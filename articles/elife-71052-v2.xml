While several UVR-induced changes, including extracellular matrix reorganisation and epidermal DNA damage, have been documented, the role of different fibroblast lineages and their communication with immune cells has not been explored. We show that acute and chronic UVR exposure led to selective loss of fibroblasts from the upper dermis in human and mouse skin. Lineage tracing and in vivo live imaging revealed that repair following acute UVR is predominantly mediated by papillary fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast reorganisation occurs with minimal migration. In contrast, chronic UVR exposure led to a permanent loss of papillary fibroblasts, with expansion of fibroblast membrane protrusions partially compensating for the reduction in cell number. Although UVR strongly activated Wnt signalling in skin, stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by epidermal β-catenin stabilisation did not enhance papillary dermis repair. Acute UVR triggered an infiltrate of neutrophils and T cell subpopulations and increased pro-inflammatory prostaglandin signalling in skin. Depletion of CD4- and CD8-positive cells resulted in increased papillary fibroblast depletion, which correlated with an increase in DNA damage, pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, and reduction in fibroblast proliferation. Conversely, topical COX-2 inhibition prevented fibroblast depletion and neutrophil infiltration after UVR. We conclude that loss of papillary fibroblasts is primarily induced by a deregulated inflammatory response, with infiltrating T cells supporting fibroblast survival upon UVR-induced environmental stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>UVR tissue damage</kwd><kwd>fibroblast heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>COX-2 inhibition</kwd><kwd>in vivo live imaging</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C219/A23522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/PO18823/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206439/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>Fiona M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT94028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhodes</surname><given-names>Lesley E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014653</institution-id><institution>NIHR Manchester Biomedical Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawkshaw</surname><given-names>Nathan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhodes</surname><given-names>Lesley E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF594-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rognoni</surname><given-names>Emanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical College of Saint Bartholomew’s Hospital Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirk</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>UV irradiation, a major cause of skin damage, leads to selective loss of fibroblasts from the upper dermis via a deregulated inflammatory response, and infiltrating T cells can promote fibroblast survival in UV irradiated skin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun penetrates the skin and has both positive and negative impacts on human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hart et al., 2019</xref>). While UVR is essential for vitamin D synthesis, prolonged (chronic) UVR exposure contributes to the development of skin cancer (photo-carcinogenesis) and accelerates ageing (photoageing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Debacq-Chainiaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>). UVR is a small component of solar radiation and comprises high-energy UVC (wavelength 100–280 nm), lower-energy UVB (280–315 nm), and UVA (315–400 nm) wavebands. UVC is absorbed by stratospheric ozone while UVA and UVB penetrate the skin. Chronic UVR damages the DNA, lipids, and proteins of skin cells directly (photochemical reactions) or indirectly via inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shih et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The connective tissue of the skin, the dermis, comprises distinct layers known as the papillary, reticular, and dermal white adipose tissue (DWAT) layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rinkevich et al., 2015</xref>). During mouse skin development, multipotent fibroblasts differentiate into distinct subpopulations (lineages) that form the different layers. These fibroblast lineages differ in location and function, and their cell identity and composition change with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rognoni and Watt, 2018</xref>). While papillary fibroblasts beneath the basement membrane have an active Wnt signalling signature and are required for hair follicle formation, fibroblasts in the reticular dermal layer express high levels of genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune signalling and mediate the initial phase of wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Philippeos et al., 2018</xref>). During mouse skin development, dermal maturation is governed by a tight balance between fibroblast proliferation, quiescence, and ECM deposition. Within the first week of postnatal life, there is a coordinated switch in fibroblast behaviour from proliferative to quiescent, which is governed by ECM deposition/remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rognoni et al., 2018</xref>). While this quiescent state characterises postnatal skin, upon wounding different fibroblast lineages are stimulated to proliferate and migrate into the wound site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eming et al., 2014</xref>). Besides depositing/remodelling ECM in the wound bed, fibroblasts are able to acquire a dermal papilla or adipocyte fate in response to distinct signals and thereby promote hair follicle and DWAT regeneration, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plikus et al., 2017</xref>). After tissue repair, the quiescent state of fibroblasts is restored.</p><p>UVA and UVB induce different types of photo-damage in skin. UVB penetrates the epidermis and papillary dermis, while UVA affects the full thickness of the dermis, including the subcutaneous fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>). Photoaged dermis is characterised by a loss of fibroblast density and changes in ECM organisation, including depletion of fibrillin-rich microfibers in the papillary dermis and accumulation of elastin-rich elastic fibres in the reticular dermis, which are mediated, at least in part, by MMP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Naylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wlaschek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scharffetter-Kochanek et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, UVR is a potent local and systemic immune modulator, able to modify the innate and adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, the activated signalling pathways and recruitment of distinct immune subsets lead to an immunosuppressive environment which supports inflammation resolution of a sunburn reaction and tissue repair but can also contribute to skin cancer.</p><p>While the consequences of UVR exposure for the epidermis, ECM, and skin-resident immune network have been widely characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Debacq-Chainiaux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watson et al., 2014</xref>), its short- and long-term impact on different dermal fibroblast subpopulations (lineages) is unknown. In this study, we have examined how dermal fibroblast lineages respond to acute and chronic UVB irradiation. Uncovering the UVR-induced early pathogenic processes leading to premature skin ageing and a cancer-permissive environment will pave the way for new treatment strategies that target aberrant fibroblast behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sahai et al., 2020</xref>). There is growing interest in the specific impact of UVB radiation on human health as ambient UVB will increase with destruction of the ozone layer (United Nations EEAP 2019 report: Environmental Effects and Interactions of Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, UV Radiation, and Climate Change, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ozone.unep.org/science/assessment/eeap">https://ozone.unep.org/science/assessment/eeap</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Acute UVR exposure results in a transient loss of fibroblasts in the papillary dermis</title><p>We began by determining the effect of acute UVB exposure on human dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hawkshaw et al., 2020</xref>). For this study, six healthy volunteers (two males, four females; mean age 44 ± 12 years) were recruited. Their buttock skin was exposed to three times their individual minimal erythema dose (MED), sufficient to induce a moderate sunburn reaction characterised by histone H2AX phosphorylation (yH2AX), a central component of the DNA damage response and repair system, and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) accumulation in papillary fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>). Skin biopsies were collected from irradiated skin at time points up to 14 days post-UVR and subjected to double immunofluorescence labelling for CD39 (papillary fibroblast marker) and vimentin (VM, a pan-fibroblast marker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Philippeos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantifying and plotting fibroblast density changes over time in skin sections of individual healthy volunteers revealed a loss of CD39/VM double-positive cells in the upper dermis, which was followed by a transient increase in the repair phase before returning to pre-UVR treatment level within 2 weeks.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Acute UVB exposure depletes fibroblasts in the papillary dermis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostaining of human skin for CD39 (green) and vimentin (VM) (red) and quantification of double-positive cells per field of view relative to control skin at indicated time points after acute ultraviolet radiation (acUVR) exposure (n = 6 biological replicates).

To study the effect of UVB on fibroblasts, we used the PDGFRαH2BEGFP transgenic mouse line, in which all dermal fibroblasts express nuclear GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamilton et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D, E and H</xref>). Quantification of PDGFRαH2BEGFP-positive cells showed a significant loss of upper dermal fibroblasts 1, 4, and 8 days after the second UVB exposure followed by a repair phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), recapitulating the human in vivo findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The decrease in upper dermal fibroblasts correlated with an increase in DNA damage, measured by the phosphorylation of histone H2AX (yH2AX+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and apoptosis (cCasp3+) in dermal fibroblasts, particularly in the papillary dermis, 1 and 4 days post-UVB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Fibroblast proliferation increased at days 4 and 8, particularly in papillary fibroblasts, returning to normal thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). No αSma+ dermal fibroblasts were present, indicating that UVB did not stimulate differentiation into myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also noted that acUVB did not induce changes in the ECM that were detectable by collagen hybridising peptide (CHP) labelling, a molecular probe that recognises the triple helix structure of immature, damaged, and remodelling interstitial collagen fibres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate if distinct fibroblast subpopulations respond differently to UVR and cell stress, we reanalysed a published single-cell RNA-seq dataset of neonatal (P2) and adult (P21) mouse back skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). As previously shown, neonatal fibroblasts clustered into papillary, reticular, preadipocytes, adipocytes, and other fibroblast subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and adult fibroblasts could be divided into five major clusters. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes between neonatal fibroblast subpopulations revealed that selected GO terms related to DNA damage, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell stress were predominantly enriched in papillary fibroblasts, whereas expression of genes associated with GO term ‘response to UV’ or ‘cellular response to UV’ was not significantly increased in any fibroblast subpopulation at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>). Indeed, the enrichment of selected GO terms in papillary fibroblasts is due to their highly proliferative state in neonatal skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rognoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phan et al., 2020</xref>), rather than indicating a different susceptibility/response to UV damage. The overall enrichment of selected GO terms was much less pronounced in adult mouse skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Our immunofluorescence, lineage tracing, and in vivo live imaging results showed that the loss of papillary fibroblasts is primarily due to apoptosis rather than movement of papillary fibroblasts into the deeper dermis. After acute UVR fibroblasts start proliferating, increase motility and restore tissue density. In contrast, prolonged exposure to UVR prevented repopulation of fibroblasts in the upper dermis even after 30 days post-UVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These observations are in line with previous studies of chronic UVB irradiation that reported a reduced cell density in the papillary dermis even 200 days after final UVB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2007</xref>). Loss of the papillary lineage is associated with premature skin ageing, reduced regeneration, and a profibrotic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lichtenberger et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We and others have recently shown how different fibroblast lineages contribute to dermal architecture and have explored their tissue-scale behaviour in development and skin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rognoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). Deregulation of these complex processes is associated with several skin pathologies, including fibrosis, chronic wounds, and cancer. Comparison of the fibroblast lineage response during repair of full thickness wounds and UVR-induced tissue damage reveals several differences. While both forms of tissue damage induce a pronounced inflammatory response and activation of Wnt/β-catenin and YAP/TAZ signalling in the epidermis and dermis, UVR-induced tissue damage is repaired with minimal fibroblast proliferation, migration, and myofibroblast differentiation. We recently showed that ECM is a potent regulator of fibroblast behaviour and inhibits proliferation during skin development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rognoni et al., 2018</xref>). The inhibitory signal of the ECM can be partly overcome by overexpression of epidermal β-catenin, which induces the expression of several fibroblast growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lichtenberger et al., 2016</xref>). However, the induction of proliferation especially in the lower dermis was not sufficient to restore fibroblast organisation in UVR-damaged skin, which could be due to a lack of directional migration. Consistent with this, our lineage-tracing and in vivo live imaging experiments revealed that only fibroblasts in the upper dermis contribute to tissue repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). While in the early UVR response (1 day post-UVR) fibroblast migration is limited to single cells, papillary fibroblasts become more motile at 4 days post-UVR, which could be due to ECM remodelling. In support of this concept, during skin homeostasis most dermal fibroblasts are stationary, yet active random fibroblast migration has been observed close to growing hair follicles where the surrounding ECM is extensively remodelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, upon full-thickness wounding, we and others have shown that fibroblasts start migrating towards the wound where they randomly distribute and expand during the early wound repair phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rognoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). During wound healing, chemoattractants such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are key regulators of fibroblast chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melvin et al., 2011</xref>); however, the intrinsic and extrinsic signals controlling fibroblast migration after UVR exposure remain unclear.</p><p>Recent laser or genetic ablation experiments have revealed that loss of dermal fibroblasts is repaired through a mixture of proliferation/migration and reorganisation of the plasma membrane network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>). Our data indicate that a similar mechanism may apply during repair of UVR-induced tissue damage. In contrast to acUVR tissue damage, in chUVR skin the decreased fibroblast density persisted in the papillary dermis and surviving fibroblasts were significantly elongated; in addition, fibroblast loss was compensated by an increased membrane network of surrounding fibroblasts. This is in line with the observation of Marsh et al. that the progressive loss of fibroblasts during skin ageing is balanced by increasing membrane protrusions rather than fibroblast proliferation or migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>). Our data indicate that repeated UVB tissue damage accelerates this process (photoageing).</p><p>Resident immune cells are not only essential for skin barrier function, pathogen defence, and wound healing but also provide essential signals for hair follicle growth and skin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nosbaum et al., 2016</xref>). Here we identify an additional function, that of promoting the survival of dermal fibroblasts during environmental stress. In line with previously published reports, we found that upon UVR exposure neutrophils were first recruited to the UV-exposed site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hawkshaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilgus et al., 2000</xref>). Neutrophil-derived reactive oxidants are potent mediators of UVB-induced tissue damage and tumorigenesis because of their cytotoxicity and immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Savage et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katiyar et al., 1999</xref>). This was followed by infiltration of different types of T cells; in particular, Tregs became highly activated and proliferative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is suggested to inhibit the UVR-induced inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>). While in homeostatic conditions Tregs are predominantly located around hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2017</xref>), their expansion throughout the interfollicular dermis was evident upon UVR exposure, and this could potentially promote an immunosuppressive environment. Whether there is also direct cross-talk between T cells and dermal fibroblasts during the UVR tissue damage response is currently unclear. A recent study in human skin has identified CD4+ GATA3+ and CD8+ GATA3+ T cells as the predominant T cell populations in UVR-induced inflammation, and these are therefore likely to contribute to tissue resolution via dermal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hawkshaw et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Production of multiple pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, including PGE-2, is promoted following UVR as a result of arachidonic acid release by phospholipases and by induction of COX-2 expression in various skin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athar et al., 2001</xref>). Here we show that PGE-2 and COX-2 are both significantly elevated immediately after UVR exposure and PGE-2 levels are further increased after T cell depletion. In line with our mouse data, it has been reported that following acUVB exposure of human skin pro-inflammatory prostaglandins including PGE-2 peak at 24 hr before normalising after 4 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hawkshaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rhodes et al., 2009</xref>). PGE-2 governs diverse biological functions that are mediated by signalling through four distinct E-type prostanoid (EP) receptors, EP1–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konya et al., 2013</xref>). The major EP receptor in skin is EP4, which is a Gs-coupled receptor regulating cAMP/PKA, MEK/ERK1/2, NF-ƙB, and PI3K/ERK/Akt signalling; these pathways are important for cell survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, angiogenesis, and inflammation. In fibroblasts, PGE-2 binding to EP4 has been shown to increase PTEN activity and Fas expression and decrease survivin expression, thereby promoting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). In line with these observations, the increased PGE-2 levels and EP4 expression in the dermis in the early UVR response coincide with the observed fibroblast depletion at 1 and 4 days after UVB exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>).</p><p>In support of the concept that prostaglandin signalling influences fibroblast survival, specific inhibition of COX-2 immediately after UVB exposure significantly reduced fibroblast depletion and neutrophil recruitment. This is consistent with the observation that the COX enzyme inhibitor aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) efficiently protects keratinocytes and melanocytes from acute UVB-induced DNA damage by decreasing cutaneous inflammation and PGE-2 levels in skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2021</xref>). Based on our findings, aspirin may also enhance dermal fibroblast survival and regeneration upon UVR-induced environmental stress. Whether the anti-inflammatory activities of aspirin could help prevent fibroblast-associated changes in photoaged skin warrants investigation in the future.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that papillary fibroblasts repair the dermis following UVR with minimal migration and that their survival is influenced by tissue resident T cells controlling UVR-induced inflammation. Specific inhibition of COX-2 reduces dermal fibroblast loss which may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of UVR-induced skin damages and photoageing. Our findings could also be relevant to stromal changes in skin cancer, in which fibroblast senescence is linked to age-associated cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Procopio et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human volunteer and UVR time-course analysis</title><p>Ethical approval was granted by the Greater Manchester North NHS research ethics committee (ref: 11/NW/0567) for the studies presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>.

Briefly, data were imported, cells expressing less than 200 genes and genes expressed in less than 3 cells were filtered out, counts were normalised, logarithmised, and scaled, a PCA and UMAP were computed, and cells were clustered using the Leiden algorithm. The fibroblast subset was selected and clustered and annotated using marker genes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phan et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, GO term enrichment using g:Profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>) was performed on differentially increased genes (p&lt;0.05, Log2 fold change &gt; 1) for each cluster.</p><p>Human single-cell RNA-seq data from eyelid skin was visualised using the single-cell ageing atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2021</xref>), and GO term enrichment of significant genes (Log2 fold change &gt; 0.5, p&lt;0.05) in each identified fibroblast cluster was performed with g:Profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, human RNA-seq data for upper and lower breast dermis from three donors were obtained from GSE109822 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Philippeos et al., 2018</xref>), and differentially expressed genes were determined with edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>).

Unless stated otherwise, data are means ± standard deviation (SD) and statistical significance was determined by unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test, ordinary one-way or two-way ANOVA for biological effects with an assumed normal distribution. For unbiased cell identification with DAPI, Ki67, YAP, yH2AX, cCasp3, TOPGFP, or PDGFRαH2BEGFP labelling, nuclear staining was quantified using the Spot detector plugin of Icy software (version 2.1.0.1). Similarly, cells labelled with tdTomato in the lineage-tracing experiments or stained with COX-2, Ly6G (neutrophils), CD3 (CD3+ T cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), and FoxP3+ (Tregs) were counted per area with the Spot detector plugin of Icy software. To quantify CD45, EP4, and CHP staining in tissue sections, mean fluorescence was determined with Icy software and normalised to background. Cell elongation was determined by measuring the maximal tdTomato+ cytoplasm diameter of individual cells in the papillary dermis of Lrig1-CreER × Rosa26-tdTomato lineage-traced transgenics. Figures were prepared with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator (CC2021).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>FW is on secondment as Executive Chair of the Medical Research Council.

#1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Rognoni et al. showed that distinct fibroblast population (papillary fibroblast in the upper dermis vs reticular fibroblast in the lower dermis) in the skin have different response to UV radiation and tissue remodeling. Taking advantage of specific CreER tools that they have established in previous work, they nicely demonstrated that papillary fibroblasts are the cell type, which is responsible for the contribution of tissue repair after acute UV radiation. In contrast, chronic UV-induced damage is not easily repaired in part due to more severe loss of papillary fibroblasts, which is also seen in aging skin. In the last part, the authors tried to addressed further the molecular mechanisms and showed that the CD4 and CD8 T cells have a supportive role in UV-induced tissue repair by maintaining the papillary fibroblasts.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>I think minimal work is required for the submission before publication in a peer reviewed journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this positive evaluation of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I recommend authors to explain a bit more about the possible factors to explain the cell response differences between papillary vs reticular fibroblasts. For me, first part (fibroblast heterogeneity) and second part (Wnt, interaction with immune cells) do not connect so well.</p></disp-quote><p>To explore potential intrinsic differences between papillary and reticular fibroblasts, we have included an analysis of GO terms associated with the cellular response to UV, cell stress and DNA damage/repair in publicly available transcriptomic datasets and how these map to differences in the gene expression profiles of different fibroblasts subpopulations in undamaged neonatal and adult mouse skin (Phan et al., 2020, e<italic>Life</italic>), sun exposed human eyelid skin (Zou et al., 2021, Dev Cell) as well as microdissected human skin (Philippeos et al., 2018, J Invest Dermatol.) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Our new data analysis indicates that dermal fibroblast subpopulations do not differ in their response or susceptibility to UV damage.</p><p>We have improved the connection between the two parts of the manuscript by re-writing the text and by expanding our analysis of Wnt signalling (Figure 5) and immune cell distribution (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) in the upper and lower dermis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there any differences in immune cell distribution (or EP4 expression) between upper and lower dermis? Or not, what makes differences between papillary vs reticular fibroblasts in their response to UV? The CD4 and CD8 T cells seem to act mainly on papillary fibroblasts based on the blocking antibody effects as shown in Figure 6C. Are CD4 and CD8 T cells predominantly recruited and located in the upper dermis? The authors should provide quantification of CD8 T cell distribution in upper vs lower dermis (Supplementary Figure 6), like they did in other figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified the distribution of different T cell populations in the upper and lower dermis and included the data in Figure 6A-C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C. While CD3+ T cells were depleted in the epidermis, they were increased in the upper and lower dermis. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup>), which are enriched in the lower dermis in control skin, were significantly increased in the upper dermis after UVR exposure while Tregs (FoxP3+) significantly expanded throughout the dermis.</p><p>In addition, we have now measured prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) concentration after UVR exposure with and without T cell depletion (Figure 7A and B) and expanded our analysis of EP4 and COX-2 expression in the upper and lower dermis (Figure 7C and K). Acute UVR exposure induced the release of PGE-2 in the skin, which was further increased after CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cell depletion. COX-2 and EP4 expression are highly increased 1 day after UVR exposure in the epidermis and dermis, coinciding with the fibroblast loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>The Figure overall is presented very well, and writing is clear. I am a bit confused with different time points presented in each panel of figures. Most of places in their figures, they labeled clearly e.g., “acUVB π 1 day”, but not all. For example, Figure 2A is 8 weeks post UVB, Figure 2B, chUVB is 1 or 3 day. Figure 2E is 24 hours. How about Figure 2C, D? I appreciate if authors could use the same labeling across all figures, which really help readers to understand the time course of cellular events upon UVR.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the inconsistency, and we have now made the figure labels clearer and more consistent throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6D, aCD4 and aCD8, &quot;a&quot; (alpha) is not written in symbol.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Significance:</p><p>The significance of this paper is to describe a distinct cellular response of heterogeneous dermal fibroblasts in the context of UV-induced tissue damage. They used unique mouse models to address this point, which has not been shown in the field. This study is relevant for broad area of skin researchers including the field of aging, wound healing, tissue remodeling, cancer and immune-dermal interaction.

They show that both in human and mouse skin, acute UV leads to transient depletion of papillary fibroblasts characterized by increased gH2AX signal and apoptosis, followed by a wave of increased proliferation, whereas no substantial ECM remodeling is seen. They further show that chronic UV leads to a more stable decrease in papillary fibroblasts, but less apoptosis and compensatory proliferation are observed. In contrast substantial ECM remodeling is seen. In addition chronic UV-exposed fibroblasts appear elongated. The authors then show that acute UV is able to trigger some fibroblast motility, whereas boosting proliferation is not sufficient to rescue fibroblast numbers. In contrast, blunting inflammation results to some degree of rescue in terms of fibroblast numbers.Overall this is an interesting manuscript that utilizes stringent approaches to address the clinically relevant question of effects of UV on skin. The manuscript is very well and clearly written, the data is of high quality and compelling. The conclusions are overall well justified by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only major issue I have with the manuscript is that it is not clear how the in vivo imaging, a very elegant approach with a compelling result, integrates with the rest of the data. From the first part it seems that the authors draw the conclusion that acute UV kills the fibroblasts through DNA damage and apoptosis, which is not seen in the chronic treatment. So it would have been more logical to analyse the migration patterns in the chronic UV group as migration would be more likely to be relevant there. Also, if cells are migrating downwards, should this not result in increased levels of Lrig1+ cells in the lower dermis. Now both compartments seem to show a reduction (Figure 3d). On the other hand, if the migration would be replenishing the lost population, then one would expect the migration to be directional or at least show some biased z displacement towards the epidermis, which seems not to be the case. So all in all the reader is left wondering about the relevance of this observation. While I understand that repeating the imaging in chronic UV treated mice is a major experimental undertaking, this or additional experiments addressing the role of migration in the described phenomena would strengthen this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We carried out in vivo live imaging of dermal fibroblasts to elucidate firstly if active cell migration contributes to fibroblast depletion in the upper dermis (which occurs in both acute and chronic UV exposed skin), and secondly, how fibroblast migration is involved in the early tissue damage repair response (repopulation of the upper dermis only occurs in after acute UV damage). Our conclusion is that after UVR exposure there is very little cell migration and that it is random, not directional. This is in contrast to fibroblast behaviour during repair of full thickness skin wounds (Rognoni et al., 2018, Mol Syst Biol; Jiang et al., 2020, Nat Commun). We conclude that following UVR (acute or chronic) fibroblasts are depleted through cell death and not through active downward migration. This is in agreement with our Lrig1CreER lineage tracing data, which shows no fibroblast density increase in the lower dermis. During the early tissue repair response (4 days post-UVB exposure) fibroblasts become more motile, which correlates with the observed reorganization of papillary lineage fibroblasts. However, the lack of directionality suggests that the replenishment of upper dermal fibroblasts is a stochastic process, similar to the reorganisation of fibroblast lineages we previously observed during skin ageing (Rognoni et al., 2018, Mol Syst Biol).</p><p>We have now revised the manuscript (Results and Discussion) to improve the description of our findings and state more clearly that fibroblast loss is not due to migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is that the matrix remodeling and cell elongation phenomena remain slightly isolated observations and it is not clear how they tie to the other observed changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this in the text by pointing out the links between fibroblast migration, cell shape changes and ECM remodelling. We think it is particularly interesting that in chronic UVR exposed skin the reduction in fibroblast density is partly compensated by elongation of upper dermal fibroblasts. This phenomenon is also observed in aged skin (Marsh et al., 2018, Cell) and our data indicate that repeated UVB tissue damage – which occurs in photo-ageing – accelerates the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1. The images in Figure 3D for the Dlk1 Cre labeling are difficult to interpret as there are very few labeled cells to begin with. This is in stark contrast to Figure 3B where a large number of cells are visible. Yet the quantified Dlk1+ cell densities in 3D and 3B are similar. Are these images not representative or what would explain this difference?</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the image in Figure 3D with one that is a better representation of the quantification. We have also made the quantification of Dlk1Cre labelled cells in upper and lower dermis consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Cell elongation statistical analyses in 3F would be more robustly done from means individual mice rather than pooling all cells together thus inflating the n number.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this analysis in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 C and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Overall it would be more compelling to show individual replicates than bar graphs throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the Figures accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Overall this is an interesting, high quality manuscript that provides compelling new knowledge on the effects of UV irradiation on the skin.

Making use of murine reporter lines and lineage tracing they show the partial loss of a specific population of fibroblasts. Mechanistically, the role of immune cells and prostaglandins are explored.

UVA is the main component of Solar UV and is the main type of UV penetrating the dermis and acting on both the cells and the extra-cellular matrix through oxidative stress. It is unclear why radiation in these experiments was restricted to UVB.</p></disp-quote><p>While we are aware of the importance of UVA for skin photobiology, it is evident from the literature that UVA and UVB induce different types of photo-damage in skin and so a separate analysis of UVA and UVB provides useful mechanistic insights that could lead to design of specific interventions. In regard to environmental risk factors there is an increasing interest in the specific impact of UVB radiation on human health, as ambient UVB will decrease or increase depending on the success of the Montreal Treaty in limiting ozone destruction (see recent United Nations EEAP 2019 report: Environmental Effects and Interactions of Stratospheric Ozone Depletion, UV Radiation, and Climate Change, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ozone.unep.org/science/assessment/eeap">https://ozone.unep.org/science/assessment/eeap</ext-link>). We have included these points in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The main issue relates to the definition of upper dermis versus lower dermis fibroblasts. The anatomical separation is not clarified in this paper. Moreover, at the molecular level, there seems to be a gap between DLK1Cre labelled cells and Lrig1Cre labelled cells. This is an important conceptual point as it needs to be clarified if the depletion concerns all cells of the upper dermis lineage or alternatively it only concerns the cells (regardless of biology) that are closest to the surface and within reach of UVB radiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We and others have extensively characterized the development and distribution of different dermal fibroblast lineages in mouse skin (see Rognoni et al., 2016, Development; Rognoni et al., 2018, Mol Syst Bio; Driskell et al., 2013, Nature; Rinkevich et al., 2015, Science; Salzer et al., 2018, Cell). In adult mouse skin papillary fibroblasts lie in the upper dermis that extends from the basement membrane to the hair follicle infundibulum above the sebaceous glands. The lower dermis, containing reticular fibroblasts, extends from below the papillary dermis to the DWAT (dermal white adipose tissue; hypodermis). We have indicated the boundary between upper and lower dermis with a dotted line in the histology/immunofluorescence images. Our pan-fibroblast (PDGFRaH2BEGFP+) and Lrig1-CreER labeled dermal cell density quantifications show that one day after acute UVB exposure all fibroblasts close to the basement membrane in the upper dermis are depleted, which correlates with the distribution of apoptotic and DNA damaged fibroblasts and UVR induced tissue damage. GO term analysis of different dermal fibroblast subpopulations (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2) indicates that these subpopulations do not differ in their response or susceptibility to UV damage. We have stated these findings more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding the evolution of the fibroblast depletion, authors claim that the numbers reach baseline levels at 14 days after an acute irradiation. However in the chronic irradiation model, they claim that fibroblasts never recover their initial numbers… In the latter set of experiments, experiments have only been performed for up to 10 days. It is advised to continue observing changes in fibroblast numbers up to 14 and 21 days before such conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included data on fibroblast density at later time points following chronic UVB exposure (Figure 2H), which shows that upper fibroblast depletion persists for 30 days after chronic UVR. Our observations are in line with previous chronic UVB studies (now cited) reporting a reduced cell density in the papillary dermis even 200 days after the final UVB exposure (Dai et al., 2007, Am J Pathol).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The human equivalent of this experiment is also not convincing. It is not clear how many technical replicates (staining) have been performed for each patient. In any case the overall trend does not support the authors description (with the exception of 1 patient) of a depletion and a recovery. There seems to be a general trend towards increased fibroblasts over 14 days. In that sense Figure 2H may be an overrepresentation of the authors findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the quantitation of UVB treated human skin in Figure 1A and included the missing technical information in the Methods section. Due to the large variation in fibroblast density between donors, we have now normalized the mean fibroblast density to the non-UVR exposed skin sample for each donor and present the normalized mean fibroblast densities in a boxplot. Our data show a significant loss of dermal fibroblasts at 1 day post UVR; this is followed by a transient increase during the repair phase and a return to pre-UVR treatment levels after two weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I question the decision by the authors to use a burning dose of UVB for the chronic irradiation experiment? Often to reflect the clinical scenario of chronic irradiation sub-erythemal doses are used and adjusted to the tanning response.</p></disp-quote><p>Compared to other recent studies (Bald et al., 2014, Nature; Kunisada et al., 2005, Cancer Res; Ohkumo et al., 2006, Mol Cell Biol.; Dai et al., 2007, Am J Pathol.; Mira Han et al., 2017, Sci Rep.; Meeran et al., 2009, Toxicol Appl Pharmacol), our chronic UVB treatment regime in C57BL/6 mice is rather mild with 800 J/m<sup>2</sup> twice a week for 8 weeks. The mice develop prominent skin tanning after 8 weeks of treatment but there is no breakdown of the skin barrier, which would be a feature of severe sunburn. We have stated this more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The mechanism proposed in this work for the depletion and recovery of the fibroblasts is unclear. Authors show that upper dermal fibroblasts undergo DNA damage and apoptosis (staining impossible to see). They also claim through in vivo imaging that the cells largely move downwards. The latter finding cannot be recapitulated by the Lrig1Cre lineage tracing. Finally, another claim is made about the protective role of T cells (in reducing PGE2?) and the importance of PGE2. These different mechanisms are not linked to each other. Can authors deplete only Tregs? And not all CD4 cells? Can they deplete CD8 or CD4 cells and treat with celecoxib? Can they measure apoptosis levels in the T cell depletion studies?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity regarding mechanism, which was also highlighted by Reviewer 2. We show that fibroblasts are lost by cell death and not by downward migration (see response to Reviewer 2). We have now elaborated more clearly the effect of UVB-induced inflammation on dermal fibroblast survival and included quantification of fibroblast apoptosis (Figure 6H) and PGE-2 levels (Figure 7, A and B), both of which increase upon T cell depletion. In addition, we have added quantification of COX-2 and EP4 expression in the upper and lower dermis after UVB exposure, and show that both are highly induced at 1 day post UVR.</p><p>We agree that it would be interesting to selectively deplete Tregs; however we show that both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells equally influence dermal fibroblast survival and proliferation (Figure 6D-I). Similarly, repeating the celecoxib treatment in combination with anti-CD8 and CD4 would, in our opinion, provide minimal further insights to the current COX-2 inhibition experiment in Figure 7D-J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. The T cell depletion studies are not controlled properly by isotype Antbody. Similarly the effect of interventions is not tested in normal skin to ensure specificity of the effect to UV irradiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The revised manuscript now shows the isotype antibody control data in Figure 6—figure supplement 1H-K and specifically highlights the interventions we have performed on non-UVB treated skin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Many of the immunostaining panels are difficult to see at such a low magnification. DLK1Cre lineage tracing images are not convincing as large pockets of TdTomato can be identified that does not correspond to cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the clarity and the labeling of the immunostaining panels. It is worth noting that induction of Dlk1Cre during early skin development labels reticular fibroblasts that further differentiate into adipocytes. Therefore, in adults the adipocyte layer contains large number of tdTomato+ cells, a point we make in the revised manuscript. We have exchanged and increased the size of Figure 3D, to better represent the associated quantification and show the structure of the tdTomato positive adipocyte layer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I cannot comment on fibroblast shapes in vivo the CHP staining and the evaluation of the dermis ECM.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):Understanding the consequences of UV radiation on the skin is essential for our knowledge on skin carcinogenesis, skin ageing but also inflammation. Very few studies have proposed a clear mechanism for the effect of UV on fibroblast behaviour. Solar UV in the context of human pathology is the main environmental exposure. It is composed in large majority by UVA which has an essential role in inducing fibroblast senescence and skin photo-ageing. Unfortunately by restricting the study to UVB radiation authors restrict its applicability to the clinical scenario.</p><p>Although I am not an expert in the dermis, there are notable deficits in relating to past studies in carcinogenesis (Paolo Dotto's group) or ageing (IGF signalling and senescence) without going through an exhaustive list.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to cite the past studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
