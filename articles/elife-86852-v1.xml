However, most single-cell studies of infection quantify the expression of viral transcripts and proteins, rather than the amount of progeny virions released from infected cells. Here, we overcome this limitation by simultaneously measuring transcription and progeny production from single influenza virus-infected cells by embedding nucleotide barcodes in the viral genome. We find that viral transcription and progeny production are poorly correlated in single cells. The cells that transcribe the most viral mRNA do not produce the most viral progeny and often represent aberrant infections that fail to express the influenza NS gene. However, only some of the discrepancy between transcription and progeny production can be explained by viral gene absence or mutations: there is also a wide range of progeny production among cells infected by complete unmutated virions. Overall, our results show that viral transcription is a relatively poor predictor of an infected cell’s contribution to the progeny population.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>single-cell transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>NS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI165821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>75N93021C00015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>HHMI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantification of both viral transcription and progeny production from single influenza-infected cells shows that the cells that produce the most viral RNA often do not produce the most virions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many aspects of viral infection are heterogeneous when measured across single cells.

However, it is unclear how variation in these different aspects of infection is related within the same infected cells. For instance, to what degree does the extent of viral transcription in an infected cell determine the number of progeny virions the cell produces? The answer to this question remains elusive because the most common single-cell techniques (flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing) measure the levels of proteins and transcripts, rather than the number of viral progeny produced.</p><p>Here, we develop a novel approach to simultaneously measure viral transcription, viral mutations, and viral progeny production in single cells infected with influenza virus. We find that progeny production is even more heterogeneous than viral transcription in single cells. The cells that express the most viral transcripts often do not generate any detectable viral progeny. Instead, cells with extremely high viral transcription often fail to express the NS gene and represent non-productive infections. Our findings emphasize that different aspects of viral infection are not always correlated at the single-cell level, and that many of the cells contributing large amounts of viral mRNA to bulk RNA sequencing studies do not appreciably contribute virions to the progeny population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Viral barcoding to measure transcription, progeny production, and viral genotype in single cells</title><p>To quantify the progeny virions released from single infected cells, we inserted random nucleotide barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lauring and Andino, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amato et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Varble et al., 2014</xref>) into the influenza virus genome so that they are positioned near the 3′ end of the viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We can sequence the viral barcodes on progeny virions released into the supernatant to quantify the relative number of physical progeny produced by each cell and sequence the viral barcodes in cells secondarily infected with an aliquot of the supernatant to quantify the relative number of infectious progeny produced by each cell. Additionally, we can reconstruct the genome of the virion that infected each cell by selectively amplifying viral genes from the single-cell cDNA library and performing long-read sequencing as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russell et al., 2019</xref>).

This approach allowed us to insert 16-nucleotide random barcodes near the 3′ end of the genes, downstream of the stop codon but upstream of the polyadenylation signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These barcodes were therefore present in both viral mRNAs and genomic RNAs (vRNAs), but did not modify the amino acid sequence of the viral protein. We refer to these viruses as ‘dual-barcoded’ as they have barcodes on two different genes. Dual barcodes provided duplicate measurements of progeny production from the same infected cell, which were averaged and normalized (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>We engineered barcodes into the A/California/04/2009 (pdmH1N1) strain of influenza virus with the G155E cell-culture adaptation mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Viruses with barcoded HA and NA segments could be generated by reverse genetics, and in cell culture grew to titers comparable to unmodified viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm that the sequence of individual barcodes did not affect viral growth in cell culture, we generated virus libraries carrying a small pool of barcodes and verified that the virus titers and barcode frequencies were stable across three passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>For our single-cell experiments, we generated libraries of virions with a high diversity of barcodes on the HA and NA genes.

For the low MOI condition, we infected ~10<sup>4</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) with the dual-barcoded virus library at an MOI of ~0.15; under these conditions, most cells are uninfected, and most infected cells are infected by a single virion. For the high MOI conditions, we infected ~7 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells at an MOI of ~0.6; under these conditions, fewer cells are uninfected and a substantial fraction of the infected cells are infected by multiple virions. To ensure a single round of relatively synchronized infection, we replaced the virus inoculum with fresh medium after 1 hr and added ammonium chloride, which prevents secondary infection by blocking the endosomal acidification necessary for viral fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin and Helenius, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohkuma and Poole, 1978</xref>). We collected the cells for single-cell RNA sequencing at a single timepoint 12 hr after infection. Before loading onto a 10X Chromium device, we added a control sample that allowed us to quantify the rate of cell multiplets and PCR strand exchange. This control sample contained cells infected with a second virus carrying synonymous mutations that could be distinguished in sequencing data (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>For the low MOI sample, we obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data for 254 cells infected with our barcoded virus library, resulting in an empirical MOI of 0.17 (since we recovered data for ~1600 total cells from this sample). For the high MOI sample, we obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data for 357 cells infected with our barcoded virus library, resulting in an empirical MOI of ~0.59 (since we recovered data for ~800 total cells from this sample). Note that many cells are lost during preparation for single-cell RNA sequencing, so an important caveat of our study is that some infected cells that produced viral progeny are absent in the transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). However, because the number of barcodes in our virus library greatly exceeds the number of infected cells, these undetected infections should not substantially affect our measurements of relative viral progeny among the cells that were captured.</p><p>Under both infection conditions, there was extremely wide variation in the amount of viral transcription among infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), similar to that observed in prior single-cell studies of influenza infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steuerman et al., 2018</xref>).

Cells that fail to express any viral gene produce little or no detectable progeny virions, regardless of their total viral transcription activity. The lack of physical progeny produced by cells that fail to express even a single viral gene presumably occurs because the absence of the encoded protein impairs virion formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; note that our analysis is limited to cells that express HA and NA since those are the barcoded genes). But although cells that fail to express a viral gene produce little or no progeny, the converse is not true: cells that express the full complement of viral genes often still fail to produce detectable progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Strikingly, absence of the influenza NS gene not only precludes progeny production but is specifically associated with an aberrant state of high viral transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). At both low MOI and high MOI, many of the highest transcribing cells fail to express NS, and the mean level of viral transcription is significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) in cells that do not express NS compared to cells that express all viral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These data suggest that NS acts as a negative regulator of viral transcription. This observation is consistent with the known functional roles of the NEP protein expressed from the NS gene, which is to export viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Neill et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullido et al., 2001</xref>) and possibly to switch the viral polymerase from transcription to genome replication through direct protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mänz et al., 2012</xref>). Overall, this result suggests that the cells that contribute the most to the signal observed in transcriptomic studies often represent aberrant non-productive infections that do not contribute viral progeny.</p><p>For cells infected at low MOI, we can also study the effect of viral mutations on progeny production. At low MOI, physical viral progeny are produced both by cells that express viral genes with mutations and by cells that express unmutated viral genes; however, more of the infectious progeny virions come from cells with unmutated viral genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) – probably because some non-synonymous mutations interfere with protein functions that are required for infection of new cells. Nonetheless, physical and infectious progeny production are much more correlated among single cells than are transcription and progeny production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; Pearson’s R values of –0.14 for the correlation of transcription with infectious progeny at low MOI versus 0.39 for the correlation of physical progeny with infectious progeny at low MOI). However, none of the viral factors we measure (viral transcription, expression of each viral gene, or mutated viral proteins) fully explain the extreme variation we observe in progeny production. Progeny production remains highly variable across cells without any viral deficit (e.g. cells that express unmutated copies of all viral genes), although it is less variable across this population than across all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). This unexplained variation suggests that cellular or uncharacterized viral factors must also contribute to cell-to-cell variation in progeny production.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Viral gene absence and viral mutations only explain a fraction of heterogeneity observed in progeny production.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of physical progeny virions.

However, the most important outcome of infection for multi-cycle viral growth is how many progeny virions are produced by an infected cell. Prior studies of progeny production from single cells have relied on isolating individual infected cells in small volumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulte and Andino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delbrück, 1945</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>). These studies have shown progeny production is highly heterogeneous, but have not provided measurements of most other properties of the infected cells – and have therefore lacked explanatory power to understand the basis for the variation in progeny production. Here, we have overcome these limitations with a new method to simultaneously measure physical and infectious progeny production alongside transcription of all viral and host genes, as well as sequencing of the genome of the virion that infected each cell.</p><p>The most striking finding from our work is that while viral transcription and progeny production are both highly heterogeneous across influenza-infected cells, they are not well correlated at either low MOI or high MOI. In particular, the cells that transcribe the most viral mRNA often generate no detectable progeny virions. Part of the discrepancy between these two single-cell measurements is due to the fact that cells that fail to express the influenza NS gene tend to transcribe very high levels of mRNA but produce no progeny. This result makes biological sense: one of the proteins encoded by the NS gene is NEP, which exports viral ribonucleoproteins from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Neill et al., 1998</xref>), terminating their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bullido et al., 2001</xref>). NEP may also mediate a switch from transcription to genome replication by the viral polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mänz et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, absence of NS and other defects in the viral genome only explains part of the discordance between viral transcription and progeny production in single influenza-infected cells. These two properties are often discordant even in cells expressing unmutated copies of all influenza genes. We suggest that further study of both viral and cellular factors that promote transcription versus progeny production is an interesting area for future work.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Our experiments used a cell line rather than the differentiated airway cells that are the actual target cells during human influenza infections. We performed experiments using a single strain of H1N1 influenza at a single timepoint. We were also able to profile all relevant single-cell properties for a relatively modest number of infected cells since single-cell RNA sequencing captures only a fraction of the input cells. However, the method we have described should be extensible to other cell-culture systems and larger numbers of cells in future work.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our results suggest several implications for broader thinking about viral infections. First, recent studies have examined the distribution of influenza virus transcription or protein expression across differentiated airway cells ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Steuerman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamele et al., 2022</xref>). Our results suggest it is also important to measure progeny production across airway cells as the cell types expressing the most viral transcripts or proteins may not be the ones producing the most viral progeny. Second, our results suggest failure of some cells to express specific viral genes contributes to the discordance between viral transcription and progeny production. Failure to express the influenza NS gene is strongly correlated with high viral transcription, even under high MOI conditions that promote genetic complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Phipps et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sims et al., 2022</xref>). Third, recent work on the transmission of influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCrone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xue and Bloom, 2019</xref>) and SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Koelle, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lythgoe et al., 2021</xref>) in humans has emphasized the narrow genetic bottleneck, with only a small fraction of viral diversity in the donor transmitted to the recipient. Our results suggest physical bottlenecks in how many virions reach the recipient may be further narrowed by the fact that only a small fraction of the initially infected cells will produce most of the progeny that continue the infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 were created and validated in the Bloom lab as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2018</xref>.

The stop codons were followed by an exogenous sequence containing a priming site, a 16-nucleotide random barcode, a second priming site, and a HindIII restriction site. The 3′ end of the vRNA was treated similarly. The first 67 nt of the HA coding sequence were duplicated, and the corresponding region of the coding sequence was synonymously recoded.

In brief, cDNA derived from the 10X Genomics protocol was first amplified in a semi-specific PCR reaction.

Cycles were kept to a minimum to reduce strand exchange; since different segments required different yield, different numbers of cycles were employed each segment-specific reaction. For the polymerase segments, 14 cycles of segment-specific PCR were performed;for the HA, NA, and NP segments, 10 cycles were performed; for the M and NS segments, 7 cycles were performed.

For the low MOI sample, cells were called as infected if at least 1% of their transcripts came from virus. For the high MOI sample, cells were called as infected if at least 2.5% of their transcripts came from virus. These thresholds provided clear separation of an infected and uninfected population.

Barcoded libraries of an H1N1 influenza virus (two genes were barcoded near the 3'end) were used to infect cells using an experimental approach ensuring that, in the low multiplicity of infection condition, each cell is infected by one virion and that nearly every virion has a unique barcode. This allows then, upon single-cell RNA sequencing and sequencing of the supernatants, to infer back the cells that were producing certain barcoded viruses. Assessing detection frequencies of barcodes in the single-cell sequencing and in the sequencing of the supernatants allows us to compare the levels of viral transcription and progeny virion production.</p><p>Observations that viral transcription levels are very heterogenous at the single-cell level are not novel, but reinforce those from previous studies. The major findings of this study are (i) progeny virion production is also very heterogenous, i.e., a few cells produce most of the progeny virions and (ii) there is a poor correlation between viral transcription levels and progeny virion production at the single-cell level.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The article is very well written, the experimental choices are very well justified and the methods are very detailed, allowing the possibility of reproducing the work performed in this study. The conclusions are very well supported by the data and the limitations of the study and how those might influence the conclusions are also clearly explained. In addition, several experimental caveats, such as PCR cross-overs in next-generation sequencing and cell multiplets in single-cell sequencing, were well accounted for, which is not always the case in studies using these techniques.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It seems that the results presented here are from one single experiment. How reproducible are the results?</p><p>As explained in the article, it is important that nearly every virion has a unique barcode. This was assessed by sequencing the barcodes in the virus libraries. Between 92% to 96% of the barcodes were unique. With this information, it should be possible to assess whether non-unique barcodes were detected in infected cells, and if yes, remove these from the downstream analysis.</p><p>It seems like all the information available in this very rich dataset was not fully exploited. For instance, Figure 5C suggests that cells missing the expression of one viral gene might still be able to produce progeny viruses. It would be interesting to have the information regarding which gene was not expressed in these cells.</p><p>The introduction and discussion are rather short and the article could benefit from expanding them. Additional speculations about viral or cellular factors (e.g. differences in innate immune responses, differences in cell division status) that might explain the observed heterogeneity, both at the viral transcription and viral progeny virus production levels, would be interesting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86852.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response:</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bacsik</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dadonaite</surname><given-names>Bernadeta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Butler</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Greaney</surname><given-names>Allison J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heaton</surname><given-names>Nicholas S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Duke University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank eLife and the reviewer for the nice summary of our manuscript. We largely agree with the summary and review, and just add a few small points.</p><p>First, the review asks about the reproducibility of our findings, and suggests that they are only from a single experiment. In fact, our manuscript reports data from two independent single-cell experiments: one performed at low multiplicity of infection (MOI), and another at higher MOI. The broad trends, including the lack of strong correlations between viral mRNA transcription and progeny production, are consistent across both experiments.</p><p>Second, the reviewer asks about what happens when two different virions bearing the same viral barcode infect two different cells, given that we estimate 4-8% of barcodes to be shared between multiple infecting virions. When two cells are infected by different virions with the same barcode, this breaks the one-to-one link between transcription in that cell and progeny in the supernatant, since it is not possible to determine which cell contributed the progeny with that barcode. This means that between 4-8% of the points on our correlation plots could be affected by this factor, meaning that a few outliers should be expected. Another scenario, where a single cell is infected by two barcodes, is not problematic for our method because we can simply sum the progeny output for both barcodes from that cell.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer notes that some cells appear to produce progeny virions despite failing to express one or more viral genes. Such cells can be explained in one of two ways. First, as noted immediately above, we expect a small fraction (4-8%) of the points to be erroneous due to a lack of a guaranteed one-to-one link between cell and progeny for non-unique barcodes. Second, in some cases the missing viral gene could be a technical artifact caused by a stochastic failure to capture modestly expressed transcripts from the gene; this phenomenon, known as gene dropout, occurs at a fairly high rate in single-cell experiments (see Qiu Nature Communications 2020 for a detailed discussion). Genes that are expressed at lower levels, like the Influenza virus polymerase genes, are more likely to be missed during single-cell RNA sequencing. The absent viral genes in each infected cell can be explored in detail using the interactive plots at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jbloomlab.github.io/barcoded_flu_pdmH1N1/">https://jbloomlab.github.io/barcoded_flu_pdmH1N1/</ext-link></p></body></sub-article></article>
