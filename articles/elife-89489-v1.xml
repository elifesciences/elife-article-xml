The nearest full-length structure of BTK to date consists of the autoinhibited SH3–SH2–kinase core. Precisely how the BTK N-terminal domains (the Pleckstrin homology/Tec homology [PHTH] domain and proline-rich regions [PRR] contain linker) contribute to BTK regulation remains unclear. We have produced crystals of full-length BTK for the first time but despite efforts to stabilize the autoinhibited state, the diffraction data still reveal only the SH3–SH2–kinase core with no electron density visible for the PHTH–PRR segment. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) data of full-length BTK, on the other hand, provide the first view of the PHTH domain within full-length BTK. CryoEM reconstructions support conformational heterogeneity in the PHTH–PRR region wherein the globular PHTH domain adopts a range of states arrayed around the autoinhibited SH3–SH2–kinase core. On the way to activation, disassembly of the SH3–SH2–kinase core opens a new autoinhibitory site on the kinase domain for PHTH domain binding that is ultimately released upon interaction of PHTH with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. Membrane-induced dimerization activates BTK and we present here a crystal structure of an activation loop swapped BTK kinase domain dimer that likely represents the conformational state leading to trans-autophosphorylation. Together, these data provide the first structural elucidation of full-length BTK and allow a deeper understanding of allosteric control over the BTK kinase domain during distinct stages of activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BTK</kwd><kwd>kinase regulation</kwd><kwd>conformational states</kwd><kwd>kinase structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI043957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andreotti</surname><given-names>Amy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple dynamic protein interactions converge to regulate the catalytic activity of the B cell kinase, BTK.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The TEC family kinase, BTK (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase) is best known as the target of ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA), the first-in-class covalent kinase active site inhibitor used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The TEC kinases are the second largest subfamily of non-receptor tyrosine kinases in the human genome after the SRC family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu and Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mano, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). The TEC and SRC kinases share the SH3–SH2–kinase domain arrangement (the ‘Src module’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Structures of the autoinhibited SRC family kinases were solved in 1997 revealing, for the first time, the compact arrangement of the SH3 and SH2 domains assembled onto the distal side of the catalytic kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). Despite the shared ‘Src module’ of the SRC and TEC families, 18 years passed before an autoinhibited structure of one of the TEC kinases was resolved by X-ray crystallography. In 2015, the BTK SH3–SH2–kinase fragment was crystallized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This BTK fragment crystallizes as a domain swapped dimer; the SH2 domain opens to allow the B helix of one chain to pack against the β-sheet of the other chain. One-half of the domain swapped BTK structure represents the current model for autoinhibited BTK and closely resembles the compact structure of autoinhibited SRC kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Current Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) structural data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of the SRC and TEC domain architectures.

The SRC kinases contain a C-terminal tail (absent in the TEC family) that, upon phosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine, binds to the SH2 domain in an intramolecular fashion to stabilize the autoinhibited Src module. BTK instead stabilizes the SH2 autoinhibitory pose via a conserved acidic side chain at the end of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). The SRC kinases also contain an N-terminal SH4-unique domain region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) that is intrinsically disordered and has not been resolved in the available crystal structures. The SRC kinases are myristoylated or palmitoylated in the SH4 domain driving membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koegl et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast, BTK contains an extended N-terminal region (PHTH–PRR) consisting of the phospholipid-binding Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain followed by a Tec homology (TH) domain and a long linker housing two proline-rich regions (PRR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The folded N-terminal PH domain of BTK has been crystallized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baraldi et al., 1999</xref>) revealing a binding site for inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP<sub>4</sub>), the headgroup of its target phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The crystal structure shows the TH domain bound to zinc and closely associated with the PH domain; the folded N-terminal domain of BTK is hereafter referred to as PHTH. The BTK PHTH domain crystallizes as a homodimer, named for the preeminent structural biologist, Matti Saraste, who solved the first BTK PHTH structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hyvönen and Saraste, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The N-terminal PHTH–PRR domains account for over 30% of the BTK sequence. The BTK PHTH domain structure has been solved both as the isolated domain and in a construct where PHTH is covalently attached to the BTK kinase domain through a short tether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The tightly tethered structure revealed an interface between the PHTH domain and the N-lobe of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) but the contacts are mutually exclusive with the contacts between the BTK SH3 and kinase domain in the autoinhibited ‘Src module’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) raising questions about whether both the SH3 and PHTH domain associate with the kinase domain simultaneously. At the same time, we conducted solution-based Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>) that point to autoinhibitory interactions between the PHTH domain and the activation loop face of the BTK kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In this case, the mapped interface reflects intermolecular contacts that result upon addition of excess PHTH domain to the isolated BTK kinase domain (NMR) or comparison of full-length BTK with the SH3–SH2–kinase fragment (HDXMS). Thus, the BTK structural data reported to date support two poses for the N-terminal PHTH domain: PHTH domain landing on the distal face of the kinase domain N-lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and PHTH domain binding to the activation loop face of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>Here, we set out to solve the structure of the full-length BTK protein. Our crystallization target included the N-terminal PHTH domain and the long PRR linker region followed by the SH3, SH2, SH2–kinase linker, and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Mutations were introduced into the SH3–SH2–kinase core in an effort to stabilize the compact autoinhibited conformation. We reasoned that this approach might encourage the PHTH domain to adopt a stable autoinhibited state or states. Despite efforts to optimize the autoinhibitory conformation of BTK, the crystallography presented here reveals the same domain swapped dimer solved previously and no electron density is observed for the PHTH-linker residues. Further analyses using both small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) support a BTK autoinhibited state wherein the core SH3–SH2–kinase region adopts the compact monomeric form much like that observed in the early SRC kinase structures. CryoEM allows the PHTH domain to be directly observed; the globular PHTH adopts a range of conformational states that surround but do not contact the core ‘Src module’. To revisit the PHTH domain crystallographically, we lengthened and redesigned the tether between PHTH and kinase domains to provide greater conformational freedom between domains. The resulting crystal structure revealed yet another binding pose for the BTK PHTH domain on the BTK kinase domain and mutational analysis supports a regulatory role for this interface in the full-length kinase. Finally, we have also captured a structure of a BTK kinase domain dimer revealing a potential arrangement of this domain undergoing trans-autophosphorylation following PIP<sub>3</sub>-mediated dimerization. Together, the structural and biochemical data presented here provide new insights into the allosteric control of BTK catalytic function. These findings create new opportunities to target this kinase in the context of disease and/or drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construct design and optimization</title><p>To stabilize the autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK for crystallography, we first optimized the inhibitory contacts between the SH3 domain and the N-lobe of the BTK kinase domain. Following previous efforts that successfully stabilized this region in a related SRC family kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lerner et al., 2005</xref>), we substituted key residues within the SH2-linker sequence with proline (construct ‘4P’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The catalytic activity of the full-length BTK 4P variant, measured by autophosphorylation on Y511 in the BTK activation loop, is reduced compared to wild-type BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, the melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of BTK 4P is 4°C higher than wild-type BTK consistent with stabilization of the overall fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we tested the effect of mutation of L390 to phenylalanine on the activity and stability of full-length BTK. L390 resides in the SH2-linker and has been shown to stabilize the hydrophobic stack (W421 and Y461) in the kinase domain N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Raußendorf et al., 2017</xref>). The aromatic phenylalanine is found in other members of the TEC family suggesting it is well tolerated in this position. We find the L390F mutation does not change the activity of full-length BTK but it does increase the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> by 1.5°C compared to wild-type BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b , c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore combined the 4P and L390F mutations (BTK 4P1F) and observe a further decrease in autophosphorylation activity and 4.5°C increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lastly, we compared the BTK 4P1F mutant to full-length BTK containing ITK activation loop residues (L542M S543T, V555T, R562K, S564A, and P565S) instead of the wild-type BTK sequence. We have previously show that incorporation of these ITK activation loop residues results in dampened loop dynamics that favor the autoinhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joseph et al., 2013</xref>). As well, previous BTK crystallography efforts showed that these changes in the activation loop are required for crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, the activity of full-length BTK with the ITK loop substitution is low and we find that this sequence change also stabilizes the overall protein as the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> is 2.5°C higher than wild-type BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that targeted modifications within the SH2-linker region and activation loop of BTK result in stabilization of the autoinhibited conformation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stabilization of the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) SH3–SH2–kinase core.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Mutations introduced into the SH2–kinase linker region of BTK (residues 382–396).

In addition, the catalytic K430 was mutated to arginine to eliminate kinase activity that could produce heterogeneity. This construct produced very small crystals in multiple crystallization conditions.

Notably, there is no PHTH domain density visible even after the structure is fully refined. To confirm that the crystals contain the full-length BTK protein and not a degradation fragment, we harvested, washed, and analyzed the crystals by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). The result shows the crystal is full-length BTK protein with no evidence of smaller BTK fragments. Finally, we built five additional full-length BTK constructs with varying mutations/deletions within the long PRR containing linker between the PHTH and SH3 domains (see Materials and methods).

Placing the PHTH structure at the N-terminus of the BTK SH3–SH2–kinase model shows that the PHTH domain is readily accommodated within the solvent channels of the crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The crystallography results are consistent with a flexible N-terminal PHTH domain with the caveat that crystal packing might limit native autoinhibitory contacts between the PHTH and SH3–SH2–kinase regions. To address this, we examined the accessibility of the previously identified PHTH domain-binding site on the activation loop face of the BTK kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>) in the context of symmetry related molecules in the crystal. The C-lobe G-helix portion of the PHTH/kinase interface mapped previously by solution methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>), appears inaccessible while the activation loop itself and the portion of the N-lobe previously identified within the PHTH/kinase interface are accessible. Thus, it is possible that the PHTH domain mobility in the crystal is due to steric occlusion of the previously identified regulatory site.

Indeed, we and others have previously implicated the PHTH domain in autoinhibitory contacts with the kinase domain of BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we have mapped an interaction between the PHTH domain and the activation loop face of the BTK kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) using solution methods. As well, the BTK fragment lacking the PHTH–PRR region is more active than the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and the same work suggested that mutation of specific surface exposed side chains within the PHTH domain (R133 and Y134) results in modest activation of BTK. The latter was based on the tightly tethered PHTH–kinase crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, PDB: 4Y93) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The location of the PHTH domain in the tightly tethered structure (PDB: 4Y93) is sterically incompatible with the autoinhibited SH3–SH2–kinase structure, and so the authors used molecular dynamics simulations to arrive at a model for full-length autoinhibited BTK that accommodates both the SH3 and PHTH domain on the kinase N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Given the short linker used in that work, the steric clash between SH3 and PHTH domains in the two separate structures, and the fact that our X-ray and cryoEM analyses of full-length BTK do not reveal precise PHTH autoinhibitory contacts, we decided to pursue the role of PHTH in BTK autoinhibition further by crystallizing a redesigned tethered PHTH–kinase construct.</p><p>The first step in our redesign was to lengthen the linker between PHTH and kinase domain to reflect the flexibility and distance between the N- and C-terminal domains of BTK. We inserted GGSGG repeats that were either 22 or 32 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This linker entirely replaced the PRR, SH3, SH2, and SH2-linker sequence. We intentionally excluded the SH2–kinase linker from the PHTH–kinase construct since this linker, in particular L390, mediates autoinhibitory contacts between the SH3 domain and the kinase domain N-lobe. In addition, the new <sup>1</sup>PHTH<sup>171</sup>-G(GGSGG)<sub>4/6</sub>G-<sup>396</sup>kinase<sup>659</sup> constructs included PHTH β5–β6 loop mutations (Q91A, I92A, I94A, and I95A) to prevent formation of the ‘Saraste dimer‘ since that structure is associated with BTK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hyvönen and Saraste, 1997</xref>). As before, the K430R and ITK activation loop mutations were incorporated to facilitate crystallization. The GDC-0853 inhibitor was included in all crystallization conditions.

Since our new PHTH–kinase structures does not contain L390, and instead Y134 fulfills the hydrophobic stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), we reasoned that in the full-length protein the PHTH domain may only exert its effect upon release of L390 from the N-lobe (likely concomitant with release of the SH3 domain). We therefore tested the effect of the PHTH mutations in the context of an additional mutation (W251K) that breaks the SH3 contacts with the SH2-linker (contains L390) and kinase domain N-lobe. Mutation of W251K in the SH3 domain of full-length BTK by itself leads to an increase in BTK activity similar to that of the R133E/Y134E/R171E mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d, e</xref>). Mutation of W251 to lysine in combination with the R133E/Y134E/R171E mutation results in a more active kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d, e</xref>) and shorter time to the threshold ADP level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) compared to constructs in which the autoinhibitory SH3 domain is intact.

(<bold>f</bold>) Comparison of regulatory spine structures for active BTK kinase domain (PDB: 3K54), inactive BTK (PDB: 3GEN), and the ‘DFG-up’ structure solved here (PDB: 8S9F). F540 is orange and other R-spine residues are in blue. W395 is at the top of the R-spine in BTK; the ‘DFG-up’ configuration stabilizes the active rotamer of W395 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chopra et al., 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89489-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The activation loop of one monomer in the face-to-face BTK dimer structure extends into the active site of the other monomer but electron density is missing for residues 546–559, which includes the Y551 autophosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). Nevertheless, superimposing two different substrate-bound kinase structures (tyrosine and serine phosphoacceptors) onto the BTK kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>) shows that Y551 from one BTK kinase domain monomer would easily reach a viable phosphor-acceptor position in the active site of the opposing monomer. The swapped BTK dimer structure may therefore represent a conformation along the trans-autophosphorylation activation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beenstock et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The canonical Lys/Glu salt bridge with active kinase domains does not form in the BTK kinase domain dimer due to the unusual conformation of the phenylalanine side of the DFG motif (F540) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). The F540 side chain intercalates between the Lys/Glu side chains adopting what has previously been termed ‘DFG-up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dodson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombano et al., 2019</xref>) or ‘DFGinter’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Modi and Dunbrack, 2019</xref>). The C-helix is therefore held in an intermediate state between the C-helix in and C-helix out conformations associated with active and inactive kinases, respectively. In addition to the unusual position of F540, D539 of the DFG motif points inward, orientated approximately 180° opposite from that in the DFG-in conformation of the active kinase and E445 on the C-helix forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of G541 in the DFG motif instead of forming a salt bridge with K430 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). It is also interesting to compare the regulatory spine (R-spine) for this BTK kinase dimer and the R-spine in previously solved active and inactive structures of BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). The active BTK structure shows close packing between the top of the R-spine and W395, which adopts the rotamer conformation required for active BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph et al., 2010</xref>). Inactive BTK, in contrast, shows no contact between W395 and the R-spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>); interestingly, the DFG conformation is quite similar between active and inactive BTK. The ‘DFG-up’ configuration in the kinase domain dimer structure is accompanied by the W395 rotamer that is associated with active BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>). That said, it is also possible that the DFG status is highly dependent on the nature of the bound drug. In fact, a previous structure of another TEC family kinase, BMX, reveals the same DFG-up state and the kinase domain in that case is also bound to dasatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muckelbauer et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings reported here provide new insights into autoinhibition and allosteric control of the full-length, multidomain BTK protein. The data advance our understanding of BTK regulation as many previous studies did not interrogate the structure of the entire full-length protein. In pursuing full-length BTK, we find that missing electron density in crystals of full-length BTK, elongated SAXS envelopes, and visualization of the PHTH domain by cryoEM support a model where the N-terminal BTK PHTH domain populates a conformational ensemble surrounding the compact/autoinhibited SH3–SH2–kinase core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). In previous work probing allosteric regulation of full-length BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>), we consistently find that perturbations to the conformational state of the SH3–SH2–kinase core have no effect on the hydrogen/deuterium exchange behavior of the PHTH domain consistent with the dynamically independent PHTH domain observed here. Contrary to models of autoinhibited multidomain proteins where each globular domain is sequestered into a compact core, the autoinhibited state of full-length BTK might instead feature a conformationally heterogeneous PH domain that is connected to a compact core through a flexible linker and likely contacts the kinase domain only transiently. Similar conformational heterogeneity has been reported for the PH domains of phospholipases Cε and β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garland-Kuntz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) activation model.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Inactive, autoinhibited BTK, the conformational heterogeneity of the Pleckstrin homology/Tec homology (PHTH) domain is indicated in fuzzy red.

A recent crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Truebestein et al., 2021</xref>) provides a more unbiased view of the potential autoinhibitory interface between the PH and kinase domains of AKT; the PH domain binds to the activation loop face of the kinase domain in a manner that is quite similar to our earlier solution studies of both ITK and BTK (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devkota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>). Like AKT, the BTK PH/kinase interface detected in solution studies masks the PIP<sub>3</sub>-binding site on the PH domain. However, consideration of all data to date suggests that regulatory interactions between the BTK PHTH and kinase domains are transient. Previously characterized contacts between the PHTH domain and the activation loop face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amatya et al., 2019</xref>) or between the PHTH domain and the kinase domain N-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) may all exist within the conformational ensemble of a range PH/kinase domain interactions.</p><p>Non-PH domain containing kinases present similarly dynamic N-terminal regions that exert regulatory control over catalytic activity. The N-terminal region of the SRC kinases has been invoked in ‘fuzzy’ intramolecular regulatory interactions with the Src module (SH3–SH2–kinase) core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arbesú et al., 2017</xref>). For SRC, it has been suggested that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal regions increase the flexibility of the SH3–SH2–kinase core to promote ligand-binding interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pérez et al., 2013</xref>). The N-terminal ‘cap‘ region of ABL is another example of a long, disordered N-terminal region; myristoylation results in a key autoinhibitory contact between the N-terminal myristate and the ABL kinase domain C-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pluk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nagar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hantschel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panjarian et al., 2013</xref>). Within BTK, we have previously shown that the PRR in the linker between the PHTH and SH3 domains competes with the SH2–kinase linker for binding to the SH3 domain thereby shifting the conformational equilibrium of the autoinhibited core to a more open configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laederach et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, BTK SH3 displacement from the autoinhibited core via interaction with the PRR may be a prerequisite for the PHTH domain to take up the autoinhibitory pose on the kinase domain N-lobe defined here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). The extent to which the intrinsically disordered PRR region of BTK participates in additional, perhaps fuzzy, interactions with the BTK SH3–SH2–kinase region remains to be investigated. As well, interactions of the N-terminal region of BTK with both positive and negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nocka et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tsukada et al., 1994</xref>) may alter the dynamic characteristics observed here. It is also possible that the dynamic linker between the PHTH and SH3 domains of BTK may mediate phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shelby et al., 2023</xref>) and clustering into signaling competent condensates. While these questions need further study, it is notable that the SRC and TEC kinases seem to share dynamic regulatory features in their N-termini despite drastically different primary structures.</p><p>Transition from fully autoinhibited to active BTK following receptor activation can be considered in light of the structural insights now available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The BTK hydrophobic stack residues, W421 and Y461, are a binding site for both the L390 side chain on the SH2–kinase linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Raußendorf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>) and Y134 on the BTK PHTH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Both interactions allosterically inhibit BTK catalytic activity by stabilizing the inactive kinase domain conformation. The SH3/L390/hydrophobic stack interaction is present in the autoinhibited Src module and release of the regulatory SH3/SH2 domains opens the kinase N-lobe for secondary inhibitory interactions with the PHTH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). Once PIP<sub>3</sub> is made available by the action of PI3K, the PHTH binds to PIP<sub>3</sub> in the membrane and likely dimerizes through the Saraste dimer. To explore possible consequences of BTK dimerization at the membrane, we superimposed the PHTH–kinase structure onto the PHTH Saraste dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Viewing the resulting dimer arrangement from the inner membrane surface shows a large acidic patch on the BTK kinase domains parallel to the bound IP<sub>4</sub> ligands. If the PHTH–kinase complex remains intact upon membrane association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>), electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged BTK kinase domain and the negatively charged membrane surface might result in dissociation of the inhibitory BTK PHTH/kinase interaction and subsequent dimerization-mediated autophosphorylation in the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Indeed, mutation of the PHTH domain residues that contact the kinase domain led to more rapid PIP<sub>3</sub>-mediated activation of full-length BTK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–i</xref>) suggesting the PHTH autoinhibitory structure interaction might remain intact as BTK associates with PIP<sub>3</sub>. This is consistent with a recent report that Grb2 association with the PRR of BTK results in higher levels of BTK activity at the PIP<sub>3</sub> membrane possibly by destabilizing autoinhibited BTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nocka et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The autoinhibitory role of the PHTH domain in maintaining the BTK kinase domain in its inactive state until assembly at the membrane provides new insight into oncogenic forms of BTK. Specifically, the oncogenic p65BTK isoform lacks most of the PHTH domain and is expressed in colorectal carcinoma and some glioblastoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grassilli et al., 2016</xref>). As well, an extended transcript yields BTK-C, an isoform that contains additional residues at the N-terminus and is expressed in breast and prostate cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eifert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). It is not fully understood to what extent and through what mechanisms these deletions and extensions of the PHTH domain affect BTK regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grassilli et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to effects on PIP<sub>3</sub> binding, and/or interactions with other regulatory proteins, it is also possible that the altered PHTH domain sequences may contribute to oncogenicity by disrupting the autoinhibitory function of the PHTH domain.</p><p>The TEC kinases provide a rich tapestry on which multidomain protein regulation and allostery can be studied. The observations here support a model where the BTK PHTH domain visits multiple conformational states and likely rapidly interconverts between states (both detached and associated with the SH3–SH2–kinase core). A model where the primary autoinhibitory contacts are housed within the SH3–SH2–kinase core is consistent with the fact that the SRC kinases lack the PH domain entirely and rely only on their SH3 and SH2 domains for autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the temptation to assign a stable autoinhibitory configuration to the BTK PHTH domain, the inherent conformational heterogeneity of the BTK PHTH domain instead suggests the possibility of multifaceted regulatory roles for this single domain. It will be interesting to compare the TEC kinases in this regard. The length of the PRR linker between PHTH and SH3 domain varies across the family, the loops that mediate formation of the BTK PHTH Saraste dimer are absent in the PHTH domains of other TEC kinases, and one TEC kinase, RLK/TXK, lacks the PHTH domain and instead contains an N-terminal region nearly identical in length to that of the SRC kinases. Subfamily-specific differences in structure, dynamics, autoregulation, activation, and allostery are likely important for control of distinct signaling pathways in distinct cell types.</p></sec><sec

id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and constructs</title><p>Cloning and mutagenesis in this work were carried by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phusion Hot Start II DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For initial protein characterization, full-length (FL) BTK (residues 1–659) was cloned into pET20b vector with a C-terminal 6xHistidine tag (FL BTK-C6H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). For crystallization and activity assays, a N-terminal 6× Histidine-SUMO-tag FL BTK (N6H-SUMO-FL BTK) construct was created by inserting a N-terminal 6× Histidine-SUMO-tag into pET20b FL BTK-C6H by Seamless Ligation Cloning Extract (SLiCE) cloning and removing the C-terminal 6xHistidine by PCR (pET-His-SUMO provided by Eric Underbakke). The <sup>1</sup>PHTH<sup>171</sup>-G(GGSGG)<sub>4/6</sub>G-<sup>396</sup>kinase<sup>659</sup> constructs were cloned into pET28b vector with a N-terminal 6× Histidine-SUMO-tag. The BTK kinase domain (residues 382–659) construct (N6H-SUMO KD) was created by deleting residues 1–381 from the pET20b N6H-SUMO-FL BTK plasmid by PCR. All BTK constructs carry the solubilizing Y617P mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). All constructs created in this work were verified by sequencing at the Iowa State University DNA synthesis and sequencing facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The plasmids were transformed to BL21 (DE3) cells (MilliporeSigma). To express FL BTK-C6H, N6H-SUMO-FL BTK, and N6H-SUMO KD, cells were grown in LB broth (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (Fisher Scientific). For the expression of <sup>1</sup>PHTH<sup>171</sup>-G(GGSGG)<sub>4</sub>G-<sup>396</sup>kinase<sup>659</sup> and <sup>1</sup>PHTH<sup>176</sup>-G(GGSGG)<sub>4</sub>G-<sup>384</sup>kinase<sup>659</sup> fusion proteins (PHTH–KD), cells were grown in LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin (MilliporeSigma). For expression of any kinase active BTK, pCDFDuet YopH was co-transformed with the BTK plasmids additionally supplemented with 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All BTK constructs were expressed similarly: cells were grown at 37°C until the optical density at 600 nm reached ~0.6. Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-<sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 hr at 18°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol), and stored at −80°C until use. Cells were thawed with the addition of 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 1500 U of DNAse I (MilliporeSigma) and lysed by sonication on ice at 50% amplitude for 2 min with 0.5 s on and 1.5 s off intervals. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 1 hr at 4°C, and the supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA column (QIAGEN) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 20 column volume of lysis buffer with 10 mM imidazole. For FL BTK-C6H, the proteins eluted with lysis buffer with 300 mM imidazole. For N6H-SUMO-tagged BTK constructs, the BTK-bound Ni-NTA resins in disposable columns were capped, resuspended with the lysis buffer with the addition of 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and 1 mg of Ulp1 (provided by Eric Underbakke), and incubated O/N. The tagless BTK proteins were obtained by collecting the flow-through from the column and eluting with additional 10 ml of lysis buffer. The BTK sample was concentrated, and further purified with HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 pg (Cytiva) with Size exclusion chromatography buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM Dithiothreitol). The purity of the samples was verified by SDS–PAGE. If YopH is still present in the BTK fractions, proteins were further purified with a Source 15Q column using ion-change buffers (Buffer A: 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 DTT, and 50 mM; Buffer B: 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 DTT, and 1 M NaCl). Purified proteins were concentrated to 5–20 mg/ml, flash-frozen in 100 µl aliquots with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Crystallization, structure determination, and refinement</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Crystal structure of FL BTK</title><p>The FL BTK construct (residues 1–659) used for initial crystallization trials contains multiple mutations in different regions of BTK: (1) PHTH domain β5–6 loop mutations: Q91A, I92A, I94A, and I95A; (2) PPR region mutations: P189A, P192A, P203A, and P206A; (3) SH2–kinase linker mutations: A384P, S386P, T387P, A388P, and L390F; (4) activation loop mutations: L542M S543T, V555T, R562K, S564A, and P565S; (5) kinase inactive mutation: K430R. Tiny needle-shaped crystals of FL BTK were initially obtained from sitting-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing purified FL BTK proteins at 15–20 mg/ml with equal amount of the precipitant solution 15–20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris Propane, pH7.5, and 0.2 M potassium thiocyanate (KSCN) at 4°C.

For the liposome experiments, 200 μM liposomes were added to the both control and kinase reactions. Experiments were performed in triplicates in black 96-well plates and were measured alongside three control reactions for nonenzymatic production of ADP (no kinase added). The reactions were initiated by adding 25 μl of 2× ATP/NADH buffer, containing 1 mM NADH, 2 mM PEP, 2 mM ATP and 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in reaction buffer and measured using the Synergy HT Microplate Reader (BioTek) by monitoring the fluorescence of NADH at 460 nm at 22°C with 1 min intervals for 3 hr. The absolute concentration of NADH stock at ~40 mM was determined by measuring its absorbance at 340 nm (<italic>ε</italic>340 = 6220 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) based on Beer–Lambert law. NADH concentration versus fluorescence units (FUs) standard curve ranging from 50 to 600 μM was measured at beginning of each measurement to determine the FUs to NADH concentration conversion factor. Raw fluorescence data from control reactions and kinase reactions for each condition were averaged and converted to picomole ADP produced using the NADH concentration conversion factor calculated assuming the amount of NDAH consumed is equivalent to the amount of ADP produced by ATP hydrolysis. Amount of ADP produced corrected for nonenzymatic ADP production (from control reactions) were plotted against time in Excel.

An open question in the field is how the Pleckstrin Homology-Tec Homology (PHTH) domain inhibits BTK activity, with multiple competing models in the field. The authors used a complimentary set of biophysical techniques combined with well thought out stabilizing mutations to obtain structural insights into BTK regulation in its full length form. They were able to crystallize the full length construct of BTK but unfortunately the PHTH was not resolved yielding the structure similar to previously obtained in the field. The investigation of the same construct by SAXS yielded an elongated structural model, consistent with previous SAXS studies. Using cryo-EM the authors obtained a low resolution model for the FL BTK with a loosely connected density assigned to the dynamic PHTH around the compact SH2-SH3-Kinase Domain (KD) core. To gain further molecular insights into PHTH-KD interactions the authors followed a previously reported strategy and generated a fusion of PHTH-KD with a longer linker, yielding a crystal structure with a novel PHTH-KD interface which they tested in biochemical assays. Lastly, Yin-wei Lin et al crystallized the BTK KD in a novel partially active state in a &quot;face to face&quot; dimer with kinases exchanging the activation loops, although partially disordered, being theoretically perfectly positioned for trans phosphorylation. Overall this presents a valiant effort to gain molecular insights into what clearly is a dynamic regulatory motif on BTK and is a valuable addition to the field.</p><p>I think the authors addressed all the comments that I had during the initial round of review. The only thing I can think of that would strengthen the paper is to add a supplemental figure/table with the results of unbiased SITUS fitting rather than just saying that it is close to manual fitting. Additionally, SITUS outputs not just one best solution but all the top fits and having a significant difference in cross correlation between the best fit and second best fit is usually indicative of true fit. As the authors already ran SITUS and colores they have this data and I think having a sup table with cross correlations for the top 3 fits for each of their maps would make their EM fitting more convincing and not hard to do.</p><p>Lastly, it seems like both the authors and I agree that the cryoEM reconstructions do not correspond to the reported resolutions by the FSC. This point in no way changes any of the conclusions of the paper, however, I can't help but feel guilty that some student who is not in the field will look at these EM maps in the future and think that this is how 7A reconstructions should look like. If the authors, maybe somewhere in the methods could add a sentence indicating that the FSC curves may be overly optimistic and that there are no secondary structure features present which would be expected at these resolutions, that would be great.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89489.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>David Yin-wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kueffer</surname><given-names>Lauren E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Juneja</surname><given-names>Puneet</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wales</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeastern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Engen</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northeastern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Andreotti</surname><given-names>Amy H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Iowa State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ames</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>The study provides valuable insights into allosteric regulation of BTK, a non-receptor protein kinase, challenging previous models.

Instead we point out that the PH/kinase interface identified in the prior structure is incompatible with the contacts between the SH3 and kinase domains in autoinhibited BTK. This then leads us to the suggestion that a PH/kinase inhibitory interaction may instead occur upon dissociation of the SH3-SH2 cassette from the kinase domain. Our data support that model. Moreover, our data suggest the PHTH domain is dynamic, likely not settling in to one particular autoinhibitory state. Thus, it is possible the previously solved PH/kinase structure exists within the conformational ensemble of a range PH/kinase domain interactions. In an effort to clarify our think we added two sentences to the Discussion (pg. 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, multiple biophysical techniques were employed to investigate the activation mechanism of BTK, a multi-domain non-receptor protein kinase.

It is somewhat difficult to compare the previously reported activity assay for the same BTK mutant (Wang et al. ref 5, Figure 4D) with the data we report here. For unexplained reasons, the time scale for the quantitative assay in the previous work is truncated to 50 munutes for the R133/Y134 mutant data compared to 120 minutes for all of the other activity data reported in that figure. In our data, if we qualitatively examine the differences in a representative progress curve at 50 minutes between WT and the double R133/Y134 mutant (see Figure 6a, dark blue and pink traces) one might conclude that the R133/Y134 mutation is activating BTK. However, when we calculate the average kinase activity rate ± standard error for three independent experiments we find that the difference between WT and the double R133/Y134 mutant is not significant (see Figure 6b and c). Thus, instead of making any assertions about the previously published data we are trying to be as rigoruous as possible in presentation and interpretation of our own data.</p><p>In addition, throughout the manuscript we tried to be very careful in our discussion of our data and that published previously, to avoid conclusive statements about the previously described interface. Afterall, one of our overriding conclusions is that the N-terminal region of BTK is highly dynamic.

The cryo-EM reconstructions are potentially over-interpreted. The reported resolution for all of the analyzed reconstructions is better than 8Å, at which point helices should be recognized as well-resolved structural elements. In the current view/depiction of the cryo-EM maps/models it is hard to see such structural features and it would be great if the authors could include a panel showing maps at higher thresholds to show correspondence between the helices in the kinase C lobe and the cryo-EM maps. Otherwise, the overall positioning of the models within the cryo-EM maps is hard to evaluate and may very well be wrong. (Fig 4, S2).</p></disp-quote><p>First, we fully recognize the model is low-resolution and we are careful in our discussion of the cryo-EM data to use language that acknowledges the limitations of the model. Nevertheless, this is the model we have (specific data processing points are discussed below).</p><p>The resolution numbers are from the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve given by Cryosaprc at the end of refinement. We do acknowledge the reviewer’s comments that the resolution could be over estimated in that calculation, but our main focus is to show that the overall domain arrangement of the autoinhibited BTK core (Src-module) fits into the reconstructions.</p><p>We tested visualizing the maps at higher threshold, but the secondary structures of the reconstructions were still not well resolved. We do realize that with the current reconstructions, we do not have the structural details to correctly orientate and fit individual domains; this is why we chose to simply fit the available crystal structure of the autoinhibited BTK SH3-SH2-kinase core into the maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. With the above in mind, if the maps are not at the point where helices are well resolved, it may be beneficial to low-pass filter the maps to a more conservative resolution for fitting, analysis, and representation. (Fig 4, S2).</p></disp-quote><p>Using low-pass filtered maps at 10Å or unsharpened maps, the fitting of the BTK model and map do not change significantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be valuable to get a quantitative metric on the model/map fitting for the cryo-EM work. One good package for this is Situs which provides cross-correlation values for the top orthogonal fits, without user input for initial fitting. This would again increase confidence in the correctness of model positioning on the map. (Fig 4, S2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We tested the colores feature (Exhaustive One-At-A-Time 6D Search) in Situs to perform model to map fitting without user input as the reviewer suggested. The highest ranked fitting is identical to what we presented in the manuscript. Following are the cross-corelation numbers calculated from “Fit-in-map” tool in chimera and from “collage” function in Situs. We now indicate this step in the caption to Figure 4.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Fit-in-map</th><th>Situs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Class 0</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.7181</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.6144</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Class 1</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.7003</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.6277</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Class 3</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.6273</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.5798</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be great to see 2D class averages from the particles contributing to each of the 3D classes. Theoretically, a clear bright &quot;blob&quot; (hypothesized to be the PHTH domain) should be observable in the 2D class averages. In the current 2D class averages that region is unconvincingly weak. (Fig 4, S2).</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to improve both 2D and 3D reconstructitions by feeding the particles from each 3D class through many cycles of 2D classification and selection to exclude ‘bad’ paritcles, but neither the 2D class averages nor 3D reconstructions could be improved.</p><p>We agree the feature that appears in the 2D class averages is weak. The BTK protein is only 77kD in size and is highly dynamic and flexible. Thus, in reality this is not an ideal system for cryo-EM. As well, the PHTH domain itself is quite small and NMR data, acquired in the context of a different project, provides evidence that the isolated PHTH domain is dynamic in solution (NMR linewidths vary throughout the protein suggesting intermediate exchange). Nevertheless, given the inability to capture the PHTH domain in crystal structures of full-llength BTK we reasoned that cryo-EM could provide some insight. In the future we anticipate building on these data to include inhibitory binding partners of BTK; however such an effort is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It seems like there was quite a large circular mask applied during 2D classification. Are authors confident that the weak density attributed to the PHTH domain is not neighboring particles making their way into the extraction box? It would be great if the authors would trim their particle stack with a very stringent interparticle distance cutoff (or report the cutoff in the manuscript if already done so) to minimize this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially picked particles using a small radius (100 Å), and stringently selected 2D classes with particles that contained only density aligning to the core SH3-SH2-kinase domains. We found, however, that 3D ab initio reconstruction always resulted in an additional density located at different positions around the larger core density. The structure of a single BTK PHTH domain fits into that additional remote density. Given the additional density that consistently appeared in 3D reconstructions, we went back and picked particles using a larger circular mask (200 A). Subsequent 2D classification and 3D reconstruction from this analysis gave similar results and are presented in the manuscript.</p><p>Regardless of the mask radius, we used stringent conditions for particle picking and checked for the presence of duplicates. An interparticle distance cutoff of 0.1 to 0.5 times the particle diameter was used and resulted in fewer number of particles, but the presence of the extended density remains. We also made use of template picking (2D class averages) to repick the particles and found no significant difference in the number of particles or quality of 2D classifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The cryo-EM processing may benefit from more stringent particle picking. The authors picked over 2M particles from 750 micrographs which likely represents very heavy overpicking. I would encourage the authors to re-pick the micrographs with 2D class averages and use more stringent metrics to reduce the overpicking. This may result in higher-resolution reconstructions. (Fig 4, S2).</p></disp-quote><p>This was an effort to maximize the number of particles extracted. After multiple rounds of 2D classification and selection to exclude empty and junk particles, the final number of particles selected for 3D ab-initio reconstructions were only 68,788, and only ~20K particles for each 3D reconstruction. Thus, we are not concerned that we overpicked particles. This approach is described in Supp Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The Dmax from SAXS for the Full Length BTK is at 190Å. It would be great if the authors could make a cartoon of what domain arrangement may satisfy this distance, as it is quite extended for such a small particle. Can the authors rule out dimerization at SAXS concentrations? (Fig 1).</p></disp-quote><p>SAXS data for full-length, wild-type BTK has been previously published (Márquez et al, 2003 EMBO J. (2003) 22:4616-4624). Our data for WT BTK are consistent with that published previously (and we have cited this previous work). In that work, the authors attribute the ~200 Å Dmax value to an elongated BTK conformation where the domains of BTK are arranged in a linear fashion (a figure showing this domain arragement is provided by Marquez et al. precluding the need for such a cartoon here).</p><p>In the present work we take advantage of targeted mutations to stabilize the autoinhibted SH2-SH2-kinase core and the Dmax value that we report for this more autoinhibited version of full-length BTK (FL 4P1F) is ~150Å. Notwithstanding low resolution in both SAXS and cryoEM, it is notable that superposition of the cryoEM models in Figure 4c &amp; d gives a distance of ~150Å between the PHTH domains from the two models.</p><p>Finally, we cannot completely rule out that a small fraction of full length BTK is forming dimers. However, in our experience purifying and working with this protein, we find that purified and concentrated monomeric fulllength Btk proteins (as high as 15mg/ml) are quite stable and remain monomeric and free of aggregation even after sitting at 4°C for more than a week. Here the BTK SAXS data were collected within 24 hours after the samples were thawed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure S1 (C) it seems that the curves are just scattering curves with Guinier plots in the inserts, but are labeled as Guinier plots in the legend. The Guinier plots for some samples (FL 4P1F) show signs of aggregation, which may complicate the analysis, it could be beneficial to redo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out our mistake in presention of the SAXS data. We have now replaced plots in Figure S1c with the correct scattering profiles for each construct with the Guinier insets shown. We revised the label of this panel to “Scattering profile and Guinier plots (insets)”.</p><p>In addition, we re-processed the FL 4P1F data by performing buffer subtraction (using a different buffer alone scattering dataset (also collected during original data acquisition)). The data quality after reprocessing were significantly improved (see new scattering profiles and Guinier plots for full-length BTK inSupplementary Figure S1). Protein stability (see above) and the current data quality therefore suggest that aggregation is not complicating the SAXS analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Have the authors verified that the activation loop mutations that they introduce do not disrupt the PHTH binding as they previously reported an activation loop on BTK to interact with PHTH, an interaction they do not see here? If so, a citation would be helpful in the text. If not, testing this would strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The same activation loop mutations were included in the constructs used in the previous solution studies of the PHTH/kinase domain interaction by NMR and HDX (see ref [11]). We clarify this point in the methods section. As well, all but one of the sequence changes introduced into the activation loop are at positions at the ‘base’ of the activation loop and therefore are not surface exposed. Only one amino acid change is on the exposed part of the activation loop (V555T).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Can the authors comment on the surfaces which are accessible and inaccessible to the PHTH in the crystal (Fig 3E)? The fact that PHTH doesn't adopt a stable conformation in the solvent channel to some degree indicates that the accessible interaction surfaces are not suitable for PHTH interactions, as the &quot;effective concentration&quot; of the PHTH would be quite high. Are these surfaces consistent with the cryo-EM analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we did state the following in describing the crystallization results:</p><p>“the crystallography results are consistent with a flexible N-terminal PHTH domain with the caveat that the domain swapped dimer organization might limit native autoinhibitory contacts between the PHTH and SH3SH2-kinase regions.”</p><p>In the domain swapped dimer seen in the crystal, a symmetry related molecule does partially block the Ghelix region of the kinase domain while the activation loop and C-helix in the N-lobe remain accessible. Our previous solution studies (ref [11]) pointed to the G helix as part of the interaction interface in addition to the activation loop and part of the N-lobe. We have now modified the sentence above to more clearly describe which parts of the kinase domain are inaccessible in the crystal and the possible ramifications of the steric environment on PHTH domain mobility in the crystal (see pg. 10). That said, all of our previous HDX data shows little protection in the PHTH domain in full-length BTK (mapping of the PHTH/kinase interaction was only possible in trans using excess PHTH domain) and so our data can be best summarized by concluding that the PHTH domain visits a number of conformational states and makes transient contacts with various regions of the kinase domain (dependent upon whether the SH3-SH2 region is engaged or not). This is similar to the ‘fuzzy’ intramolecular contacts described for the N-terminal region of the SRC family. Like the SRC family, BTK (and other TEC kinases) contain a long disordered linker between the N-terminal region and the compact SH3-SH2-kinase core.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. For the novel active state dimer of the Kinase Domain it would be great to see some functional validation of the dimerization interface. It is structurally certainly quite suggestive, but without such experiments the functional significance is unclear. If appropriate mutations have been published previously a citation would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree. We scoured the literature and our own facuntional assay results over many years but the appropriate mutations to test the functional significance of the kinase domain dimer have not been reported or previously studied in our lab. We are therefore actively pursuing this line of investigation now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have the following proposed experiments/analysis that should help.</p><p>1. To better validate the putative PH-kinase interface seen, the authors should try some alphafold multimer / rosettaTTFold modelling of just the PHTH module with the kinase domain. The advantage of this is that it will test how conserved over evolution the potential interface is, and will help to decipher discrepancies between the two structures. This may end up being similar to what is seen in Akt (in this case the alphafold prediction does not match the allosteric inhibitor structure, or the nanobody bound structure), but this could help provide additional insight into how the PH domain interacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have applied alphafold to this system. The PHTH-kinase fusion sequence was fed to Alphafold and the separate PHTH and kinase domains to Aphafold multimer. The results provide a range of ‘complexes’ none of which recapitulate the PHTH/kinase interface reported here or that reported by Wang et al in previous work. Three of five results from Alphafold Multimer place the PHTH domain on the activation loop face of the kinase domain consistent with the previous solution data pointing to a similar regulatory interface. This is interesting but our experience in applying alphafold to dynamic confromationally heterogeneous systems is that the results need to be considered with caution. For that reason we did not include any of the alphafold predictions in the manuscript.</p><p>Evolutionary conservation is discussed further in the next section:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Could the authors provide a detailed evolutionarily analysis of the binding surface between the PHTH and kinase domains and include this in Fig5, this also would help interpret the likelihood of this interface.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question and we have in fact previously published a detailed evolutionary analysis of the BTK kinase domain in collaboration with Kannan Natarajan (see Amatya et al., PNAS, 2019, [ref 11]). In that work we found that evolutionarily conserved residues on the kinase domain map to the activation loop face, supporting the solution data that the PHTH interacts with the kinase domain across the activation loop face. That work predated alphafold but it is interesting that, to the exent that alphafold predicts anything, it seems to converge on the PHTH domain containg the activation loop face.</p><p>In the context of our current work, and this question from the reviewer, we re-examined the evolutionary anlysis carried out previously and find that BTK (or TEC family) specific residues on the kinase domain do not appear at the newly identified PHTH/kinase interface we report here. We could speculate that since the ‘back’ of the kinase domain N-lobe interacts with multiple binding partners (SH3, SH2-linker and PHTH) evolutionary pressures may have resulted in a certain degree of plasticity to allow recognition of multiple binding partners.</p><p>Evolutionary analysis of the BTK PH domain was also carried out previously and shows that the conserved sites map to the phospholipid binding pocket of the PH domain. The analysis did not include TH domain residues. Since we find the TH domain contributes to the PHTH/kinase interface in our crystal structure, we do not have the data at this time to do a thourough anaylsis but we appreciate this comment and can address this in furture work with collaborators.</p></body></sub-article></article>
