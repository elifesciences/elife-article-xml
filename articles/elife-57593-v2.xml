Here, we provide mechanistic insight into ciliary ubiquitin processing in cells and for mouse model lacking the ciliary protein Mks1. In vivo loss of Mks1 sensitises cells to proteasomal disruption, leading to abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. We identified UBE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that polyubiquitinates β-catenin, and RNF34, an E3 ligase, as novel interactants of MKS1. UBE2E1 and MKS1 colocalised, and loss of UBE2E1 recapitulates the ciliary and Wnt signalling phenotypes observed during loss of MKS1. Levels of UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-dependent and UBE2E1 mediates both regulatory and degradative ubiquitination of MKS1. We demonstrate that processing of phosphorylated β-catenin occurs at the ciliary base through the functional interaction between UBE2E1 and MKS1. These observations suggest that correct β-catenin levels are tightly regulated at the primary cilium by a ciliary-specific E2 (UBE2E1) and a regulatory substrate-adaptor (MKS1).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MKS1</kwd><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>Wnt signalling</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd><kwd>UBE2E1</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M000532/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Colin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Community's Seventh Framework Programme FP7/2009 Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>241955 SYSCILIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Colin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204378/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wheway</surname><given-names>Gabrielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105615/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szymanska</surname><given-names>Katarzyna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interacting MKS1 and UBE2E1 regulate canonical Wnt signaling through modulation of beta-catenin levels at the base of primary cilium, providing new insights into ciliopathy disease mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that sense and transduce extracellular signals on many mammalian cells. The cilium has essential roles throughout development during mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Praetorius and Spring, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nauli et al., 2003</xref>), in transduction of multiple signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huangfu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>) and in the establishment of left-right asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>). Primary cilia have a complex ultrastructure with compartmentalisation of molecular components that together form functional modules. Mutations in proteins that are structural or functional components of the primary cilium cause a group of human inherited developmental conditions known as ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2008</xref>). Examples of ciliopathies include Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) and Joubert syndrome (JBTS). Many proteins that are mutated in ciliopathies, including the MKS1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szymanska and Johnson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>), localise to the transition zone (TZ), a compartment of the proximal region of the cilium. Mutations in the <italic>MKS1</italic> gene cause about 15% of MKS, a lethal neurodevelopmental condition that is the most severe ciliopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaddour et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The MKS1 protein contains a B9/C2 domain with homologies to the C2 (calcium/lipid-binding) domain of the synaptotagmin-like and phospholipase families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kyttälä et al., 2006</xref>). MKS1 interacts with TMEM67, the transmembrane receptor encoded by the <italic>TMEM67</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawe et al., 2007</xref>), and two other B9/C2-domain containing proteins, B9D1 and B9D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). B9D1, B9D2, and MKS1 are predicted to bind lipids in the ciliary membrane, and all three have been shown to localise at the ciliary TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bialas et al., 2009</xref>) forming components of a functional module (known as the ‘MKS-JBTS module’). This module contains other transmembrane proteins (TMEMs), namely the Tectonic proteins (TCTN1-3), TMEM17, TMEM67, TMEM231, and TMEM237, as well as other C2-domain proteins (jouberin, RPGRIP1L, and CC2D2A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Gonzalo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). TZ proteins are thought to form a diffusion barrier at the base of the cilium that restricts entrance and exit of both membrane and soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2012</xref>). The compartmentalisation of the cilium is essential for the regulated translocation of signalling intermediates, most notably during Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chih et al., 2011</xref>), and mutations of TZ components invariably cause Shh signalling defects during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weatherbee et al., 2009</xref>). For example, mouse embryos from the <italic>Mks1<sup>Krc</sup></italic> knock-out mutant line have severe Shh signalling and left-right patterning defects during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weatherbee et al., 2009</xref>). Previously, we have described the <italic>Mks1</italic> knock-out mouse line, for which mutant embryos have deregulated, increased canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling and increased proliferation defects in the cerebellar vermis and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wheway et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Other studies have shown that the ciliary apparatus restricts the activity of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lancaster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simons et al., 2005</xref>), although the mechanistic detail by which signal transduction is regulated remains unclear. One regulatory pathway involves the ciliary TZ protein jouberin (also known as AHI1), which shuttles β-catenin between the cytosol and nucleus in order to regulate Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lancaster et al., 2011</xref>). However, ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the best-characterised mechanism for regulating canonical Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aberle et al., 1997</xref>). In the absence of a Wnt signal, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated in a complex of proteins (referred to as the destruction complex) that include axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ikeda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Munemitsu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rubinfeld et al., 1996</xref>). Subsequent ubiquitination of β-catenin leads to its degradation by the proteasome, meaning that in the absence of Wnt signalling the steady state levels of cytoplasmic β-catenin are low. Part of this regulation appears to be mediated by a functional association of the ciliary apparatus with the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>), and UPS components have been shown to interact with ciliopathy proteins (e.g. USP9X and lebercilin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">den Hollander et al., 2007</xref>). RPGRIP1L (a ciliary TZ protein mutated in a range of ciliopathies including MKS and JBTS) has been reported to interact with the proteasome proteins, PSMD3 and PSMD5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerhardt et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, discrete localisation of ubiquitin has been observed at the ciliary base suggesting that UPS processing can be constrained and regulated by the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerhardt et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanistic basis to substantiate the association between the UPS and ciliary apparatus remains unclear and, in particular, it is unknown if the pathomechanism of Wnt signalling defects in ciliopathies depends on defective regulation of β-catenin localisation and processing by ciliary proteins.</p><p>Here, we describe the interaction and functional association of MKS1 with ciliary UPS components, specifically the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2E1 (also known as UbcH6) and the E3 ubiquitin ligating enzyme RNF34. In addition to ciliogenesis defects, loss of MKS1 causes deregulation of both proteasome activity and canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling. These cellular phenotypes are also observed after loss of UBE2E1. MKS1 and UBE2E1 colocalise during conditions of cilia resorption, and levels of MKS1 and UBE2E1 are co-dependent. We show that in the absence of MKS1, levels of ubiquitinated proteins, including β-catenin, are increased. Furthermore, polyubiquitination of MKS1 is dependent on both UBE2E1 and RNF34, and lysine (Lys)63-linked polyubiquitination of MKS1 is dependent on UBE2E1. This suggests that regulation of intracellular signalling, specifically canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling, can be regulated and constrained at the primary cilium by a ciliary-specific E2 and MKS1, a substrate-adaptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mks1 mutation causes deregulation of proteasome activity</title><p>Loss of ciliary basal body proteins perturbs both UPS function and Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>), and we have previously reported de-regulated increases of canonical Wnt signalling in <italic>Mks1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wheway et al., 2013</xref>). To investigate the mechanistic basis for regulation of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling and possible UPS processing of β-catenin by a ciliary protein, we first characterised these processes in cells and tissues lacking functional MKS1. We derived immortalised dermal fibroblasts from a human MKS patient, carrying compound heterozygous <italic>MKS1</italic> mutations [c.472C &gt; T]+[IVS15-7_35del29] causing the predicted nonsense and splice-site null mutations [p.R158*]+[p.P470<italic>fs</italic>*562] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaddour et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) leading to loss of MKS1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b-c</xref>). <italic>MKS1</italic>-mutated fibroblasts had decreased cilia incidence and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), and de-regulated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). <italic>MKS1</italic>-mutated fibroblasts had moderately increased levels of total β-catenin and the Wnt downstream target cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Treatment with the non-specific proteasome inhibitor MG-132 also increased levels of phosphorylated β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Since β-catenin is phosphorylated to mark it for processing by the 26 S proteasome, we also tested if proteasome enzymatic activity was affected in <italic>MKS1</italic>-mutated fibroblasts. We observed increased proteasome activity, which was inhibited by treatment with lactacystin that targets the 20 S catalytic core of the proteasome, as well as moderate increased levels of the proteasome subunit α7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

Furthermore, expression of exogenous UBE2E1 led to moderate decreases in MKS1 levels for both shScr and sh<italic>Ube2e1</italic> knock-down cells, suggesting that UBE2E1 inhibits both MKS1 levels and polyubiquitination of this protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>MKS1 is ubiquitinated and its ubiquitynation depends on UBE2E1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) shScr and sh<italic>Ube2e1</italic> mIMCD3 knockdown cells transiently transfected with cmyc-MKS1 and/or FLAG-cmyc-UBE2E1 under different conditions of ciliogenesis: proliferating cells grown in media containing serum (+); ciliated cells grown in the absence of serum (-); and cells undergoing ciliary resorption grown in the absence of serum followed by 2 hr incubation in media with serum (-/+).

Total polyubiquitinated proteins from cell extracts were pulled-down using TUBEs bound to agarose beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blotting using an anti-cmyc antibody. TUBE assays confirmed that MKS1 was polyubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, upper panel). Treatment of pull-downs with either a pan-specific deubiquitinase (DUB) and a DUB specific for K63-linked polyubiquitination confirmed that MKS1 polyubiquitination occurred through both K63 and other ubiquitin lysine linkages such as K48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, lower panel). Importantly, these results suggest that ubiquitination of MKS1 has dual functions in targeting this protein for degradation, as well as other regulatory functions through K63. Although UBE2E1 could be an E2 in an MKS1 degradation pathway, our data suggests that loss of UBE2E1 caused an increase in the levels of polyubiquitinated MKS1 consistent with an inhibitory function for UBE2E1 in ubiquitinating MKS1. To test this alternative hypothesis, we therefore performed in vitro ubiquitination assays in which purified MKS1 was used as a substrate of the reaction, purified UBE2E1 was the E2 and RNF34 was a possible cognate E3. We observed that UBE2E1 underwent auto-ubiquitination and that ubiquitination was enhanced but not dependent on RNF34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). MKS1 inhibited UBE2E1 ubiquitination, suggesting that this could be the basis for the co-dependent regulation of protein levels. This action was attenuated by addition of β-catenin, but β-catenin by itself did not inhibit UBE2E1 ubiquitination. However, poly-ubiquitination of β-catenin appeared to be dependent on MKS1, suggesting that UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-regulators of β-catenin ubiquitination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MKS1 and UBE2E1 interact to regulate Β-catenin ubiquitination</title><p>Monoubiquitination by UBE2E1 has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schumacher et al., 2013</xref>) and UBE2E1 has also been shown to be an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme required for β-catenin polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chitalia et al., 2008</xref>). These studies suggest that UBE2E1 has dual functions as an E2 in regulating protein function (for example, through monoubiquitination of MKS1) or targeting them for degradation (for example, polyubiquitination of β-catenin). We therefore asked the question if the co-dependent regulation of MKS1 and UBE2E1 could regulate cellular β-catenin levels. We first confirmed that MKS1 and β-catenin interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>) and that sh<italic>Ube2e1</italic> knock-down cells have increased levels of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), consistent with the up-regulated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling that we observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Consistent with the mutual inhibition of MKS1 and UBE2E1, TUBE pull-down assays confirmed that levels of polyubiquitinated β-catenin increased following <italic>MKS1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). As expected, levels of polyubiquitinated β-catenin further increased in the presence of the catalytically-inactive dominant negative (DN) form of UBE2E1 compared to wild-type (WT) UBE2E1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). We also observed increased levels of phosphorylated β-catenin following loss of MKS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>) but no effect on γ-tubulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>) and no consistent effect on levels of non-phosphorylated (active) β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b-c</xref>). Specific localisation of phosphorylated β-catenin at the base of cilia increased following MKS1 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), suggesting that this is the cellular location where the phosphorylated form of β-catenin is processed by UBE2E1 for polyubiquitination. We reasoned that, in steady state conditions, UBE2E1 could mediate correct polyubiquitination levels of β-catenin, followed by subsequent targeted degradation, maintaining regulated levels of canonical Wnt signalling. In the event of high levels of the E2, caused by absence of the regulator MKS1, β-catenin is over-polyubiquitated and its levels increase leading to dysregulation of canonical Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). These observations indicate that correct β-catenin levels are tightly regulated at the primary cilium by a ciliary-specific E2 (UBE2E1) and a regulatory substrate-adaptor (MKS1).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>MKS1 and UBE2E1 interact to regulate β-catenin ubiquitination.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Immunoblot showing increased co-immunoprecipitation of β-catenin by anti-MKS1 in sh<italic>Ube2e1</italic> knockdown cells compared to shScr control cells.

Protein levels of MKS1 (pink) and UBE2E1 (light brown) are co-dependant through regulation at the base of the cilium. MKS1 localises to the TZ (dashed pink lines) and is mono-/bi-ubiquitinated by a complex that includes UBE2E1 and RNF34 (blue). MKS1 and UBE2E1 regulate each other, what has an effect on downstream UBE2E1 role in regulation of polyubiquitination of β-catenin (yellow). The correct regulation between these proteins facilitates normal proteasomal function and canonical Wnt signalling (small pink arrow). Both processes are de-regulated following MKS1 mutation of loss (red cross), causing aberrant accumulation of UBE2E1 and polyubiquitinated β-catenin and disrupted tethering to the ciliary apparatus.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig7sdata1"><label>Figure 7—source data 1.</label><caption><title>MKS1 and UBE2E1 interact to regulate β-catenin ubiquitination: full western blots.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57593-fig7-data1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57593-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A number of studies suggest that the primary cilium or basal body constrains canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lancaster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simons et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelhamed et al., 2019</xref>), and de-regulated, increased signalling is one of the hallmarks of the ciliopathy disease state. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling is aberrantly up-regulated in several ciliopathy animal models, and, in particular, in postnatal cystic kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lancaster et al., 2009</xref>). We have shown previously that homozygous <italic>Mks1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryos also have up-regulated canonical Wnt signalling, reduced numbers of primary cilia and increased proliferation in the cerebellar vermis and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wheway et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanistic detail of Wnt signalling de-regulation in ciliopathies remains unclear and controversial. A key question remains whether this ciliary signalling defect is a secondary consequence of cilia loss, or if it is directly and causally related to the loss of function of specific cilium proteins. Several studies support the latter hypothesis, including one study that suggests that jouberin, a component of the TZ/basal body, may modulate Wnt/β-catenin signalling by facilitating nuclear translocation of β-catenin in response to Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lancaster et al., 2009</xref>). Regulation of Wnt signalling appears to be also mediated by a functional association of the basal body with the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>), through which signalling pathway components such as β-catenin are degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aberle et al., 1997</xref>). Early studies showed that the basal body and the proteasome can colocalise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fabunmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wigley et al., 1999</xref>) and normal, regulated Wnt signalling has been shown to be dependent on the interaction of the basal body protein BBS4 with RPN10, a component of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerdes et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Rpgrip1l</italic><sup>-/-</sup> knock-out mice have decreased proteasome activity, and a component of the proteasome (Psmd2), was shown to interact with Rpgrip1l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerhardt et al., 2015</xref>). Loss of RPGRIP1L does not alter the amount of MKS1 at the ciliary transition zone of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiegering et al., 2018</xref>), but one explanation for the higher proteasome activity that we observe is that MKS1 deficiency results in an increased levels of RPGRIP1L. Our results suggest that loss or mutation of MKS1 had no consistent effect on RPGRIP1L levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>), although UBE2E1 regulation of the levels of other ciliary proteins is a mechanism that warrants further investigation. Furthermore, a number of other UPS proteins have been implicated in ciliopathies including TOPORS, an E3 ligase located at the basal body and cilium that is mutated in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakarova et al., 2007</xref>), and TRIM32, an E3 mutated in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiang et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, TRIM32 has been shown to interact with UBE2E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Napolitano et al., 2011</xref>). UPS components have also been shown to interact with ciliopathy proteins, such as USP9X with lebercilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">den Hollander et al., 2007</xref>), and the UPS was an enriched biological module that we identified in a whole genome siRNA screen of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wheway et al., 2015</xref>). These observations therefore support a specific role for MKS1 in UPS-mediated proteostasis and signalling regulation.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that loss of MKS1 causes aberrant accumulation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and aberrantly increased proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). The increase in proteasomal activity may be a non-specific response to cellular stress in the absence of MKS1, but our discovery and validation of direct interactions of MKS1 with two proteins (UBE2E1 and RNF34) in the ubiquitination cascade suggest that loss of MKS1 causes a more specific defect. We confirmed biochemical and functional interactions of MKS1 with both UBE2E1 and RNF34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as their co-localisation with the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Loss or dominant negative expression of UBE2E1 mimicked the cellular phenotype of <italic>MKS1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d and g–h</xref>), suggesting a functional interaction between MKS1 and UBE2E1 at the cilium. Using western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) we substantiated an inverse correlation between MKS1 and UBE2E1 protein levels in the cell, and using in vitro ubiquitination assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>) we show that this is due (at least in part) to ubiquitination of MKS1 by UBBE2E1. We suggest that this interaction between MKS1 and UBE2E1 plays a role in regulating Wnt signalling at the base of the primary cilium. In support of this, we demonstrated a functional interaction between UBE2E1, MKS1 and β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>) and that phosphorylated β-catenin localised at the base of the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>), presumably prior to UPS processing. However, alternative interpretations of our data are that UBE2E1 could occupy an E2 binding position on MKS1 preventing MKS1 degradation, or that MKS1 binds to UBE2E1 to facilitate UBE2E1 ubiquitination and degradation.</p><p>Our data indicates that MKS1 acts as a novel substrate-adaptor that interacts with UPS components and β-catenin, thereby regulating levels of β-catenin through normal degradation during Wnt signalling. MKS1 could mediate the degradation of β-catenin by controlling the stability and the localisation of UBE2E1 at the ciliary apparatus, and perhaps ensuring the correct processing of ubiquitinated β-catenin through close proximity to the proteasome at the ciliary base. This suggestion is supported by the biochemical interaction of another ciliopathy protein, Rpgrip1l, with proteasome proteins and the discrete localisation of ubiquitin at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerhardt et al., 2015</xref>). Catalytically active UBE2E1 regulated ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and d</xref>), which implies that UBE2E1-mediated ubiquitination of substrates such as MKS1 and β-catenin is required for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, we show for the first time, that MKS1 is polyubiquitinated with non-degradative K63-linked chains, which have been shown to have scaffolding roles in other cell signalling networks by bridging together large signalling complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu and Sun, 2016</xref>). Since MKS1 contains a predicted lipid-binding B9/C2 domain, MKS1 may therefore act as a membrane anchor to ensure the spatial organisation and co-ordinated regulation of both the β-catenin destruction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbit et al., 2008</xref>) and UPS components at the ciliary apparatus. Loss of MKS1 would lead to the disruption of both the structure and function of the ciliary transition zone, preventing regulated ciliary signalling and β-catenin degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). In summary, our results indicate that the MKS1-UBE2E1 complex plays a key role in the degradation of β-catenin, which in turn facilitates correct cell function and signalling. Our data provide a mechanistic explanation for Wnt signalling defects in ciliopathies and highlights new potential targets in the UPS for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6;129P2-Mks1<sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EM:05429</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_EM:05429">IMSR_EM:05429</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Tg(<italic>ACTB-Ub*<sup>G76V</sup>/GFP</italic>)1<sup>Dant/J</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory, Maine, USA</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">008111</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:008111">IMSR_JAX:008111</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">mIMCD3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-2123</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0429">CVCL_0429</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">hTERT-RPE1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-4000</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_4388">CVCL_4388</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ARPE-19</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-2302</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0145">CVCL_0145</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACS-4500</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_4V93">CVCL_4V93</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MKS-562 fibroblasts</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khaddour et al., 2007</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">MKS1 compound heterozygote mutations</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pCMV-cmyc-MKS1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dawe et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">full-length cDNA (NM_017777);

This paper addresses an important question in the field as to why ciliary dysfunction causes increased canonical Wnt signaling. The data convincing shows that the loss of MKS1 elevates canonical Wnt signaling. They then identify the E2 ligase Ube2e1 as an Mks1 binding protein by yeast two-hybrid and explore the role of Ube2e1 and Mks1 in regulating β catenin levels. The supporting data has significant problems that will need to be addressed before publication. First, many of the conclusions depend on small differences in band intensity. These differences are often not quantitated or if they are quantitated, it is not clear that the experiments were performed more than once. Statistical analysis also needs to be improved. Many experiments lack statistical tests; others use t-tests to compare multiple variables without any correction for multiple analysis. Secondly, as described below, the quality of several experiments needs to be improved if they are to be used to support the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Data analysis is lacking. A number of figures lack quantitative analysis. Most lack details about the statistical analysis performed. It is not clear what &quot;#&quot; means in the graphs. It appears that a simple t-test were used for multiple comparisons without correction. Figure legends need to indicate the n of the experiment and the statistical test used.</p><p>2. Why would increased proteasomal activity (Figure 1C) cause GFP to accumulate in the UbG76V line? It seems that increased proteasomal activity would decrease (or not change) GFP accumulation.</p><p>3. GST pulldown in Figure 2D is not convincing. The background in the control lane is darker than the experimental lane and could obscure a band of the intensity seen in the GST-UBE2E1 pulldown.</p><p>4. Figure 3b: There is little or no difference between the &quot;no colocalization&quot; and &quot;colocalization&quot; images. There may be a quantitative difference in the centrosomal staining seen in the panels in 3a but this would need to be measured.</p><p>5. Figure 5c. Western blots need to be added. Why is the level of nuclear Ube2e1 relevant to the work?</p><p>6. The conclusion that increased expression of UBE2E1 decreases MKS1 levels (5d) is not convincing.</p><p>7. The details of what was done in Figure 6b are lacking but a number of points are confusing. Why doesn't the band marked &quot;MKS1cmyc-Ub&quot;show up in the Ub western blot? Would we expect all ubiquitinated proteins to be detected in the Ub blot? If so, then this blot is not evidence of K63 polyubiquitination of the MKS1. The differences between the lanes in the c-myc blot are not convincing. I would expected the DUBs to reduce the extent of polyubiquitination, which should have brought the smears of poly-Ub-MKS1cmyc down the gel, but this is not seen.</p><p>8. Figure 6c is problematic. First, both MKS1-GST and Ub-GST are used and a GST western blot is used as evidence of Ub ligation onto MKS1. Ub needs a different tag from its substrate to be convincing. Second, the patterns of the proteins in the blots do not match the guide at the top. Rnf34-His is found in lanes where it was not added. UbE2E1-Flag is only seen in the one of the lanes where it is supposed to be present. This seems to be an unduly complicated figure with UbE2E1-Flag and UbE2E1-His showing different results. There is no explanation of this in the figure legend or text.</p><p>9. Figure 6e is too low quality to be interpreted.</p><p>10. The staining of the neuroepithelium (S2) with the anti-acetylated tubulin antibody shows decreased cytoplasmic staining and no evidence of ciliary label. Better cilia markers, higher magnification and quantification are needed to make this point. This is also a problem in S1D where the MKS mutant cells have strong cytoplasmic label. It is unclear what the arrow is pointing at, but there is no evidence that it is a cilium.</p><p>11. It was published that phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) is degraded by the proteasome at the base of cilia (Corbit et al., 2008; Gerhardt et al., 2015). Szymanska et al., showed that the amount of phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) is increased by MKS1 deficiency, although proteasome activity is enhanced in MKS1 mutant cells. How can this discrepancy be explained? The authors did not provide a sufficient explanation. An explanation could be that MKS1 affects Wnt signaling and proteasome activity in two different ways. But this needs to be shown. As they mentioned in the discussion, another transition zone protein, RPGRIP1L, positively regulates proteasome activity (Gerhardt et al., 2015). Previously, it was shown that the loss of RPGRIP1L does not alter the amount of MKS1 at the ciliary transition zone of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Wiegering et al., 2018) but maybe MKS1 deficiency results in an increased amount of RPGRIP1L at the transition zone of human and mouse fibroblasts leading to the higher proteasome activity the authors observed. Or mutations in MKS1 change the ciliary amount of BBS4 and/or OFD1 which also govern proteasome activity (Liu et al., 2014).</p><p>12. Furthermore, some examinations should be performed in another way to allow a more precise interpretation. For example, the authors quantified phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) and β-catenin. In MKS1 deficient cells, the amount of both proteins is higher. In my opinion, an important control measurement is missing. The authors should additionally measure the amount of non-phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41). Since Szymanska et al., suggest that MKS1 and UBE2E1 colocalize at the ciliary base, they should also measure the amount of hosphor-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) not only by Western blotting (overall cellular amount) but also at the ciliary base by fluorescence intensity measurements in MKS1 deficient human or mouse fibroblasts. This kind of measurement was performed in hTERT-RPE1 cells which were treated with siRNA against MKS1 (Figure 6f) but in these cells the amount of γ-tubulin seems to be increased. Maybe, the increased amount of hosphor-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) is caused by the higher amount of γ-tubulin. It cannot be excluded that several cilia overlap because this image lacks ciliary axoneme staining. In regard to the colocalization of MKS1 and UBE2E1, the authors should perform an analysis such as FRET or in situ PLA which confirms that both proteins localize close enough together to interact at the ciliary base.</p><p>13. The proteasome activity assay uses the 20S fluorophore substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC to measure activity. The general view is that the proteasome degrades this substrate independently of ubiquitination (Gan et al., 2019). Despite of this, Szymanska et al., observe an enhanced proteasome activity in cells deficient for UBE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme. This data should be carefully controlled in order to test whether the proteasome activity assay results are reliable. It would be helpful to check whether proteasome activity assays in which other substrates are used that are degraded by the proteasome without ubiquitination provide the same results. If this is the case, UBE2E1 may indirectly regulate proteasome activity by taking part in the ubiquitination of a protein that regulates proteasome activity.</p><p>14. In human there are approximately 40 E2 enzymes, therefore each E2 is likely to act with multiple E3s (there are over a 1000) with E3s likely to be the main driver of target specificity. Authors have not controlled their experiments, or at least have not showed it in the manuscript, with any other E2s. Consequently, there is a real risk that the findings simply confirm that cilia and MKS1 are regulated by UPS rather than that UBE2E1 is a specific regulator in this system.</p><p>15. With regard to immunoprecipitations and ubiquitination assays. Firstly inputs (for each analyzed protein in each sample) and/or loading controls are not always shown (e.g. Figure 2) which makes interpretation of results difficult.</p><p>16. Details are lacking about the conditions of the IP experiments used to detect ubiquitinated proteins (6b,d,e). If these were performed under native conditions, the ubiquitin being detected by western blot could be on any protein that complexes with the target of the precipitation. E2 ligases may have a large number of interactors.</p><p>17. As far as the UBE2E1 knockdown model. In the MS analysis in Figure 3, I am quite surprised that there is still such a strong recovery of UBE2E1 peptides from UBE2E1 silenced line. Is this not an impediment to this model? Does this not suggest that this cell line still has sufficient, functioning UBE2E1? Also again, it is hard to estimate if the MKS1 specific observations would not be replicated by silencing other E2s.</p><p>18. Lack of inputs in Figure 6a,b,d and e make interpretation of the critical claims from this manuscript difficult. If there is an effect of UBE2E1 on MKS1 total protein levels inputs of UBE2E1, MKS1 and loading controls for all samples in 6a 6b and 6d should clarify this. Currently, the only demonstration of the claimed protein increase is in Figure 5d and it is not repeated 3 times to allow for statistical analysis. Furthermore, it looks very marginal (numbers are not greatly affected either 113-107-96 with appreciation that WB is not really a quantitative technique) and unlikely to be significant. It is possible that even if direct, changes caused by UBE2E1 to MKS1and vice versa are completely irrespective of protein levels or stability and affect localization and function through chains other than K48.</p><p>19. Authors should clarify statements regarding degradation and UBE2E1 dual function, as alternative explanations have not been ruled out. UBE2E1 action on MKS1 could be indirect. The increase in b-catenin levels in Figure 6d is very hard to interpret without loading controls.</p><p>20. There are multiple alternative explanations for the observations presented in this manuscript, which renders figure 7 a bit uncertain. For example, UBE2E1 could be involved in ubiquitination of an MKS1 targeting E3 or DUB and that could be the reason for the observed changes. It would be more forthcoming to highlight this in the manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>Corbit, K., Shyer, A., Dowdle, W., Gaulden, J., Singla, V., Chen, M., Chuang, P., Reiter, J., 2008.

Although this procedure was detailed in the Methods and Materials section, we now make this clear in the main text and figure legends, in order to aid interpretation of our observation that loss of Mks1 caused abnormal accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Since we also observed a concomitant increase in proteasome activity, we interpret this increase as a response to facilitate the degradation of abnormal amounts of polyubiquitinated proteins.

We have attempted to calculate co-localization values between the red (UBE2E1) and green (MKS1) channels (using z-stacks of these channels), but this has been difficult to compare between biological replicates for the two cell-lines because of the variable staining pattern of UBE2E1 in nuclei. We therefore feel that a simple scoring based on presence or absence of UBE2E1 at basal bodies is the most representative of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 5c.

The details of what was done in Figure 6b are lacking but a number of points are confusing. Why doesn't the band marked &quot;MKS1cmyc-Ub&quot;show up in the Ub western blot?</p></disp-quote><p>The details of methodology for the assay shown in Figure 6b are now included in the Materials and Methods and in the figure legend. In response the second point, the pull-downs bring down all ubiquitinated proteins (the agarose beads are cross-linked to four separate ubiquitin-binding domains) which will be detected by the anti-ubiquitin antibody. Consequently, the specific “MKS1cmyc-Ub” band will be lost in the smear of all ubiquitinated proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would we expect all ubiquitinated proteins to be detected in the Ub blot? If so, then this blot is not evidence of K63 polyubiquitination of the MKS1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that all ubiquitinated proteins will be detected in the Ub blot, but this blot is included (in the bottom panel of Figure 6b) as an essential control to show that the K63-specific de-ubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) is active and that the TUBE assay has worked. The top panel of Figure 6b with the anti-cmyc blot shows decreased levels of MKS1 after K63-DUB treatment in comparison to TBST (100 and 149 vs 80 and 121 AUs), suggesting that MKS1-cmyc is at least partially polyubiquitinated with K63 ubiquitin chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences between the lanes in the c-myc blot are not convincing. I would expected the DUBs to reduce the extent of polyubiquitination, which should have brought the smears of poly-Ub-MKS1cmyc down the gel, but this is not seen.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include normalised band intensities for polyUb-cmycMKS1 under the blots in the top panel of Figure 6b, which shows modest yet consistent decreases in polyubiquitination after DUB and K63DUB treatments, for multiple biological replicates of this experiment. However, we agree that de-ubiquitination was not efficient, even following the manufacturer’s protocol, meaning that quantitation between replicates has been problematic. We therefore provide data in Figure 6b as representative of this set of experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 6c is problematic. First, both MKS1-GST and Ub-GST are used and a GST western blot is used as evidence of Ub ligation onto MKS1. Ub needs a different tag from its substrate to be convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this important point, and have gone to considerable efforts to repeat the entire experiment using untagged Ub and His-tagged MKS1 (now displayed in new Figure 6c). This new data shows both mono-ubiquitination of MKS1 and poly-ubiquitination of β-catenin that is dependent on MKS1. (The old data is also shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1a since it is consistent with these conclusions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the patterns of the proteins in the blots do not match the guide at the top. Rnf34-His is found in lanes where it was not added.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this error in labelling the lanes and have corrected the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>UbE2E1-Flag is only seen in the one of the lanes where it is supposed to be present.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the input UBE2E1 with a His-tagged protein, and the UBE2E1-FLAG data is included in Figure 6—figure supplement 1a (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This seems to be an unduly complicated figure with UbE2E1-Flag and UbE2E1-His showing different results. There is no explanation of this in the figure legend or text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated and simplified the presentation of this entire set of assays (now shown in Figure 6c, with the previous data shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1a). Figure 6c demonstrates that UBE2E1 undergoes auto-ubiquitination and that ubiquitination is enhanced but not dependent on RNF34. MKS1 inhibits UBE2E1 ubiquitination, suggesting that this could be the basis for the co-dependency of protein levels (data shown in Figure 5c-d). This action is attenuated by addition of β-catenin, but β-catenin by itself does not inhibit UBE2E1 ubiquitination, suggesting that UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-regulators of β-catenin ubiquitination (also see below, point 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 6e is too low quality to be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment has been repeated and is now shown in Figure 7b. Consistently for all replicates, we observe an increase of polyubiquitinated β-catenin following loss of MKS1 and over-expression of active (wild-type; WT) UBE2E1. This suggests that when MKS1 and active UBE2E1 are present, normal poly-ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin is taking place. Upon loss of MKS1, this process is disrupted leading to abnormally high levels of highly polyubiquitinated β-catenin. Poly-ubiquitination of β-catenin is much reduced in the presence of inactive (dominant negative; DN) UBE2E1, again suggesting that UBE2E1 and MKS1 are co-regulators of β-catenin ubiquitination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The staining of the neuroepithelium (S2) with the anti-acetylated tubulin antibody shows decreased cytoplasmic staining and no evidence of ciliary label. Better cilia markers, higher magnification and quantification are needed to make this point. This is also a problem in S1D where the MKS mutant cells have strong cytoplasmic label. It is unclear what the arrow is pointing at, but there is no evidence that it is a cilium.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, in our hands, the anti-acetylated tubulin antibody gives variable results on fresh-frozen tissue sections and primary dermal fibroblasts, so we have removed this data in Suppl. Figure 2. We have retained the data showing the increase of activated β-catenin, consistent with data shown in Figure 1a-b.</p><p>This is also a problem in S1D where the MKS mutant cells have strong cytoplasmic label.</p><p>We agree, but IF staining with this label does not preclude accurate quantitation of cilia incidence and length in these cells and this does seem to be a consistent cellular phenotype in MKS1-mutated cell-lines (see Wheway et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. It was published that phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) is degraded by the proteasome at the base of cilia (Corbit et al., 2008; Gerhardt et al., 2015). Szymanska et al., showed that the amount of phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) is increased by MKS1 deficiency, although proteasome activity is enhanced in MKS1 mutant cells. How can this discrepancy be explained? The authors did not provide a sufficient explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We now make the following potential mechanism clearer in the Discussion: phospho-β-catenin after being phosphorylated needs to be ubiquitinated, probably by UBE2E1 (Chitalia et al., 2008) at the base of the cilium. Our data indicates that MKS1 is necessary to facilitate correct ubiquitination of β-catenin by UBE2E1. Due to the lack of MKS1, UBE2E1 levels increase, which increases polyubiquitination of phosphorylated β-catenin localized at the ciliary base. We observe a concomitant increase in proteasome activity, and suggest that this up-regulation is in response to increased levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, including β-catenin, but the levels appear to overload the ability of the proteasome to process them for degradation. As a consequence, there is abnormal accumulation of β-catenin at the ciliary base, where it awaits its degradation, leading to de-regulation of canonical Wnt signalling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An explanation could be that MKS1 affects Wnt signaling and proteasome activity in two different ways. But this needs to be shown. As they mentioned in the discussion, another transition zone protein, RPGRIP1L, positively regulates proteasome activity (Gerhardt et al., 2015). Previously, it was shown that the loss of RPGRIP1L does not alter the amount of MKS1 at the ciliary transition zone of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Wiegering et al., 2018) but maybe MKS1 deficiency results in an increased amount of RPGRIP1L at the transition zone of human and mouse fibroblasts leading to the higher proteasome activity the authors observed. Or mutations in MKS1 change the ciliary amount of BBS4 and/or OFD1 which also govern proteasome activity (Liu et al., 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point by using the best available commercial antibody, against RPGRIP1L, and doing a series of western blots following both MKS1 knockdown and in MKS1-mutated fibroblasts (Figure 7—figure supplement 1a-b). RPGRIP1L protein levels were indeed increased in MKS1-mutated fibroblasts compared to normal controls (HDF), but this result was not confirmed by MKS1 knockdown. We therefore conclude that the potential regulatory action of MKS1 on RPGRIP1L warrants further investigation, but is somewhat beyond the current remit and focus of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Furthermore, some examinations should be performed in another way to allow a more precise interpretation. For example, the authors quantified phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) and β-catenin. In MKS1 deficient cells, the amount of both proteins is higher. In my opinion, an important control measurement is missing. The authors should additionally measure the amount of non-phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41).</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured levels of non-phospho-β-catenin in both MKS1 knockdown and in MKS1-mutated fibroblasts (Figure 7—figure supplement 1a-b). Β-catenin protein levels were marginally increased following MKS1 knockdown but this result was not confirmed in MKS1-mutated fibroblasts. We conclude that there does not appear to be an overall effect on the levels of non-phospho-β-catenin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since Szymanska et al., suggest that MKS1 and UBE2E1 colocalize at the ciliary base, they should also measure the amount of phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) not only by Western blotting (overall cellular amount) but also at the ciliary base by fluorescence intensity measurements in MKS1 deficient human or mouse fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We present new data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1b to support the data in Figure 7c, showing an increase in phospho-β-catenin at the base cilia but no overall change in non-phospho-β-catenin levels following MKS1 knockdown. We used γ-tubulin staining to define regions-of-interest to ensure that the analyses were limited to the ciliary base; there is no perturbation of γ-tubulin levels following MKS1 knockdown (Figure 7—figure supplement 1b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This kind of measurement was performed in hTERT-RPE1 cells which were treated with siRNA against MKS1 (Figure 6f) but in these cells the amount of γ-tubulin seems to be increased.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that there is no difference in γ-tubulin levels at the ciliary base following MKS1 knockdown (Figure 7—figure supplement 1a). We have changed the field of view presented in Figure 7c to clarify the observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe, the increased amount of phospho-β-catenin (S33/S37/T41) is caused by the higher amount of γ-tubulin. It cannot be excluded that several cilia overlap because this image lacks ciliary axoneme staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a possibility, but we have never observed that <italic>MKS1</italic> knock-down or mutant cells have multiple cilia (for example, see Wheway et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In regard to the colocalization of MKS1 and UBE2E1, the authors should perform an analysis such as FRET or in situ PLA which confirms that both proteins localize close enough together to interact at the ciliary base.</p></disp-quote><p>We used multiple assays that included Y2H, GST pulldown and IP, and IF microscopy to show that MKS1 and UBE2E1 biochemically interact and co-localise. Importantly, Y2H assays indicate that there is a direct interaction between MKS1 and UBE2E1, and we therefore judge that proximity assays such as FRET and PLA would be merely confirmatory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. The proteasome activity assay uses the 20S fluorophore substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC to measure activity. The general view is that the proteasome degrades this substrate independently of ubiquitination (Gan et al., 2019). Despite of this, Szymanska et al., observe an enhanced proteasome activity in cells deficient for UBE2E1, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugation enzyme. This data should be carefully controlled in order to test whether the proteasome activity assay results are reliable. It would be helpful to check whether proteasome activity assays in which other substrates are used that are degraded by the proteasome without ubiquitination provide the same results.</p></disp-quote><p>In all relevant assays, we have used proteasome inhibitors to control for its activity. These experiments were conducted in three different cell lines (Figure 1c and d, Figure 4g) always with the control of proteasome inhibitor treatment. In addition, we have used “irrelevant control” cells (mutated for the centrosomal protein ASPM; Figure 1c), which have proteasome activity levels similar to those observed in control cells. We therefore judge that the experiments are well-controlled as presented and that they reflect a reproducible biological effect. Furthermore, in data that we present here, proteasome protein levels appear to be up-regulated, consistent with the increase in activity (see Figure 1c, Figure 7—figure supplement 1b). We therefore do not think that additional proteasome activity assays will provide additional insight above the conventional, accepted assays of activity that we already report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If this is the case, UBE2E1 may indirectly regulate proteasome activity by taking part in the ubiquitination of a protein that regulates proteasome activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a possibility, but another alternative is that loss of UBE2E1 causes dysregulation of another E2 or E2s that cause aberrant increase of polyubiquitinated proteins and hence increase in proteasome activity in degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. Discriminating between these alternatives is, we feel, beyond the focus of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. In human there are approximately 40 E2 enzymes, therefore each E2 is likely to act with multiple E3s (there are over a 1000) with E3s likely to be the main driver of target specificity. Authors have not controlled their experiments, or at least have not showed it in the manuscript, with any other E2s. Consequently, there is a real risk that the findings simply confirm that cilia and MKS1 are regulated by UPS rather than that UBE2E1 is a specific regulator in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>The specific localization and interactions of UBE2E1, and reciprocal co-regulation of MKS1 and UBE2E1, argue that UBE2E1 is a specific co-regulator. In particular, the dominant negative (DN) mutant C131S of UBE2E1 has specific and significant effects on ciliogenesis. However, we agree that <italic>degradation</italic> of MKS1 (rather than co-regulation) is likely to be mediated by another E2 (for example, Ube2l3, Ube2k, Ube2n or Ube2m; see Figure 4e-f source data 1) because polyubiquitination of MKS1 is inhibited, rather than enhanced, by UBE2E1 (see Figure 6a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15.
