functions of excitable cells, like synaptic transmission in neurons and the contraction of heart and skeletal muscles. To accomplish such diverse functions, different calcium channels activate at different voltages and with distinct kinetics. To identify the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage sensing properties, we combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukaryotic calcium channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1. Both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model; however, they greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Specifically, stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Communication in our body runs on electricity. Between the exterior and interior of every living cell, there is a difference in electrical charge, or voltage. Rapid changes in this so-called membrane potential activate vital biological processes, ranging from muscle contraction to communication between nerve cells.</p><p>Ion channels are cellular structures that maintain membrane potential and help ‘excitable’ cells like nerve and muscle cells produce electrical impulses. They are specialized proteins that form highly specific conduction pores in the cell surface. When open, these channels let charged particles (such as calcium ions) through, rapidly altering the electrical potential between the inside and outside the cell.</p><p>To ensure proper control over this process, most ion channels open in response to specific stimuli, which is known as ‘gating’. For example, voltage-gated calcium channels contain charge-sensing domains that change shape and allow the channel to open once the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold. These channels play important roles in many tissues and, when mutated, can cause severe brain or muscle disease.</p><p>Although the basic principle of voltage gating is well-known, the properties of individual voltage-gated calcium channels still vary. Different family members open at different voltage levels and at different speeds. Such fine-tuning is thought to be key to their diverse roles in various parts of the body, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here, Fernández-Quintero, El Ghaleb et al. set out to determine how this variation is achieved.</p><p>The first step was to create a dynamic computer simulation showing the detailed structure of a mammalian voltage-gated calcium channel, called Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1. The simulation was then used to predict the movements of the voltage sensing regions while the channel opened.</p><p>The computer modelling experiments showed that although the voltage sensors looked superficially similar, they acted differently. The first of the four voltage sensors of the studied calcium channel controlled opening speed. This was driven by shifts in its configuration that caused oppositely charged parts of the protein to sequentially form and break molecular bonds; a process that takes time. In contrast, the fourth sensor, which set the voltage threshold at which the channel opened, did not form these sequential bonds and accordingly reacted fast. Experimental tests in muscle cells that had been engineered to produce channels with mutations in the sensors, confirmed these results.</p><p>These findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms that shape the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels. This knowledge will help us understand better how ion channels work, both in healthy tissue and in human disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1</kwd><kwd>voltage sensing</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated calcium channel</kwd><kwd>resting state structure</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flucher</surname><given-names>Bernhard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flucher</surname><given-names>Bernhard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Campiglio</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure modeling, site-directed mutagenesis, and current recordings revealed the mechanism by which stabilization of voltage sensors in the resting and activated states determines the gating properties of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 calcium channel.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>) translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx. Thus, they contribute to cellular excitability and they couple electrical activity to fundamental cell functions like contraction of heart and skeletal muscle, secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones, and the regulation of gene expression. Together with voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>), Ca<sub>V</sub>s form a structurally related ion channel superfamily with a fourfold symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Their pore-forming α<sub>1</sub> subunits are composed of four homologous but non-identical domains (repeats I-IV), each containing six transmembrane helices (S1-S6). The S5 and S6 helices plus the connecting P loop of all four repeats form the central channel pore with the selectivity filter and the activation gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catterall et al., 2020</xref>). Helices S1-S4 of each repeat form separate voltage sensing domains (VSDs). The S4 helix contains positively charged residues (termed gating charges) in every third position, and its movement across the electric field upon membrane depolarization is thought to initiate the conformational change resulting in channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure model of the hetero-tetrameric human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain structure of eukaryotic Ca<sub>V</sub> channels.

Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enabled the determination of the structure of the voltage-gated calcium channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 at 3.6 Å resolution, displaying a closed pore and the VSDs in the activated up-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Very recently, three cryo-EM structures of homo-tetrameric sodium channels experimentally locked in resting (or VSD-down) states have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wisedchaisri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wisedchaisri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). However, up to now the resting states of eukaryotic Ca<sub>V</sub> and Na<sub>V</sub> channels remained inaccessible to experimental structure determination. Nevertheless, many years of experimental work and structure modeling provide ample support for the sliding helix model of the voltage sensor action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>). According to this model, the negative membrane potential at rest pulls the positively charged S4 helices down toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane holding the channel gate closed. The reversal of the electric field upon membrane depolarization causes the outward displacement of the S4 helix by about 10 Å. The movement of two to three positive gating charges through the hydrophobic constriction site (HCS) in the center of the VSD is facilitated by the transient formation of ion-pair interactions with negative countercharges in the other helices of the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While this model describes the principal mode of voltage sensor action, without further structure-function data, it does not explain how the four homologous but structurally distinct VSDs of eukaryotic channels cooperate in channel gating and how the unique gating properties of different channel isoforms are achieved. The distinct structure of the four VSDs of eukaryotic Na<sub>V</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub> suggests that there might be considerable variability between the four VSDs of a channel in the movement of the S4 helices and the molecular interactions of their gating charges. In fact, accumulating evidence indicates functional differences between the VSDs of individual channel isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pantazis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tuluc et al., 2016a</xref>). The rabbit skeletal muscle Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 is the first member of the Ca<sub>V</sub> family for which the structure has been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Biophysically it is characterized by slow kinetics and right-shifted voltage dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tuluc et al., 2016a</xref>). Together these attributes make Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 a prime candidate for studying how specific structural features of the VSDs determine voltage dependence and kinetics of channel activation.</p><p>Here, we applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and Markov state modeling (MSM) combined with site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological analyses to identify the molecular mechanism by which individual VSDs determine the characteristic voltage dependence and kinetics of current activation. Our structure models of the activated and resting states of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 VSDs I and IV are consistent with the sliding helix model and yielded reliable predictions of the importance of ion-pair formation between the outer gating charges and various countercharges within the particular VSD. Our data provide novel insight in how the stabilization of the VSDs in resting and/or the activated states shapes the kinetics and voltage dependence of activation, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The structure of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 reveals differences between VSDs</title><p>Based on the cryo-EM structure of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), we generated a new structural model to study the molecular mechanisms determining the specific gating properties of this voltage-gated calcium channel. To this end, we used the <italic>Rosetta</italic> computational modeling software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bender et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rohl et al., 2004</xref>) to build a homology model of the human eukaryotic Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 and included all missing loops and modeled both splice variants with and without exon 29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tuluc et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting models were equilibrated and simulated at 300 K in the membrane environment to identify favorable side-chain orientations and to relax the protein.</p><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 is a pseudo-tetrameric channel with a domain-swapped arrangement in which each VSD (S1-S4) is positioned next to the pore domain (S5-S6) of the adjacent repeat in a clockwise orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). The structures of the individual repeats closely resemble the crystal structure of Na<sub>V</sub>Ab (Cα root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] of 2.7 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>), which is regarded as phylogenetic ancestor of Ca<sub>V</sub> and Na<sub>V</sub> channels and for which considerable structural information is available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While all four VSDs of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 display the canonical voltage sensor fold, individually they differ from one another in significant aspects like the length of the helical structures and the number of gating charges in S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only VSD IV contains four gating charges (R1-R4) at the three-residue interval, like Na<sub>V</sub>Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). VSDs I and III possess an additional positive charge (K0) at the outer end of S4, and VSD II an additional gating charge (K5) at the cytoplasmic side of S4. All four VSDs are in the activated (S4-up) state in that (K0) R1, R2, and R3 are positioned above the phenylalanine (in S2) of the HCS and R4 (and K5) below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>As predicted by the sliding helix model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2017</xref>), the gating charges form ion pairs with countercharges of the extracellular negative cluster (ENC) and intracellular negative cluster (INC). The interactions of the inner gating charges with countercharges of the INC are identical in the four VSDs of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1, representing the typical arrangement of the highly conserved charge transfer center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). However, between the VSDs, the outer ion-pair interactions differ. Overall, the four VSDs of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 can be grouped into two classes – VSDs I and III, and VSDs II and IV, respectively – each with the same number and position of countercharges in the ENC. While in VSDs I and III, the gating charges form ion pairs with two glutamate residues in the S2 helix, VSDs II and IV gating charges interact with one negative countercharge each in the S2 and S3 helices. Also, in VSDs I and III, the additional outermost gating charges are lysines (K0), whereas in VSDs II and IV, the innermost gating charge is a lysine residue (K4) instead of an arginine (R4) in VSDs I and III. Note that lysine forms only a single interaction with a negative countercharge in the INC as opposed to two formed by arginine. Together these differences in the ion pairs formed by the gating charges indicate that the activated state of VSDs I and III is considerably more stabilized than that of VSDs II and IV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MD simulation and MSM of VSD I in activated and resting states</title><p>The interactions between gating charges and their ion-pair partners observed in the structure model based on available cryo-EM structures of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 merely represent a snapshot depicting the endpoint of the voltage sensing process. However, because high-resolution structures of resting states of Ca<sub>V</sub> channels are lacking, the molecular details of the steps leading up to VSD activation are still elusive. Exploiting the potential of structure modeling to fill this gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>), we applied MD simulation and MSM of individual VSDs to predict the structures, kinetics, and energy levels of resting states. To overcome the high energy barriers and the timescale limitations of MD simulations in the absence of the membrane potential, we used <italic>Umbrella</italic> sampling. This enhanced sampling technique explores the conformational transitions of a VSD as the positively charged S4 helix moves along the likely pathway toward the cytoplasmic side of the VSD, and thus create the seeding points for subsequent MD simulations. For this purpose, the obtained structures were clustered based on a geometrical RMSD criterion resulting in about 50 cluster representatives. These were simulated for 100 ns each (aggregated simulation time close to 5 µs) to obtain unbiased trajectories, which were then projected in a time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA), representing the slowest reaction coordinates. Finally, the kinetic coordinate system provided by the tICA allows calculation of thermodynamics and kinetics by an MSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Using this approach, we modeled the resting state structures of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 VSDs I and IV, because they represent the two structurally distinguishable classes of VSDs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and because they differentially regulate the specific gating properties of skeletal muscle calcium currents. VSD I determines Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1’s slow activation kinetics and VSD IV its voltage-dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nakai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tuluc et al., 2016a</xref>). The latter is regulated by alternative splicing in that exclusion of the 19 amino acids of exon 29 from the extracellular loop linking IVS3 and IVS4 causes a 30 mV left-shift of the voltage dependence of activation and a several-fold increase in current density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tuluc et al., 2009</xref>). Previously we demonstrated that the loss of voltage sensitivity upon insertion of exon 29 is caused by the relative lateral displacement of S3 and S4 and the resulting loss of ionic interactions of the outer gating charges (R1, R2) with a single countercharge (D1196) in the S3 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuluc et al., 2016b</xref>). Considering the importance of these ionic interactions in VSD IV for regulating the channel’s voltage dependence, we hypothesized that similarly the specific kinetic properties of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 may be encoded in the structure, ionic interactions, and the molecular kinetics of the state transitions of VSD I.</p><p>The free energy maps calculated for the MD simulation of VSD I, VSD IVe, and VSD IVa each comprised four energy minima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,E,I</xref>) and the corresponding structures resembled the activated and three resting states, as predicted by the sliding helix model. Across these states, the S4 helix of VSD I described a stepwise downward movement of 15.3 Å, corresponding to three helical turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In the activated state, the gating charges K0, R1, R2, and R3 were above phenylalanine (F97) of the HCS, and only R4 was below it. In the deepest resting state 1, only K0 and R1 were positioned above the HCS, while R2, R3, and R4 were located below it. In all four states, IS4 adopted a shifting stretch of 3<sub>10</sub> helical conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), so that the side chains of the gating charges all pointed toward the center of the VSD. As IS4 moved from the activated state to resting state 1, R4, R3, R2, and R1 sequentially formed ion pairs with countercharges of the INC (E100 in IS2 and D126 in IS3), which are part of the highly conserved charge transfer center of voltage-gated cation channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). In all states also the gating charges above and below the HCS formed extensive ionic bonds with negative countercharges in IS1 and IS2. In the resting states 2 and 3 and in the activated state R1, R2, and R3 formed ion bonds with E87 and E90, plus in resting state 3 and the activated state K0 formed an additional ion bond with E76 in the IS1-S2 loop. In resting states 1 and 2, gating charges R3 and R4 formed ion bonds with E49 and E54 at the cytoplasmic end of IS1. This multitude of ionic interactions stabilizes each of the consecutive states and thus strictly delineates the path of IS4 through VSD I upon channel activation and deactivation. Note that in addition to the indicated ionic bonds, the gating charges form transient hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic and polar interactions with several other putative interaction partners, all of which might contribute to the movement of S4 across the membrane electrical field, but are not subject of the present study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and kinetics of voltage sensor transitions of voltage sensing domains (VSDs) I and IV with and without exon 29.</title><p>(<bold>A,E,I</bold>) The free energy surfaces of 5.0 µs trajectories of VSD I (<bold>A</bold>), VSD IV of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e (<bold>E</bold>), and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1a including exon 29 (<bold>I</bold>) reconstructed in the time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA) coordinate space resulted in four macrostates.

The conformational transitions between the different activation states of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 VSD I occurred in the high µs to low ms timescale. Because the values calculated in our model are obtained in the absence of the force provided by changes in the electric field, the absolute transition times derived from MSM may not correspond to the actual transition times of the VSD upon physiological activation and deactivation. Nevertheless, relative differences between transition times provide meaningful information when compared between different VSDs or functionally different mutants (see below). Relying on a simple transition state theory model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Laidler and King, 1983</xref>), we generated a schematic 1D representation of the high-dimensional free energy surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), allowing an intuitive interpretation of free energy levels of the states and ΔG of the energy barriers. The free energy of the activated state was the lowest and transitions in the activating direction were two to four times faster than in the deactivating direction, consistent with the fact that our MD simulations were performed on structure models at a depolarized membrane (0 mV), which favors the activated state of the VSDs. The energy barriers (ΔG) for the three state transitions of VSD I in the activating direction were between 48 and 51 kJ/mol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MD simulation and MSM of VSD IV in activated and resting states</title><p>How do the molecular interactions during VSD activation and deactivation and the kinetics of state transition differ between VSD I and VSD IV to explain their distinct functions in determining kinetics and voltage dependence of activation, respectively? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tuluc et al., 2009</xref>) The basic structural features of the activated and resting states of VSD IV corresponded to those of VSD I, except that in VSD IV the translocation of S4 across the HCS covered a shorter distance and involved fewer ion-pair interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G,J,K</xref>). Upon the deactivating motion of the S4 helix of VSD IV, only a single gating charge (R3) fully translocated from a position above the HCS (F1161) to below it. Accordingly, the total vertical displacement in the two splice variants of IVS4 was 12.9 Å in VSD IVe and only 10.2 Å in VSD IVa, corresponding to roughly two helical turns.</p><p>In the four states of both VSD IV variants, only the two inner gating charges R3 and K4 sequentially interacted with the conserved ion-pair partners of the charge transfer center (E1164 and D1186) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). R2 moved into the HCS but did not form ion pairs with E1164 or D1186. In the deep resting states, an additional ion pair was formed between K4 and E1121 at the cytoplasmic end of IVS1. At variance with VSD I, ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges of VSD IV was completely absent in the resting states. Instead, R1 and R2 established several weaker hydrogen bonds with side chains of uncharged polar amino acids. In VSD IV ion-pair interactions of R1 and R2 with the ENC were limited to the activated state of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e splice variant. Within VSD IV they were established with a single ion-pair partner (D1196), the functional importance of which for splicing-dependent regulation of the voltage dependence of activation had been shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuluc et al., 2016b</xref>). Consistent with that study, these interactions were greatly attenuated when exon 29 was included in the IVS3-S4 linker of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). The activated state structure of VSD IVa (containing exon 29) showed only a single H-bond between R2 and D1196, compared to two each of R1 and R2 with D1196 in VSD IVe (lacking exon 29). Thus, the three resting states of VSD IV are not stabilized by ion pairs formed by the outer gating charges, and the ion-pairs forming in the activated state are further reduced by inclusion of exon 29 in the linker separating the two participating helices.</p><p>Can these striking structural differences explain the kinetic differences conferred to the channel by VSDs I and IV? Our MSM calculations of state transition kinetics strongly support this notion. Compared to VSD I, the energy barriers between the states were substantially lower in VSD IV (35–38 kJ/mol for IVe and 35–42 kJ/mol for IVa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,L</xref>). Consistent with the differences in activation kinetics, the transition times determined for VSD IV were in the µs range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,J</xref>), which is two to three orders of magnitude faster than those of VSD I. Also, the transitions between resting states 1 and 2, and between resting state 3 and the activated state were about three times faster in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1a compared to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e, indicating an effect of exon 29 insertion on the kinetics of VSD IV movement. However, compared to the substantial difference between the kinetically distinct VSDs I and IV, the differences in energy barriers and transition times between the two VSD IV splice variants remain unexpectedly small. Apparently, the calculated transition times primarily reflect differences in kinetics, but much less differences of the voltage dependence of activation. This makes sense, considering that the height of energy barriers and the transition kinetics are expected to affect the sequential transitions of a VSD through all four states, which determine the channel activation kinetics, whereas changes in voltage sensitivity primarily rely on the stabilization of the activated state and therefore are little affected by differences of the state transitions.</p><p>The direct comparison of VSD I and the two splice variants of VSD IV in the activated and resting states demonstrates striking differences between VSDs I and IV in the extent of ion-pair formation in the ENC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As shown above, in VSD IV these involve interaction of R1 and R2 with the ion-pair partner D1196 in IVS3 formed in the activated state that is subject to modulation by alternative splicing of exon 29. VSD I lacks an analogous ion-pair partner in the corresponding position of IS3. Instead IS4 displays extensive ion pairs with countercharges (E76, E87, E90) in IS2 that are sequentially formed by gating charges R3, R2, R1, and K0 in the activated and the intermediate resting states 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This indicates that in VSDs I and IV, the gating charges above the HCS utilize structurally distinct ion-pair partners to stabilize the voltage sensor either only in the activated state (VSD IV) or in the activated and resting states (VSD I). The additionally formed ion pairs in the resting states of VSD I are paralleled by a remarkable increase in the energy barriers and the state transition times, suggesting that the number and strength of interactions between the gating charges and the ENC transiently formed in the resting states determine the slow activation kinetics of VSD I.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-64087-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Movement of wildtype Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e voltage sensing domain (VSD) I upon activation and deactivation, highlighting the ion-pair interactions formed between the S4 gating charges (blue) and relevant countercharges (red) in the S2 and S3 helices.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>VSD I ion pairs differentially regulate gating properties</title><p>To experimentally test this hypothesis, we simultaneously mutated both countercharges, E87 and E90, to alanine (E87A/E90A) in the rabbit GFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tanabe et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tuluc et al., 2009</xref>), expressed them in their native environment in dysgenic myotubes and examined the effects on the gating properties of its calcium currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

This supports our interpretation of the role of the two countercharges in determining the gating properties, and also substantiates the reliability and predictive value of the kinetic analysis of our MD simulations. Yet, it is worth noting that the transition kinetics derived from our MD simulation relate to the activation of an isolated VSD, whereas kinetics and voltage dependence of channel activation reflect the concerted action of all four VSDs and its mechanical transduction to the channel gate. Consequently, changes in activation properties of a single VSD will only result in similar changes of current activation, when this VSD is obligatory and rate-limiting for gating, or, in an allosteric model, according to its relative contribution to the gating process. This limitation may also account for the different magnitudes of the effects (50-fold vs. 5-fold) on the activation kinetics of the E87A/E90A mutant observed in MSM and current recordings.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-64087-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Movement of the E87A/E90A double mutant of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e voltage sensing domain (VSD) I upon activation and deactivation, highlighting the ion-pair interactions formed between the S4 gating charges (blue) and relevant countercharges (red) in the S2 and S3 helices.</title></caption></media><p>As E87 and/or E90 govern the kinetics as well as voltage dependence of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 activation, we wondered whether these two properties are mechanistically linked to each other or separable?

However, patch clamp analysis of deactivation kinetics in WT and mutant VSD I did not reflect these differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon repolarization to negative membrane potentials, the deactivation time constants of all tested constructs were between 4 and 10 ms and thus near the activation time constants of the fast activating mutants (E87A/E90A and E90A). This is expected considering the distinct dependence of channel activation and deactivation on the actions of multiple VSDs. Upon depolarization, the VSDs need to proceed through all resting states into the activated state before the channel gate will open. Inevitably, the speed of this action is limited by the slowest VSD necessary for channel opening (VSD I in the case of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1). In contrast, on deactivation the channel gate closes when the first essential VSD transits from the activated state into resting state 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Principally, this can be any one of the four VSDs. Therefore, channel deactivation will be rapid even if VSD I requires considerably more time to return to its deepest resting state, as predicted by our MSM analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 VSDs fill an important gap in the understanding of the voltage sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The results presented in this study demonstrate two surprisingly different VSDs, which substantially differ in the range of S4 helix displacement during activation/deactivation, as well as in the number and position of ionic bonds formed between the outer gating charges and countercharges of the ENC in the resting and activated states. These structural differences correspond to differences in the free energy states and kinetics of the state transitions, which in turn correlate with the experimentally determined kinetics and voltage dependences of current activation. Throughout this structure-function study, the combination of MD simulation and MSM proved to be of exceptionally high predictive value. All tested interaction partners suggested by the model showed the predicted effects on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis. Conversely, alterations of kinetic properties first recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by our computer model.</p><p>Overall, the structures of the lowest energy states of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 VSDs display the basic features of the sliding helix model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall et al., 2017</xref>) and of previous simulations of VSD structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuluc et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, two of the resting states predicted by our models closely correspond to recently described cryo-EM structures of homotetrameric Na<sub>V</sub> channels with the VSD in a down-state. Our resting state 1 structure of VSD IVa resembles a mutated Na<sub>V</sub>Ab captured in the resting state by disulfide locking (Cα RMSD of 1.7 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wisedchaisri et al., 2019</xref>). Our resting state 2 structure of VSD I resembles that of a Na<sub>V</sub>Ab/Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 chimera stabilized in a deactivated state by toxin binding (Cα RMSD of 1.9 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the voltage sensing action of the eukaryotic Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 displays a remarkable similarity to that of its homotetrameric bacterial ancestor. Particularly, the sequential movement of the gating charges across the HCS and the stabilization of the states by their transient formation of ion pairs with negatively charged amino acids of the INC were similarly observed in VSDs I and IV. Evidently, these features represent highly conserved properties of voltage-gated cation channels (prokaryotic and eukaryotic) and probably define the essence of the voltage sensing mechanism.</p><p>In contrast, the interactions of the outer gating charges with the negatively charged amino acids of the ENC differed considerably between the two studied VSDs of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1, as well as between the two splice variants of VSD IV. Although the outer gating charges of both VSDs established such ion pairs, they used partners in different transmembrane segments (IS2 vs. IVS3). In both VSDs, the examined ion-pair partners of R1 proved to be crucial for stabilizing the voltage sensor in the activated state, as their mutations consistently resulted in a shift of the voltage dependence of activation to more depolarized voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Ghaleb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuluc et al., 2016b</xref>). Furthermore, the ion-pair interactions in the two VSDs differed in the extent they were formed in different states. While in VSD IV such ion pairs were restricted to the activated state, in VSD I they were also found in resting states 2 and 3, leading to a substantially stronger stabilization of these resting states in VSD I compared to VSD IV. Concordantly, MSM and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that this stabilization of resting states in VSD I causes a dramatic slowing of state transitions and of activation kinetics characteristic for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 currents, respectively. Apparently, the repeated formation and breaking of ionic bonds in consecutive resting states increases the energy barriers between the states and thus slows down the movement of IS4 to the activated state. In contrast, the weaker hydrogen bonds of the outer gating charges of IVS4, or mutation of ion-pair partners in IS3, support fast state transitions and current activation.</p><p>This indicates that the negative countercharges in the ENC serve a dual role in the voltage-gating process. They enable the hand-over-hand movement of the gating charges, thus guiding the state transitions of S4 across the membrane electric field, and they stabilize the VSD in the activated states. Accordingly, mutation of specific countercharges differentially affected the voltage dependence and kinetics of activation. While the charge-neutralizing mutation of E87 in IS2, which stabilizes the VSD I in the activated state, perturbed the voltage dependence of activation, mutating E90, which also forms ionic bonds with R1 and R2 in the resting states, accelerated the activation kinetics. MD simulation and MSM suggested that the loss of the stabilizing interactions with the negative countercharge E90 causes the collapse of resting states 1 and 2, thereby enhancing the speed of VSD I transition into the activated state. As E90 also contributed to stabilizing the activated state, its mutation also caused a right-shift of the voltage dependence of activation. The importance of activated-state-stabilizing interactions of the outermost gating charges for specifically setting the voltage dependence of activation is consistent with earlier mutagenesis experiments of R1 in VSD I and of R1, R2, and D1196 in VSD IV, all of which right-shifted voltage dependence without changing activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El Ghaleb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuluc et al., 2016b</xref>). Unlike VSD I, VSD IV establishes stabilizing ion pairs exclusively in the activated state. The lack of stabilizing ion pairs in the resting states is consistent with the intrinsically fast activation kinetics of this VSD. However as in VSD I, weakening the countercharges in IVS3 either physiologically, by insertion of exon 29 in the IVS3-S4 linker, or experimentally, by mutagenesis, caused a right-shift of the voltage dependence of activation with little effect on kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tuluc et al., 2016b</xref>). Thus, ion-pair formation of R1 with E87 and E90 in VSD I, and of R1 in VSD IV with D1196 are functionally equivalent in stabilizing the activated state in both VSDs, whereas ion-pair formation of multiple gating charges with E90 that stabilize the resting states is specific for VSD I and represents the structural correlate of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 slow activation.</p><p>If the outward motion of the S4 helix with the sequential stabilization of the inner gating charges by ion-pair formation with the INC is the general theme of the voltage sensing process, the interactions between the outer gating charges with countercharges of the ENC represent the variations to this theme. They differ in number, strength, and position from analogous interactions described in the structures of other channels, and even between the VSDs of a single channel. Importantly, in which states they are established determines which biophysical properties of channel gating are being modulated. The general principle derived from our modeling and mutagenesis experiments is that stabilization of VSDs in the activated state supports channel opening by shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more hyperpolarizing potentials. On the other hand, ion-bond formation between the gating charges and the ENC in resting states delays channel opening by slowing down the activation kinetics. Interestingly, at least in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1, these actions are divided between separate VSDs. Thus, our findings provide a molecular mechanism explaining how channels using the same general voltage sensing mechanism can produce very distinct gating properties and how in pseudo-tetrameric eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels the distinct VSDs cooperate in establishing the characteristic gating properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td><italic>CACNA1S</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2016</xref></td><td>Q13698</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (rabbit)</td><td><italic>CACNA1S</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grabner et al., 1998</xref></td><td>P07293</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>GLT, dysgenic skeletal myotubes</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Powell et al., 1996</xref></td><td>GLT; mdg/mdg</td><td>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1-null</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (rabbit)</td><td>GFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e <break/>(wild type)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tuluc et al., 2009</xref></td><td/><td>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1- <break/>D exon 29</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (rabbit)</td><td>GFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e <break/>-E87A/E90A, -E87A, -E90A</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td>Invitrogen <break/>Thermo Fisher</td><td>A-6455, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_221570">AB_221570</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-RyR</td><td>Invitrogen <break/>Thermo Fisher</td><td>(MA3-925) 34 C <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2254138">AB_2254138</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>AMBER simulation software</td><td>AmberMD</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_014230">SCR_014230</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>AmberTools 19</td><td>AmberMD</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018497">SCR_018497</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PyMOL</td><td>Schrödinger</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000305">SCR_000305</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Clampex</td><td>Clampex</td><td>Version 10.2 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Clampfit</td><td>Clampfit</td><td>Version 10.7 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SigmaPlot</td><td>SigmaPlot</td><td>Version 12.0 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003210">SCR_003210</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>GraphPad Prism</td><td>Version 7 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Homology model of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit</title><p>We predicted the structure of the human WT Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit by making a homology model based on the cryo-EM structure of the rabbit Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 α<sub>1</sub> subunit with the VSDs in the up-state and the pore closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2016</xref>).

Van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions were cut off at 10 Å, whereas long-range electrostatics were calculated by the particle mesh Ewald method. A hierarchical clustering was performed on the 10 ns trajectory using an RMSD distance cut-off criterion of 2.5 Å, resulting in three clusters. We chose the highest populated cluster representative for all further steps.

The workflow of the modeling procedure is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. To overcome the high energy barriers and the timescale limitations of MD simulations, we applied Umbrella sampling as enhanced sampling technique. As collective variable we used the distance between the S4 gating charge residues (R1, R2, and R3) and anchor residues at the intracellular helical ends of the VSDs located in S1 and S3, by using a force constant of the harmonic spring potential of 80 kcal/mol*Å<sup>2</sup> to pull the S4 helix downward. Starting from the equilibrated structure, the Umbrella windows decreased between a distance of 24.0–14.0 Å using a step size of 1 Å. Each Umbrella window was simulated for 100 ns. After 20 ns of simulation time, the current conformation was extracted and used as starting structures for the next Umbrella window. The force constant of 80 kcal/mol*Å<sup>2</sup> was determined to allow a sliding movement of S4 with minimal distortion of the VSDs. Additionally, we applied a weak backbone restraint on the φ torsion angle of the S4 helix of 50 kcal/mol*rad<sup>2</sup> to guarantee a minimum of local artifacts of the Umbrella sampling process, that is, loss of secondary structure of the S4 helix. This combination of pulling and torsional restraint was tested and resulted in a sliding movement of the S4 helix without observing unfolding events. Note that the combination of restraints and Umbrella sampling does not result in equilibrium distributions, due to insufficient overlap between the individual sampling windows. Rather the Umbrella sampling was applied to generate conformations along a potential deactivation pathway; however, no states were pre-defined based on the Umbrella sampling. Hence, the Umbrella sampling was used as a mechanical force to pull the S4 helix in the absence of a membrane potential. To obtain the different activation and resting states, we used the resulting pathway of the combined Umbrella sampling trajectories and clustered it using a small distance cutoff criterion to also obtain cluster representatives at transition state regions. Using this procedure, we cannot exclude the possibility of other substantially different pathways (e.g., such that involve helix rotation and formation or breaking of interactions before or after S4 translocation). However, from our calculations we see no indications of the existence of such completely different pathways, which are kinetically accessible. Thus, to reconstruct the transition kinetics and to improve the sampling efficiency, we clustered the Umbrella sampling trajectories applying the program implemented in the AMBER suite <italic>cpptraj</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roe and Cheatham, 2013</xref>) by using the average linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm with an RMSD distance cutoff criterion of 1.2 Å resulting in a large number of clusters. The choice of the distance cutoff is optimized to obtain a broad cluster distribution within the conformational space of each VSD. The cluster representatives of the different activation states were equilibrated and simulated for 100 ns using the AMBER18 simulation package. For the resulting trajectories, a tICA was performed using the Python library PyEMMA 2 employing a lag time of 10 ns.</p><p>Construction of tICA and Markov state models is a dimensionality reduction technique, detecting the slowest relaxing degrees of freedom and facilitating the kinetic clustering, which is crucial for building an MSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pérez-Hernández and Noé, 2016</xref>).

PCCA+ relies on a maximum likelihood estimate of the transition.</p><p>To build the Markov state model, we used the Cα coordinates of the respective S4 transmembrane helix, defined 100 microstates using the k-means clustering algorithm and applied a lag time of 10 ns. The sampling efficiency and the reliability of the Markov state model (e.g., defining optimal feature mappings) can be evaluated with the Chapman-Kolmogorov test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), by using the variational approach for Markov processes and by taking into account the fraction of states used, as the network states must be fully connected to calculate probabilities of transitions and the relative equilibrium probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Likas et al., 2003</xref>). The construction of the MSM allows to quantify thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the resulting ensembles without the intrinsic bias resulting from the seeding process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The first stage of the MSM is to discretize the obtained conformational space into the so-called microstates, grouping together conformations of the system that can exchange rapidly (e.g., by k-means clustering). The aim is to construct a kinetically relevant clustering by using a geometric criterion, which still allows a quantitative connection with experiments, due to their high resolution. To identify the kinetic relevance of the clustering, an appropriate lag time, that is, observation interval, has to be chosen. This resulting microstate model can then be used as starting point for a kinetic clustering. To create a more understandable model, a kinetic clustering of a relevant set of microstates to the so-called macrostates can be performed, which are larger aggregates that correspond to the free energy wells (e.g., by PCCA+ clustering). The additional kinetic clustering into macrostates results in a more compact representation than the microstate model and thereby allows an easier processing and understanding of the conformational space. Thus, these qualitative models are ideal for generating new hypotheses, which can then be tested again with higher resolution models and experiments. The MSM was constructed by following the guidelines and input commands from the provided tutorial (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emma-project.org/latest/tutorial.html#jupyter-notebook-tutorials">http://www.emma-project.org/latest/tutorial.html#jupyter-notebook-tutorials</ext-link>).</p><p>To calculate the 1D free energy barriers <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>‡</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> we used the obtained mean first passage times k from the MSM and calculated the barriers according to the transition state theory with the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>‡</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Expression plasmids</title><p>Cloning procedure for GFP-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1e WT was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tuluc et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vladimir Yarov-Yarovoy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your manuscript has been evaluated by three reviewers who find the results interesting. The models demonstrate how changes in the acidic residues in the voltage sensors of skeletal muscle Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 may control kinetics and voltage dependence. The molecular models of VSDs I and IV describe a sliding helix mechanism, but with different activation barriers, such that VSD I appears to control slow activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are concerned about the heavy reliance on simulations that are not well described and lack measures of reliability. Better description of the conceptual basis of the methods for non-MD expects and much more precise definition of the methods for MD-experts are needed so that the readers can accept that the models are reasonable representations of the gating motions studied.</p><p>The reviewers criticise the lack of statistical reliability tests, with absence of measures of error, convergence and reproducibility, each of which are required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. This is particularly important as trajectories of the order of 100 ns need to represent events that actually take place on 100 microsecond or longer time scales in physiology, such that simulations could be merely anecdotal, incomplete, dependent on starting models or dependent on the choices made in enhanced sampling techniques. Currently, the description leaves the reader to guess what has been done, unsure of the impacts those decisions might have on the findings, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. Thus, as well as detailed responses to the comments of the reviewers, it is essential that the simulation methods be better described and justified, with results supplemented by rigorous proofs of sampling (e.g. interconversion, back and forth, between identified macrostates), convergence (e.g. MSM results changing to within a small tolerance) and reproducibility (e.g. not being dependent on the selected initial Umbrella Sampling), along with quantitative comparisons to experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript represents a study of the voltage sensor movements in homology models of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 to explain its slow kinetics and right shifted V dependence in terms of the roles of distinct structures and ion pair interactions in VSDs I and IV, backed by electrophysiology. In particular, the results suggest interactions specific to subunit chemistry can drastically affect activation. This is backed by mutagenesis and electrophysiology seeing special roles played by residues, such as E87 affecting V dependence while E90 affects rate, representing important information on how subunits of a Ca<sub>V</sub> control voltage gating. The study is well written and presents a unified story to explain kinetics and V dependence. The models are used in MD simulations to examine thermodynamics and kinetics of the voltage-sensing transitions, but they are not well described and reliability tests appear non-existent, as discussed more below. A more involved examination of sampling, reproducibility and errors is needed to trust those results. Without this it is hard to judge if they are even qualitatively consistent with the electrophysiology to provide insight into voltage sensing.</p><p>Although given a fairly wordy description in the methods, the MD approaches are not well described and I am left unsure of what was actually done. Umbrella sampling was first used to &quot;overcome high barriers&quot;. But details of the Umbrella Sampling are not described. I assume this was 1D sampling, but what is the reaction coordinate? On page 18 the authors talk about &quot;pulling S4 down&quot; with K = 80 kcal/mol*rad*2. What does that even mean having an angular restraint? Likewise, the authors mention some torsion restraint on S4, but it is not clear what it was actually acting on and its purpose. Was this the restraint for each window? How many windows and how was the coordinate defined? Was each of many windows run for 100ns or was that just subsequent sampling in a few macrostates? Did the windows overlap well and was the preliminary free energy profile from this Umbrella Sampling (not provided) converged? As this Umbrella Sampling set the stage for all of the MD results, how it was carried out is critical. Importantly, as the authors admit the barriers are high and timescales long for S4 movements, if not captured adequately by the chosen reaction coordinate may lead to far-from-equilibrium starting points for subsequent simulations, tICA analysis and MSM. (n.b. The outward sliding motion of S4 is important for analysis and interpretation, and while this may be the case, until we know how the starting structures were made with US we cannot tell if it is an artifact of the starting trajectory or not.)</p><p>The authors then took clusters and simulated different &quot;activation states&quot; for 100ns each. Does that mean activated states, or activation states between activated and resting states? How were these states actually identified? We would need to see those defined states from the Umbrella simulations and how they were chosen. Are final results depending on such decisions?</p><p>The methods description following this stage is vague. The authors say on page 19 that they &quot;discretize the obtained conformational space into so-called microstates, grouping together conformations of the system that can exchange rapidly (e.g., k-means clustering).&quot; Most <italic>eLife</italic> readers will not understand this, and it is vague in that it does not specify the actual method, but some example method &quot;k-means clustering&quot; without explaining what it means. They then say &quot;To create a more understandable model, a kinetic clustering of a relevant set of microstates to so-called macrostates, can be performed, which are larger aggregates that correspond to the free energy wells (e.g., PCCA+ clustering).&quot; Again stating an example method called PCCA+ clustering. Was this what was used, and what does it mean? Then, MSM is used to extract thermodynamics and kinetics. Details of this analysis, its reliability and reproducibility are completely lacking.</p><p>In Figure 2 and later figures, the authors choose to plot sampling and identify states in the dominant two tICA vectors. What do these vectors actually mean physically? How do we know only 2 such order parameters characterise the slowest coordinates in the activation transition? Subsequent panels in Figure 2 suggest an activation/deactivation reaction coordinate that is visualised as a sliding S4, presumably due to changing structures in the macrostates. How does concerted movement between minima in tICA1,2 translate to this S4 sliding movement? Those two order parameters would need visualisation to become meaningful to the reader.</p><p>Throughout the paper the data is presented without any errors. e.g. What are the error bars in transition mean first passage times in Figure 2? This is particularly important for barriers and the exponentially sensitive rates. Figure 2d suggests activation barriers of 60 kcal/mol. Is that even possible? If one were to estimate a rate for hopping over such barriers, it would not be microseconds (more likely millennia)! How reliable are those barriers (and estimated rates)? Analysis to calculate errors and prove evidence for reproducibility of the results is missing.</p><p>Regarding these barriers, I have concerns about sampling of interconversion of macrostates to capture the MFPT. e.g. Looking at Figure 2a, it seems that there is no sampling between them in the chosen TICA1-2 space, and this raises doubt about the free energies and rates. Regarding apparent lack of overlap between sampling in macrostates (most apparent in Figure 2A), what is the origin of this? This may come down to the Umbrella Sampling used to get starting points for subsequent 100ns simulations for MSM analysis. Some reaction coordinate (unspecified) was presumed for Umbrella Sampling and pulling along that direction may have yielded patches of sampling such that the minima found in the MSM are artifacts of the starting Umbrella trajectory (sequence of windows). Would the same results emerge from a different initial starting method?</p><p>In Figure 2 panel A, the scale goes to 10kT whereas the predicted barriers are much higher (60 kcal/mol). These are given different units, and 60 kcal/mol is of order 100kT, being on a different order to the scale of the free energy maps. n.b. On page 9 the authors now refer to barriers of 50 kJ/mol (a third different unit of energy and again different magnitude). This of order 10-15 kcal/mol and appears inconsistent with the above data. Units again on page 10 in kJ/mol appear wrong. I do not trust the predictions based on the data shown. We would need to be convinced of good sampling of transitions both back and forth between macrostates, such that the MFPT estimates have high accuracy, with propagated errors to rates estimated. Regarding rate estimates: How is it that the predicted barriers between successive macrostates change by 10 kcal/mol (e.g. sequence of barriers in panel D), but rates between macrostates (e.g. in panel B) remain of the same order of magnitude (1ms)? This makes no sense to me. Perhaps the barriers in panel D and other similar graphs are not based on any calculated data?</p><p>The authors write that &quot;although the absolute times derived from MSM may not correspond to the actual transition times of the VSD upon physiological activation and deactivation, relative differences between transition times provide meaningful information when compared between different VSDs or functionally different mutants&quot;. Sources of error in absolute times (and comparison to known experimental times) is required. Regarding reliability of relative rates, how do we know to believe the above statement? Besides model and force field dependence, proof of error and reproducibility of what was sampled is needed.</p><p>On page 11 the authors state that &quot;additionally formed ion-pairs in the resting</p><p>states of VSD I are paralleled by a remarkable increase in the energy barriers and the state transition times, suggesting that the number and strength of interactions between the gating charges and the ENC transiently formed in the resting states determine the slow activation kinetics of VSD I.&quot; It is suggested here that those changed interactions change the barriers, as indicated in Fig2D-H by 20 kcal/mol. Increased barrier like that means a prefactor (assuming similar order of friction) of exp(-20kcal/mol / k<sub>B</sub> T) of the order of 10<sup>-14</sup>. Yet the rates change between just micro and millisecond. Again, perhaps the representation of the barriers in the figures are not actual computed barriers? Related, on page 13 the authors write that their result &quot;substantiates the reliability and predictive value of the kinetic analysis of our MD simulation&quot;. A much more quantitative comparison than this is needed to demonstrate reliability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Manuscript by Monica Fernández-Quintero et al. describes study of molecular mechanism of voltage-gated calcium channel gating using experimental and computational modeling approaches. Authors identified specific ion-pair interactions stabilizing either activated or resting states of voltage sensing domains I and IV in eukaryotic voltage-gated calcium channel. Overall, the results are promising and provide evidence towards evolutionary functional conservation of the sliding helix hypothesis. This study provides key structural insights into voltage-dependence and kinetics of current activation of eukaryotic voltage-gated calcium channels.</p><p>1. Discuss potential role of other interactions involving hydrophobic and polar residues in stabilizing specific VSD states besides the ion-pair interactions identified in this study. Also note that residue size and hydrophobicity may also contribute to differences in VSD kinetics – see Jérôme J. Lacroix et al. (2014) Moving gating charges through the gating pore in a K<sub>V</sub> channel voltage sensor. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 111(19): E1950-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1406161111.</p><p>2. A large part of the study is computational modeling to generated models of VSDs in different resting states and run MD simulations to compute transition kinetics. However, to prove the rigor of the approach authors need to describe essential details and related results in supplemental figures and/or text. Specifically:</p><p>a. What was the reaction coordinate in the Umbrella sampling?</p><p>b. How many windows used and how well they overlapped?</p><p>c. How did the authors decide if the Umbrella sampling has generated enough data for the following steps?</p><p>d. The author mentioned for clustering the Umbrella sampling trajectory &quot;… resulting in a large number of clusters&quot;. How many clusters exactly, given all of these clusters were subsequently simulated for 100 ns?</p><p>e. How was the time lag of 10 ns chosen for the tlCA analysis in the MSM modeling?</p><p>f. The authors should show an implied timescales (ITS) plot as a function of different lag times. Was it convergent?</p><p>g. The authors should also show the results of the Chapman-Kolmogorov test to ensure the dynamics observed is Markovian so that the results can be meaningful.</p><p>3. Discuss accuracy of absolute activation and deactivation times estimated by MSM – how far away they are from the actual transition times observed experimentally?</p><p>4. An assumption in the computational modeling part of this study is that transitions between VSD states can happen at equilibrium. However, this rarely happens in reality. The activation or deactivation can be considered as a non-equilibrium process by which the electric field exerts force on gating charges to trigger conformational changes in VSDs. Authors should discuss strength and weaknesses of chosen computational modeling methods.</p><p>5. Note that while the experimental testing is in agreement with observations form computations models, it is not a direct validation of accuracy of the computational prediction. Given the largely unchanged conformation of the rest of the channel except S4, the computational modeling at its best can only infer S4 gating charges movement in individual VSD in a specific physiological state of the channel. The experiments, on the other hand, only showed macroscopic view of the channel activation, in which the contribution of the gating charges movement, VSDs cooperation, and pore coupling is complex. The authors need to discuss these limitations.</p><p>6. The authors studied activation and deactivation kinetics of the gating charges movement using the computational modeling approaches. Discuss why only activation kinetics have been studied experimentally.</p><p>7. Can authors provide computational ion-pair energy calculations to support VSD state-stabilization hypotheses?</p><p>8. Provide in the Supplementary Information example scripts and command lines used for Rosetta homology modeling, MD simulations, and MSM calculations. Such scripts should contain enough information such that someone else could independently run and validate author's data.</p><p>9. Provide confidence intervals for experimental data.</p><p>10. Provide PDB coordinates of Rosetta Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 models as text files in the Supplementary Information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Fernandez-Quintero et al. show how changes in the negatively charged amino acid residues in the voltage sensor of skeletal muscle Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 calcium channels can control their function. These calcium channels serve two physiological functions with different kinetics and voltage dependence: excitation-contraction coupling triggered by conformational coupling with the ryanodine receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and calcium entry triggered by opening of their pore. Voltage-driven movement of the S4 segments in their voltage sensors initiate both functions. Molecular models are developed here for the function of VSD I and VSD IV describing the transmembrane movements of their S4 segments from resting to activated states. In each case, the molecular models fit a sliding helix mechanism of VSD function in which the S4 segments exchange ion pair partners between the extracellular negative cluster and the intracellular negative cluster of counterions in the voltage sensor. The kinetic barriers for movement of the S4 segment in VSD IV were much lower than VSD I, suggesting that VSD I controls the slow activation of the calcium conductance of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels. Introducing mutations in two negatively charged amino acid residues in the extracellular negative cluster of VSD I (E87A and E90A) showed that they differentially regulate channel function. E87A positively shifted the voltage dependence of activation, whereas E90A gave a smaller positive shift in activation and slowed the rate of activation by four-fold.</p><p>Understanding how molecular specializations in VSDs control ion channel function is an important goal of molecular physiology. Because of its unique functional properties, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channel provides an interesting experimental model. The results presented here are an important advance, as they provide a detailed new molecular model of VSD function and they show how a conserved molecular feature of VSDs, the negatively charged amino acid residues in the extracellular negative cluster, control the voltage dependence and rate of activation of VSD I.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>Line 33. It is an overstatement to say calcium channels control most functions in excitable cells. Many hormone receptors and other regulators act independently of them. It seems more accurate to say that calcium channels control most functions that are triggered by action potentials in excitable cells, or something similar.</p><p>Lines 137-142. More description of the conceptual basis for these methods for non-MD expects would be good here. It will be important for general readers to understand why they should accept these models as good representations of corresponding functional states.</p><p>Line 142. Figure 6 is cited out of order here. Perhaps it should be a Supplementary Figure.</p><p>Lines 139-142. Trajectories of 100 ns raise the concern that they may not accurately represent events that actually take place on the 100 usec to msec time scales in physiology. The rationale for use of Umbrella sampling to bridge these time scales should be made more clear.</p><p>Lines 120-121. Are there corresponding differences among the VSD's in interactions of their gating charges with the intracellular negative cluster, as indicated here for the extracellular interactions? Do you expect that these intracellular interactions also contribute to control of kinetics and voltage dependence?</p><p>Lines 158-159 and Figure 2. How were activated and resting states designated? Is there functional evidence to back up the designations of Resting State 2 and Resting State 3 as resting vs. active? Can one have confidence that states generated by thermal perturbation in MD analysis will reflect the same states that result from voltage stimulation?</p><p>Lines 163-164. A &quot;shifting stretch&quot; of 3-10 helix. Are all of the gating charges included in this 3-10 helical segment or only the central ones? Does S4 remain in 3-10 conformation after passing through the HCS? Are these conformations similar in VSD IV?</p><p>In addition to the S4 segment and its gating charge position and interactions, the previous resting state structure of the prokaryotic sodium channel revealed new conformations of the intracellular end of the S4 segment and the S4-S5 linker. Are these conformations observed in these molecular models of the resting state?</p><p>Figure 3. In most of the manuscript, the order of states begins with Activated and proceeds to Resting, presumably because that is where the MD runs start. However, it feels backwards to me. This is especially true in Figure 3 where changing the order to Resting&gt;Activated from left to right will give a much more intuitive reading of the changes of ion pair partners in the color code.</p><p>Lines 253-254. Here the paired mutations cause a 50-fold increase in the rate of activation in the MSM model, whereas the actual mutation only causes a 4-fold the experimental results. What accounts for this large discrepancy?</p><p>Figure 5. There is a larger dispersion of WT data for activation rate in Figure 4D and in Figure 5O and Q. Why are these data more variable?</p><p>Lines 400-402.

However, there remains some concern about the possible dependence of sampling for the MSM model on the original umbrella sampling, and that this may have been too easily dismissed by the authors. There is still need for clarification and justification of methods, and improved illustration of tests. However, although umbrella sampling simulations may not have reached equilibrium and may still influence the subsequent dynamics to some degree, this does not necessarily preclude a valid MSM, especially for a process that is fairly well constrained (such as in this case where there are strong interactions between the S4 and other VSD residues during S4 translocation), there is sufficient MD sampling achieved after the umbrella sampling, the sampling is validated with Chapman-Kolmogorov tests, and the data is supported by experimental measurements. Thus, although ideally data would be provided that proves the final results do not depend on the initially pulling procedure (redoing with a different starting procedure/path), we do not insist on this here. We do, however, ask that: 1. the possibility that results may depend on those choices not be dismissed; 2. remaining questions and comments from the reviewers regarding clarity of methods and results be addressed in the revised manuscript; and 3. please provide the requested PDB models.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed some concerns, but the major critique regarding the possible dependence of results on the initial umbrella sampling and the description of methods have not been fully resolved. The authors did not seem to understand the concern expressed about the possible dependence of results on the initial umbrella sampling path. We know that the authors analysed MD with their MSM after US, but the point is that all sampling commenced with a pulling of the S4 along a predetermined path using umbrella sampling, done so because of the long timescale of sampling S4 movements, and one cannot just expect the subsequent MD not to be biased by that initial pulling.1. The authors admit that the umbrella sampling was used to seed the subsequent MD because otherwise the long timescales of S4 movement may not be reached, but then dismiss the possibility that the subsequent MD may remain trapped in the vicinity of that umbrella sampling path? The authors further dismiss this possible dependence by saying that this is because of their inherent statistical checks, which does not prove much to me. Statistical analysis on the subsequent MD may show reproduction of that MD by the MSM, but may still be restricted to their sampling close to the initial umbrella sampling path. I note that the cartoon in Figure S10 illustrates (perhaps with actual data, it is unclear) that the sampling from MD looks very similar in pattern to the original umbrella sampling, highlighting the concern. To say that all MSM analysis of the MD after umbrella sampling was independent of the initial US because it came after the umbrella sampling is missing the point. One could instead model initial S4 movement along an extremely different pathway (e.g. one that involves helix rotation and interaction breaking/forming before or after translocation in different stages…, perhaps using more than one translocation coordinate) and then go off sampling a different statistically reliable set of sampled states, if those different initial pathways are kinetically separated.</p><p>2. The methods section still does not explain all approaches clearly. What is the mysterious &quot;dihedral torsion restraint&quot; on S4, why was it needed and what was its purpose? Is it because the pulling of S4 caused the helix to lose secondary structure? What atom selections did it involve? The authors merely write that it was used to &quot;minimise local artifacts&quot;! Details of the umbrella sampling and its reliability remain unclear. The 1D umbrella sampling was along a translocation coordinate, presumed parallel to the helix, and how do we know such a pulling was successful? I note that S4 was pulled with US away from equilibrium, at 1 Å per 20ns (see later note on constraint also). If this trajectory is meant to yield states near equilibrium to seed the subsequent MD (as opposed to a steered MD pulling which then relies on the following unbiased MD to reach equilibrium, where equiuiibration would need to be discarded prior to MSM analysis), then it is essential that convergence of the umbrella sampling itself is demonstrated (e.g. a profile of free energy along the chosen order parameter for time 0-T with T increasing, showing convergence to within a reasonable tolerance like 1 kcal/mol). If the authors were to redo the umbrella sampling, pulling in the opposite direction, I would expect significant hysteresis. If the pulling never reached equilibrium, why should we have confidence that the subsequent MD used for MSM analysis was not influenced by this?</p><p>3. Regarding the tests in Figure S4. This figure is poorly described in its caption. The purpose, approach and what are each of the panels for the Chapman-Kolmogorov tests should be properly described. Moreover, the figure has tiny information at low resolution such that it is hard to see what is being shown in each of the small panels.</p><p>4. The mix up of energy units was unfortunate. I still am not confident all units are right. Free energies are now in kJ/mol but I note constraints are still specified in kcal/mol. The pulling of S4 by residues R1, R2 and R3 uses a constraint of 80 kcal/mol/A^2. If correct (not kJ/mol), this is an extremely tight constraint. Assuming equilibrium and applying equipartition theorem, this restraint would correspond to a standard deviation of less than 0.1 Å, such that windows spaced at 1 Å cannot overlap at all (probability of overlap at 5-10 standard deviations being vanishingly small). I suggest overlap can only be obtained as a result of the non-equilibrium pulling periods of the trajectory. The umbrella sampling was therefore used only as a non-equilibrium pull and not to establish an equilibrium distribution prior to unbiased MD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Authors addressed all of my comments, except providing PDB coordinates of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channel models.

This is particularly important as trajectories of the order of 100 ns need to represent events that actually take place on 100 microsecond or longer time scales in physiology, such that simulations could be merely anecdotal, incomplete, dependent on starting models or dependent on the choices made in enhanced sampling techniques. Currently, the description leaves the reader to guess what has been done, unsure of the impacts those decisions might have on the findings, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches. Thus, as well as detailed responses to the comments of the reviewers, it is essential that the simulation methods be better described and justified, with results supplemented by rigorous proofs of sampling (e.g. interconversion, back and forth, between identified macrostates), convergence (e.g. MSM results changing to within a small tolerance) and reproducibility (e.g. not being dependent on the selected initial Umbrella Sampling), along with quantitative comparisons to experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for their exceptionally thorough review of our article.

In particular, the results suggest interactions specific to subunit chemistry can drastically affect activation. This is backed by mutagenesis and electrophysiology seeing special roles played by residues, such as E87 affecting V dependence while E90 affects rate, representing important information on how subunits of a Ca<sub>V</sub> control voltage gating. The study is well written and presents a unified story to explain kinetics and V dependence. The models are used in MD simulations to examine thermodynamics and kinetics of the voltage-sensing transitions, but they are not well described and reliability tests appear non-existent, as discussed more below. A more involved examination of sampling, reproducibility and errors is needed to trust those results. Without this it is hard to judge if they are even qualitatively consistent with the electrophysiology to provide insight into voltage sensing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer´s overall positive assessment and we agree that the original manuscript was in want of more detailed description of the modeling methods and information about sampling, reproducibility and errors of the results. We addressed this point making substantial revisions, which are described in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although given a fairly wordy description in the methods, the MD approaches are not well described and I am left unsure of what was actually done. Umbrella sampling was first used to &quot;overcome high barriers&quot;. But details of the Umbrella Sampling are not described. I assume this was 1D sampling, but what is the reaction coordinate? On page 18 the authors talk about &quot;pulling S4 down&quot; with K = 80 kcal/mol*rad*2. What does that even mean having an angular restraint? Likewise, the authors mention some torsion restraint on S4, but it is not clear what it was actually acting on and its purpose. Was this the restraint for each window? How many windows and how was the coordinate defined? Was each of many windows run for 100ns or was that just subsequent sampling in a few macrostates? Did the windows overlap well and was the preliminary free energy profile from this Umbrella Sampling (not provided) converged? As this Umbrella Sampling set the stage for all of the MD results, how it was carried out is critical. Importantly, as the authors admit the barriers are high and timescales long for S4 movements, if not captured adequately by the chosen reaction coordinate may lead to far-from-equilibrium starting points for subsequent simulations, tICA analysis and MSM. (n.b. The outward sliding motion of S4 is important for analysis and interpretation, and while this may be the case, until we know how the starting structures were made with US we cannot tell if it is an artifact of the starting trajectory or not.)</p><p>The authors then took clusters and simulated different &quot;activation states&quot; for 100ns each. Does that mean activated states, or activation states between activated and resting states? How were these states actually identified? We would need to see those defined states from the Umbrella simulations and how they were chosen. Are final results depending on such decisions?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this criticism, we extended the methods section so that it becomes clear what exactly has been done. Umbrella sampling was used exclusively to generate a potential pathway of the downward movement of the S4. This is necessary to compensate for the force of the membrane potential gradients lacking in our model, because it is based on the starting structure of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 solved in the depolarized state. Experimental details including the reaction coordinates and the justification of torsional restraints are now described in the Materials and methods (pages 2021).</p><p>Importantly, all other results, including the free energy surfaces, do not rely on the Umbrella sampling, as we used this pathway only to generate starting structures for classical molecular dynamics simulations in an extended region of the phase space (i.e., along the expected trajectory of S4 during the downward movement). The states are derived from the Markov State Model (i.e., representing the free energy wells) and are reliable within its statistical significance (see new Table S1). Therefore, the presented/analyzed structures are independent of the initial Umbrella sampling. This important point has now been made clear in the description of the approach in the Methods section (page 20 and Figure S10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods description following this stage is vague. The authors say on page 19 that they &quot;discretize the obtained conformational space into so-called microstates, grouping together conformations of the system that can exchange rapidly (e.g., k-means clustering).&quot; Most eLife readers will not understand this, and it is vague in that it does not specify the actual method, but some example method &quot;k-means clustering&quot; without explaining what it means. They then say &quot;To create a more understandable model, a kinetic clustering of a relevant set of microstates to so-called macrostates, can be performed, which are larger aggregates that correspond to the free energy wells (e.g., PCCA+ clustering).&quot; Again stating an example method called PCCA+ clustering. Was this what was used, and what does it mean? Then, MSM is used to extract thermodynamics and kinetics. Details of this analysis, its reliability and reproducibility are completely lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for these comments and questions and addressed them as follows: We extended the Methods section, adding explanations for all the applied algorithms (k-means clustering, PCCA clustering, Markov-state models). We also included the Chapman-Kolmogorov plots and implied timescale plots (Figure S4), which are algorithms to estimate the reliability of the Markov-state models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 and later figures, the authors choose to plot sampling and identify states in the dominant two tICA vectors. What do these vectors actually mean physically? How do we know only 2 such order parameters characterise the slowest coordinates in the activation transition? Subsequent panels in Figure 2 suggest an activation/deactivation reaction coordinate that is visualised as a sliding S4, presumably due to changing structures in the macrostates. How does concerted movement between minima in tICA1,2 translate to this S4 sliding movement? Those two order parameters would need visualisation to become meaningful to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we also included a detailed explanation of tIC vectors. The first two vectors correspond to the kinetically slowest directions in cartesian coordinate space and thus capture the majority of the slow movements (typically 70% of the movements slower than the lag time). The S4 sliding movement is primarily represented by tIC1, whereas tIC2 corresponds more to reorganization processes along this movement. A schematic structure showing the two motions represented by the tIC1 and tIC2 coordinates is now included in Figure S10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the paper the data is presented without any errors. e.g. What are the error bars in transition mean first passage times in Figure 2? This is particularly important for barriers and the exponentially sensitive rates. Figure 2d suggests activation barriers of 60 kcal/mol. Is that even possible? If one were to estimate a rate for hopping over such barriers, it would not be microseconds (more likely millennia)! How reliable are those barriers (and estimated rates)? Analysis to calculate errors and prove evidence for reproducibility of the results is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now show the confidence intervals for the calculated mean first passage times in the Supporting Methods to show the statistical relevance of our results (Table S1). We calculated the barriers in Figure 2d based on the obtained mean first passage times, to visualize the results in a different way.</p><p>For estimating the energy barriers we used the transition state theory, the equation of which is now included also in the Supplementary Material. Unfortunately, we had specified the wrong units for the estimated 1D free energy barriers. The results were illustrated in kJ/mol, but had been mislabeled as kcal/mol in the original manuscript. We apologize for this mistake. This error has now been corrected in all plots (Figures 2, 4, and 5) and throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding these barriers, I have concerns about sampling of interconversion of macrostates to capture the MFPT. e.g. Looking at Figure 2a, it seems that there is no sampling between them in the chosen TICA1-2 space, and this raises doubt about the free energies and rates. Regarding apparent lack of overlap between sampling in macrostates (most apparent in Figure 2A), what is the origin of this? This may come down to the Umbrella Sampling used to get starting points for subsequent 100ns simulations for MSM analysis. Some reaction coordinate (unspecified) was presumed for Umbrella Sampling and pulling along that direction may have yielded patches of sampling such that the minima found in the MSM are artifacts of the starting Umbrella trajectory (sequence of windows). Would the same results emerge from a different initial starting method?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in Figure 2a there is sampling between the macrostates, which is a prerequisite for the construction of the MSM. The sampling is validated by the inherent statistical checks in the course of MSM building. Thus, consistent results would emerge from different initial starting methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2 panel A, the scale goes to 10kT whereas the predicted barriers are much higher (60 kcal/mol). These are given different units, and 60 kcal/mol is of order 100kT, being on a different order to the scale of the free energy maps. n.b. On page 9 the authors now refer to barriers of 50 kJ/mol (a third different unit of energy and again different magnitude). This of order 10-15 kcal/mol and appears inconsistent with the above data. Units again on page 10 in kJ/mol appear wrong. I do not trust the predictions based on the data shown. We would need to be convinced of good sampling of transitions both back and forth between macrostates, such that the MFPT estimates have high accuracy, with propagated errors to rates estimated. Regarding rate estimates: How is it that the predicted barriers between successive macrostates change by 10 kcal/mol (e.g. sequence of barriers in panel D), but rates between macrostates (e.g. in panel B) remain of the same order of magnitude (1ms)? This makes no sense to me. Perhaps the barriers in panel D and other similar graphs are not based on any calculated data?</p></disp-quote><p>This inconsistency resulted from the unit error stated above. We corrected the units of the tIC plots to kJ/mol. Consequently, it is now apparent that the free energies presented in the tIC surfaces are in the same order of magnitude.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write that &quot;although the absolute times derived from MSM may not correspond to the actual transition times of the VSD upon physiological activation and deactivation, relative differences between transition times provide meaningful information when compared between different VSDs or functionally different mutants&quot;. Sources of error in absolute times (and comparison to known experimental times) is required. Regarding reliability of relative rates, how do we know to believe the above statement? Besides model and force field dependence, proof of error and reproducibility of what was sampled is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewer and now provide the confidence intervals for all transition times and also the reliability checks for the underlying Markov-state models (Table S1, Figure S4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 11 the authors state that &quot;additionally formed ion-pairs in the resting</p><p>states of VSD I are paralleled by a remarkable increase in the energy barriers and the state transition times, suggesting that the number and strength of interactions between the gating charges and the ENC transiently formed in the resting states determine the slow activation kinetics of VSD I.&quot; It is suggested here that those changed interactions change the barriers, as indicated in Fig2D-H by 20 kcal/mol. Increased barrier like that means a prefactor (assuming similar order of friction) of exp(-20kcal/mol / k_B T) of the order of 10^-14. Yet the rates change between just micro and millisecond. Again, perhaps the representation of the barriers in the figures are not actual computed barriers? Related, on page 13 the authors write that their result &quot;substantiates the reliability and predictive value of the kinetic analysis of our MD simulation&quot;. A much more quantitative comparison than this is needed to demonstrate reliability.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, this inconsistency arose from our mislabeling of the units. This has been corrected and the results are now in line with the timescales and the free energy plots. Obviously, as pointed out by the reviewer, the largest errors have to be expected for kinetics due to the exponential dependency on barriers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Manuscript by Monica Fernández-Quintero et al. describes study of molecular mechanism of voltage-gated calcium channel gating using experimental and computational modeling approaches.

Discuss accuracy of absolute activation and deactivation times estimated by MSM – how far away they are from the actual transition times observed experimentally?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge activation and deactivation kinetics of individual VSD of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 are not known and probably impossible to measure directly in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, any further discussion of the differences and/or similarities of the transition times derived from MD/MSM would be highly speculative. Therefore, we suffice it to say that, “Because the values calculated in our model are obtained in the absence of the force provided by changes in the electric field, the absolute times derived from MSM may not correspond to the actual transition times of the VSD upon physiological activation and deactivation”. (line 187)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. An assumption in the computational modeling part of this study is that transitions between VSD states can happen at equilibrium. However, this rarely happens in reality. The activation or deactivation can be considered as a non-equilibrium process by which the electric field exerts force on gating charges to trigger conformational changes in VSDs. Authors should discuss strength and weaknesses of chosen computational modeling methods.</p></disp-quote><p>This important limitation has now been explicitly stated in the sentence quoted at the end of the previous paragraph. (line 187)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Note that while the experimental testing is in agreement with observations form computations models, it is not a direct validation of accuracy of the computational prediction. Given the largely unchanged conformation of the rest of the channel except S4, the computational modeling at its best can only infer S4 gating charges movement in individual VSD in a specific physiological state of the channel. The experiments, on the other hand, only showed macroscopic view of the channel activation, in which the contribution of the gating charges movement, VSDs cooperation, and pore coupling is complex. The authors need to discuss these limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this is an obvious but important issue.

As expected, in all cases, the deactivation kinetics were fast and in the range of the activation kinetics observed in the fast constructs (E90A, E87A/E90A). Fast deactivation is expected even in the slowly activating constructs, because closure of the gate is determined by the first (fastest) VSD moving from the activated state into resting state 3, rather than by the slow VSD I, which is rate limiting only during activation. This is now discussed at the end of the Results section (lines 312-325).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

These calcium channels serve two physiological functions with different kinetics and voltage dependence: excitation-contraction coupling triggered by conformational coupling with the ryanodine receptor in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and calcium entry triggered by opening of their pore. Voltage-driven movement of the S4 segments in their voltage sensors initiate both functions. Molecular models are developed here for the function of VSD I and VSD IV describing the transmembrane movements of their S4 segments from resting to activated states. In each case, the molecular models fit a sliding helix mechanism of VSD function in which the S4 segments exchange ion pair partners between the extracellular negative cluster and the intracellular negative cluster of counterions in the voltage sensor. The kinetic barriers for movement of the S4 segment in VSD IV were much lower than VSD I, suggesting that VSD I controls the slow activation of the calcium conductance of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels. Introducing mutations in two negatively charged amino acid residues in the extracellular negative cluster of VSD I (E87A and E90A) showed that they differentially regulate channel function. E87A positively shifted the voltage dependence of activation, whereas E90A gave a smaller positive shift in activation and slowed the rate of activation by four-fold.</p><p>Understanding how molecular specializations in VSDs control ion channel function is an important goal of molecular physiology. Because of its unique functional properties, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channel provides an interesting experimental model.

However, there remains some concern about the possible dependence of sampling for the MSM model on the original umbrella sampling, and that this may have been too easily dismissed by the authors. There is still need for clarification and justification of methods, and improved illustration of tests. However, although umbrella sampling simulations may not have reached equilibrium and may still influence the subsequent dynamics to some degree, this does not necessarily preclude a valid MSM, especially for a process that is fairly well constrained (such as in this case where there are strong interactions between the S4 and other VSD residues during S4 translocation), there is sufficient MD sampling achieved after the umbrella sampling, the sampling is validated with Chapman-Kolmogorov tests, and the data is supported by experimental measurements. Thus, although ideally data would be provided that proves the final results do not depend on the initially pulling procedure (redoing with a different starting procedure/path), we do not insist on this here. We do, however, ask that: 1. the possibility that results may depend on those choices not be dismissed; 2. remaining questions and comments from the reviewers regarding clarity of methods and results be addressed in the revised manuscript; and 3. please provide the requested PDB models.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we addressed all three points requested above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:The authors have addressed some concerns, but the major critique regarding the possible dependence of results on the initial umbrella sampling and the description of methods have not been fully resolved. The authors did not seem to understand the concern expressed about the possible dependence of results on the initial umbrella sampling path. We know that the authors analysed MD with their MSM after US, but the point is that all sampling commenced with a pulling of the S4 along a predetermined path using umbrella sampling, done so because of the long timescale of sampling S4 movements, and one cannot just expect the subsequent MD not to be biased by that initial pulling.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not claim that this approach is unbiased. However, as nicely summarized in the “Essential Revisions” paragraph above, this does not preclude a valid MD simulation and MSM, because the experimentally conditions are solidly based on published structure-function data of VSD action, validated by appropriate tests as well as by the mutagenesis experiments shown in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors admit that the umbrella sampling was used to seed the subsequent MD because otherwise the long timescales of S4 movement may not be reached, but then dismiss the possibility that the subsequent MD may remain trapped in the vicinity of that umbrella sampling path? The authors further dismiss this possible dependence by saying that this is because of their inherent statistical checks, which does not prove much to me. Statistical analysis on the subsequent MD may show reproduction of that MD by the MSM, but may still be restricted to their sampling close to the initial umbrella sampling path. I note that the cartoon in Figure S10 illustrates (perhaps with actual data, it is unclear) that the sampling from MD looks very similar in pattern to the original umbrella sampling, highlighting the concern. To say that all MSM analysis of the MD after umbrella sampling was independent of the initial US because it came after the umbrella sampling is missing the point. One could instead model initial S4 movement along an extremely different pathway (e.g. one that involves helix rotation and interaction breaking/forming before or after translocation in different stages…, perhaps using more than one translocation coordinate) and then go off sampling a different statistically reliable set of sampled states, if those different initial pathways are kinetically separated.</p></disp-quote><p>We explain (there is nothing to “admit”) that to overcome the timescale limitation of MD simulations in the absence of the driving membrane potential, some kind of enhanced sampling technique (i.e. Umbrella sampling) is necessary to restrict the MD simulation of the VSD to the general vicinity determined by the probable path of the S4 helix relative to the other helices. It was not our intension to “dismiss” the possibility that different starting points could result in models with extremely different pathways. We searched the manuscript carefully for statements that might suggest that. However, nowhere in our manuscript do we claim that all MD/MSM analysis after Umbrella sampling was independent of the initial US. We only write that no states were pre-defined based on US. To make this point absolutely clear, we further amended our explanations in the Methods section accordingly (lines 454 – 465).</p><p>We also clarify that the schematic figures in Figure S2 (earlier Figure S10) are exemplary figures and not data from the present modeling. (line 762)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The methods section still does not explain all approaches clearly. What is the mysterious &quot;dihedral torsion restraint&quot; on S4, why was it needed and what was its purpose? Is it because the pulling of S4 caused the helix to lose secondary structure? What atom selections did it involve? The authors merely write that it was used to &quot;minimise local artifacts&quot;! Details of the umbrella sampling and its reliability remain unclear. The 1D umbrella sampling was along a translocation coordinate, presumed parallel to the helix, and how do we know such a pulling was successful? I note that S4 was pulled with US away from equilibrium, at 1 Å per 20ns (see later note on constraint also). If this trajectory is meant to yield states near equilibrium to seed the subsequent MD (as opposed to a steered MD pulling which then relies on the following unbiased MD to reach equilibrium, where equiuiibration would need to be discarded prior to MSM analysis), then it is essential that convergence of the umbrella sampling itself is demonstrated (e.g. a profile of free energy along the chosen order parameter for time 0-T with T increasing, showing convergence to within a reasonable tolerance like 1 kcal/mol). If the authors were to redo the umbrella sampling, pulling in the opposite direction, I would expect significant hysteresis. If the pulling never reached equilibrium, why should we have confidence that the subsequent MD used for MSM analysis was not influenced by this?</p></disp-quote><p>We replace the term “dihedral torsion restraint” by a more detailed explanation of the applied backbone restraint, i.e., ϕ torsion angle, also describing the magnitude and an explanation of why this was important.</p><p>Concerning convergence, we now explicitly state that US does not result in equilibrium distributions because of insufficient overlap between the individual sampling windows, as we did not aim at a converged sampling from the US procedure. (lines 449-459)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding the tests in Figure S4. This figure is poorly described in its caption. The purpose, approach and what are each of the panels for the Chapman-Kolmogorov tests should be properly described. Moreover, the figure has tiny information at low resolution such that it is hard to see what is being shown in each of the small panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We amended the figure legend to describe the panels and we increased the font size in the figure. (lines 771-775)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The mix up of energy units was unfortunate. I still am not confident all units are right. Free energies are now in kJ/mol but I note constraints are still specified in kcal/mol. The pulling of S4 by residues R1, R2 and R3 uses a constraint of 80 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>. If correct (not kJ/mol), this is an extremely tight constraint. Assuming equilibrium and applying equipartition theorem, this restraint would correspond to a standard deviation of less than 0.1 Å, such that windows spaced at 1 Å cannot overlap at all (probability of overlap at 5-10 standard deviations being vanishingly small). I suggest overlap can only be obtained as a result of the non-equilibrium pulling periods of the trajectory. The umbrella sampling was therefore used only as a non-equilibrium pull and not to establish an equilibrium distribution prior to unbiased MD.</p></disp-quote><p>The unit and magnitude of the constraint are correct (80 kcal/mol*Å<sup>2</sup>). We tested the applied parameters to avoid unfolding of the S4 helix but to have enough force to induce the downward movement of the S4. As correctly stated by the reviewer and as mentioned above, there is indeed insufficient overlap between the individual sampling windows for US to result in an equilibrium distribution as we do not aim at a converged sampling from the US procedure. This has now been explicitly stated.
