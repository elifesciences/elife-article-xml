While generally well tolerated below 40°C, in rare cases, fever can abnormally elevate neural activity and induce seizures in neurotypical children aged 2–5 years. This study investigates the mechanisms by which neuronal activity is maintained and stabilized during exposure to fever-range temperatures. Recordings of layer (L)4-evoked spiking in L2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) of mouse somatosensory cortex revealed four outcomes as temperature increased from 30°C to 36°C and 39°C (fever-range): neurons remained inactive, stayed active, ceased activity, or initiated activity. Roughly equal proportions of neurons ceased or initiated spiking, making the subset of ‘STAY’ PNs, those that remain active across temperatures, crucial for maintaining stable cortical output. STAY PNs were more prevalent at younger postnatal ages. Their firing stability was supported by a distinct ion channel composition, including the thermosensitive channel TRPV3, which enables continued spiking by adjusting depolarization to meet spike threshold. Intracellular blockade of TRPV3, but not TRPV4, significantly reduced the proportion of STAY PNs and suppressed spiking at 39°C. Moreover, in <italic>Trpv3<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, temperature increases to 39°C reduced both spiking and post-synaptic potential amplitude, and these mice exhibited a delayed seizure onset. Together, these findings suggest that TRPV3 contributes to the preservation of cortical activity during fever.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fever is a symptom of an infection during which the body temperature rises from just below 37 °C (98.6. 6 °F) to above 38 °C (100.4. 4 °F). This extra heat helps the body fight germs. For most children and adults, a higher temperature – which also affects the brain – causes only milder symptoms such as tiredness, body aches, headache or chills. However, in about 1 in 20 to 1 in 50 children aged 6 months to 5 years, a fever can trigger a seizure. Seizures happen when brain cells, called neurons, become overly active at the same time.</p><p>Most studies in rodents have focused on why brain cells become overactive at very high temperatures, around 41 to 42 °C. Much less is known about why seizures are relatively rare at lower temperatures of about 38 to 39 °C. To address this gap, Shen et al. studied how neurons maintain a normal activity at lower temperatures.</p><p>The researchers recorded neurons in the somatosensory cortex of mice as their body temperature increased from 30 °C to between 36 °C and 39 °C (fever-range). In young mouse brains, fever induced two simultaneous changes in brain cells: some neurons reduced their activity, allowing them to rest, while others increased their activity to compensate. Because the number of active and less active neurons was roughly balanced, the cells could keep their overall activity stable during a fever.</p><p>Moreover, the researchers also identified a thermosensitive protein known as TRPV3 that enhanced its activity during fever. This allowed a sustained flow of ions into the neurons, helping active neurons to keep their firing rate. Rather than increasing seizure risk, this mechanism appears to stabilize neural circuits and prevent excessive synchronization of neurons when fever reduces or pauses activity in many neurons. In addition, active neurons were distinct in that they received greater excitatory input from neighboring neurons and underwent functional adaptations, such as maintaining ion channel expression and distribution, to help preserve effective communication and network stability during fever.</p><p>Genetically modified mice lacking TRPV3 showed reduced neuronal activity and a delayed onset of seizures, indicating that TRPV3 is essential in maintaining cortical activity during fever. These findings differ from experiments conducted at very high temperatures, where neuronal overexcitation is driven by breakdowns in ion channel function and inhibitory signaling.</p><p>Shen et al. uncovered previously unknown neuronal processes that help the brain continue functioning during fever. This work lays the groundwork for future studies into the causes of fever-related seizures, including whether such seizures arise when compensatory mechanisms fail or when key proteins necessary for maintaining neural balance are overexpressed during elevated body temperatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fever</kwd><kwd>temperature</kwd><kwd>TRPV3</kwd><kwd>febrile seizures</kwd><kwd>homeostatic</kwd><kwd>cortical neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAAA000440-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antoine</surname><given-names>Michelle W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian Brain Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NAP2022-I-2/2022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ulbert</surname><given-names>István</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02ks8qq67</institution-id><institution>Hungarian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bolyai Janos Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fiáth</surname><given-names>Richárd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K22NS105922-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antoine</surname><given-names>Michelle W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Developmental electrophysiological adaptations and heat-sensitive proteins, such as TRPV3, in cortical excitatory neurons help maintain stable activity levels when brain temperature rises by 2–3°C during fever.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most mammals, including humans, core body temperature (T<sub>b</sub>) is tightly regulated between 36.1 and 37.8°C, with a daily fluctuation of 0.5°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell, 2011</xref>). Fever or other thermal challenges can impede heat dissipation to significantly increase T<sub>b</sub> beyond 38°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Because global brain temperature and core body temperature are largely congruent, large increases in temperature affect both regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Increases in body temperature up to 40°C are generally well tolerated, but temperatures above 42°C (within the hyperthermia and heat stress range) become harmful, leading to protein denaturation and cell death. The body and brain employ protective mechanisms, such as heat shock proteins, to cope with heat stress. These proteins are rapidly induced or upregulated at noxious temperatures, aiding in the refolding or degradation of damaged proteins once temperatures return to physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Miller and Fort, 2018</xref>). However, the mechanisms that stabilize and preserve neuronal firing at lower, fever-range temperatures are not well understood.</p><p>In rare cases, moderate-grade fevers (T<sub>b</sub> = 38.1 –39°C) cause seizures in children aged 6 months to 6 years, with the highest susceptibility between 2 and 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oakley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004</xref>). A seizure is defined as a sudden, temporary burst of synchronized, excessive neuronal firing in the brain. These febrile seizures (FS) are almost typically triggered by the thermal component of fever, as CNS infections or metabolic disorders are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004</xref>). Additionally, FS can be induced solely by increased T<sub>b</sub> due to ambient heat, such as a warm bath, hot room, or overdressing. Beyond age five, FS rarely occurs, suggesting that developmental changes in brain physiology stabilize network excitability during this window of susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shinnar and O’Dell, 2004</xref>). Identifying the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying this protective shift could provide insight into normal brain maturation and reveal processes whose disruption may increase susceptibility to febrile seizures.</p><p>Rodents exhibit a similar age-dependent susceptibility to thermally induced seizures. The second postnatal week is proposed as a developmental window of heightened seizure susceptibility. During this period, fever-range temperatures (38.1–39°C), comparable to the range at which FSs occur in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holtzman et al., 1981</xref>), do not typically induce seizures. Instead, seizures arise only at higher thresholds (&gt;42.7°C), consistent with hyperthermic rather than febrile seizures. This raises the question: what physiological changes occur during the second postnatal week that prevent seizures from being triggered at fever-range temperatures (~39°C)?</p><p>For practical reasons, EEG recordings for the onset of FS in humans are limited. However, EEG traces from rodents with thermally induced seizures show that ictal events often initiate in the hippocampus and propagate to the cortex, with the later spread to the cortex being correlated to the more severe behavioral stages of the seizure, i.e., Racine stage &gt;4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dubé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baram et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, the cortex represents a critical locus in the seizure phenotype and likely contains mechanisms that may alter neural activity in response to temperature changes. In this manuscript, rather than examining how fever provokes seizures, we focus on identifying the electrophysiological adaptations during postnatal development that stabilize cortical activity at 39°C. Specifically, we compare two developmental stages flanking the proposed window of hyperthermic seizure susceptibility (P12–14): an earlier stage (P7–8) and a later stage (P20–23). This design also provides negative controls, allowing us to determine whether changes observed in the P12–14 window are unique.</p><p>Early comparative studies correlating rat and human brain development using neuronal birth dates, myelination patterns, and saltatory growth stages suggest that 5–7 day-old rats approximate full-term human newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dobbing and Sands, 1973</xref>). More recent analyses based on hippocampal and cortical maturation indicate that the second postnatal week (P10–14) corresponds to human infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bender et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the third and fourth postnatal weeks align with the human juvenile stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baram et al., 1997</xref>). Here, using wild-type mice across three postnatal developmental periods—postnatal day (P)7–8 (newborn), P12-14 (infancy), and P20-26 (juvenile)—we investigated the electrophysiological properties, ex vivo and in vivo, that enable excitatory cortical PNs in mouse primary somatosensory (S1) cortex to remain active during temperature increases from 30°C (standard in electrophysiology studies) to 36°C (physiological temperature), and then to 39°C (fever-range).</p><p>Finally, to begin identifying molecular determinants that may mediate the electrophysiological properties enabling firing stability in cortical PNs, we extended our studies to two members of the thermosensitive, Ca²<sup>+</sup>-permeable, nonselective cation channels of the transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) family: TRPV3 and TRPV4. These channels are activated within the innocuous warm temperature range (TRPV3: 31–39°C; TRPV4: 27–34°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shibasaki et al., 2007</xref>), unlike TRPV1 and TRPV2, which respond to noxious heat above 42°C and 52°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashio and Tominaga, 2022</xref>). TRPV3 and TRPV4 share low (~41%) amino acid sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2002</xref>) and are both expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caterina, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanju and Liedtke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Given its activation within the 31–39°C range, we hypothesized that TRPV3 may specifically contribute to neuronal adaptations occurring within fever range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shibasaki et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we aimed to elucidate adaptative neural mechanisms that allow cortical excitatory PNs to maintain stable spiking despite substantial increases in brain temperature into the fever range. Across three postnatal developmental ages, excitatory cortical PNs responded to depolarizing stimuli during temperature increases from 30°C to 39°C by remaining inactive, continuing to spike, ceasing spiking, or initiating spiking. Nearly equal proportions of neurons ceased or initiated activity, so overall firing stability was maintained largely by ‘STAY’ neurons, which remained active throughout temperature increases. We propose that STAY neurons likely achieve this stability through unique ion channel compositions, including those from TRPV3, which allows for higher depolarization levels through increased excitatory synaptic input relative to inhibitory input.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Body temperature rises to fever levels during regular activity and exposure to higher ambient temperatures</title><p>Contrary to common belief, T<sub>b</sub> is not fixed but varies with arousal state, motor activity, and environmental temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kiyatkin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hankenson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

However, contrary to expectations, average spiking remained remarkably stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). We also examined the temperature-induced effects on L2/3 PNs in the absence of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Intrinsic spiking was measured in the presence of synaptic blockers (100 μM APV, 10 μM NBQX, and 3 μM gabazine). PNs were held at –80 mV, followed by positive current injection (500 ms) steps to determine rheobase (the minimum current injection needed to produce one spike). At 39°C, rheobase was increased compared to 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Current was injected up to 250 pA above rheobase at 30°C, 36°C, and 39°C, using a new brain slice for each recording.

Our electrophysiological assessments across three postnatal ages, P7-8, P12-14, and P20-23, showed that excitatory PNs responded to temperature increases from 30°C to 39°C by either remaining inactive, staying active, ceasing activity, or initiating activity. Roughly equal portions of neurons ceased or initiated activity, so firing stability was largely maintained by those that remained active, i.e., STAY neurons. The overall proportion of PNs that remain spiking from 36°C to 39°C was higher at P12-14 compared to P20-23. This increased proportion at earlier ages could potentially reflect the increased risk for febrile seizure occurrence at earlier postnatal ages.</p><p>STAY neurons likely possess a unique composition of ion channels that enable them to exhibit temperature sensitivity in spike threshold but not in input resistance and adjust their depolarization levels to match the ST value. Our initial characterization focused on <italic>Trpv3</italic> and <italic>Trpv4</italic>, two members of a family of thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels that are expressed in the brain and activated between 30–39°C, the temperature range of our study. Intracellular blockade of TRPV3, but not TRPV4, significantly decreased the population of STAY PNs and prevented stability in spiking activity during temperature increases into fever range.</p><p>TRPV3 is highly expressed in various tissues, including epithelial cells of the skin and oropharynx, the tongue, testis, dorsal root ganglion, trigeminal ganglion, spinal cord, and brain (Moussaieff A et al., 2008 and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). It plays a crucial role in skin and hair generation as well as in the perception of pain and warmth on the skin. However, its role in the central nervous system remains to be further elucidated. In the brain, TRPV3 is expressed in several neuronal types, including cortical and striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>TRPV3 has a reported temperature threshold for activation between 31–39°C, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2002</xref> noting activation at 39°C. Consistent with this, we observed the strongest physiological effects in cortical PNs at 39°C. At this temperature, intracellular blockade of TRPV3 reduced average spiking levels and temperature-induced increases in the PSP. Additionally, a potential early postnatal temperature-dependent activity mechanism in PNs, where levels of excitatory and inhibitory input are adjusted to match the cell’s ST, was abolished with TRPV3 blockade. Altogether, these results suggest that TRPV3 blockade reduces net activity in sensory cortical circuits by decreasing activity in STAY cells.</p><p>Although TRPV3 channels are cation-nonselective, they exhibit high permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+&gt;</sup>Na<sup>+</sup>≈K<sup>+</sup>≈Cs<sup>+</sup>) with permeability ratios (relative to Na<sup>+</sup>) of 12.1, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). Opening of TRPV3 channels activates a nonselective cationic conductance and elevates membrane depolarization, which can increase the likelihood of generating action potentials. Indeed, our observations of a loss of the temperature-induced increases in the PSP with TRPV3 blockade are consistent with a reduction in membrane depolarization. In S1 cortical circuits at P12-14, STAY PNs appear to rely on a temperature-dependent activity mechanism, where depolarization levels (mediated by higher excitatory input and lower inhibitory input) are scaled to match the cell’s ST. Thus, an inability to increase PSPs with temperature elevations prevents PNs from reaching ST, so they cease spiking. See summary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Summary model of how STAY neurons achieve firing stability through unique ion channel compositions, including TRPV3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) with synaptically evoked spiking, gradual increases in brain slice temperature from 30 °C to 36°C to 39°C result in four possible outcomes: neurons remain inactive, continue spiking (STAY), stop spiking, or initiate spiking. To spike, PNs must reach the spike threshold (ST), defined as the minimal V<sub>m</sub> that elicits an action potential, which requires sufficient depolarization via the post-synaptic potential (PSP). STAY neurons consistently reach ST and continue spiking. Neurons that stop spiking fall below the level of depolarization required to reach ST, while neurons that initiate spiking achieve sufficient depolarization to newly reach ST. (<bold>B</bold>) STAY neurons may contain unique ion channels, such as TRPV3. TRPV3 channels are highly permeable to Ca²<sup>+</sup> ions, and Ca²<sup>+</sup> influx contributes to PN depolarization. The presence of TRPV3 facilitates greater ion entry, enabling depolarization sufficient to reach ST and sustain spiking, whereas its absence reduces depolarization to levels insufficient for spiking.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102412-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Previous research in <italic>Trpv3</italic> <sup>-/-</sup> KO mice revealed a similar phenotype of reduced activity with diminished TRPV3 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).

These electrophysiological effects were also replicated using pharmacological inhibition of TRPV3 with 50 μmol/L forsythoside B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, consistent with the idea that ischemic injury upregulates TRPV3 expression, leading to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and progressive cell death, inhibition of TRPV3, rather than N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, protected against progressive cell death after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>As STAY PNs and neurons that initiate spiking at fever temperature (‘START’ cells) are active at fever temperature, future research will focus on the molecular characterization of these cells in the cortex and elsewhere in the brain at P12-14 and other ages. Interestingly, neurons that initiate spiking at fever temperature are more prevalent at P20-23 than at the earlier ages examined. TRPV4 block caused a subset of PNs to initiate spiking at 39°C, suggesting that low TRPV4 expression could define the population of START cortical PNs, at least at P12-14.</p><p>Molecular characterization of STAY and START cell types may provide additional insights into their function within normal brain circuits.

Alternatively, neurons that become active could initiate responses to specific stimuli, such as an increase in brain temperature. In this latter scenario, these neurons may be part of the brain’s homeostatic response to temperature increases, while STAY neurons may play a critical role in facilitating ongoing (cognitive) functions during a fever. Future research into the molecular characterization of these cell types could offer opportunities to target and modulate their activity in a brain region-specific manner, potentially advancing treatments for fever-associated seizures or epilepsies, such as Dravet Syndrome (a genetic epilepsy typically initiating in early infancy) and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals and the EC Council Directive of September 22, 2010 (2010/63/EU).

Evoked spikes were analyzed over a 150 ms interval, starting 2–3 ms post-stimulus, for 11 sweeps at 10 s inter-sweep interval (ISI). Spike threshold was defined as the membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) at which the second derivative of <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> was &gt;5 SDs above the pre-stimulus period. Intrinsic spiking excitability was measured in the presence of glutamate and GABA-A receptor blockers (in μM: 100 APV, 10 NBQX, 3 gabazine). F-I curves were obtained from PNs held at –80 mV by applying incremental current injections relative to this V<sub>m</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Animal surgery and in vivo electrophysiological recordings</title><p>In vivo experiments were done under general anesthesia where five mice (age, P24-26; body weight, 7–10 g; both genders) received an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Regular doses of the ketamine/xylazine cocktail were given intramuscularly to maintain the depth of anesthesia during the experimental sessions. Up until the thermal fever protocol started, the T<sub>b</sub> of the animals was kept at 36°C using a homeothermic heating pad connected to a temperature controller (Supertech, Pécs, Hungary). To measure the internal body temperature, a Type T thermocouple microprobe (MT-29/5; Physitemp Instruments, Clifton, NJ, USA) was placed in the rectum of the animal. The microprobe has a shaft diameter of 330 µm, a time constant of 0.025 s, and 0.1°C accuracy.</p><p>To perform high-density extracellular electrophysiological recordings, mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA), then two circular craniotomies (~1.5 mm in diameter) were made with a dental drill above the left and right barrel cortices. The craniotomies were centered at the following stereotaxic coordinates: anterior-posterior (AP): −1.0 mm; medial-lateral (ML): 3.5 mm (with respect to the bregma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). Two commercially available Neuropixels 1.0 silicon probes (imec, Leuven, Belgium; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) mounted on two motorized stereotaxic micromanipulators (Neurostar, Tübingen, Germany) were implanted into the brain, one into the left and the other into the right barrel cortex, to a depth of 1.5 mm. An insertion speed of 2 µm/s was used to decrease the mechanical trauma caused by the probe insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiáth et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In order for the probe tracks to be perpendicular to cortical layers, the probes were inserted at an angle of 20 degrees from vertical. The dura mater in the craniotomy was left intact, except when it was too thick and thus the silicon probe could not pierce through this layer (which was indicated by significant probe buckling; n=3 insertions). In these cases, a 36-gauge, slightly bent needle was used to carefully cut the dura above the targeted cortical area. After the probe reached its final insertion depth, to allow the brain tissue to settle, we waited at least 10 min before electrophysiological recording was started. Spiking activity of cortical neurons (action potential band, 300–10,000 Hz) was recorded on 384 channels (768 channels in total for the two probes), with a sampling rate of 30 kHz/channel and with a gain of 500 (yielding a resolution of 2.34 μV per bit). Data were acquired using the SpikeGLX open-source software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/">http://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karsh, 2026</xref>). A common stainless steel wire inserted into the neck muscle of the animal served as the external reference and ground electrode. To avoid the dehydration of the cortex, the skull and the craniotomy was kept moist during the whole experiment using body temperature, sterile physiological saline solution, and Gelaspon. Before starting the experimental protocol, manual whisker stimulation (by repetitively touching the whiskers of the animal with a cotton swab) was used to verify the recording position. In all cases (n=10 probe insertions), we detected strong whisker-evoked neuronal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Thermal fever protocol during electrophysiological recordings</title><p>First, we recorded cortical activity for 45 min at ~36°C body temperature (‘baseline’&quot; period), then the body temperature of the animal was elevated with the aid of the heating pad and a power bank with warming capability which was placed next to the mouse. The body temperature was increased from 36°C to 39°C in about 5 min (~0.01°C/s). The elevated body temperature was maintained for 45 min (‘thermal fever’ period). Next, we turned off the heating until the T<sub>b</sub> reached physiological temperatures (36°C; ~5 min; ~0.01°C/s). Cortical activity was recorded for another 45 min at 36°C body temperature (‘recovery’ period). Continuous recordings with a total duration of 145 min were obtained for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Spike sorting and data analysis</title><p>To extract cortical single-unit activity, spike sorting was performed with Kilosort2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort">https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pachitariu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pachitariu et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pachitariu and Pennington, 2026</xref>) using the default parameter set (available in the StandardConfig.m file). Channels containing activity acquired by recording sites located outside the cortex were removed before spike sorting (usually ~130 channels/probe recorded from the barrel cortex). The list of single-unit clusters generated by Kilosort2 was visually inspected to remove units considered as noise (e.g. units with abnormal spike waveform shapes) or multi-unit activity (e.g. clusters with a contaminated refractory period). Manual curation of the Kilosort2 results was done with the Phy Python library, which provides a graphical user interface for interactive visualization of high-density data and supply operations for merging, splitting, and marking of clusters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy">https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rossant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rossant, 2026</xref>). In this dataset, we aimed to keep only those single units which had at least 900 spikes (&gt;~0.1 Hz firing rate), a clear refractory period, a consistent waveform shape, and whose spikes were present throughout the 145-min-long recording.</p><p>Following manual curation, based on their spike waveform duration, the selected single units (n=633) were separated into putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barthó et al., 2004</xref>). The spike duration was calculated as the time difference between the trough and the subsequent waveform peak of the mean filtered (300–6000 Hz bandpassed) spike waveform. Durations of extracellularly recorded spikes showed a bimodal distribution (Hartigan’s dip test; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) characteristic of the neocortex with shorter durations corresponding to putative interneurons (narrow spikes) and longer durations to putative principal cells (wide spikes). Next, k-means clustering was used to separate the single units into these two groups, which resulted in 140 interneurons (spike duration &lt;0.6 ms) and 493 principal cells (spike duration &gt;0.6 ms), corresponding to a typical 22–78% (interneuron – principal) cell ratio. Finally, the firing rates of neurons were computed separately during the three distinguished periods (baseline, thermal fever, and recovery). To decrease the effect of transient changes (e.g. tissue recovery during the baseline period or the short-term effect of heating during the thermal fever period), for each 45-min-long period, we used only the last 25 min to calculate the mean firing rates of neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused using standard methods. Brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C with shaking, rinsed in 1X PBS, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. They were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, frozen on dry ice, and stored at –80°C until sectioning. Tissue was cut at 30 µm on a cryostat and mounted onto slides. Sections were permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 (in 1X PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation in 3% H₂O₂ (in 1X PBS) at room temperature. Slides were blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1 hr at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-TRPV3-Biotin antibody (#ACC-033-B), TRPV3 blocking peptide (#BLP-CC033), and/or anti-TRPV4 antibody (#ACC-034) (Alomone Labs, Israel). For antibody–peptide controls, the anti-TRPV3-Biotin antibody was pre-incubated with its blocking peptide at a 1:2.5 ratio, using 1 mg/ml of each. The following day, sections were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (streptavidin-conjugated or unconjugated). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). Finally, sections were mounted onto slides, cover-slipped, and stored at 4°C until imaging. Images were acquired using a Keyence BZ-X810 microscope (BZ-X800 Viewer, Version 1.1.1.8) with BZ-X filter sets: DAPI (Ex 360/40 nm; OP-87762), GFP (Ex 470/40 nm; OP-87763), and TRITC (Ex 545/25 nm; OP-87764).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 9.0 (GraphPad).

The authors began by demonstrating that exposure to infrared light increasing ambient temperature causes body temperature rise to fever level above 38{degree sign}C.

However, the spike number only decreased in P7-8 PNs, while it remained stable in P12-14 PNs at 39{degree sign}C. In addition, the fever temperature also reduced the late peak postsynaptic potential (PSP) in P12-14 PNs. The authors further characterized the firing properties of cortical P12-14 PNs, identifying two types: STAY PNs that retained spiking at 30{degree sign}C, 36{degree sign}C and 39{degree sign}C, and STOP PNs that stopped spiking upon temperature change.

The authors concluded that during fever, neuronal firing stability is largely maintained by sensory STAY PNs and MSNs that express functional TRPV3 channels. Overall, this study is well designed and executed with substantial controls, some interesting findings, and quality of data. Here are some specific comments:</p><p>(1) Could the authors discuss, or is there any evidence of, changes in TRPV3 expression levels in the brain during the postnatal 1-4 week age range in mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question. To our knowledge, no published studies have documented changes in TRPV3 expression in the mouse brain during the first to fourth postnatal weeks. Research on TRPV3 expression has primarily relied on RT-PCR analysis of RNA from dissociated adult brain tissue (Jang et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2018), largely due to the limited availability of effective antibodies for brain sections at the time. Furthermore, the Allen Brain Atlas does not provide data on TRPV3 expression in the developing or postnatal brain. To address this gap, we performed immunohistochemistry to examine TRPV3 expression at P7,</p><p>P14, and P21 (Figure 7). To confirm specificity, the TRPV3 antibody was co-incubated with a TRPV3 blocker (Figure 7A, top row, right panel). While immunohistochemistry is semiquantitative, we observed a trend toward increased TRPV3 expression in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus from P7 to P14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Are there any differential differences in TRPV3 expression patterns that could explain the different firing properties in response to fever temperature between the STAY- and STOP neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another excellent question, and we plan to explore it in the future by developing reporter mice for TRPV3 expression and viral tools that leverage endogenous TRPV3 promoters to drive a fluorescent protein, enabling monitoring of cells with native TRPV3 expression. To our knowledge, such tools do not currently exist. Creating them will be challenging, as it requires identifying promoters that accurately reflect endogenous TRPV3 expression.</p><p>We have not yet quantified TRPV3 expression in STOP and STAY neurons. However, our analysis of evoked spiking at 30, 36, and 39 °C suggests that TRPV3 may mark a population of cortical pyramidal neurons that tend to remain active (“STAY”) as temperatures increase. While we have not directly compared TRPV3 expression between STAY and STOP neurons at feverrange temperatures, intracellular blockade of TRPV3 with forsythoside B (50 µM) significantly reduced the proportion of STAY neurons (Figure 9B). Consistently, spiking was also significantly reduced in Trpv3⁻/⁻ mice (Figure 10D).</p><p>In our immunohistochemical analysis, TRPV3 was detected in L4 barrels and in L2/3, where we observed a patchy distribution with some regions showing more intense staining (Figure 7B). It is possible that cells with higher TRPV3 levels correspond to STAY neurons, while those with lower levels correspond to STOP neurons. As we develop tools to monitor activity based on endogenous TRPV3 levels, we anticipate gaining deeper insight into this relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) TRPV3 and TRPV4 can co-assemble to form heterotetrameric channels with distinct functional properties. Do STOP neurons exhibit any firing behaviors that could be attributed to the variable TRPV3/4 assembly ratio?</p></disp-quote><p>There is some evidence that TRPV3 and TRPV4 proteins can physically associate in HEK293 cells and native skin tissues (Hu et al., 2022).TRPV3 and TRPV4 are both expressed in the cortex (Kumar et al., 2018), but it remains unclear whether they are co-expressed and coassembled to form heteromeric channels in cortical excitatory pyramidal neurons. Examination of the I-V curve from HEK cells co-expressing TRPV3/4 heteromeric channels shows enhanced current at negative membrane potentials (Hu et al., 2022).</p><p>Currently, we cannot characterize cells as STOP or STAY and measure TRPV3 or TRPV4 currents simultaneously, as this would require different experimental setups and internal solutions. Additionally, the protocol involves a sequence of recordings at 30, 36, and 39°C, followed by cooling back to 30°C and re-heating to each temperature. Cells undergoing such a protocol will likely not survive till the end.</p><p>In our recordings of <italic>TRPV3</italic> currents, which likely include both STOP and STAY cells, we do not observe a significant current at negative voltages, suggesting that <italic>TRPV3/4</italic> heteromeric channels may either be absent or underrepresented, at least at a 1:1 ratio. However, the possibility that TRPV3/4 heteromeric channels could define the STOP cell population is intriguing and plausible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 7, have the authors observed an increase of TRPV3 currents in MSNs in response to temperature elevation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not recorded TRPV3 currents in MSNs in response to elevated temperatures. Please note that the handling editor gave us the option to remove these data from the paper, and we elected to do so to develop them as a separate manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is there any evidence of a relationship between TRPV3 expression levels in D2+ MSNs and degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, though it falls outside our current research focus in the lab. A PubMed search yields no results connecting the terms TRPV3, MSNs, and degeneration. However, gain-of-function mutations in TRPV4 channel activity have been implicated in motor neuron degeneration (Sullivan et al., 2024) and axon degeneration (Woolums et al., 2020). Similarly, TRPV1 activation has been linked to developmental axon degeneration (Johnstone et al., 2019), while TRPV3 blockade has shown neuroprotective effects in models of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice (Chen et al., 2022).</p><p>The link between TRPV activation and cell degeneration, however, may not be straightforward. For instance, TRPV1 loss has been shown to accelerate stress-induced degradation of axonal transport from retinal ganglion cells to the superior colliculus and to cause degeneration of axons in the optic nerve (Ward et al., 2014). Meanwhile, TRPV1 activation by capsaicin preserves the survival and function of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (Chung et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Does fever range temperature alter the expressions of other neuronal Kv channels known to regulate the firing threshold?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an active line of investigation in our lab. The results of ongoing experiments will provide further insight into this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors study the excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in response to layer four stimulation at temperatures ranging from 30 to 39 Celsius in P7-8, P12-P14, and P22-P24 animals. They also measure brain temperature and spiking in vivo in response to externally applied heat. Some pyramidal neurons continue to fire action potentials in response to stimulation at 39 C and are called stay neurons. Stay neurons have unique properties aided by TRPV3 channel expression.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use various techniques and assemble large amounts of data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) No hyperthermia-induced seizures were recorded in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The goal of this manuscript is to uncover age-related physiological changes that enable the brain to maintain function at fever-range temperatures, typically 38–40°C. Febrile seizures in humans are also typically induced within this temperature range. Given this context, we initially did not examine hyperthermia-induced seizures. However, as requested, we assessed the effects of reduced <italic>Trpv3</italic> expression on hyperthermia-induced seizures in WT(<italic>Trpv3+/+</italic>), heterozygous (<italic>Trpv3+/-</italic>), and homozygous knockout (<italic>Trpv3-/-</italic>) P12 pups. Please see figure 10.</p><p>While T<sub>b</sub> at seizure onset and the rate of T<sub>b</sub> increase leading to seizure were not significantly different among genotypes, the time to seizure from the point of loss of postural control (LPC), defined as collapse and failure to maintain upright posture, was significantly longer in <italic>Trpv3+/-</italic> and <italic>Trpv3-/-</italic> mice. Together, these results indicate that reduced TRPV3 function enhances resistance to seizure initiation and/or propagation under febrile conditions, likely by decreasing neuronal depolarization and excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Febrile seizures in humans are age-specific, extending from 6 months to 6 years. While translating to rodents is challenging, according to published literature (see Baram), rodents aged P11-16 experience seizures upon exposure to hyperthermia. The rationale for publishing data on P7-8 and P22-24 animals, which are outside this age window, must be clearly explained to address a potential weakness in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added an explanation in the “Introduction” for our rationale in including age ranges that flank the period of susceptibility to hyperthermia-induced seizures (see lines 80–100). In summary, we emphasize that this design provides negative controls, allowing us to determine whether the changes observed in the P12–14 window are specific to this developmental period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Authors evoked responses from layer 4 and recorded postsynaptic potentials, which then caused action potentials in layer 2/3 neurons in the current clamp. The post-synaptic potentials are exquisitely temperature-sensitive, as the authors demonstrate in Figures 3 B and 7D. Note markedly altered decay of synaptic potentials with rising temperature in these traces. The altered decays will likely change the activation and inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels, adjusting the action potential threshold.</p></disp-quote><p>The activation and inactivation of voltage-gated ion channels can modulate action potential threshold. Indeed, we have identified channels that contribute to the temperature-induced increase in spike threshold, including BK channels and <italic>Scn2a</italic>. However, Figure 4B represents a cell with no inhibition at 39°C, and thus the observed loss of the late postsynaptic potential (PSP). This primarily contributes to the prolonged decay of the synaptic potentials. By contrast, cells in which inhibition is retained, when exposed to the same thermal protocol, do not exhibit such extended decay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The data weakly supports the claim that the E-I balance is unchanged at higher temperatures. Synaptic transmission is exquisitely temperature-sensitive due to the many proteins and enzymes involved. A comprehensive analysis of spontaneous synaptic current amplitude, decay, and frequency is crucial to fully understand the effects of temperature on synaptic transmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to imply that E-I balance is generally unchanged at higher temperatures. Our statements specifically referred to observations in experiments conducted during the P20–26 age range in cortical pyramidal neurons. We are conducting a parallel line of investigation examining the differential susceptibility of E-I balance across age and temperature, and we have observed age- and temperature-dependent effects. Recognizing that our earlier wording may have been misleading, we have removed this statement from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is unclear how the temperature sensitivity of medium spiny neurons is relevant to febrile seizures. Furthermore, the most relevant neurons are hippocampal neurons since the best evidence from human and rodent studies is that febrile seizures involve the hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to provide clarification. The goal of this manuscript is to uncover age-related physiological changes that enable the brain to maintain stable, non-excessive neuronal firing at fever-range temperatures (typically 38–40°C). We hypothesize that these changes are a normal part of brain development, potentially explaining why most children do not experience febrile seizures. By understanding these mechanisms, we may identify points in the process that are susceptible to dysfunction, due to genetic mutations, developmental delays, or environmental factors, which could provide insight into the rare cases when seizures occur between 2–5 years of age.</p><p>Our aim was not to establish a link between medium spiny neuron (MSN) function and febrile seizures. MSNs were included in this study as a mechanistic comparison because they represent a non-pyramidal, non-excitatory neuronal subtype, allowing us to assess whether the physiological changes observed in L2/3 excitatory pyramidal neurons are unique to these cells. Please note that the handling editor gave us the option to remove these data from the manuscript, and we chose to do so, developing these findings into a separate manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) TRP3V3 data would be convincing if the knockout animals did not have febrile seizures.</p></disp-quote><p>We find that approximately equal numbers of excitatory neurons either start or stop firing at fever-range temperatures (typically 38–40 °C). Neurons that continue to fire (“STAY” cells), thus play a key role in maintaining stable, non-excessive network activity. While future studies will examine the mechanisms driving some neurons to initiate spiking, our findings suggest that a reduction in the number of STAY cells could influence more subtle aspects of seizure dynamics, such as time to onset, by decreasing overall network excitability. We assessed the effects of reduced <italic>Trpv3</italic> expression on hyperthermia-induced seizures in WT(<italic>Trpv3+/+</italic>), heterozygous (<italic>Trpv3+/-</italic>), and homozygous knockout (<italic>Trpv3-/-</italic>) P12 pups. As you stated, these mice have hyperthermic seizures, however, we noted that the time to seizure from the point of loss of postural control (LPC), defined as collapse and failure to maintain upright posture, was significantly longer in <italic>Trpv3+/-</italic> and <italic>Trpv3-/-</italic> mice. Normally, seizures happen shortly after this point, but notably, <italic>Trpv3-/-</italic> mice took twice as long to reach seizure onset compared with wildtype mice. In an epileptic patient, this increased time may be sufficient for a caretaker to move the patient to a safer location, reducing the risk of injury during the seizure.</p><p>Consistent with findings that TRPV3 blockade using 50 µM forsythoside B reduces spiking in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons, we observed significantly reduced spiking in <italic>Trpv3-/-</italic> mice as well (Figure 10D). Analysis of postsynaptic potentials in these neurons showed that, in WT mice, PSP amplitude increased with temperature elevation into the febrile range, whereas this temperature-dependent depolarization was absent in <italic>Trpv3-/-</italic> mice (Figure 10E). Together, these results indicate that reduced TRPV3 function enhances resistance to seizure initiation and/or propagation under febrile conditions, likely by decreasing neuronal depolarization and excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This important study combines in vitro and in vivo recording to determine how the firing of cortical and striatal neurons changes during a fever range temperature rise (37-40 oC).

The authors can also separate the recording based on brain regions (cortex vs striatum) using the depth of the probe as a landmark to study the specific firing of cortical neurons and striatal neurons.

Specifically, we added examples of multiunit and single-spike waveforms, as well as autocorrelation histograms (ACHs). ACHs were used because raster plots of individual single units would not be very informative given the long recording period. Additionally, Figure 5F was also aimed to replace raster plots as it helps to track changes in the firing rate of a single neurons over time.</p><p>Additionally, all recordings were conducted in the cortex at a depth of ~1 mm from the surface, and no recordings were performed in the striatum. Based on the reviewing editor’s suggestions, we decided to remove the striatal data from the manuscript and develop this aspect of the project for a separate publication.</p><p>Lastly, we used published parameters to classify recordings based on spike waveform into putative regular principal neurons and interneurons. To clarify this point, we have now included descriptions that were previously listed only in the “Methods” section into the “Results” section as well.</p><p>The paragraph below from the methods section describes this procedure.</p><p>“Following manual curation, based on their spike waveform duration, the selected single units (n = 633) were separated into putative inhibitory interneurons and excitatory principal cells (Barthóet al., 2004). The spike duration was calculated as the time difference between the trough and the subsequent waveform peak of the mean filtered (300 – 6000 Hz bandpassed) spike waveform. Durations of extracellularly recorded spikes showed a bimodal distribution (Hartigan’s dip test; p &lt; 0.001) characteristic of the neocortex with shorter durations corresponding to putative interneurons (narrow spikes) and longer durations to putative principal cells (wide spikes). Next, k-means clustering was used to separate the single units into these two groups, which resulted in 140 interneurons (spike duration &lt; 0.6 ms) and 493 principal cells (spike duration &gt; 0.6 ms), corresponding to a typical 22% - 78% (interneuron – principal) cell ratio”.</p><p>As suggested, we calculated the E/I balance using the average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the in vivo condition. Our analysis revealed that the E/I balance remained unchanged (see Author response image 1).
