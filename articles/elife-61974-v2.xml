of the formin proteins that have the capacity to nucleate and elongate actin filaments and, therefore, to remodel the cytoskeleton. DIAPH3 is essential for cytokinesis as its dysfunction impairs the contractile ring and produces multinucleated cells. Here, we report that DIAPH3 localizes at the centrosome during mitosis and regulates the assembly and bipolarity of the mitotic spindle. DIAPH3-deficient cells display disorganized cytoskeleton and multipolar spindles. DIAPH3 deficiency disrupts the expression and/or stability of several proteins including the kinetochore-associated protein SPAG5. DIAPH3 and SPAG5 have similar expression patterns in the developing brain and overlapping subcellular localization during mitosis. Knockdown of SPAG5 phenocopies DIAPH3 deficiency, whereas its overexpression rescues the DIAHP3 knockdown phenotype. Conditional inactivation of <italic>Diaph3</italic> in mouse cerebral cortex profoundly disrupts neurogenesis, depleting cortical progenitors and neurons, leading to cortical malformation and autistic-like behavior. Our data uncover the uncharacterized functions of DIAPH3 and provide evidence that this protein belongs to a molecular toolbox that links microtubule dynamics during mitosis to aneuploidy, cell death, fate determination defects, and cortical malformation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mDia2</kwd><kwd>malformation of cortical development</kwd><kwd>MTOC</kwd><kwd>Astrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tissir</surname><given-names>Fadel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FNRS PDR T0236.20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tissir</surname><given-names>Fadel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EOS 30913351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tissir</surname><given-names>Fadel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>Eva On-Chai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007370</institution-id><institution>Université Catholique de Louvain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>Eva On-Chai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saade</surname><given-names>Rana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chehade</surname><given-names>Georges</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruiz-Reig</surname><given-names>Nuria</given-names></name><name><surname>Jossin</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DIAPH3 safeguards integrity of microtubule cytoskeleton during division of neural progenitor cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of the cerebral cortex requires the production and positioning of the right number of neurons. At initial stages of cortical development, the dorsal telencephalon is organized in a pseudostratified epithelium consisting of neural stem cells (NSCs, also known as neuroepithelial cells) that undergo multiple rounds of proliferative division to expand the initial pool of progenitors. Once neurogenesis begins, the neocortex comprises two germinal zones: the ventricular zone (VZ), which forms the lining of lateral ventricles and contains radial glial cells (RG), also known as apical neural progenitor cells (aNPCs), and the adjacent subventricular zone (SVZ), which is located dorsally to the VZ and contains basal progenitors (BP). In the VZ, aNPCs undergo several rounds of divisions to self-renew and generate glutamatergic neurons. aNPCs can also give rise to BP cells, which delaminate from the VZ and translocate to the SVZ, where they divide a limited number of times to increase the final output of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noctor et al., 2008</xref>). A delicate balance between proliferation and differentiation of aNPC must be preserved during neurogenesis. This balance is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and involves rearrangements of the cytoskeleton to support a rigorous sequence of fate decisions. During cell division, filamentous actin rearranges at the cell cortex to enhance cell membrane rigidity for the anchorage of astral microtubule (MT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heng and Koh, 2010</xref>). In the meantime, the centrosome, also known as the microtubule organising centre (MTOC), duplicates, and the two nascent centrosomes migrate toward the poles of the cell. Astral and spindle MT nucleate from the centrosomes and extend to the cortex and equator of the cell, respectively. Polarity proteins G-protein signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2, aka PINS/LGN) and nuclear mitotic apparatus (NUMA) are distributed underneath the cell cortex and interact with cortical actin to connect microtubule plus-end motor proteins dynein/dynactin, and pull on astral MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, spindle MT grow inwardly and attach to chromosomes at the metaphase plate. Once the chromosomes are properly aligned and each chromosome is bilaterally connected to two spindle MT, cohesin <bold>i</bold>s degraded and sister chromatids migrate to opposing poles of the cell, thus enabling nuclear division (aka karyokinesis). Thereafter, actin redistributes to the contractile ring, which constricts, creating the cleavage furrow. The cell cycle is completed by cytokinesis that splits the cytoplasm. Hence, the coordinated action of actin and MT is key to cell division. Errors in centrosome duplication, actin or microtubule polymerization, spindle assembly, or chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy and/or mitotic catastrophe.</p><p>Formins are key regulators of actin dynamics. There are fifteen mammalian formins and they all possess two formin homolog (FH) domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breitsprecher and Goode, 2013</xref>). FH1 delivers profilin-bound actin monomers to the actin filament-barbed ends accelerating elongation, whereas the FH2 dimerizes, enabling the bundling of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kovar, 2006</xref>). Diaphanous (DIAPH) formins form a subgroup of three members that have three regulatory domains: a GTPase-binding domain (GBD) at the N terminus, a diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD), and a diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID). DAD binds to DID, maintaining the DIAPH proteins in an inactive state. Activation occurs through the binding of Rho-GTPases, which releases the DAD/DID interaction. The best-characterized functions of diaphanous three (DIAPH3, also referred to as mDia2) are actin-related. In proliferating cells, DIAPH3 is required for the formation of the contractile ring and the cleavage furrow to enable cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWard and Alberts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). DIAPH3 is also involved in filopodia assembly, supporting cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stastna et al., 2012</xref>), and mesenchymal-amoeboid transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hager et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morley et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the above-mentioned roles, evidence for DIAPH3 implication in actin/cytokinesis-independent functions has emerged. Early in vitro studies have suggested that DIAPH3 interacts with EB1 and APC, which localizes to plus-end, thereby stabilizing MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolini et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of the full <italic>Diaph3</italic> knockout mice has revealed an important role of DIAPH3 in the biology of NSCs. The lack of DIAPH3 severely compromises chromosome segregation, leading to aneuploidy, mitotic catastrophe, and loss of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damiani et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, the precise function of DIAPH3 in nuclear division, especially in cytoskeletal rearrangements, remains elusive. Furthermore, the impact of DIAPH3 deficiency on brain development and function was not assessed due to early embryonic lethality.</p><p>Here, we report that DIAPH3 localizes at the centrosome during mitosis and regulates the assembly of MT as well as the bipolar shape and orientation of the mitotic spindles. DIAPH3 deficiency disrupts the expression and/or stability of several proteins, leading to multipolar spindles and disorganized cytoskeleton. One of the affected proteins is SPAG5 (also known as the mitotic spindle-associated protein 126 or Astrin), which localizes at the centrosome and kinetochore, and has a documented function in cell division. SPAG5 displays a similar expression pattern as DIAPH3 in the developing cortex. Downregulation of SPAG5 phenocopies DIAPH3 deficiency, whereas its overexpression rescues the DIAPH3 knockdown phenotype. We also used a conditional approach to delete <italic>Diaph3</italic> specifically in the cerebral cortex and report that this causes a marked depletion of cortical neurons, microcephaly, locomotor impairment, and social interaction defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DIAPH3 localizes to centrosome and is required for assembly and function of mitotic spindle</title><p>We studied the subcellular distribution of DIAPH3 by immunofluorescence in U2OS cells.

In telophase, it was also seen at the midbody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is consistent with its documented role in the ingression of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWard and Alberts, 2009</xref>).

Notably, DIAPH3 knockdown compromised the integrity of the centrosome and bipolar shape of the spindle (40% of cells exhibited an abnormal number of centrosomes), as well as the organization of MT, leading to mis-segregation of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The assembly of NUMA-GPSM2 beneath cortical actin recruits the dynein/dynactin motor protein complex to haul astral MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>). Downregulation of DIAPH3 dramatically reduced the amount of cortical actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–N</xref>). We used Western blotting on dorsal telencephalon lysates from cortex-specific <italic>Diaph3</italic> knockout mice (hereafter referred to as <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO, obtained by crossing a floxed allele with mice expressing the recombinase Cre under the control of <italic>Emx1</italic> promoter; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) to assess the level of core cortical proteins NUMA, GPSM2, PAR3, NUMB, INSC, dynein, and dynactin; MT plus-end-associated proteins sperm-associated antigen (SPAG 5) and Kinastrin (KNSTRN, aka small kinetochore-associated protein/SKAP); and the cytoplasmic linker-associated protein (CLASP)1. We also used CENPA, a protein downregulated in DIAPH3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Mao, 2016</xref>) as the positive control for Western blotting and normalized the results to GAPDH levels. We did not detect significant changes in the level of endogenous NUMA, dynein, dynactin, INSC, or CLASP1 between <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO and control mice. In contrast, polarity proteins GPSM2, NUMB, and PAR3, and microtubule-associated proteins SPAG5 and KNSTRN were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We studied the subcellular distribution of differentially expressed proteins in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO (GPSM2 and PAR3) or knockdown cells (NUMB, SPAG5, and KNSTRN). All displayed mild to important alterations of their partition during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The distribution of GPSM2, NUMB, SPAG5, and KNSTRN in the pericentrosomal region was compromised as was that of PAR3 in the apical surface, even though we cannot exclude that some of these changes are due to the reduction in protein levels. The most evident change was observed in SPAG5. In control cells, the protein localized to the spindle pole and kinetochore during metaphase and progressively concentrated in the pericentrosomal region as mitosis proceeded to anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In DIAPH3-depleted cells, SPAG5 expression declined sharply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>), and its distribution was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The bipolar organization of the spindle was altered, and astral MT were shrunk.

Their respective numbers decreased by 36% (number of Pax6<sup>+</sup> cells/0.1mm<sup>2</sup> = 502 ± 48 in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO versus 786 ± 35 in control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), 31% (number of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells/0.1mm<sup>2</sup> = 234 ± 4.8 in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO versus 339 ± 15 in control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>), and 23% (number of Tbr1<sup>+</sup> cells/0.1mm<sup>2</sup> = 404 ± 12 in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO versus 524 ± 18 in controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). These results show that the loss of DIAPH3 has an effect on the three cortical cell types, with aNPC being the most affected population. BP and neurons are produced by neurogenic division and settle at more basal positions than their precursors. This type of division supposedly involves asymmetric inheritance of fate determinants, and has been associated with a mitotic spindle that is oblique or perpendicular to the ventricular surface, even though this view has been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chenn and McConnell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shitamukai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shitamukai and Matsuzaki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noctor et al., 2008</xref>). During asymmetric divisions, cellular components and/or molecules regulating fate decision (e.g. the apical process, mother vs daughter centriole, cilia remnants, or polarity proteins) are believed to be inherited unevenly by the daughter cells. Given the deregulation of polarity proteins NUMB and PAR3 upon DIAPH3 downregulation, we analyzed the mitotic spindle orientation in dividing aNPCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). We considered dividing cells in both VZ and SVZ. In control embryos, 87% (77/89) of divisions were planar and 13% (12/89) were non-planar. In <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO, the fraction of planar divisions dropped to 46% (37/81), whereas that of non-planar divisions increased to 54% (44/81) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K,L</xref>). We also observed signs of multipolar spindles in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M,N</xref>), a phenotype that is reminiscent of DIAPH3 and SPAG5 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, to determine whether the changes in spindle orientation correlate with cell fate, we assessed cell cycle exit and neurogenesis by BrdU injection at e13.5 and performed the analysis of BrdU<sup>+</sup>, Ki67<sup>+</sup>, Ki67<sup>-</sup>, and Tbr1<sup>+</sup> cell numbers at e14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O–S</xref>). The fraction of proliferating cells (BrdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>) was reduced (−15%, p=0.011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>), whereas that of precursors which exited the cell cycle (BrdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>-</sup>/BrdU<sup>+</sup>) was enhanced in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO compared with controls (+20%, p=0.011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>).

These results suggest that DIAPH3 deficiency impairs locomotor activity, but has little effect, if any, on anxiety and/or attention. In addition, <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO mice exhibited a defective social behavior in the ‘three-chamber’ test. They spent more time in the empty chamber than with a stranger mouse (stranger 1), emphasizing the lower sociability of <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO mice, as compared to control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). When another stranger mouse was introduced, <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO mice spent less time with the new stranger, indicating impairment in social novelty behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO mice did not show any olfactory defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). They performed as well as controls in the Morris water maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and modified Y-maze tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), implying that long-term and short-term memories were preserved. Finally, they did not display any repetitive behavior, as assayed by self-grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>) or marble burying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Functional analysis of knockout mice showed that it regulates cytokinesis in erythroid cells by promoting the accumulation of actin in the cleavage furrow at telophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to this well-documented role in actin cytoskeleton and cytokinesis, we have reported that DIAPH3 plays a role during karyokinesis and that its loss causes chromosome mis-segregation, aneuploidy, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damiani et al., 2016</xref>). Here we provide evidence that DIAPH3 localizes to the centrosome during mitosis. Its depletion compromises the integrity of centrosome, spindle and astral MT, as well as the expression or stability of several proteins involved in spindle-cell cortex and spindle-kinetochore interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results are consistent with previous in vitro data, suggesting that DIAPH3 may serve as a scaffold protein that binds to and stabilizes MT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palazzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartolini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wen et al., 2004</xref>). By regulating centrosome integrity, microtubule stability, and spindle orientation, DIAPH3 sits at the heart of cell division accuracy and fate determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). All these processes are requisites for the production and maintenance of neural progenitors and neurons. The centrosome acts as a seed and anchoring point for the minus end of MT as they grow toward the equatorial region (spindle MT) or the cell cortex (astral MT). Consistent with this, we found that depletion of DIAPH3 disrupts the centrosome and results in disorganized spindle and astral MT, abnormal alignment, and segregation of chromosomes. DIAPH3 depletion affects the expression level and/or distribution of several proteins. Among those, SPAG5, which localizes at the centrosome and kinetochore, is essential to the recruitment of other centrosomal proteins such as CDK5RAP2 (MCPH3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kodani et al., 2015</xref>). SPAG5 controls sister chromatid cohesion by regulating separase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thein et al., 2007</xref>). Knockdown of SPAG5 induces similar mitotic errors to those triggered by knockdown of DIAPH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kodani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thein et al., 2007</xref> and this work), and its overexpression rescues DIAPH3 knockdown phenotype. DIAPH3 depletion also affects the expression level or the stability of GPSM2, NUMB, and PAR3, all of which localize at the region of the cell cortex where astral MT are anchored.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Working model of DIAPH3 function in aNPC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During mitosis, diaphanous three (DIAPH3) maintains the dynamics of cytoskeleton. Polarity proteins nuclear mitotic apparatus (NUMA) and G-protein signaling modulator 2 (GPSM2) assemble underneath cortical F-actin and recruit the dynein/dynactin motor protein complex. Dynein and dynactin interact with SPAG5/KNSTRN/CLASP1 located at the microtubule plus-end and attach astral microtubule (MT) to cell cortex, thus providing the pulling force for chromosome bipolar segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okumura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kern et al., 2016</xref>).

Primary microcephaly is an inherited neurodevelopmental defect that appears mostly during pregnancy or at the first postnatal year. Eighteen ‘microcephaly’ genes named MCPH 1–18 (for microcephaly primary hereditary 1–18) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>). All these genes are expressed in the germinal zones, wherein the neural progenitors reside, proliferate, and differentiate into neurons during the second trimester of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Verloes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilmore and Walsh, 2013</xref>). A key determinant of brain size is the production and maintenance of the right numbers of neural progenitors and neurons. To attain the initial pool of progenitors and right number of neurons, NSCs must reconcile two imperatives: the high speed and fidelity of cell division. This relies on the interplay between cell cycle regulators, mitotic spindle assembly, mitotic checkpoints, and cytoskeleton. Hence, the division of NSCs and the balance between proliferation and differentiation of apical progenitors is a critical factor of brain size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilmore and Walsh, 2013</xref>). Defects in the balance between proliferative and neurogenic division, or in the timing of neurogenic switch, affect cell fate and production of neurons. Loss of function of DIAPH3 disrupts the modality of cell division and fate determination of apical progenitors, enhancing the number of neurogenic divisions at the expense of proliferative division, prematurely exhausting the pool of progenitors. Even though the cytocortical proteins help to orientate the mitotic spindle, the loss of GPSM2 does not lead to microcephaly despite the randomized cleavage planes in dividing neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konno et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumer et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the role of DIAPH3 in fidelity of nuclear division and the cell loss observed in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO mice may be more instrumental to the emergence of microcephaly in <italic>Diaph3</italic> cKO mice than its role in oriented cell division. It will be interesting to test whether the blockade of apoptosis induces neoplastic transformation due to accumulation of aneuploid cells. Finally, DIAPH3 is expressed in several epithelia and may govern cell proliferation, thereby influencing the size of different organs and/or organisms. In support of this, patients with microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1 (MOPD 1) syndrome display a 50% reduction in DIAPH3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edery et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Diaph3</italic> gene has been associated with body size in equines, as copy number variants were reported in donkeys, ponies, and horses with short stature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Metzger et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In humans, two clinical studies point to <italic>DIAPH3</italic> as an autism susceptibility gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vorstman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). The first study identified a double-hit mutation with one amino acid substitution (Pro614Thr) in one allele and a deletion in the second allele. The second is a de novo point mutation in the 18th exon (c.2156T &gt; C, pI719T). Several chromosomal deletions spanning the <italic>DIAPH3</italic> locus have also been associated with language impairment, autism, and intellectual disability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/">https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nathalie Sans et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, among autistic patients, a significant fraction exhibits microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fombonne et al., 1999</xref>). In this work, we report that the conditional deletion of <italic>Diaph3</italic> in the mouse cerebral cortex dramatically affects neurogenesis and leads to microcephaly and autistic-like behavior, with typical altered motor activity and social interactions. Our finding that the deletion of <italic>Diaph3</italic> affects the accuracy and modalities of division of neural progenitor cells, ultimately regulating the final number of cortical neurons, may provide a molecular and cellular basis to the brain malformations and neurological disorders that have been associated with DIAPH3 dysfunction in humans.</p><p>Combined together, our results suggest a novel role of DIAPH3 as a centrosomal protein. Its deficiency induces centrosome abnormalities and disrupts spindle and astral MT. These defects cause inaccuracies in nuclear division and fate decision of neural progenitors, leading to the loss of cortical progenitors, microcephaly, and autistic-like behavior.</p></sec><sec

The ‘open-field’ test was performed to assess locomotor activity and anxiety. Mice were allowed to move freely in a square arena (60 × 60 cm) and video tracked (Ethovision 6.1, Noldus; Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mallon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mignion et al., 2013</xref>). The total distance covered by test mice (locomotor activity) and the time spent in the periphery (anxiety) were measured.</p><p>The ‘elevated plus maze’ test was performed to assess locomotor activity and anxiety. Mice were placed in a setup consisting of two opposing open arms (exposed place) and two opposing closed arms (safer place). Total distance travelled and time spent in the closed arm were recorded by a video tracking system (Ethovision 6.1, Noldus; Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 5 min.</p><p>The ‘three-chamber’ test was performed to assess sociability. Test box was divided into three equal compartments of 20 cm each, and dividing walls had retractable doorways allowing access into each chamber. Mice were habituated in the middle chamber for 5 min with the doorways closed. To evaluate social interactions, mice were enclosed in the center compartment, and an unfamiliar mouse (called stranger 1) was restricted in a wire cage placed in one side compartment, while the other side compartment contained an empty wire cage. Mice were video tracked (Ethovision 6.1, Noldus; Wageningen, The Netherlands) for 10 min. The time spent in each chamber was measured. To evaluate the preference for social novelty, a second unfamiliar mouse (called stranger 2) was introduced into the empty wire cage in the other side compartment of the sociability test box. Mice were video tracked for 10 min, and the time spent in each chamber was measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moy et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The ‘food localization’ test was performed to evaluate the olfactory function. Test mice were fasted for 16 hr with water supply ad libitum. They were then transferred into a clean cage with 3-cm-thick wood-chip bedding and lightly tamped down to make a flat surface. 1.0 g of food pellet was placed at the same location under the bedding and mice were introduced into the cage at a constant position. The time from which the mouse was placed into the cage until it retrieved the food pellet with its front paws was counted up to a maximum of 300 s.</p><p>The ‘Morris water maze’ test was performed to assess long-term memory. Water maze was made of a round pool with a diameter of 113 cm, virtually divided into four quadrants (North, South, West, and East) and filled with water (26°C). Several visual cues were placed around the pool. The platform was placed at the center of the North-East quadrant of the pool and maintained in this position throughout the four days. Mice were video-tracked (Ethovision 6.1, Noldus; Wageningen, The Netherlands). The time latency to reach the platform was measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rzem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boucherie et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The ‘Y-maze’ test was performed to assess short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rzem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lepannetier et al., 2018</xref>). The Y-maze was made of three identical opaque arms. The test mouse was freely accessible to only two arms for 10 min. After a 30 min inter-trail interval, the third arm was opened and the mouse was put back into the maze. The mouse was video tracked, and the time spent in the novel arm was assessed.</p><p>‘Self-grooming’ and ‘marble burying’ tests were performed to assess repetitive behavior. For self-grooming assessment, mice were individually placed in a clear plastic cage for 20 min. The first 10 min served as a habituation period, and during the second 10 min of testing, time spent grooming was recorded. For the marble burying test, test cages were filled with wood-chip bedding and lightly tamped down to make a flat surface. Twenty glass marbles were placed on the surface in a regular pattern and mice were then placed in the cage.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>This manuscript describes the role of Diaph3 in cortical development. Previous work from this group found that Diaph3 deletion in mice results in the loss of neural progenitors, cell death, and aneuploidy attributed to compromised spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Here they report that DIAPH3 does not only bind to actin network, as expected, but is also localized at the level of the centrosome. The major findings of this paper are: 1) depletion of DIAPH3 causes defects in centrosome formation/mitotic spindle orientation, resulting the mis-segregations of chromosomes; 2) depletion of DIAPH3 leads to the reduction in several other proteins associated with cell polarity and microtubule organization; 3) loss of SPAG5 phenocopies the loss of DIAPH3, and overexpression of SPAG5 can rescue some of the defects in DIAPH3 depleted cells; 4) conditional deletion of Diaph3 in the brain results in microcephaly and behavioral defects. There is concern that the current data are somewhat limited with regards to novel findings compared with the previous report (Damiani 2016), and the new findings on the links with centrosomal function and SPAG5 remain somewhat superficial.</p><p>Reviewers were overall enthusiastic about the findings, pending the summarized modifications below.</p><p>– Assessing the fate of RGC's daughter cells upon division is necessary to conclude on a change of neurogenic output upon loss of Diaph3. The conventional view that spindle orientation is causal to the division mode (in term of fate) of RGC daughters was recently challenged by Matzusaki, so authors should avoid strict correlated asymmetric division with neurogenic division (see page 8, line 150 and data provided in figure 3H-I). It is also important to take this into account when interpretating Diaph3 cKO in figure 4J. In this context it is quite misleading to use 'proliferative' and 'neurogenic' to qualify the division patterns based on mitotic spindle orientation. The authors should better focus on neurogenesis itself using ad hoc labeling (EdU cell cycle exit for instance) or even better, clonal analyses.</p><p>– It is unclear whether the specific loss of Diaph3 in cortical cells, which triggers apoptosis of progenitors, interferes with the assessment of the cell type composition of the cKO developing cortex (progenitors and newborn neurons).</p><p>– The study does not provide sufficient justification for the focus on SPAG5, or even why there is dysregulation of mitotic factors with Diaph3 mutated. Do DIAPH3 and SPAG5 physically interact? Why does knockdown of either protein lead to a decrease in the other? Is this at the protein and or RNA levels? This could be studied by co-immunoprecipitation for instance, both in vitro and from physiologically relevant tissues (like embryonic brain). Can this be quantified by PCR and WB? Could the reduction of SPG5 observed in Diaph3 KO results from loss of telencephalic cells (See Figure S2)? Figure 2D: Is the reduction of SPG5 mRNA mostly in the dorsal forebrain because Diaph3 expression is regionalized? The authors should provide complementary ISH to show the expression pattern of Diaph3 at the same developmental stage.</p><p>– How do to the anatomic neocortical changes relate to behavioural analyses?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DIAPH3 deficiency links microtubules to mitotic errors, defective neurogenesis, and brain dysfunction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been re-evaluated by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Gleeson as the Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.

The updated manuscript includes novel experimental data that answers many of the reviewer questions. Reviewers comment that the new manuscript now includes many of the requested controls, and the BrdU experiments in Figure 4 provide stronger evidence that progenitors in mDiaph3 cKO mice undergo neurogenic divisions at the expense of symmetric proliferation. However, there were several issues that reviewers wished to point out, that could further improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. In Figure 3, there are no control IF images that accompany the shRNA knockdown of Spag5. While the western in Figure 3D shows the efficiency confirms the efficiency of shRNA knockdown, it would be useful to have the images of controls accompanying 3A-C, rather than referring the reader back to the images in Figure 1 (Lines 148-149).</p><p>2. Two separate reviewers commented that the IP in Figure 2K is not convincing. There is a faint smudge in the Diaph3 IP lane, but it looks to migrate at a different molecular weight than the Spag5 in the input lanes. If this is best example of the IP, I suggest removing it to avoid any confusion for the reader. How about IP with SPAG5, does it pull down DIAPH3? What does FT mean?</p><p>3. The cell cycle exit analysis is a welcome addition. But the authors should present data and analysis using BrdU<sup>+</sup> Ki67 – / BrdU<sup>+</sup> (cf Chenn and Walsh Science 2002) – cell cycle exit and not reentry.</p><p>4. Regarding their experiments on spindle pole orientation, the authors should not only remove the words 'proliferative' and 'neurogenic' to qualify the division patterns, but also asymmetric and symmetric, which are equally misleading and not addressed by the data shown.</p><p>5. Specificity of shRNA, especially SPAG5, remains problematic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61974.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Reviewers were overall enthusiastic about the findings, pending the summarized modifications below.</p><p>– Assessing the fate of RGC's daughter cells upon division is necessary to conclude on a change of neurogenic output upon loss of Diaph3.

The use of proliferative/neurogenic based on spindle orientation is not adequate and we have adapted the text accordingly.

Cortex-specific deletion of Diaph3 by Emx1-Cre starts as early as e9.5 and leads to loss of neural progenitor cells. This depletes progressively the pool of progenitors, which impacts on the cell type composition of the developing mutant cortex. However, apoptosis cannot account for alterations of the spindle orientation especially if we consider that fate decisions and spindle orientation are completely unrelated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The study does not provide sufficient justification for the focus on SPAG5, or even why there is dysregulation of mitotic factors with Diaph3 mutated.

Among those, GPSM2, NUMB, PAR3, SPAG5 and KNSTRN had altered expression and/or distribution. We focused on SPAG5 for the following reasons:</p><p>1. SPAG5 displayed the most arresting change in partition in <italic>Diaph3</italic> KO/KD cells;</p><p>2. Knock down of DIAPH3 or SPAG5 produce similar (if not identical) alterations in spindle polarity and chromosome segregation;</p><p>3. SPAG5 and DIAPH3 have the same expression pattern in the developing cortex and overlapping subcellular distribution during mitosis;</p><p>4. Contrary to GPSM2, NUMB, PAR3, nothing is known about the function of SPAG5 in the biology of neural progenitor cells.</p><p>We have now conducted Co-IP experiments, which uncover a “physical” endogenous interaction between the two proteins.

Linage tracing using Emx1-Cre mouse line showed that Emx1 derivatives are glutamatergic neurons of cortical areas such as the neocortex, hippocampus, pallial amygdala, and entorhinal cortex among others (Gorski et al., 2002; Cocas et al., 2009). Interestingly, regions that play important role in social interactions are the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (Huang et al., 2016 and 2020). Patients suffering ASD have alterations in PFC activity and/or connectivity and sensorimotor dysfunctions causing social and motor deficits respectively (Gillbert et al., 2008; Ha et al., 2015; Mosconi and Sweeney 2015; Barak and Feng 2016; Bicks et al., 2015). These regions are interconnected, and their glutamatergic neurons derive from Emx1 progenitors (Gorski et al., 2002; Cocas et al., 2009). In this current work, we showed that Diaph3 is necessary for the normal development of all cortical areas. <italic>Diaph3</italic> conditional knockout mice have severe anatomic changes in cortical areas implicated in social interactions and motor control. Notably, they have reduced number of cortical excitatory neurons. This can affect the excitatory/inhibitory balance and explain the lower sociability and locomotor activity in these mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.

Furthermore, the function of SPAG5 has never been explored in the brain.
