Traditionally, in both vertebrates and invertebrates, neuronal cell types were characterized solely based on anatomical features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bota and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cajal, 1911</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">White et al., 1986</xref>). With the advent of molecular biology and, more recently, single cell transcriptome profiling, neuronal cell type classification has begun to increasingly rely on molecular features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hobert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tasic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). As one might predict, neuronal cell type identity and diversity are defined by neuron type-specific gene batteries that encode the specific structural and functional features of a mature neuron type. While each neuron type expresses a unique gene battery, each individual genetic component of a gene battery is usually expressed in more than one neuron type. For example, the biosynthetic enzymes and transporters that define a specific neurotransmitter phenotype are expressed by multiple distinct cell types (e.g. acetylcholine is used as a neurotransmitter by spinal cord motor neurons, as well as projection neurons in the basal forebrain). Hence, neuron-specific gene batteries are defined by unique combinations of not uniquely expressed genes.</p><p>To understand how cell types in a nervous system differentiate into many distinct neuron types, one needs to understand how the expression of neuron type-specific gene batteries are controlled. Even fully mature neurons generally express many transcription factors (TFs) and one could therefore envision two distinct, extreme models for how neuron type-specific gene batteries are activated: In one case, the âloadâ of controlling gene expression during terminal neuronal differentiation may be distributed somewhat evenly over many distinct TFs, each of which controls expression of subsets of genes of a neuron type-specific gene battery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Contrasting such a âpiecemealâ regulatory model, one could also envision that among the cohorts of TFs expressed in a terminally differentiating neuron type, some TFs may have a broader role than others. In the most stringent version of this model, a âcoordinated regulatoryâ model, a TF (or a cohort of multiple TFs) may jointly regulate most if not all genes of the gene battery that uniquely differentiates one neuron type from another neuron type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Background.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Possible models for regulation of terminal gene batteries.

Its nervous system is composed of only 302 neurons, which fall into a wide range of 118 anatomically defined and molecularly distinct neuron classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hobert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">White et al., 1986</xref>). For each anatomically defined neuron class, a wealth of reporter transgene-based expression data has been available, both for TFs and potential effector gene batteries, that is, genes that encode the ânuts and boltsâ of a mature neuron type, such as neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, neuropeptides, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hobert, 2016b</xref>). These molecular markers have been instrumental for genetic mutant analysis that has identified several distinct TFs that are required for the execution of the differentiation programs of distinct neuron types. The first paradigm of such an analysis involved the two homeobox genes <italic>unc-86</italic> and <italic>mec-3</italic>, identified by their effect on the differentiation of touch sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalfie et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Way and Chalfie, 1988</xref>). Both TFs were found to heterodimerize to directly control the expression of scores of reporter genes that define the phenotype of differentiated touch sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duggan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xue et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). Four additional cases corroborated the UNC-86/MEC-3 scenario and are schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Here again, specific TFs (or heterodimeric combinations thereof) were found to directly control the expression of a large cohort of terminal effector genes in specific neuron classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etchberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kratsios et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masoudi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wenick and Hobert, 2004</xref>). In all cases, nearly all molecular markers that characterize a specific neuron type fail to be expressed in animals lacking the respective TF(s). Moreover, regulation of these molecular markers is often direct, as inferred by (a) the identification of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory binding sites for all of these individual TFs, (b) the presence of these binding sites in effector genes, and (c) the experimentally verified importance of these <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory motifs for gene expression in the respective neuron types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The continuous expression of these factors throughout the life of the respective neuron types combined with conditional gene removal has further illustrated that these factors are not only required for initiation of the respective neuron type-specific gene batteries but also continuously required to maintain their expression. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that individual TFs define the differentiated state of a neuron through a coordinated regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These TFs were called âterminal selectorsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hobert, 2016b</xref>).</p><p>One key question that has remained is how generalizable the concept of coordinated transcriptional control by terminal selector TFs really is across the entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system. A number of studies have attempted to address this question. Based on the analysis of small number of molecular markers in TF mutant backgrounds, multiple TFs have emerged as candidate terminal selectors (summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hobert, 2016a</xref>). For example, in the context of studying glutamatergic neurotransmitter identity specification, we identified a number of TFs that control <italic>eat-4/VGLUT</italic> expression and we showed that these factors also control a small number of additional identity features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>). However, the often very limited number of molecular markers tested in the TF mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) has left the question open whether these TFs are indeed broadly controlling the many distinct identity features of a neuron. Moreover, with the notable exception of the cases mentioned above (and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>), it is not clear whether most of these TFs <italic>directly</italic> control terminal effector genes and, hence, whether they are indeed the best candidate terminal selectors for the given neuron classes. Lastly, the number of known transcriptional regulators of neuronal identity remains limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hobert, 2016a</xref>), even within the relatively small nervous system of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> composed of 118 neuron classes.</p><p>In this paper, we set out to test how broadly applicable the terminal selector concept is and to ask whether we can predict regulators of neuronal identity throughout the entire nervous system.

We indeed find such enrichment among the gene batteries of all individual neuron types. Therefore, our analysis (a) provides strong support for the concept of terminal selector TFs in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system and (b) predicts novel terminal selectors for many neuronally expressed TFs for most neuron types of the nervous system.

We reasoned that the likelihood of a TF binding site bearing relevance for the activation of a nearby gene is much increased if a site is phylogenetically conserved in the cross-species orthologs of that gene. We previously validated this assumption in the following manner: we generated a software pipeline, CisOrtho, that interrogated the genome of two nematode species, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic>, for binding sites for the heteromeric TTX-3::CEH-10 complex that is exclusively expressed in the AIY interneurons (called âAIY motifâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigelow et al., 2004</xref>). Orthologous genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> that contain conserved copies of the AIY motif were indeed confirmed to be expressed in AIY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigelow et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wenick and Hobert, 2004</xref>). We further developed this phylogenetic footprinting approach, predicting and experimentally validating additional TF targets based on binding site conservation criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glenwinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these previous findings, we developed a novel software pipeline, called TargetOrtho2. TargetOrtho2 uses multiple species phylogeny and supervised learning to identify TF target genes from instances of binding sequences that are likely to be functionally relevant for gene expression.</p><p>As described in detail in the Materials and methods section, TargetOrtho2 is a tool for predicting TF target genes from putative TF binding sites in non-coding genomic sequences. Taking a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) as input, TargetOrtho2 uses FIMO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grant et al., 2011</xref>) to find individual motif occurrences among the genomes of multiple species. Motif matches in upstream and intronic genome regions of orthologous genes from multiple nematode genomes are used to score candidate TF target genes by accounting for motif conservation in orthologs, frequency, and log-odds scores derived from the PSSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Candidate TF target genes are rank ordered based on motif feature data per gene. Rather than ranking candidate TF regulatory target genes based on non-weighted normalized motif feature scores as in the previous published version of TargetOrtho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glenwinkel et al., 2014</xref>), we tested and implemented a supervised learning approach in which previous in vivo validated TF target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) motif features are used to train a classifier for predicting and ranking novel TF target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To evaluate which supervised learning approach was superior in distinguishing true TF target genes from random genes in the genome with a DNA binding motif present, we employed a cross-validation scheme in which motif features from validated TF target genes (genes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were shuffled together with random genes with a DNA binding motif.

We gave no preference for whether a TF has previously been found to be involved in neuronal identity specification. Our only criteria for analyzing TFs were that (a) binding sites were available for our enrichment analysis and (b) those TFs were expressed throughout the life of a neuron, a key feature of candidate terminal selectors.

This finding is expected based on past functional analysis of terminal selectors: between 8% and 36% of reporter genes whose expression is terminal selector-dependent based on mutant analysis have either no predicted binding site or a poorly ranked binding site (bottom 50% percentile of genome-wide candidate TF target genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For example, of 23 ASE-expressed reporter genes that lose expression in <italic>che-1</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etchberger et al., 2007</xref>), four have no predicted CHE-1 binding site and four others are poorly ranked CHE-1 target genes by TargetOrtho2. Expression of such reporter genes is either initiated using sub-threshold binding sites (below the FIMO scanner threshold of p=1e-4) or by indirect regulation, in which a terminal selector regulates the expression of another TF that then controls the specific effector gene. Several examples of indirect, âfeedforwardâ regulation have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altun-Gultekin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Etchberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon and Hobert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kratsios et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we argue that while terminal selectors tend to have an enrichment of binding sites in the neuron class gene batteries they regulate, implicating them in direct regulation, we also expect a degree of indirect regulation.</p><p>Set apart from the âcoordinated regulatoryâ motif signatures are âpiecemeal regulatoryâ motif signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, green). We observe that with increasing evidence of direct regulation (number of TF-dependent markers examined with reporters), the probability of observing a coordinated regulatory motif signature (putative terminal selector signature) increases. For example, the TF CEH-14 has just three reported target genes in PHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>) and has a âpiecemeal regulatoryâ motif signature while TFs with more than 20 experimentally validated target genes all display a âcoordinated regulatoryâ motif signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Other TFs with âcoordinated regulatoryâ motif signatures are better candidate terminal selectors than the TFs with previous genetic loss-of-function data in these cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2F</xref> for best candidate terminal selector per neuron class).</p><p>In most neuron classes, we observe a combination of âcoordinated regulatoryâ and âpiecemeal regulatoryâ motif signatures suggesting that neuron class gene batteries are regulated by both broad and targeted regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2C,E,F</xref>).

This included, for example, the case of the heteromerically acting TTX-3 and CEH-10 homeodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wenick and Hobert, 2004</xref>). For 16 out of these 17 cases, we observed significant co-enrichment and ranking of TargetOrtho2-predicted target genes, suggesting that co-expressed terminal selectors with coordinated regulatory motif signatures mainly target common effector genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2D</xref>). For example, the CEH-14 LIM homeobox gene and the UNC-86 POU homeobox genes are predicted to co-regulate the gene battery of the PHC neurons based on the presence of co-enriched binding sites in the PHC gene battery and this prediction is validated by genetic analysis that showed loss of a number of PHC markers in <italic>unc-86</italic> and <italic>ceh-14</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, CEH-14 and CFI-1 binding sites are co-enriched in the same set of genes that constitute the effector gene battery of the cholinergic PVC neurons (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2D</xref> for co-enrichment statistics) and genetic mutant analysis has previously confirmed loss of PVC marker gene expression in <italic>ceh-14</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>), and, as we have shown above, <italic>cfi-1</italic> affects PVC marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Taken together, we refer to this scenario as co-terminal selectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>We extended this analysis to all neuron classes throughout the nervous system. Rather than evaluating all possible combinations of TFs per neuron class for binding site co-enrichments entailing hundreds of thousands of possible combinations of cofactors and significance tests, we chose to evaluate cofactors in pairs, an approach that is computationally more feasible. One may examine the results of all co-enrichment significance tests to infer larger combinations of cofactor TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2G</xref>). We examined pairs of candidate terminal selectors (defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) expressed in the same neuron class and asked if these also tend to target common genes in a neuron type. Of these candidate terminal selector pairs (where motif 1 and motif 2 have a coordinated regulatory motif signature), we find that 98% show common target genes suggesting that a combinatorial activity of TFs is the predominant mode of effector gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2G</xref>). For example, our analysis predicts that UNC-3 and UNC-42, rather than acting in parallel pathways, both target common effector genes in the command interneurons, a group of interconnected neurons controlling locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <italic>Supplementary File S2G</italic>). While many cofactor pairs are predicted to target common effector genes in one or several command interneurons, the UNC-3::UNC-42 pair uniquely shows co-motif enrichment in all command interneuron gene batteries. In an accompanying manuscript, we validate such cooperative function of <italic>unc-42</italic> and <italic>unc-3</italic> in specifying command interneuron identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berghoff et al., 2021</xref>).

The expression patterns of this reporter collection cover all 118 neuron classes, with a median 57 of reporters expressed per neuron class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We first checked the four <italic>bona fide</italic> terminal selector motif signatures among Brain Atlas reporters and find coordinated regulatory motif signatures among their seven target neuron classes (UNC-3 in DA,DB,VA,VB; CHE-1 in ASE; TTX-3::CEH-10 in AIY, HLH-4 in ADL) in agreement with motif analysis of corresponding single cell differential expression profile data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3A</xref>).

A comparison between single cell and Brain Atlas datasets shows that the proportion of genes with motifs per neuron class is highly correlated (Spearman correlation = 0.80, p=0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) despite the independent nature of each dataset (marker population overlap per neuron class varies from 0% to 11%, average 4.5%).

In most cases, the phenotypic analysis of such TF knockout strains was limited to a small number of molecular markers, hence leaving it unclear how broadly a TF affected the overall identity of a neuron. However, in some instances, these studies extended to a large array of functional and molecular identity features. In all of these cases, most if not all available molecular identity markers were found to be affected by specific TFs, leading to the classification of these TFs as âmaster regulatoryâ TFs, or terminal selectors, that broadly define neuronal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2008</xref>). The key operational feature of terminal selectors is that they broadly affect terminally identity features of a neuron, without affecting the initial generation of the neuron (thereby setting them apart from earlier acting patterning genes) and that they are continuously expressed throughout the life of a neuron, thereby indicating roles in not only coordinating the initiation but also the maintenance of terminal identity features. Yet, even in the most deeply studied cases, the breadth by which these TFs affect, that is, coordinate, the expression of neuron type-specific gene batteries remained unclear. Do they indeed coordinate the expression of most of the terminal identity features of a neuron?</p><p>Here, we have described a systematic study of the potential range of the activity of individual TFs in individual neuron classes. Specifically, the recent availability of single cell expression profiles of the mature <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>) and the elucidation of DNA binding specificity of many <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weirauch et al., 2014</xref>) has enabled us to ask whether neuron type-specific gene batteries can indeed be expected to be controlled by a coordinated mechanism. It is important to recall that, a priori, different models could be envisioned for how neuron type-specific gene batteries are controlled (âpiecemeal controlâ by many TFs versus âcoordinated regulationâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our analysis provides support for the coordinated, terminal selector-type model of neuron identity specification. The gene batteries of essentially all individual <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuron classes were found to display enrichment of phylogenetically conserved <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motifs. Importantly, these motifs were not identified de novo, but were the in vitro-defined binding sites of TF(s) known to be expressed in the respective neuron class.</p><p>The purely computational identification of binding site enrichment alone would already be quite suggestive for a regulatory relationship between the TFs and the genes that contain these binding sites. Yet, a <italic>de facto</italic> experimental validation of such regulatory relationship has already been provided in the past through many genetic loss-of-function studies. For example, the gene battery expressed in the AWA olfactory neurons is enriched for the in vitro binding site of the nuclear hormone receptor ODR-7 and genetic loss-of-function studies had previously shown that ODR-7 regulates one such AWA-expressed effector gene with an ODR-7 binding site, the GPCR-encoding <italic>odr-10</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sengupta et al., 1996</xref>). We further validated here several additional loci as ODR-7 targets in vivo. Altogether, several dozen neuron classes were already associated with a TF that affected the expression of one or some very few targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hobert, 2016a</xref>). Based on our finding of enriched, phylogenetically conserved binding sites, we found that these TFs are also predicted to control many other specific features of the respective neuron class. Hence, a coordinated regulatory control mechanism appears to be the major mode by which neuronal identity specification is achieved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Even though there is a significant enrichment of binding sites for terminal selectors in neuron type-specific gene batteries, not every gene battery member contains high-scoring, well-conserved binding sites. This could indicate either non-conventional binding or indirect regulation via intermediary factors. It is also possible that some members of a terminal gene battery are regulated instead by different factors, but if this were the case, such factors would only be responsible to regulate a subset of identity features. The enrichment of bindings sites â as well as extensive past genetic loss-of-function analysis â clearly underscores the predominant role of terminal selectors in neuronal identity control.</p><p>Another key conclusion from our study is that it provides and supports a concrete mechanistic basis for combinatorial control mechanisms in neuronal identity specification. Previous genetic loss-of-function studies have shown that in many different neuron types, the removal of not just one, but two or more TFs resulted in similar types of neuron identity specification defects. In the two best characterized cases, UNC-86 and MEC-3 homeodomain TFs bind cooperatively to adjacent binding sites in touch neuron-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xue et al., 1993</xref>) and the CEH-10 and TTX-3 homeodomain TFs bind cooperatively to adjacent binding sites in the AIY interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wenick and Hobert, 2004</xref>). The present study reveals that the terminal gene batteries of most neuron classes tend to show an enrichment of phylogenetically conserved sites for more than one predicted terminal selector, in several cases more than a dozen. Since the binding sites for such collaborating factors are co-enriched in the same target genes, these factors either bind DNA cooperatively and/or operate as a transcription factor collective on their target promoters . Many of these predicted cofactor combinations are homeodomain proteins, which is consistent with our recent finding that each individual neuron class in <italic>C. elegans</italic> expresses a unique combination of homeodomain TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reilly et al., 2020</xref>). Our binding site analysis demonstrates that those âhomedomain codesâ leave phylogenetically conserved, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory footprints in neuron type-specific gene batteries and corroborate their critical role in neuronal identity specification.</p><p>A number of limitations of our studies are notable. First and foremost, our pipeline entirely relies on prior knowledge about the existence of TF binding sites; it is not designed for de novo motif discovery, a feature handled by other software suits including MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>) or FIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elemento et al., 2007</xref>). Not all <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFs currently have well-defined binding sites and, as such, our analysis likely underestimates the number of regulators of neuronal identity. Moreover, we excluded 94 DNA binding motifs (41% of 215 available motifs) that were highly similar to other <italic>C. elegans</italic> TFs to avoid ambiguous motif signatures where one or more TFs may use the same binding site. This circumstance is especially problematic if more than one such TF is expressed in the same cell in which case it not possible to use DNA motif evidence to infer how broadly these TFs regulate their targets. Also, our (partial) reliance on in vitro derived DNA binding sites does not take into account the possibility that binding sites may differ in vivo. In spite of these limitations, our analysis provides strong support for the terminal selector model of neuron type specification and it provides a rich resource for future experimentation. In principle, prediction of neuronal regulators using this type of phylogenetic analysis can be undertaken in any cohort of well-conserved genomes with well-defined orthology assignments.</p><p>The breadth by which the coordinated regulatory principle appears to operate throughout the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that this principle may be used broadly in other organisms as well. The study of a number of TFs in the vertebrate nervous system suggests that coordinated regulation of terminal gene batteries by terminal selectors is indeed conserved across phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>), even though the evidence is currently limited. One general problem in revealing functions of TFs during terminal differentiation in more complex organisms is that many TFs are often utilized at multiple distinct steps during development, including early progenitor specification. Hence, simple, non-temporally controlled mutant analysis will obscure later functions. For example, vertebrate HOX cluster genes have functions in early patterning of the spinal cord, but their function and expression during later stages of terminal differentiation have, surprisingly, remained unstudied. In spite of these often encountered challenges, a few notable examples of putative vertebrate terminal selectors include the Ets domain TF Pet1, which in combination with other factors broadly coordinates expression of terminal identity markers of serotonergic neurons in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Spencer and Deneris, 2017</xref>), several Dlx homeodomain factors which directly control and maintain terminal identity features in forebrain GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindtner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pla et al., 2018</xref>), the Lhx2 protein in olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monahan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), Brn3a in the habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2018</xref>), Dlx homeodomain proteins in forebrain GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindtner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pla et al., 2018</xref>), the Pitx3 homeodomain protein in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smidt and Burbach, 2009</xref>), or the homeodomain protein Crx in in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbo et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>TargetOrtho2</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Improvement in computation time</title><p>TargetOrtho2 is approximately 50 times faster than the previous version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glenwinkel et al., 2014</xref>) with run times averaging 20 min per job (median 17.8 min, range 8 to 80 min, FIMO p-value threshold = 1e-4).

For each of the 10 sets (size 2N), the data is randomly shuffled and split in half. One half is used to train a classifier, the other half is used as the validation set. The training half and validation half are then swapped in a twofold validation scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In reality, some of these genes will indeed be true positives (real TF target genes), but we expect motif features among a randomized set have distinct features (such as lower conservation and PSSM scores, etc.) from a complete set of true positive TF target genes. Because we only know when true positives are correctly labeled as TF target genes and when false negatives are incorrectly labeled as non-target genes, we use recall (true positives/[true positives + false negatives]) to assess each classifierâs performance. Additionally, we can test whether the rank order of correctly identified true positives in the validation set is significantly better than randomly drawn gene motif feature data using the Wilcoxon rank sums test. We found that a GPC modeled on the combined motif data from all three terminal selectors is the most accurate for the classification problem at hand (median recall = 0.8, median rank sums test Z score = 6.06, p&lt;1e-9) with the most informative features being upstream and intronic motif match frequency, max log-odds motif score in upstream and intronic regions, plus upstream and intron motif match conservation among the eight nematode genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study combines single cell RNA-seq and transcription factor DNA-binding data to help resolve the regulatory logic behind neuronal sub-type specification in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They find that most neurons appear to be specified not by one TF but by a combination of TFs. They also find that while the majority of TFs act on the whole cohort of effector genes that define each neuron type, a minority of TFs only appear to act on a subset of effector genes. That some TFs play a more comprehensive role while others only control sub-routines has also been demonstrated before. Hence, the study is not conceptually novel. Yet, the study represents a major leap forward due to the complete identification of all neuronal sub-classes in C.elegans, and because the compressed worm genome allows for meaningful TF-to-target-gene predictions, something that is difficult in mammals. From these perspectives the study will be of broad interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors comprehensively analyze all worm neurons for scRNA sequence data, transgene expression data, and conserved TF binding site data. They test the hypothesis that distinct single or pairs of TFs act as terminal selectors for each of the 118 defined neuronal classes. This is in contrast to &quot;piecemeal&quot; regulation of each neuronal class by multiple TFs that each control a small portion of the relevant gene expression program. The manuscript integrates previous data sets and provides some new experimental tests of their proposed terminal selector model. They find that most neurons appear to be specified not by one TF but by a combination of TFs. This concept was previously demonstrated in flies and mice, but only for selected neurons. Here they find that while the majority of TFs act on the whole cohort of effector genes that define each neuron type, a minority of TFs act on only a subset of effector genes. However, they use conflicting terminology for these important TFs that should be clarified for the benefit of the wider neural development field, as <italic>C. elegans</italic> often leads the way for other model systems. Although the study is not conceptually novel, it represents a major leap forward due to the complete identification of all neuronal sub-classes in C.elegans, and because the compressed worm genome allows for meaningful TF-to-target-gene predictions, something that is difficult in mammals. Finally, the paper generates interesting testable hypotheses for understanding neuronal diversity in other animals.</p><p>The majority deal with presenting a clear definition of terms used.</p><p>1. As the authors point out, the linkage of TFs to target genes based upon known in vitro or in silico predicted DNA binding is merely correlative, and finding target sites in a downstream gene frustratingly often does not translate into direct regulation. There are several reasons for the limited correlation between TF sites and direct regulation e.g. change in TF PWM when binding as monomer or homodimer, change in TF PWM when binding as monomer or heterodimer, and because bona fide target sites can be low affinity sites that do not match the PWM (PMID 25557079). Yet the Abstract states that &quot;our nervous system wide analysis at single cell resolution demonstrates that many transcription factors directly co-regulate the cohort of effector genes that define a neuron type&quot;. This phrasing implies causal relationships rather than correlative findings. Similarly, explicitly stating that some TFs are &quot;piece meal&quot; regulators while others are &quot;master regulators&quot; chiefly based upon correlative data also seems to be a bit of a stretch. It would be a good hypothesis to leave for future functional studies.</p><p>2. The term &quot;master regulator&quot; was introduced already in the 80s and early 90s, triggered by the potency of e.g., mammalian MyoD to convert fibroblasts into myoblasts, by Antp to convert the fly antennae into legs, and by Eya (Pax6) in converting fly legs into eyes. The authors previously deserted this nomenclature, and introduced the name &quot;terminal selectors&quot;, defined as TFs that (A) directly regulate (B) all aspects of a neuron's identity, and (C) acted throughout the neuron's life.</p><p>However, because many TFs do not fit this description (indeed, there is probably not a single fly or mouse TF that currently qualifies on all three counts) they are now running into &quot;semantical problems&quot;. Specifically:</p><p>A. In this study, indirect regulation by some TFs on some target gene(s) is as high as 36%. By definition (A) these TFs are not &quot;terminal selectors&quot; then. What should these TFs be called? &quot;Indirectly acting terminal selectors&quot;?</p><p>B1. Some of the regulation is &quot;piece meal&quot; i.e., some TFs only control expression of a subset of the sub-type specific genes.

As the authors point out, the linkage of TFs to target genes based upon known in vitro or in silico predicted DNA binding is merely correlative, and finding target sites in a downstream gene frustratingly often does not translate into direct regulation. There are several reasons for the limited correlation between TF sites and direct regulation e.g. change in TF PWM when binding as monomer or homodimer, change in TF PWM when binding as monomer or heterodimer, and because bona fide target sites can be low affinity sites that do not match the PWM (PMID 25557079). Yet the Abstract states that &quot;our nervous system wide analysis at single cell resolution demonstrates that many transcription factors directly co-regulate the cohort of effector genes that define a neuron type&quot;. This phrasing implies causal relationships rather than correlative findings. Similarly, explicitly stating that some TFs are &quot;piece meal&quot; regulators while others are &quot;master regulators&quot; chiefly based upon correlative data also seems to be a bit of a stretch. It would be a good hypothesis to leave for future functional studies.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Abstract, we changed âdemonstratesâ to âindicatesâ. Nevertheless, we wish to point out that our analysis is not purely correlational, i.e. our conclusions are not merely based on presence/absence of binding sites. There is a very substantial amount of reporter analysis done â mainly in the literature, but also in this manuscript â that shows that shows that many of the TFs under investigation have an effect on reporter gene expression, and we show here that this genetic dependency is parallel by the presence of binding sites. In several cases, we have also mutated such binding sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The term &quot;master regulator&quot; was introduced already in the 80s and early 90s, triggered by the potency of e.g., mammalian MyoD to convert fibroblasts into myoblasts, by Antp to convert the fly antennae into legs, and by Eya (Pax6) in converting fly legs into eyes. The authors previously deserted this nomenclature, and introduced the name &quot;terminal selectors&quot;, defined as TFs that (A) directly regulate (B) all aspects of a neuron's identity, and (C) acted throughout the neuron's life.</p><p>However, because many TFs do not fit this description (indeed, there is probably not a single fly or mouse TF that currently qualifies on all three counts) they are now running into &quot;semantical problems&quot;. Specifically:</p><p>A. In this study, indirect regulation by some TFs on some target gene(s) is as high as 36%. By definition (A) these TFs are not &quot;terminal selectors&quot; then. What should these TFs be called? &quot;Indirectly acting terminal selectors&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate that these definitional issues are brought up â it has helped us to improve terminology throughout the manuscript. It is true that direct regulation (point A) has been a feature of the terminal selector definition. However: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. If we see a good site that is conserved we infer itâs functional. But if we do NOT see a good site that is conserved, we canât exclude the terminal selector does not bind: it may bind to a poorer site thatâs below our detection threshold, or the site may simply not be conserved in other nematode species. Hence, because the absence of direct regulation is difficult to prove, perhaps it is more useful for the definition of a terminal selector to âonlyâ invoke the operational, genetic criteria of a neuronâs identity being very severely affected, be that via direct regulation or not. This is of course along the lines of the original definition âselectorâ, which also made no assumptions about biochemical mechanisms, but rather invoked the operational definition of affecting the identity of developing fields/organs. The âterminalâ addition to âselectorâ â an important extension of this concept â should be viewed as operational as well, in the sense that terminal identity features are gone in the mutant, without affecting the generation of the neuron. Plus, terminal identity features are continuously controlled. This is often direct, but may not have to be.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now discuss this point, we hope, clearly and succinctly, in a substantially revised Discussion (which was requested to be improved anyway, so that fits well). We have also carefully combed through the manuscript and minimized the usage of the word âmaster regulatoryâ and now instead call such regulation âcoordinated regulatory controlâ, to indicate that one factor (or a specific factor combination) coordinate the expression of many members of a gene battery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B1.

So what is the difference between a &quot;master regulator&quot; and a &quot;terminal selector&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This is again a spot-on criticism that indeed requires clarification. First and foremost, we indeed do NOT believe that piecemeal regulators should be called terminal selectors; that would not properly reflect the intellectual history of the âselectorâ terminology. The reason we ârevivedâ here the âmaster regulatoryâ term is to contrast the âterminal selectorâ mode of regulation with the âpiece-mealâ regulation role. Hence, in the original version of the manuscript, we appended the term âmaster regulatoryâ to âterminal selectorâ, hence making it âPiecemeal TFsâ vs âmaster-regulatory terminal selectorsâ. With the reviewerâs criticism we are now realizing that weâre wading into old nomenclature issues about what âmaster regulatoryâ traditionally means. It used to mean (based on factors like MyoD or Pax6/eyeless) that such factors have the ability of factors to ECTOPICALLY induce specific fates. Unfortunately, the term has become loaded with this sufficiency criterion, which never was even true â because all the above-mentioned factors were only able to exert their âmaster regulatoryâ function in specific cellular contexts. To avoid moving into such terminology territory, we minimized the usage of the word âmaster regulatoryâ and now instead call such regulation âcoordinated regulatory controlâ, to indicate that one factor (or a specific factor combination) coordinate the expression of many members of a gene battery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C.

Cholinergic markers are undoubtedly a key feature of neuron type-specific gene batteries and, hence, a key feature of neuronal identity. But, of course, they are NOT the sole defining feature of a neuronâs identity; many different types of neurons are cholinergic. But this is a feature for most molecular identity markers are a neuron â they are rarely ever exclusively expressed in one neuron class and nowhere else. Perhaps this is where the request for definition of identity/neuron class/type etc. comes from? We thought we explained this well enough in the first paragraph of the Introduction, but we now appended this paragraph to make this clearer: Any neuron-type specific gene batteries that defines a neuronâs identity is composed of individual features that are shared by other neurons as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3B.
