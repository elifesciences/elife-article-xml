information processing steps between the onset of the stimulus and the response. Despite extensive research, uncertainty remains about the actual cognitive sequence involved that leads to the reaction time. Using the hidden multivariate pattern method, we modeled the single-trial electroencephalogram of participants performing a decision task as a sequence of an unknown number of events estimated as trial-recurrent, time-varying, stable topographies. We provide evidence for five events occurring during participants’ decision-making with two visual encoding events and three events capturing respectively attention orientation, decision, and motor execution. This interpretation is supported by the observation that a targeted manipulation of stimulus intensity yields Piéron’s law in the interval between encoding and attention orientation, and Fechner’s law in the interval between attention orientation and decision commitment. The final decision-related event is represented in the brain as a ramping signal in parietal areas whose timing, amplitude, and build-up predict the participants’ decision accuracy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision</kwd><kwd>reaction time</kwd><kwd>psychophysics</kwd><kwd>electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>event-related potential</kwd><kwd>single-trial</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>Horizon Europe Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/101066503</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weindel</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name><name><surname>van Maanen</surname><given-names>Leendert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Air Force Research Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OARD FA8655-22-1-7003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borst</surname><given-names>Jelmer P</given-names></name><name><surname>van Maanen</surname><given-names>Leendert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By modeling the single-trial electroencephalogram of participants performing perceptual decisions, and building on predictions from two century-old psychological laws, we estimate the times of information processing steps contained in decision-making.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Making a decision involves several information processing steps within the time from the presentation of a stimulus to the response. The total time required for the completion of each of these processing steps is the reaction time (RT). Specific processes differ between experimental paradigms, but a minimal set that seems to be agreed upon involves encoding of the choice-relevant features of the stimuli, followed by weighting the evidence for each choice, and initiating a response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donders, 1868</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zylberberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luce, 1986</xref>). Despite being an almost two century-old problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helmholtz, 1850</xref>), it is unclear how the RT emerges from these putative components.</p><p>The answer to this problem has first been hampered by the relatively poor information gained from RT and response-accuracy data alone. Co-registering physiological signals can clarify and extend conclusions about information processing steps in the RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turner et al., 2017</xref>). Evidence for the putative components that make up RT has been found by registering the electroencephalogram (EEG) during decision tasks. First, a negative deflection in occipital electrodes happening around 200ms after the presentation of a choice, the N200, has been associated with visual encoding of the choice elements by participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ritter et al., 1979</xref>). Second, EEG data has shown that the weighting of evidence toward the alternatives is associated with a positive voltage developing over centro-parietal electrodes after early visual potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kutas et al., 1977</xref>). Computational models of decision-making explain the experimental effects observed on these centro-parietal components as an evidence accumulation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>). Lastly, a component preceding the response has been shown to lateralize with the side of the executed response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coles et al., 1985</xref>). This lateralized readiness potential (LRP) has later been described as arising from an accumulation-to-bound mechanism describing the decision to produce a movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schurger et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, the knowledge gained on the nature and latencies of cognitive processes within the stimulus-response interval from such electrophysiological components is limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio of classical neural measurements. To improve the SNR, researchers usually rely on information derived from the averaging of these signals over many trials. Unfortunately, averaging time-varying signals will result in an average waveform that misrepresents the underlying single-trial events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borst and Anderson, 2024</xref>). In the case of decision-making, several studies have shown wide trial-by-trial variation of the timing of cognitively relevant neural events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vidaurre et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smyrnis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weindel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weindel, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, averaged components are further distorted by the fact that multiple cognitive processes and associated EEG components are typically present within trials and overlap in time between trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woldorff, 1993</xref>), forcing researchers to study physiological components in isolation. A few studies have been able to simultaneously investigate multiple EEG components in decision-making using single-trial approaches. As an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Philiastides et al., 2006</xref> used a classifier on the EEG activity of several conditions to show that the strength of an early EEG component was proportional to the strength of the stimulus, while a later component was related to decision difficulty and behavioral performance (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salvador et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Philiastides and Sajda, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the authors interpreted that a third EEG component was indicative of the resource allocated to the upcoming decision given the perceived decision difficulty. In their study, they showed that it is possible to use single-trial information to separate cognitive processes within decision-making. Nevertheless, their method requires separate classifiers for each component of interest, limiting the analysis to existing theory of distinct components.</p><p>One potential solution mixing both behavior and multivariate analysis of single-trial neural signal to achieve single-trial resolution has emerged through the development of the hidden multivariate methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). These methods model the neural data of each trial as a sequence of short-lived multivariate cortex-wide events, repeated at each trial, whose timing varies on a trial-by-trial basis and define the RT. In the case of EEG, it is assumed that any cognitive step involved in the RT is represented by a specific topography recurring across trials. The time jitter in the topography is accounted for by estimating, for each of these events, a trial-wise distribution where the expected time of the peak of the topography is given by the time distribution of the previous event’s peak and the expected time distribution of the current event. By constraining, through the recorded behavior, the search for trial-shared sequential activations in the EEG during estimated ranges of time, the hidden multivariate pattern (HMP) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>) provides an estimation of the number of events and their single-trial latency during each trial. Previous similar approaches have shown that different information processing steps can be extracted from the EEG in a wide range of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berberyan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krause et al., 2024</xref>). Building on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Maanen et al., 2021</xref>), we expect that the EEG data of a decision-making task will be decomposed into task-relevant intervals indexing the information processing steps in the RT. In the current study, we combine this single-trial modeling strategy with strong theoretical expectations regarding the impact of experimental manipulations on the latent information processing steps during decision-making.</p><p>The task of the participants was to answer which of two Gabor patches flanking a fixation cross displayed the highest contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, top panel). On a trial-by-trial basis, we manipulated the average contrast of both patches but kept the difference between them constant (see the two example trials in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, one with an average contrast of 5%, and one with an average contrast of 95%, both with a difference of 5%). We hypothesize that this contrast manipulation generates two opposing predictions on encoding and decision processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weindel et al., 2022</xref>) associated with two of the oldest laws in psychophysics: Piéron’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piéron, 1913</xref>) and Fechner’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fechner, 1860</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Contrast manipulation used in the experiment.</title><p>Top shows two example stimuli illustrating minimum (left) and maximum (right) contrast values.

The Fechner diffusion model additionally includes nondecision and decision threshold parameters (see ‘Materials and methods’).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-108049-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Piéron’s law predicts that the time to perceive the two stimuli (and thus the choice situation) should follow a negative power law with the stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, green curve). In contradistinction, Fechner’s law states that the perceived difference between the two patches follows the logarithm of the absolute contrast of the two patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, yellow curve). As the task of our participants is to judge the contrast difference, Piéron’s law should predict the time at which the comparison starts (i.e., the stimuli become perceptible), while Fechner’s law should implement the comparison, and thus decision, difficulty. Given that Fechner’s law is expected to capture decision difficulty, we connected this law to evidence accumulation models by replacing the rate of accumulation with Fechner’s law in the proportional rate diffusion model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>. This linking with an evidence accumulation model further allows connecting the RT to the proportion of correct responses. To test the generalizability of our findings and allow comparison to standard decision-making tasks, we also included a speed–accuracy manipulation by asking participants to either focus on the speed or the accuracy of their responses in different experimental blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All results were obtained from the data of 26 participants, with the recorded EEG band-passed filtered between 0.01 and 40 Hz. Trials with an RT faster than 100 ms or slower than 3000 ms or in which an electrode exceeded a rejection threshold of 100 μV during the stimulus-response interval were rejected (3.1% of trials were rejected, see ‘Materials and methods’ section for a full report). The HMP model assumed that a task-related multivariate pattern event is represented by a half-sine whose timing varies from trial to trial based on a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 2 and a to-be-estimated scale parameter, controlling the average latency of the event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>).

and predicted the proportion of correct responses closely. However, when speed was stressed – and consequently one or more of the underlying cognitive processes was shorter – Fechner’s law did no longer explain the behavioral data; instead, a linear model fitted the data best. It is unlikely that neither Piéron nor Fechner law impacts the RT in the speed condition. Instead, this result is likely due to the composite nature of the RT where both laws co-exist in the RT but cancel each other out. We explored this in the next sections by applying HMP to the EEG data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Five trial-recurrent sequential events occur in the EEG during decisions</title><p>Modeling the EEG between stimulus and response as a sequence of multivariate half-sines with a 25 ms duration with varying trial-by-trial latencies revealed that five events are necessary to account for the EEG data. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the cumulative probability of occurrences of the events, thereby indicating how variable the latency of the events was over trials. Overlaid on the probabilities, we represent each event at their averaged time location as well as the averaged electrode activity.

The linear mixed model on this interval suggests a weak effect of contrast in the speed instruction (contrast coefficient, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), but the credible intervals included 0. The intervals from Event 1 to Event 2 as well as Event 2 to Event 3 were both best explained by Piéron’s law in both speed–accuracy instructions and displayed a negative effect of contrast in the linear mixed models. The interval from Event 3 to Event 4 was best explained by Fechner’s law in accuracy but not in speed. The linear mixed coefficient does, however, suggest that an increase in the duration with an increase of contrast is also present in the speed condition. The interval between the detected HMP Event 4 and Event 5 is best explained by Fechner’s law in both speed and accuracy instructions with a clear positive effect of contrast on the latency of this interval. Regarding the effect of speed–accuracy conditions, as shown by the linear mixed models (SAT coefficient, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), all intervals are affected by the instructions to the notable exception of the interval from the stimulus onset to the first event.

The observation that an early interval that seems associated with perception fits Piéron’s law is congruent with earlier empirical observations that Piéron’s law is associated with stimulus detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piéron, 1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banks, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chocholle, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Overbosch et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonnet et al., 1999</xref>). Note that this observation is not necessarily incongruent with theoretical work that argued that Piéron’s law could also be a result of a response selection mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stafford and Gurney, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Maanen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>). It could be that differences in stimulus intensity between the two options also contribute to a Piéron-like relationship in the later intervals, that is convoluted with Fechner’s law (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donkin and Van Maanen, 2014</xref>, for a similar argument).

We also showed that the contrast manipulation impacted the times between the identified EEG events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) as expected by two century-old psychophysical laws. The dynamics of each event, both in relation to the contrast manipulation as well as their build-up, can be instrumental in interpreting their functional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coles et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>). One traditional representation of the time course of specific events is to draw the trial-averaged voltage time course for a set of electrodes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> represents, for three typical sets of electrodes (top panels), the average ERP for each speed–accuracy instruction and the contrast binned in 10 equally spaced bins. Gray lines show the average occurrence of the sequential events. To test for a significant effect of contrast, we performed a nonparametric cluster-level paired <italic>t</italic>-test for the participant-averaged time series for low (&lt; 50%) vs. high (&gt; 50%) contrasts in both speed–accuracy instructions separately. This representation shows that there is an inversion of the contrast effect with higher contrasts having a higher amplitude on the electrodes associated with visual potentials in the first couple of deciseconds (left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) while parietal and frontal electrodes show a higher amplitude for lower contrasts in later portions of the ERPs (middle and right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Nevertheless, identifying neural dynamics on these ERPs centered on stimulus is complicated by the time variation of the underlying single-trial events (see probabilities displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for an illustration and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burle et al., 2008</xref> for a discussion). The likely impact of contrast on both amplitude and time on the underlying single-trial event does not allow for interpreting the average ERP traces as showing an effect in one or the other dimension without strong assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luck, 2005</xref>). If, as estimated by the HMP method, we access the time of single-trial events, we can instead time-lock electrode activity at the time of the event and analyze amplitude by controlling for time variation of the single-trial events.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Electrophysiological analysis of the time leading to each event.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stimulus-centered event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained by averaging three electrodes in occipital, parietal, and frontal areas across trials and participants for 10 binned contrast levels in both speed–accuracy instructions.

For each speed–accuracy instruction, the data is presented at the single-trial level (surface plot), with trials sorted by the single trial most likely peak time of the event, and averaged across trials for 10 contrast bins after aligning to the most likely peak time of the event (waveform plot). On the surface plot, a z-scoring was performed after applying a Gaussian window over 50 trials and with a standard deviation of 20. Black lines represent the peak(s) of previous or following events, relative to the event used as spatial filter, obtained from a rolling mean over 50 trials.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-108049-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We thus inspected how the signal recorded with the EEG electrodes varied with contrast levels surrounding the trial-by-trial most likely peak time of each event. Instead of selecting electrodes, we used each event’s topography as a spatial filter by computing the dot product between the topographies of each event (i.e., the average of the electrode activity at each event’s most likely single-trial time) and the electrode signal at all time samples from stimulus onset to 100 ms after each event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This results in single-trial time series of the match between the EEG signal and that event’s topography. We then centered each trial and each event’s time series to the trial most-likely time of the event and averaged the time series separately for the two speed–accuracy instructions and 10 contrast bins. This procedure shows that, across both speed–accuracy instructions, the first event, interpreted as the N40, is expressed as a narrow band around the single-trial most-likely time of that event as shown by the single-trial surface plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, first column). The trial-averaged traces show that its expression in the EEG is not linked to a contrast difference before 15 ms after its peak and that this effect might be linked to the peak of the following P100 (see black lines in the surface plot of the first column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The second event, the P100, is clearly affected by the contrast manipulation with a significant effect of contrast around and during its peak. The peak of the third event, interpreted as a N200, does not seem to vary with contrast. Instead, a period preceding the N200 peak is significantly different for the contrast levels, but given that the match is negative, it is likely attributable to the preceding P100 as their topographies are mostly anticorrelated. Regarding the fourth event (before the last column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), interpreted as the LRP, it can be seen that the event is mostly happening abruptly in the time course. The effect of contrast is not very clearly defined but seems to happen either right at the peak or just after, and, in this case, the effect of contrast is that lower contrast levels yield a higher expression of that particular topography. It is to be noted that some periods of significance of the contrast effect are observed much earlier than the peak of the LRP but without a discernible pattern. The fact that these periods indicate moments in the time course where higher contrasts yield higher amplitude of the component links these periods to the overlap of the preceding detected sensory events. For the last event, the CPP, instead of an abrupt onset as in the preceding LRP, there seems to be a progressive build-up of the match as suggested by the surface plot and indicated by the significant periods preceding the peak of the event (last column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This effect is in the expected direction for a decision variable (lower contrast being easier) and the duration of this period appears shorter in the speed than in the accuracy condition. This is congruent with an account of a CPP building up as a ramp before the decision commitment with a peak varying with speed stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelly et al., 2021</xref>). To further test how this electrophysiological build-up relates to behavior, we tested their relation in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Testing single-trial CPP build-up.</title></caption><p>The idea of electrophysiological signals reflecting evidence accumulation has received critical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frömer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zoltowski et al., 2019</xref>). If the CPP event detected by HMP is representing evidence being accumulated, then its trial-by-trial build-up should vary with contrast levels and be related to the proportion of correct responses. As a proxy for this build-up, we first computed the match (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) between the topography of the CPP and the samples in between the trial estimated peak of that event and the 250 ms period preceding it. We then performed a linear regression for each trial and first applied a linear mixed model (see ‘Materials and methods’ for model specification) on the intercepts and slopes obtained. On the obtained single-trial intercepts (mean = 1.68, 95% CrI = [1.15, 2.18]), we observed a significant effect of contrast (mean = –0.52, 95% CrI = [–0.85, –0.16]) but not SAT (mean = –0.004, 95% CrI = [–0.007, –0.001]) nor the interaction with contrast (mean = –0.22, 95% CrI = [–0.59, 0.13]). For the single-trial slopes (mean = 0.015, 95% CrI = [0.011, 0.018]), we observed a significant effect of contrast (mean = –0.008, 95% CrI = [–0.010, –0.006]) and SAT (mean = –0.004, 95% CrI = [–0.007, –0.001]) but not their interaction (mean = 0.000, 95% CrI = [–0.003, 0.003]). Secondly, we computed the Spearman correlation coefficient between the contrast-averaged proportion of correct responses and either the intercepts or slopes of the linear regression models, averaged over participants, for each contrast level.</p><p>On the single-trial slopes of the CPP event build-up, these observations support the hypothesis that a ramping signal, congruent with evidence accumulation, is developing prior to the response of the participants. Furthermore, assuming that the intercepts of the linear regressions reflect the value of evidence at choice commitment, the observation that the intercept predicts the proportion of correct response supports a decision-making model with a decision threshold dynamically decreasing over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tajima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Maanen et al., 2016</xref>). This is because under the assumption of a decreasing threshold, a lower rate of evidence accumulation will cross the decision threshold at a lower value, here represented by a smaller intercept.</p><fig position="float" id="box1fig1"><label>Box 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Both the intercepts and slopes of the linear models predict the proportion of correct responses with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.38 to 0.61 (all p-values &lt; 0.001).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-108049-box1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By modeling the recorded single-trial EEG signal between stimulus onset and response as a sequence of multivariate events with varying trial-by-trial peak times, we aimed to detect recurrent events that contribute to the duration of the RT in the present perceptual decision-making task. In addition to the number of events, using this HMP approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>), we estimated the trial-by-trial probability of each event’s peak, therefore assessing at which time sample each event was the most likely to occur. To identify specific cognitive processes, we combined this approach with a targeted manipulation of stimulus intensity expected to elicit two well-known psychophysical laws relating to stimulus encoding and decision, respectively Piéron’s and Fechner’s laws. In this study, we detected five events in the RT of participants performing a simple visual decision-making task. We used each event’s most likely time to extract the trial-by-trial interval between successive events to categorize these periods as being part of encoding (Piéron’s law) and decision times (Fechner’s law) depending on the impact of the stimulus intensity manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We then used the average electrode values at these trial-by-trial most likely times as spatial filters to identify the dynamics of each event and their sensitivity to the stimulus intensity manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Relating inter-event intervals and electrode activity to the psychophysical laws allowed us to unambiguously map the expected cognitive processing steps to the events discovered in the single-trial EEG between the stimulus onset and the response.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Visual encoding time</title><p>The first event after stimulus onset, identified as the N40, most likely represents the first EEG identifiable visual processing event, probably originating from subcortical structures such as the lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Proverbio et al., 2021</xref>). The following event, the P100, is expressed around 70 ms after the N40, its topography is congruent with reports for stimuli with low spatial frequencies as used in the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kenemans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kenemans et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Proverbio et al., 1996</xref>). The timing of this P100 component is changed by the contrast of the stimulus in the direction expected by Piéron’s law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The expression of this component in the EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) also varies congruently with stimulus intensity, with higher contrasts yielding a higher P100. Given all these observations, it is likely that this P100 represents the visual encoding time of the stimuli. Interestingly, another component with a close topography seems to be expressed around the P100 as suggested by the inverted positive sigmoid-like trend in the surface plot of the second column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Based on its timing and the observation that its topography is close to the P100, it could represent a C1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeffreys and Axford, 1972</xref>). This component might also be sensitive to contrast as revealed by the significant periods of difference before and after the P100 peak. Nevertheless, this event, seemingly overlapping with the P100 even at the trial level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), cannot be recovered by the method we applied. The fact that the P100 was recovered instead of the C1 could indicate that only the timing of the P100 contributes to the RT (see Section 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Attention orientation</title><p>After the P100 and a duration again influenced by the stimulus contrast according to Piéron’s law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the third event peaks with a topography that resembles the N200 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), a component linked to figure-ground separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ritter et al., 1979</xref>). The timing of this event changes with contrast congruently to the expectation of Piéron’s law and dictates the onset of decision-making (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) congruent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nunez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loughnane et al., 2016</xref>). It is interesting to note that, while this N200 peak time respective to the P100 is linked to visual processing, we did not find evidence for visual or decision-related effects in the EEG expression of that event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We do, however, observe an asymmetry in the topographical map <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. This asymmetry might point to an attentional bias with participants (or at least some participants) allocating attention to one side over the other in the same way as the N2pc component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luck and Hillyard, 1994</xref>). Based on this collection of observations, we conclude that this third event represents an attention orientation process. In line with the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Philiastides et al., 2006</xref>, this attention orientation event might also relate to the allocation of resources. Other designs varying the expected cognitive load or spatial attention could help in further interpreting the functional role of this third event.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Motor execution</title><p>The before-last event, identified as the LRP, shows a strong hemispheric asymmetry congruent with a right hand response. The peak of this event is approximately 100 ms before the response, which is also congruent with reports that the LRP peaks at the onset of electromyographical activity in the effector muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burle et al., 2004</xref>), typically happening 100 ms before the response in such decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weindel et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, while its peak time is dependent on contrast, its expression in the EEG is less clearly related to the contrast manipulation than the following CPP event. Adding the abrupt onset of this potential, we believe that this event is the start of motor execution engaged after a certain amount of evidence. The evidence for this interpretation is manifest in the fact that the event’s topography shares some activity with the CPP event that follows, an expected result if the LRP is triggered at a certain amount of evidence, indexed by the CPP. This interpretation bears the prediction that the start of motor execution does not end the decision, which is supported by the observation that the duration between the LRP and the following CPP also conforms to Fechner’s law. Additional support comes from a growing number of studies showing changes of mind in similar decision-making tasks even after the onset of electromyographical activity in the effector muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spieser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weindel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gajdos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weindel, 2021</xref>). Based on all these observations, it is therefore very likely that this LRP event signs the first passage of a two-step decision process as suggested by recent decision-making models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Servant et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verdonck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balsdon et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Decision event</title><p>Finally, the last event, the CPP, terminates the decision as shown by the observation that the time from the N200 to this last event peak is best fitted by a Fechner diffusion model and that the estimated parameters predict the proportion of correct responses at a high accuracy (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.66</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft11">\begin{document}$R^{2}\geq 0.66$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>). Regarding the build-up of this component, the CPP is seen as originating from single-trial ramping EEG activities, but other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zoltowski et al., 2019</xref>) has found support for a discrete event at the trial level. The ERPs on the trial-by-trial centered event in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> can be explained under both theoretical accounts. As outlined above, the LRP is indeed a short burst-like activity, but the build-up of the CPP between high vs. low contrast diverges much earlier than its peak. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> shows that both the intercept (value at the events’ peak) and the slope (build-up of the signal) of single-trial linear regression models fitted on the match between the CPP and the activity prior to the peak are impacted by the contrast as expected for an evidence accumulation signal and predict participants' accuracies. This means that the rate of build-up of the CPP as well as the value before the response contain information on the likelihood of the participant making a correct response. Finally, simulating EEG data with a ramping function, as expected from evidence accumulation models, shows that the ERP profile for such a simulation (Appendix 1) is again compatible with the detected CPP as a ramp. Thus, as proposed using intracranial recordings in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stine et al., 2023</xref>), we concur that decision-related signals can be best explained by both a progressive accumulation predicting correctness and an abrupt response execution event.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Generalization and limitations</title><p>The present study showed what cognitive processes are contributing to the RT and estimated single-trial times of these processes for this specific perceptual decision-making task. The identified processes and topographies ought to be dependent on the task and even the stimuli (e.g., sensory events will change with the sensory modality). More complex designs might generate a higher number of cognitive processes (e.g., memory retrieval from a cue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) and so could more natural stimuli which might trigger other processes in the EEG (e.g., appraisal vs. choice as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frömer et al., 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, the observation of early sensory vs. late decision EEG components is likely to generalize across many stimuli and tasks as it has been observed in other designs and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Philiastides et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Philiastides and Sajda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Salvador et al., 2022</xref>). To these studies we add that we can evaluate the trial-level contribution, as already done for specific processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Si et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sturm et al., 2016</xref>) for the collection of events detected in the current study.</p><p>While this represents, to the best of our knowledge, an unprecedented precision in the description and single-trial estimation of the timing of cognitive processes, some limitations are inherent to the method used. An HMP method assumes that cognitive events are sequential to one another; therefore, the estimated solution cannot account for all events in the EEG. If two components are close in time and overlapping at the trial level (e.g., C1/P100 discussed in the visual encoding time section), only the event that has both the strongest signal and is most linked to the preceding and following event will be detected. Additionally, the current study fit the same model across all participants and conditions. It cannot be excluded that inter-individual differences in signal-to-noise ratio, events’ topography, and sequence composition (i.e., cognitive processes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archambeau et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Maanen et al., 2014</xref>) or time courses (e.g., partial responses, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gajdos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weindel, 2021</xref>) could lead to incorrect estimations. Critically, an HMP model assumes that an event is present across all trials, thereby providing an estimate of an event’s position even if this event is absent for a particular trial/participant (see simulations in Section 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>). Second-order analyses are possible to assess the presence of an event (e.g., to evaluate different strategies; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Den Otter et al., 2025</xref>) and are the topic of future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To the question of the processing steps in the RT raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donders, 1868</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Helmholtz, 1850</xref> more than a century ago, we can affirm that the RT in this decision-making task is made up of five main steps: early and late visual processing, attention orientation, response execution, and decision-making. This decomposition of the RT into processing steps allowed us to explicitly test the impact of experimental conditions on these different intervals. Additionally, the trial-wise resolution allows for straightforwardly using the extracted times to address what theory best explains observed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghaderi-Kangavari et al., 2022</xref>) or apply advanced signal processing methods while accounting for trial-wise variation in time.

An ICA was performed to remove ocular-related activity on a 256 Hz downsampled version, bandpass filtered between 1 and 80 Hz and epoched based on stimulus onsets. The independent component rejection was partially automated by using the correlation of the IC time course to the vertical and horizontal EOG. Visual inspection of the independent components was used to ensure a proper classification. On average, 1.88 components were removed (max = 3). The rejected ICs were zeroed out on the low-pass only filtered signal and (eventual) bad electrodes were then interpolated using spherical splines.

id="appendix-1"><title>Appendix 1</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8"><title>Assuming half-sines when the signal is a ramp</title><p>Based on two theories of ERP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makeig, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Başar, 1980</xref>), the HMP method assumes that searching for multivariate half-sines in the EEG signal is relevant to capture significant changes in cognitive processing. In the case of the centro-parietal positivity, however, it is believed that this potential arises from ramping activity at the single-trial level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the HMP analyses presented in the main text show that we were able to find this ramp, therefore suggesting that the method can capture alternative generating signals. In this Appendix, to formally confirm that the HMP method also detects an event if it was comprised of a ramp-like signal, we simulated data congruent with this hypothesis vs. the half-sine assumption.</p><p>To do so, we first downsampled the signal to 100 Hz for computational reasons and reestimated an HMP model as in the main results but with a 50 ms event width due to the new sampling rate. In this downsampled dataset, the optimal solution is three HMP events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>) instead of five as in the main text. We then used the downsampled data structure without any real data and added, at the single-trial most-likely times, the pattern of each event. To add the pattern to the 0 signal, we computed the outer product between the patterns’ expected activation (either a ramp or a half-sine) and the values of the electrodes at the trial-by-trial most likely time of each event based on the estimates from the real data. The two first events were always simulated as half-sines: the activation pattern was defined as the first five samples of a full 10 Hz sine wave sampled at 100 Hz with a phase of 0 (i.e., 50 ms pulse-like activity). The last event was simulated as either a half-sine with the same characteristics as the first two or a ramp. The ramp pattern was defined per trial by generating 100,000 cumulative sums of Gaussian noise with both mean and standard deviation set to 0.1 over 2000 time steps. These cumulative sums form simulated accumulation traces and thus the ramp expected in decision-related signals. For each simulated accumulation trace, we recorded the time step at which a decision threshold was crossed by monitoring the first time the absolute cumulative sum exceeded the value 1 (traces that reached a threshold of -1 were inverted). For each simulated trial, to avoid a too high impact of noise, we averaged the 10 traces with the closest time to the actual time between the second event and the response. This ramp-like pattern was then added between the N200 event and the response for each trial. After having imputed the three patterns to each trial at their corresponding times, we added noise based on the variance–covariance matrix between electrodes observed in the real data, computed during the 200 ms baseline of the epochs, using a multivariate normal and an infinite impulse response filter (with 0.2, –0.2, and 0.04 as denominator coefficients as done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref>) as implemented in scipy (v1.15.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>). We then estimated the same HMP model as for the downsampled data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref> illustrates the topography of the last event for the simulated ramp signal (left panel) vs. a simulated half-sine (right panel). In both cases, the last topography detected by HMP is very close to the last one estimated on the downsampled real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). Representing the event’s match between the data and the samples preceding the peak of the event (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) shows that the build-up of the event clearly indicates whether the generating single-trial pattern is a ramp or a half-sine. Thus, in this Appendix, we show that, irrespective of the generating signal being a ramp or a half-sine, if this signal is congruent with HMPs’ assumptions of sequentiality and repetition across trials (see Section 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindel et al., 2024</xref> for a discussion), then this event will be detected. We also show that the build-up of this event can be used to infer the single-trial generating signal.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simulating a ramp or a half-sine and expecting a half-sine.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representation of the averaged times and topographies for the three events detected by HMP on the downsampled real data.

Meanwhile, the time intervals running up to neural events peaking near the time of response, consistent with decision termination, increases with contrast, fitting Fechner's law.

This new EEG analysis method enables single-trial estimates of the timing and amplitude of transient changes in EEG time-series recurrent across trials in a behavioural task. The authors find evidence for five events between stimulus onset and the response in a two-spatial-interval visual discrimination task. By analysing the timing and amplitude of these events in relation to behaviour and the stimulus manipulation, the authors interpret these events as related to separable processing stages for stimulus encoding (first two events), attention orientation (second event), motor planning (fourth event) and decision (deliberation, final event). This is largely consistent with previous findings from both event-related potentials (across trials) and single-trial estimates using decoding techniques and neural network approaches. However, by taking a data-driven approach (as opposed to theory-driven decoding analyses) a more nuanced picture emerges: there are several stimulus encoding steps which may contribute differently to behaviour, and decision processes extend beyond the planning of the motor response.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work is not only important for the conceptual advance, but also in promoting this new analysis technique, which will likely prove useful in future research. For the broader picture, this work is an excellent example of the utility of neural measures for mental chronometry.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Though beyond the scope of this manuscript, these results should be considered within the broader decision-making literature, where task or domain-specific processes may not generalise (for example, in value-based decision-making).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108049.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weindel</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04pp8hn57</institution-id><institution>Utrecht University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Utrecht</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Borst</surname><given-names>Jelmer P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012p63287</institution-id><institution>University of Groningen</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Groningen</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Maanen</surname><given-names>Leendert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04pp8hn57</institution-id><institution>Utrecht University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Utrecht</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>From my reading, this study aimed to achieve two things:</p><p>(1) A neurally-informed account of how Pieron's and Fechner's laws can apply in concert at distinct processing levels.</p><p>(2) A comprehensive map in time and space of all neural events intervening between stimulus and response in an immediately-reported perceptual decision.</p><p>I believe that the authors achieved the first point, mainly owing to a clever contrast comparison paradigm, but with good help also from a new topographic parsing algorithm they created.

We respond to the reviewer’s specific comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The second, generally stated aim above is, in the opinion of this reviewer, unconvincing and ill-defined. Presumably, the full sequence of neural events is massively task-dependent, and surely it is more in number than just three. Even the sensory evoked potential typically observed for average ERPs, even for passive viewing, would include a series of 3 or more components - C1, P1, N1, etc. So are some events being missed? Perhaps the authors are identifying key events that impressively demarcate Pieron- and Fechner-adherent sections of the RT, but they might want to temper the claim that they are finding ALL events. In addition, the propensity for topographic parsing algorithms to potentially lump together distinct processes that partially co-evolve should be acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the topographical solutions found by HMP will be dependent on the task and the quality and type of data. We address this point in the last section of the discussion (see also response to R3.5). We would also like to add that the events detected by HMP are, by construction, those that contribute to the RT and not necessarily all ERPs elicited by a stimulus.</p><p>In addition to the new last section of the discussion we also make these points clear in the revised manuscript at the discussion start:</p><p>“By modeling the recorded single-trial EEG signal between stimulus onset and response as a sequence of multivariate events with varying by-trial peak times, we aimed to detect recurrent events that contribute to the duration of the reaction time in the present perceptual decision-making task”.</p><p>Regarding the typical visual ERPs, in response to this comment but also comments R1.2, R1.3 and R2.1, we aimed for a more precise description of the topographies and thus reduced the width of the HMP expected events to 25ms. This ensures that we do not miss events shorter than the initial expectations of 50ms (see Appendix B of Weindel et al., 2024 and also response to R1.3). This new estimation provides evidence for at least two of the visual ERPs that, based on their timings and topographies (in relation with the spatial frequency of the stimulus), we interpret as the N40 and the P100 (see response to R1.5 for the justification of this categorization). We provide a description and justification of the interpretations in the result section “Five trial-recurrent sequential events occur in the EEG during decisions” and the discussion section “Visual encoding time”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To take a salient example, the last neural event seems to blend the centroparietal positivity with a more frontal midline negativity, some of which would capture the CNV and some motor-execution related components that are more tightly time-locked to, of course, the response. If the authors plotted the traditional single-electrode ERP at the frontal focus and centroparietal focus separately, they are likely to see very different dynamics and contrast- and SAT-dependency. What does this mean for the validity of the multivariate method? If two or more components are being lumped into one neural event, wouldn't it mean that properties of one (e.g., frontal burstiness at response) are being misattributed to the other (centroparietal signal that also peaks but less sharply at response)?</p></disp-quote><p>Using the new HMP parameterization described above we show that the reviewer's intuition was correct. Using an expected pattern duration of 25ms the last event in the original manuscript splits in two events. The before-last event, now referred to the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) presents a strong lateralization (Figure 3) with an increased negativity over the motor cortex contralateral to the right hand. The effect of contrast is mostly on the last event that we interpret as the CPP (Figure 5). Despite the improved precision of the topographies of the identified events, it is however to be noted that some components will overlap. If the LRP is generated when a certain amount of evidence is accumulated (e.g. that the CPP crosses a certain value) then a time-based topography will necessarily include that CPP activity in addition to the lateralized potential. We discuss this in the section “Motor execution” of the discussion:</p><p>“Adding the abrupt onset of this potential, we believe that this event is the start of motor execution, engaged after a certain amount of evidence. The evidence for this interpretation is manifest in the fact that the event's topography shares some activity with the CPP event that follows, an expected result if the LRP is triggered at a certain amount of evidence, indexed by the CPP”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Also related to the method, why must the neural events all be 50 ms wide, and what happens if that is changed? Is it realistic that these neural events would be the same duration on every trial, even if their duration was a free parameter? This might be reasonable for sensory and motor components, but unlikely for cognitive.</p></disp-quote><p>The HMP method is sensitive to the event's duration as shown in the manuscript about the method (Appendix B of Weindel et al., 2024). Nevertheless as long as the topography in the real data is longer than the expected one it shouldn't be missed (i.e. same goes for by-trial variations in the event width). For this reason we halved the expected event width of 50ms (introduced by the original HsMM-MVPA paper by Anderson and colleagues) in the revision. This new estimation with 25ms thus is much less likely to miss events as evidenced by the new visual and motor events. In the revised manuscript this is addressed at the start of the Results section:</p><p>“Contrary to previous applications (Anderson et al.,2016; Berberyan et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2018; Krause et al., 2024) we assumed that the multivariate pattern was represented by a 25ms half-sine as our previous research showed that a shorter expected pattern width increases the likelihood of detecting cognitive events (see Appendix B of Weindel et al., 2024)”.</p><p>Regarding the event width as a free parameter this is both technically and statistically difficult to implement as the amount of computing capacity, flexibility and trade-offs among the HMP parameters would, given the current implementation, render the model unfit for most computers and statistically unidentifiable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In general, I wonder about the analytic advantage of the parsing method - the paradigm itself is so well-designed that the story may be clear from standard average event-related potential analysis, and this might sidestep the doubts around whether the algorithm is correctly parsing all neural events.</p></disp-quote><p>Average ERP analysis suffers from an impossibility to differentiate between an effect of an experimental factor on the amplitude vs. on the timing of the underlying components (Luck, 2005). Furthermore the overlap of components across trials bluries the distinction between them. For both reasons we would not be able to reach the same level of certainty and precision using ERP analyses. Furthermore the relatively low number of trials per experimental cell (contrast level X SAT X participant = 6 trials) makes the analyses hard to perform on ERP which typically require more trials per modality. From the reviewer’s comment we understand that this point was not clear. We therefore discuss this in the revision, Section “Functional interpretation of the events” of the results:</p><p>“Nevertheless identifying neural dynamics on these ERPs centered on stimulus is complicated by the time variation of the underlying single-trial events (see probabilities displayed in Figure 3 for an illustration and Burle et al., 2008, for a discussion). The likely impact of contrast on both amplitude and time on the underlying single-trial event does not allow one to interpret the average ERP traces as showing an effect in one or the other dimension without strong assumptions (Luck, 2005)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In particular, would the authors consider plotting CPP waveforms in the traditional way, across contrast levels? The elegant design is such that the C1 component (which has similar topography) will show up negative and early, giving way to the CPP, and these two components will show opposite amplitude variations (not just temporal intervals as is this paper's main focus), because the brighter the two gratings, the stronger the aggregate early sensory response but the weaker the decision evidence due to Fechner. I believe this would provide a simple, helpful corroborating analysis to back up the main functional interpretation in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the suggestion and have introduced the representation on top of Figure 5 for sets of three electrodes in the occipital, posterior and frontal regions. The new panels clearly show an inversion of the contrast effect dependent on the time and locus of the electrodes. We discuss this in Section “Functional interpretation of the events” of the results:</p><p>“This representation shows that there is an inversion of the contrast effect with higher contrasts having a higher amplitude on the electrodes associated with visual potentials in the first couple of deciseconds (left panel of Figure 5A) while parietal and frontal electrodes shows a higher amplitude for lower contrasts in later portions of the ERPs (middle and right panel of Figure 5A)”.</p><p>To us, this crucially shows that we cannot achieve the same decomposition using traditional ERP analyses. In these plots it appears that while, as described by the reviewer, there is an inversion, the timing and amplitude of the changes due to contrast can hardly be interpreted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The first component is picking up on the C1 component (which is negative for these stimulus locations), not a &quot;P100&quot;. Please consult any visual evoked potential study (e.g., Luck, Hillyard, etc). It is unexpected that this does not vary in latency with contrast - see, for example. Gebodh et al (2017, Brain Topography) - and there is little discussion of this. Could it be that nonlinear trends were not correctly tested for?</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer on the interpretation of the ERP. The timing of the detected component is later than the one usually associated with a C1. Furthermore the central display does not create optimal conditions to detect a C1</p><p>We do agree that the topography raises the confusion but we believe that this is due to the spatial frequency of the stimulus that generates a high posterior positivity (see references in the following extract). The new HMP solution also now happens to show an effect of contrast on the P100 latencies, we believe this is due to the increased precision in the time location of the component. We discuss this in the “Visual encoding time” section of the discussion:</p><p>“The following event, the P100, is expressed around 70ms after the N40, its topography is congruent with reports for stimuli with low spatial frequencies as used in the current study (Kenemans et al., 2002, 2000; Proverbio et al., 1996). The timing of this P100 component is changed by the contrast of the stimulus in the direction expected by the Piéron law (Figure 4A)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) There is very little analysis or discussion of the second stage linked to attention orientation - what would the role of attention orientation be in this task? Is it spatial attention directed to the higher contrast grating (and if so, should it lateralise accordingly?), or is it more of an alerting function the authors have in mind here?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we were not specific enough on the interpretation of this attention stage. We now discuss our hypothesis in the section “Attention orientation” of the discussion:</p><p>“We do however observe an asymmetry in the topographical map Figure 3. This asymmetry might point to an attentional bias with participants (or at least some participants) allocating attention to one side over the other in the same way as the N2pc component (Luck and Hillyard, 1994, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luck et al., 1997</xref>). Based on this collection of observations, we conclude that this third event represents an attention orientation process. In line with the finding of Philiastides et al. (2006), this attention orientation event might also relate to the allocation of resources. Other designs varying the expected cognitive load or spatial attention could help in further interpreting the functional role of this third event”.</p><p>We would like to add that it is unlikely that the asymmetry we mention in the discussion cannot stem from the redirection towards higher contrast as the experimental design balanced the side of presentation. We therefore believe that this is a behavioral bias rather than a bias toward the highest contrast stimulus as suggested by the reviewer. We hope that, while more could be tested and discussed, this discussion is sufficient given the current manuscript's goal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors decomposed response times into component processes and manipulated the duration of these processes in opposing directions by varying contrast, and overall by manipulating speed-accuracy tradeoffs. They identify different processes and their durations by identifying neural states in time and validate their functional significance by showing that their properties vary selectively as expected with the predicted effects of the contrast manipulation. They identify 3 processes: stimulus encoding, attention orienting, and decision. These map onto classical event-related potentials. The decision-making component matched the CPP, and its properties varied with contrast and predicted decision-accuracy, while also exhibiting a burst not characteristic of evidence accumulation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The design of the experiment is remarkable and offers crucial insights. The analysis techniques are beyond state-of-the-art, and the analyses are well motivated and offer clear insights.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is not clear to me that the results confirm that there are only 3 processes, since e.g., motor preparation and execution were not captured. While the authors discuss this, this is a clear weakness of the approach, as other components may also have been missed. It is also unclear to what extent topographies map onto processes, since, e.g., different combinations of sources can lead to the same scalp topography.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and for the attention they brought on the question of the missing motor preparation event. In light of this comment (and also R1.1, R3.3) the revised manuscript uses a finer grained approach for the multivariate event detection. This preciser estimation comes from the use of a shorter expected pattern in which the initial expectation of a 50ms half-sine was halved, therefore ensuring that we do not miss events shorter than the initial expectations (see Appendix B of Weindel et al., 2024 and also response to R1.3). In the new solution the motor component that the reviewer expected is found as evidenced by the topography of the event, its lateralization and a time-to-response congruent with a response execution event. This is now described in the section “Motor execution” of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“The before last event, identified as the LRP, shows a strong hemispheric asymmetry congruent with a right hand response. The peak of this event is approximately 100 ms before the response which is congruent with reports that the LRP peaks at the onset of electromyographical activity in the effector muscle (Burle et al., 2004), typically happening 100ms before the response in such decision-making tasks (Weindel et al., 2021). Furthermore, while its peak time is dependent on contrast, its expression in the EEG is less clearly related to the contrast manipulation than the following CPP event”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors examine the processing stages involved in perceptual decision-making using a new approach to analysing EEG data, combined with a critical stimulus manipulation. This new EEG analysis method enables single-trial estimates of the timing and amplitude of transient changes in EEG time-series, recurrent across trials in a behavioural task. The authors find evidence for three events between stimulus onset and the response in a two-spatial-interval visual discrimination task. By analysing the timing and amplitude of these events in relation to behaviour and the stimulus manipulation, the authors interpret these events as related to separable processing stages for stimulus encoding, attention orientation, and decision (deliberation). This is largely consistent with previous findings from both event-related potentials (across trials) and single-trial estimates using decoding techniques and neural network approaches.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work is not only important for the conceptual advance, but also in promoting this new analysis technique, which will likely prove useful in future research. For the broader picture, this work is an excellent example of the utility of neural measures for mental chronometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the very positive review and thank the reviewer for pointing out important weaknesses in our original manuscript and also providing resources to address them in the recommendations to authors. Below we comment on each identified weakness and how we addressed them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The manuscript would benefit from some conceptual clarifications, which are important for readers to understand this manuscript as a stand-alone work. This includes clearer definitions of Piéron's and Fechner's laws, and a fuller description of the EEG analysis technique.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the description of both laws were insufficient, we therefore added the following text in the last paragraph of the introduction:</p><p>“Piéron’s law predicts that the time to perceive the two stimuli (and thus the choice situation) should follow a negative power law with the stimulus intensity (Figure 1, green curve). In contradistinction, Fechner’s law states that the perceived difference between the two patches follows the logarithm of the absolute contrast of the two patches (Figure 1, yellow curve). As the task of our participants is to judge the contrast difference, Piéron’s law should predict the time at which the comparison starts (i.e. the stimuli become perceptible), while Fechner’s law should implement the comparison, and thus decision, difficulty”.</p><p>Regarding the EEG analysis technique we added a few elements at the start of the result:</p><p>“The hidden multivariate pattern model (HMP) implemented assumed that a task-related multivariate pattern event is represented by a half-sine whose timing varies from trial to trial based on a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 2 and a scale, controlling the average latency of the event, free-to-vary per event (Weindel et al., 2024)”.</p><p>We also made the technique clearer at the start of the discussion:</p><p>“By modeling the recorded single-trial EEG signal between stimulus onset and response as a sequence of multivariate events with varying by-trial peak times, we aimed to detect recurrent events that contribute to the duration of the reaction time in the present perceptual decision-making task. In addition to the number of events, using this hidden multivariate pattern approach (Weindel et al., 2024) we estimated the trial-by-trial probability of each event’s peak, therefore accessing at which time sample each event was the most likely to occur”.</p><p>Additionally, we added a proper description in the method section (see the new first paragraph of the “Hidden multivariate pattern” subsection).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The manuscript, broadly, but the introduction especially, may be improved by clearly delineating the multiple aims of this project: examining the processes for decision-making, obtaining single-trial estimates of meaningful EEG-events, and whether central parietal positivity reflects ramping activity or steps averaged across trials.</p></disp-quote><p>For the sake of clarity we removed the question of the ramping activity vs steps in the introduction and focused on the processes in decision-making and their single-trial measurement as this is the main topic of the paper. Furthermore the references provided by the reviewer allowed us to write a more comprehensive review of previous studies and how the current study is in line with those. These changes are mainly manifested in these new sentences:</p><p>“As an example Philiastides et al. (2006) used a classifier on the EEG activity of several conditions to show that the strength of an early EEG component was proportional to the strength of the stimulus while a later component was related to decision difficulty and behavioral performance (see also Salvador et al., 2022; Philiastides and Sajda, 2006). Furthermore the authors interpreted that a third EEG component was indicative of the resource allocated to the upcoming decision given the perceived decision difficulty. In their study, they showed that it is possible to use single-trial information to separate cognitive processes within decision-making. Nevertheless, their method requires a decoding approach, which requires separate classifiers for each component of interest and restrains the detection of the components to those with decodable discriminating features (e.g. stimuli with strong neural generators such as face stimuli, see Philiastides et al., 2006)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A fuller discussion of the limitations of the work, in particular, the absence of motor contributions to reaction time, would also be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>As laid out in responses to comments R1.1 and R2 the new estimates now include evidence for a motor preparation component. We discuss this in the new “motor execution” paragraph in the discussion section. Additionally we discuss the limitation of the study and the method in the two last paragraphs of the discussion (in the new Section “Generalization and limitation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) At times, the novelty of the work is perhaps overstated. Rather, readers may appreciate a more comprehensive discussion of the distinctions between the current work and previous techniques to gauge single-trial estimates of decision-related activity, as well as previous findings concerning distinct processing stages in decision-making. Moreover, a discussion of how the events described in this study might generalise to different decision-making tasks in different contexts (for example, in auditory perception, or even value-based decision-making) would also be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the original text could be read as overstating. In addition to the changes linked to R3.2 we also now discuss the link with the previous studies in the before-last paragraph of the discussion before the conclusion in the new “Generalization and limitations” section:</p><p>“The present study showed what cognitive processes are contributing to the reaction time and estimated single-trial times of these processes for this specific perceptual decision-making task. The identified processes and topographies ought to be dependent on the task and even the stimuli (e.g. sensory events will change with the sensory modality). More complex designs might generate a higher number of cognitive processes (e.g. memory retrieval from a cue, Anderson et al., 2016) and so could more natural stimuli which might trigger other processes in the EEG (e.g. appraisal vs. choice as shown by Frömer et al., 2024). Nevertheless, the observation of early sensory vs. late decision EEG components is likely to generalize across many stimuli and tasks as it has been observed in other designs and methods (Philiastides et al., 2006; Salvador et al., 2022). To these studies we add that we can evaluate the trial-level contribution, as already done for specific processes (e.g. Si et al., 2020; Sturm et al., 2016), for the collection of events detected in the current study”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>As you will see, all three reviewers agree that the paper makes a valuable contribution and has many strengths.

To clarify this point we replaced the comment by the following sentence:</p><p>“Note that this observation is not necessarily incongruent with theoretical work that argued that Piéron’s law could also be a result of a response selection mechanism (Stafford and Gurney, 2004; Van Maanen et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2005). It could be that differences in stimulus intensity between the two options also contribute to a Piéron-like relationship in the later intervals, that is convoluted with Fechner’s law (see Donkin and Van Maanen, 2014 for a similar argument).

The fact that the P100 was recovered instead of the C1 could indicate that only the timing of the P100 contributes to the RT (see Section 3 of Weindel et al., 2024)”.</p><p>And we more generally address the question of overlap in the new section “Generalization and limitation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>(1) If we agree on one thing, it is that motor processes contribute to response time. Line 364: &quot;In the case of decision-making, these discrete neural events are visual encoding, attention-orientation, and decision commitment, and their latency make up the reaction time.&quot; Does the third event, &quot;decision commitment&quot;, capture both central parietal positivity (decision deliberation) and motor components? If so, how can the authors attribute the effects to decision deliberation as opposed to motor preparation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the suggestions also in the public part. This main problem is now addressed as we do capture both a motor component and a decision commitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 351 suggests that the third event may contain two components.</p></disp-quote><p>This was indeed our initial, badly written, hypothesis. Nevertheless the new solution again addresses this problem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The time series in Figure 6 shows an additional peak that is not evident in the simulated ramp of Appendix 1.</p></disp-quote><p>This was probably due to the overlap of both the CPP and the LRP. It is now much clearer that the CPP looks mostly like a ramp while the LRP looks much more like a burst-like/peaked activity. We make this clear in the “Decision event” paragraph of the discussion section:</p><p>“Regarding the build-up of this component, the CPP is seen as originating from single-trial ramping EEG activities but other work (Latimer et al., 2015; Zoltowski et al., 2019) have found support for a discrete event at the trial-level. The ERPs on the trial-by-trial centered event in Figure 5 show support for both accounts. As outlined above, the LRP is indeed a short burst-like activity but the build-up of the CPP between high vs low contrast diverges much earlier than its peak”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previous analyses (Weindel et al., 2024) found motor-related activity from central parietal topographies close to the response by comparing the difference in single-trial events on left- vs right-hand response trials. The authors suggest at line 315 that the use of only the right hand for responding prevented them from identifying a motor event.</p><p>The use of only the right hand should have made the event more identifiable because the topography would be consistent across trials (rather than inverting on left vs right hand response trials).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, in the original manuscript we didn’t test for lateralization, but the comment of the reviewer gave us the idea to explicitly test for the asymmetry (Figure 3). This test now clearly shows what would be expected for a motor event with a strong negativity over the left motor cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state on line 422 that the EEG data were truncated at the time of the response.</p><p>Could this have prevented the authors from identifying a motor event that might overlap with the timing of the response?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. This would have been a possibility but the problem is that adding samples after the response also adds the post-response processes (error monitoring, button release, stimulus disappearance, etc.). While increasing the samples after the response is definitely something that we need to inspect, we think that the separation we achieved in this revision doesn’t call for this supplementary analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The largest effects of contrast on the third event amplitude appear around the peak as opposed to the ramp. If the peak is caused by the motor component, how does this affect the conclusions that this third event shows a decision-deliberation parietal processes as opposed to a motor process (a number of studies suggest a causal role for motor processes in decision-making e.g. Purcell et al., 2010 Psych Rev; Jun et al., 2021 Nat Neuro; Donner et al., 2009 Curr Bio).</p></disp-quote><p>This result now changed and it does look like the peak capturing most of the effect is no longer true. We do however think that there might be some link to theories of motor-related accumulation. We therefore added this to the discussion in the Motor execution section:</p><p>“Based on all these observations, it is therefore very likely that this LRP event signs the first passage of a two-step decision process as suggested by recent decision-making models (Servant et al., 2021; Verdonck et al., 2021; Balsdon et al., 2023)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would suggest further investigation into the motor component (perhaps by extending the time window of analysed EEG to a few hundred ms after the response) and at least some discussion of the potential contribution of motor processes, in relation to the previous literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the absence of a motor component is sufficiently addressed in the revised manuscript and in the responses to the other comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What do we learn from this work? Readers would appreciate more attention to previous findings and a clearer outline of how this work differs. Two points stand out, outlined below. I believe the authors can address these potential complaints in the introduction and discussion, and perhaps provide some clarification in the presentation of the results.</p><p>In the introduction, the authors state that &quot;... to date, no study has been able to provide single-trial evidence of multiple EEG components involved in decision-making...&quot; (line 64). Many readers would disagree with this. For example, Philiastides, Ratcliff, &amp; Sadja (2006) use a single-trial analysis to unravel early and late EEG components relating to decision difficulty and accuracy (across different perceptual decisions), which could be related to the components in the current work. Other, network-based single-trial EEG analyses (e.g., Si et al., 2020, NeuroImage, Sturn et al., 2016 J Neurosci Methods) could also be related to the current component approach. Yet other approaches have used inverse encoding models to examine EEG components related to separable decision processes within trials (e.g., Salvador et al., 2022, Nat Comms). The results of the current work are consistent with this previous work - the two components from Philiastides et al., 2006 can be mapped onto the components in the current work, and Salvador et al., 2022 also uncover stimulus- and decision-deliberation related components.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that the link to previous work was insufficient. We now include all references that the reviewer points out both in the introduction (see response R3.2) and in the discussion (see response R3.4). We wish to thank the reviewer for bringing these papers to our attention as they are important for the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors relate their components to ERPs. This prompts the question of whether we would get the same results with ERP analyses (and, on the whole, the results of the current work are consistent with conclusions based on ERP analyses, with the exception of the missing motor component). It's nice that this analysis is single-trial, but many of the follow-up analyses are based on grouping by condition anyway. Even the single-trial analysis presented in Figure 4 could be obtained by median splits (given the hypotheses propose opposite directions of effects, except for the linear model).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree with the reviewer in the sense that classical ERP analyses would require much more data-points. The performance of the method is here to use the information shared across all contrast levels to be able to model the processing time of a single contrast level (6 trials per participant). Furthermore, as stated in the response to R1.4 and R1.5, the aim of the paper is to have the time of information processing components which cannot be achieved with classical ERPs without strong, and likely false, assumptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Medium Comments:</p><p>(1) The presentation of Piéron's law for the behavioural analysis is confusing. First, both laws should be clearly defined for readers who may be unfamiliar with this work. I found the proposal that Piéron's law predicts decreasing RT for increasing pedestal contrast in a contrast discrimination paradigm task surprising, especially given the last author's previous work. For example, Donkin and van Maanen (2014) write &quot;However, the commonality ofPiéron's Law across so many paradigms has lead researchers (e.g., Stafford &amp; Gurney, 2004; Van Maanen et al., 2012) to propose that Piéron's Law is unrelated to stimulus scaling, but is a result of the architecture of the response selection (or decision making) process.&quot; The pedestal contrast is unrelated to the difficulty of the contrast discrimination task (except for the consideration of Fechner's law). Instead, Piéron's law would apply to the subjective difference in contrast in this task, as opposed to the pedestal contrast. The EEG results are consistent with these intuitions about Piéron's law (or more generally, that contrast is accumulated over time, so a later EEG component for lower pedestal contrast makes sense): pedestal contrast should lead to faster detection, but not necessarily faster discrimination. Perhaps, given the complexity of the manuscript as a whole, the predictions for the behavioural results could be simplified?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the initial version was confusing. We now clarified the presentation of Piéron's law at the end of the introduction (see also response to R2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Once Fechner's law is applied, decision difficulty increases with increasing contrast, so Piéron's law on the decision-relevant intensity (perceived difference in contrast) would also predict increasing RT with increasing pedestal contrast. It is unlikely that the data are of sufficient resolution to distinguish a log function from a power of a log function, but perhaps the claim on line 189 could be weakened (the EEG results demonstrate Piéron's law for detection, but do not provide evidence against Piéron's law in discrimination decisions).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent observation, thank you for bringing it to our attention. Indeed, the data support the notion that Pieron’s law is related to detection, but do not rule out that it is also related to decision or discrimination. In earlier work, we (Donkin &amp; Van Maanen, 2014) addressed this question as well, and reached a similar conclusion. After fitting evidence accumulation models to data, we found no linear relationship between drift rates and stimulus difficulty, as would have been the case if Pieron's law could be fully explained by the decision process (as -indirectly- argued by Stafford &amp; Gurney, 2004; Van Maanen et al., 2012). The fact that we observed evidence for a non-linear relationship between drift rates and stimulus difficulty led us to the same conclusion, that Pieron’s law could be reflected in both discrimination and decision processes. We added the following comment to the discussion about the functional locus of Pieron's law to clarify this point:</p><p>“Note that this observation is not necessarily incongruent with theoretical work that argued that Piéron’s law could also be a result of a response selection mechanism (Stafford and Gurney, 2004; Van Maanen et al., 2012; Palmer et al., 2005). It could be that differences in stimulus intensity between the two options also contribute to a Piéron like relationship in the later intervals, that is convoluted with Fechner’s law (see Donkin and Van Maanen, 2014, for a similar argument). Unfortunately, our data do not allow us to discriminate between a pure logarithmic growth function and one that is mediated by a decreasing power function”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Appendix 1 shows that the event detection of the HMP method will also pick up on ramping activity. The description of the problem in the introduction is that event-like activity could look like ramping when averaged across trials. To address this problem, the authors should simulate events (with some reasonable dispersion in timing such that they look like ramping when averaged) and show that the HMP method would not pull out something that looked like ramping. In other words, the evidence for ramping in this work is not affected by the previously identified confounds.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this demonstration was necessary and thus added the suggested simulation to Appendix 1. As can be seen in the Figure 1 of the appendix, when we simulate a half-sine the average ERP based on the timing of the event looks like a half-sine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some readers may be interested in a fuller discussion of the failure of the Fechner diffusion model in the speed condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure which failure the reviewer refers to but assumed it was in relation to the behavioral results and thus added:</p><p>It is unlikely that neither Piéron nor Fechner law impact the RT in the speed condition. Instead this result is likely due to the composite nature of the RT where both laws co-exist in the RT but cancel each other out due to their opposite prediction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>(1) &quot;By-trial&quot; is used throughout.
