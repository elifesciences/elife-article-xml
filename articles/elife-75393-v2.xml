cells maintain a stable size distribution over generations despite fluctuations in cell growth and division size. Previously, we showed that cell size control involves both cell size checkpoints, which delay cell cycle progression in small cells, and size-dependent regulation of mass accumulation rates (Ginzberg et al., 2018). While we previously identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a key regulator of the mammalian cell size checkpoint (Liu et al., 2018), the mechanism of size-dependent growth rate regulation has remained elusive. Here, we quantified global rates of protein synthesis and degradation in cells of varying sizes, both under unperturbed conditions and in response to perturbations that trigger size-dependent compensatory growth slowdown. We found that protein synthesis rates scale proportionally with cell size across cell cycle stages and experimental conditions. In contrast, oversized cells that undergo compensatory growth slowdown exhibit a superlinear increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, with accelerated protein turnover per unit mass, suggesting activation of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Both nascent and long-lived proteins contribute to the elevated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with long-lived proteins playing a crucial role at the G1/S transition. Notably, large G1/S cells exhibit particularly high efficiency in protein degradation, surpassing that of similarly sized or larger cells in S and G2, coinciding with the timing of the most stringent size control in animal cells. These results collectively suggest that oversized cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to promote cell size homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell size</kwd><kwd>cell size homeostasis</kwd><kwd>growth rate compensation</kwd><kwd>proteasome-mediated protein degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2015-05805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kafri</surname><given-names>Ran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006126</institution-id><institution>Hospital for Sick Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Restracomp Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shixuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006126</institution-id><institution>Hospital for Sick Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Restracomp Postdoc Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ginzberg</surname><given-names>Miriam B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>Ceryl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM120956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Kevin G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oversized mammalian cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global protein degradation, which functions in parallel with the cell size checkpoints, to promote cell size homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To maintain cell size homeostasis, proliferating cells double their mass from one division to the next and divide into similarly sized daughter cells.

Misregulation of cell size control results in increased size heterogeneity, which is typically observed during neoplastic growth and is a hallmark of malignancy in many tumors, including breast cancer and small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asadullah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell and Waizbard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ginzberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>How is cell size controlled and how does cellular growth in mass coordinate with the cell cycle program? A major mechanism is the cell size checkpoint, which hinders cell cycle progression for cells that are smaller than the target size. The mammalian G1/S cell size checkpoint was first reported by Zetterberg and Killander over 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Killander and Zetterberg, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zetterberg and Killander, 1965</xref>). Subsequently, similar size checkpoints have been identified in single-celled yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartwell et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nurse, 1975</xref>). In recent years, the functioning of cell size checkpoints has been investigated with increasingly powerful technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DâArio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Varsano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xie and Skotheim, 2020</xref>). With increased resolution, these newer studies directly confirmed that smaller cells spend longer periods of growth in G1, allowing cells to reach the target size as they transition into S phase. Although it is not yet clear how animal cells sense their size, studies have revealed roles for both the p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sellam et al., 2019</xref>) and the CDK4/Rb pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zatulovskiy et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to cell size checkpoints, two independent studies suggest that mammalian cells also employ size-dependent regulation of cellular growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadart et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>). Authors of the studies used different methods to measure the growth of individual cell size throughout the cell cycle and found that the rate of cell growth negatively correlated with cell size at various cell cycle stages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref> further applied chemical and genetic perturbations that slowed down or accelerated cell cycle progression and observed compensatory changes in the rate of cellular growth, which buffered the initial effect on cell size (Figure 1A). For example, cells under CDK2 inhibition were forced to grow for a longer period in G1, resulting in an immediate increase in cell size. Remarkably, cells later compensated for this longer period of growth with slower rates of mass accumulation, resulting in only a small increase in cell size (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). To discriminate this mechanism from <italic>size checkpoints</italic>, we use the term <italic>size-dependent compensatory growth</italic>. Notably, this compensation does not occur with CDK4/6 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>), which was found to reprogram cells to a larger target size (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). Altogether, these studies suggest that cells sense their size to regulate not only cell cycle progression (e.g., cell cycle checkpoints), but also adapt the cell growth program to maintain cell size homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we ask whether the size-dependent regulation of cellular growth is mediated by protein synthesis or protein degradation. We found that proteasome-mediated global protein degradation, rather than protein synthesis, underlies the size-dependent compensatory growth and functions in parallel with cell size checkpoints to promote cell size homeostasis.</p><p>To reliably induce a compensatory growth slowdown, we utilized a CDK2 inhibitor assay previously established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>. We applied this assay to human retinal pigment epithelial-1 (RPE1) cells, a well-characterized non-transformed epithelial cell line. In this assay, unsynchronized cell populations were treated with a low dose of the CDK2 inhibitor, SNS-032, to induce a longer G1 phase. We optimized a concentration range that inhibits CDK2 function without arresting the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Cells were subsequently fixed at different timepoints and profiled for proliferation rate, cell size, and cell cycle stage. Cell size was measured with Alexa fluorophore-conjugated succinimidyl ester (SE), which reacts with primary amines and quantifies total protein content of the cell as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kafri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mugahid et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>, the temporal influence of CDK2 inhibition on cell size is characterized by a two-stage process: an early response followed by a delayed compensation. Although cell size initially increased for CDK2-inhibited cells as a result of the prolonged cell cycle, it gradually plateaus after ~24 hr due to a compensatory slowdown in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Average rates of cell proliferation and cell growth can be inferred from the dynamics of cell number and cell mass (see âMaterials and methodsâ). This revealed that CDK2-inhibited cells initially grew at the same rate as control but later compensated with a 24% reduced rate of mass accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In comparison, rates of cell proliferation remained unchanged (25% lower than control) throughout the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>). The delayed compensatory slowdown in cellular growth suggests that the influence of CDK2 inhibitor on growth rate is indirect and is mediated by a property that accumulates over time, presumably cell size.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A quantitative assay for the size-dependent regulation of cellular growth rate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the model of cell size control as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>.

The dashed blue lines represent iso-size curves at larger (upper curve) or smaller (lower curve) cell sizes. Perturbations that decrease cellular growth rate (e.g., mTOR inhibition) result in an initial decrease in cell size, followed by an adaptation involving the activation of p38 MAPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) to prolong the cell cycle, preventing further decrease in size (purple cells).

The balance between protein translation and degradation has been shown to significantly influence cell size in various cell types, including neurons, muscles, and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acebron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franklin and Johnson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sandri, 2013</xref>), suggesting a vital role of protein homeostasis in cell size control.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A quantitative assay for the size-dependent regulation of cellular growth rate</title><p>To further investigate the robustness of the assay, we employed time-lapse imaging to directly quantify single-cell dynamics of size growth. Using the nuclear area delineated by SiR-DNA as a proxy for cell size, we followed RPE1 cells stably expressing the degron of Geminin fused to a monomeric Azami green (mAG-hGem) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>) throughout ~60 hr of SNS-032 treatment. Consistent with results from the fixed cell assay, CDK2 inhibition resulted in a longer G1 phase (+3.5 hr, 32%) and lower growth rates of nuclear size (â21%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâE</xref>). Although CDK2-inhibited cells had a larger initial size as a result of prolonged growth duration from the previous cycle, they grew slower and became similarly sized as control cells around the G1/S transition, which was apparent when growth trajectories were computationally synchronized to the timing of their G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These findings provide further evidence for the size-dependent compensation in cell growth. CDK2 inhibition induced prolonged growth duration and an initial increase in cell size, which is then compensated by a delayed response of reduced growth rate, affirming that cellular growth rate is adaptively regulated to maintain cell size homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Compensatory changes in cellular growth rate are not regulated at the level of global protein synthesis</title><p>Because cell growth reflects the balance between rates of protein synthesis and protein degradation, we first asked whether the compensatory growth slowdown is mediated through reduced rates of protein synthesis in large cells.

The major targeting signal for proteasomal degradation is a post-translational modification involving ubiquitin chains linked through Lysine 48 (K48) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yau and Rape, 2016</xref>). To further test whether larger cells undergo higher rates of proteasome-mediated degradation, we measured the turnover (i.e., clearance) of K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins (K48-polyUb) in CDK2 inhibited cells that undergo a compensatory growth slowdown. K48-polyUb turnover rates were quantified as the increase in intracellular pools of K48-polyUb that is caused by a short (30 min) treatment with a potent irreversible proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib (CFZ). The excess amount of K48-polyUb in CFZ-treated cells compared to that of untreated cells, which we term ÎK48-polyUb, estimates the amount of K48-polyUb proteins that would have been degraded during the 30 min had the proteasome not been inhibited. Cell size and the partitioning of cells into different cell cycle stages were not significantly influenced by the 30 min treatment with CFZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Using this method, we measured the rates of proteasome-mediated protein degradation (ÎK48-polyUb) in CDK2-inhibited cells that were induced to undergo a compensatory slowdown of growth. CDK2-inhibited cells showed higher rates of ÎK48-polyUb, affirming a role of proteasomes in compensatory growth. The dependence of compensatory growth on proteasomal degradation is further supported by the temporal similarity of these two processes. Both the slowdown in growth rate and increase in ÎK48-polyUb showed delayed dynamics following CDK2 inhibition. CDK2-inhibited cells had similar ÎK48-polyUb as control during the first 8 hr of treatment, but later showed a significant increase in ÎK48-polyUb at 24 hr, indicating increased rates of protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). The enhanced turnover of K48-polyUb proteins aligns temporally with the compensatory growth rate changes observed in CDK2-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This pattern was consistently observed across G1, S, and G2+M phases in CDK2-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The delayed kinetics suggest that the increased ÎK48-polyUb is not triggered by the immediate inhibition of CDK2 activity but rather from the buildup of excessive cell mass triggered by the gradual influence of the longer cell cycle. Altogether, these results indicate that the compensatory slowdown of cell growth is mediated by increased clearance of K48-polyUb.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Large cells under compensatory growth slowdown have higher rates of protein degradation per unit cellular mass</title><p>Our findings suggest that larger cells have higher rates of protein synthesis as well as higher rates of protein degradation. A simple interpretation of these data would posit that both the rates of protein synthesis and degradation linearly scale with cell size. For example, a cell that increased 50% in size would have a 50% increase in both the rates of protein synthesis and degradation. To examine this quantitative relationship, we calculated fold changes in protein synthesis and degradation as a function of fold changes in cell size. Perturbation of CDK2 activity promotes proportional increases in both cell size and the rate of AHA incorporation across all cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, CDK2-inhibited cells exhibit disproportionately larger changes in protein degradation (ÎK48-polyUb) relative to the changes in cell size, suggesting a superlinear relationship. On average, ÎK48-polyUb increased by ~30% in CDK2-inhibited cells, whereas mean cell size only increased by ~3.4% compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). This disproportionate increase in degradation rates was consistent across all interphase stages (G1: 44%; S: 42%; G2+M: 31%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These observations highlight an interesting contrast between the cell size dependencies of protein synthesis and degradation. Although larger cells have higher absolute rates of protein synthesis, the rates of AHA incorporation per unit cell mass remain relatively constant across different cell sizes. In contrast, larger cells have higher rates of protein degradation even when quantified per unit cellular mass, suggesting an activation of the protein degradation pathways in large cells, in addition to large cells having more proteins to degrade.</p><p>To explore the specificity of these results, we then examined protein degradation in cells treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which induces a larger target size without compensatory growth slowdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). As expected, CDK4/6 inhibition resulted in significant increases in both cell size (G1: 32%; S: 69%; G2+M: 38%) and ÎK48-polyUb (G1: 30%; S: 66%; G2+M: 45%) at 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). However, the increases in ÎK48-polyUb remained proportional to the changes in cell size. Unlike the superlinear increase in ÎK48-polyUb observed in CDK2-inhibited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), cell size and ÎK48-polyUb under CDK4/6 inhibition followed the same linear relationship as control cells across different cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that compensatory degradation is not triggered merely by shifts in target size.</p><p>Next, we examined additional cell size perturbations to test whether the upregulated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown is a general size control mechanism or respond specifically to CDK2 inhibition and prolonged G1. Using data from a previous in-house chemical screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaufman et al., 2022</xref>), we identified compounds that increase cell size by altering progression rates of different cell cycle stages: JNJ-26854165, which slows S phase progression, and barasertib, which delays mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Importantly, the two compounds do not directly disrupt DNA or cytoskeleton integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bavetsias and Linardopoulos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2013</xref>). Both compounds led to increased global protein degradation, as measured by ÎK48-polyUb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Similar to the effects of CDK2 inhibition, they induced disproportionately higher increases in ÎK48-polyUb relative to the cell size increases, particularly in the affected cell cycle stages. Barasertib-treated G2+M cells exhibited a 10% increase in cell size but a 37% increase in ÎK48-polyUb at 8 hr of treatment, and the superlinear increase in ÎK48-polyUb persisted at 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). JNJ-26854165-treated S phase cells showed a temporary superlinear increase in degradation at 8 hr but not at 24 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that activation of protein degradation serves as a general compensatory mechanism of cell size control in response to prolonged growth periods. Whereas the dynamics of the compensatory degradation may vary, it can be triggered irrespective of the specific cell cycle stage affected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Compensatory growth slowdown involves increased proteasome activity in degrading both newly synthesized and long-lived proteins</title><p>What mediates the size-dependent increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation? One possibility is that large cells have more proteasomes. To test this, we compared proteasome concentration in control and CDK2-inhibited cells by probing the 20S proteasome subunit Î²5, PSMB5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Russell et al., 1999</xref>). These measurements showed that CDK2-inhibited cells had a similar level of proteasomes per unit mass as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting that the total number of proteasomes per cell increases proportionally with cell size in CDK2-inhibited cells. Next, we tested if large cells may activate more proteasomes. It was reported that a fraction of the intracellular proteasomes are catalytically inactive and can be stimulated in response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Livneh et al., 2016</xref>). To quantify the levels of active proteasomes in single cells, we used a proteasome activity probe, MV151. MV151 is a fluorescent and cell-permeable proteasome inhibitor that selectively binds to the catalytic core of active proteasomes and provides fluorescence readouts of active proteasomes at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verdoes et al., 2006</xref>). These data revealed a linear correlation between cell size and levels of active proteasomes (<italic>R</italic> = 0.90), suggesting that large cells have proportionately higher levels of active proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). As a positive control, the proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, eliminated the dependence of active proteasomes on cell size. The observation that larger cells have proportionally higher levels of active proteasomes, yet exhibit a superlinear increase in K48-polyUb degradation, suggests that the efficiency of protein degradation per active proteasome may be enhanced, warranting further investigation. An increased degradation efficiency might be achieved through increased efficiency in protein ubiquitination, such as activating E3 ubiquitin ligases that target proteins for degradation.</p><p>What proteins are degraded during compensatory growth slowdown? Previous studies have shown that nascent proteins, or newly synthesized polypeptides, are actively degraded in eukaryotic cells as part of protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>). It has been estimated that up to 15% of nascent chains in human cells are tagged for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). To examine if nascent or long-lived proteins are preferentially degraded in large cells, we used CHX to acutely inhibit protein synthesis and then measured K48-polyUb turnover. The comparison between cells with and without CHX treatment allowed distinction between the degradation of nascent (CHX-sensitive) and non-nascent (CHX-insensitive) proteins. As anticipated, CHX treatment significantly reduced ÎK48-polyUb levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>), confirming that nascent proteins contribute substantially to proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). We then compared cells with or without CDK2 inhibition, the difference of which reflects the level of size-related compensatory degradation. In the absence of CHX, CDK2 inhibition resulted in significant increases in ÎK48-polyUb across the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>), consistent with previous results. However, in the presence of CHX, the increase in ÎK48-polyUb was primarily observed at the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>).

In this study, we investigated size-dependent compensatory growth, which functions independently of cell cycle checkpoints. We employed a CDK2 inhibition assay to trigger compensatory growth, forcing cells to undergo prolonged growth periods, resulting in an initial increase in cell size followed by a delayed compensatory growth slowdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that the rates of global protein synthesis and degradation increase with cell size in both perturbed and unperturbed conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Interestingly, although protein synthesis rates scaled proportionally with cell size, protein degradation rates were disproportionately higher in large CDK2-inhibited cells (i.e., higher rates of protein degradation per unit mass), suggesting active upregulation of the proteasomal degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibition, which induces a larger target size without triggering compensatory growth slowdown, exhibited the same linear scaling between cell size and protein degradation rates as in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We also tested two other perturbations that forced overgrowth in cell size by extending S or G2/M phases. Like CDK2 inhibition, these perturbations induced superlinear increases in protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that activation of protein degradation functions as a general compensatory mechanism of cell size control in response to prolonged growth periods, irrespective of the specific cell cycle stage affected.

It will be interesting to examine in future studies whether the growth acceleration observed in these small cells depends on reduced global protein degradation.

This suggests that, in addition to accommodating cell size checkpoints, the G1/S transition may also serve as a critical regulatory point for protein degradation and growth rate control. These findings align with previous observation of decreased variability in both cell size and growth rate at the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ginzberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kafri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Son et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zetterberg and Killander, 1965</xref>).

It will be important in future studies to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the compensatory protein degradation in large cells. For example, what are the enzymes responsible for the observed increase in K48-linked polyubiquitination in larger cells during the G1/S transition?

We also found that both nascent proteins and long-lived proteins are targeted for degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with the relative contribution of each depending on the cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>). While proteasomal degradation of nascent chains is classically associated with protein quality control, our data suggest that cells leverage this pathway to modulate their growth rate and maintain cell size homeostasis. Future work employing dynamic isotopic labeling and quantitative proteomics could provide valuable insights into the degradation rates of specific proteins in this context. Two recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lanz et al., 2021</xref> used such an approach and measured individual protein concentrations in cells of different sizes. Proteasome subunits were found at higher concentrations in large cells, consistent with elevated rates of ubiquitylation and protein turnover. Interestingly, components involved in translation show slightly reduced concentrations in large cells. Previous work in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref> demonstrated that oversized cells show impaired gene expression. If translation integrity is disrupted in large cells, increased levels of ubiquitin-mediated degradation may be required for the clearance of aberrant nascent polypeptides through protein quality control pathways. This is consistent with our finding that nascent proteins can significantly contribute to compensatory degradation.</p><p>Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the process of compensatory growth which, unlike cell size checkpoints, can be employed in the homeostatic size control of nonproliferating cells.

Automated image processing was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Time-lapse microscopy and analysis</title><p>RPE1 cells with stable expression of H2B-mTurquoise and Geminin-mVenus were seeded in 96-well Î¼clear microplates (Greiner Bio-one, Monroe, NC) and grown in the incubator for at least 6 hr prior to imaging. The cells were imaged using the Operetta High-Content Imaging System. During imaging, the plate was incubated in a live-cell chamber (37Â°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), and cells were grown in FluoroBrite DMEM supplemented with FBS, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate. As the cells were previously cultured in regular DMEM and displayed suboptimal cell proliferation after switching to FluoroBrite DMEM, cells were grown in FluoroBrite medium for a period of 2 weeks to adapt to the new medium before the time-lapse experiments. Widefield fluorescent images of H2B-mTurquoise and Geminin-mVenus were collected every 15 min at Ã20 magnification for 60 hr. Under this experimental setting, the microscope could support imaging of up to four wells. To track the movement and division of single cells, and analyze nuclear area dynamics and cell cycle progression, we used the same methods as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Growth rate is estimated as the first derivative of the smoothed nuclear area dynamics, and all measurements presented in the study only examined the cells continuously tracked from one division to the next. The first and last six time points of the cell cycle were removed from the growth rate analysis because of the influence of nuclear breakdown and formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell cycle stages</title><p>Cells were first partitioned, according to their integrated nuclear DNA level, into G1 (2N), S (2N-4N), and G2 (4N) phases. Progression through the G1 phase was further divided, based on the fluorescence of integrated nuclear Geminin, when available, into early G1 (low baseline Geminin) and G1/S transition (higher Geminin). The thresholds were automatically detected based on the distributions of DNA and log(Geminin).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measures of AHA incorporation</title><p>To quantify rates of nascent protein synthesis, cells were treated with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (50 nM) or CDK2 inhibitor SNS-032 (25 nM) for 48 hr, then pulse-labeled with Click-IT L-azidohomoalanine (AHA, Invitrogen C10102) for 3 hr as described in the manufacturerâs protocol. Cells were then fixed and stained for DAPI and SE-A647. Rates of AHA incorporation were determined by labeling the cells with Alexa Fluor 488 DIBO alkyne (Invitrogen C10405), followed by imaging and quantification of the integrated intensity of the fluorophore on a single-cell basis as detailed above. As a negative control, cells were treated with 1 ÂµM of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cycloheximide chase experiment</title><p>Cells were seeded at 1500 cells per well into 96-well Cell Carrier-96 ultra microplates (PerkinElmer) for at least 6 hr prior to treatment. The protein synthesis inhibitor CHX was then administered at 10 ÂµM for either 0, 1.5, 3, 6, or 9 hr. Cells were then fixed and stained for DAPI and SE-A647, and imaged as detailed above. Total protein loss over time was measured by changes in cell size (SE) for the smaller 20% (20th percentile) and the larger 20% (80th percentile) of G1, S, or G2 cells separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurements of active proteasomes</title><p>RPE1-mAG-hGem cells were seeded at 1500 cells per well into 96-well Cell Carrier-96 ultra microplates (PerkinElmer) for at least 6 hr prior to treatment. The cells were then treated with 1 ÂµM activity-based active proteasome probe (ABP) MV151 Bodipy-TMR for 2 hr. MV151 binds to the inside of the catalytic core (20S) of active proteasomes, providing a total fluorescence intensity (per cell) that is proportional to proteasomal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verdoes et al., 2006</xref>). As a negative control, cells were treated with 1 ÂµM of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Cells were then fixed and stained for DAPI and SE-A647, and imaged as detailed above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurements of K48-polyUb turnover</title><p>RPE1-mAG-hGem cells were seeded into 96-well Cell Carrier-96 ultra microplates (PerkinElmer) for at least 6 hr prior to treatment. Cells were then treated with the experimental drugs (e.g., 25 nM SNS-032) or DMSO control (&lt;0.5% v/v) for the intended treatment time as indicated in the figures. At 30 min before fixation, half of the wells of each experimental condition were treated with a proteasome inhibitor (8 ÂµM CFZ). After fixation, cells were immunostained for total levels of K48-linked polyubiquitin with a primary antibody against K48-polyUb chains (Clone Apu2.07, Genentech, 1:500) for 2 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa 555, Thermo Fisher, 1:500) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained for DAPI and SE-A647, and imaged as detailed above. ÎK48-polyUb is calculated between every pair of CFZ-treated vs. non-CFZ-treated wells of the same experimental condition. Average and CIs of ÎK48-polyUb were then calculated with all replicate measurements of the same condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Whole-cell lysis and western blotting</title><p>To prepare whole-cell lysates, cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and solubilized with RIPA Lysis Buffer (Boston Bio-Products, Boston, MA) (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Burlington, ON). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Proteins were suspended with 4Ã Bolt LDS Sample Buffer and 10Ã Bolt Reducing Agent and heated for 10 min at 70Â°C. Samples of equal protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblotting for proteins as indicated. All western blot results in the figures have been reproduced in replicate experiments with cell lysates samples prepared in independent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Estimation of cell cycle length and growth rate from bulk measurements</title><p>Cells were treated with inhibitors on multiple 96-well plates and fixed every 20 hr over a period of 3 days. The plate slated to be fixed on the last timepoint was imaged by digital phase contrast (Operetta High-Content Imaging System; PerkinElmer) every 12 hr to acquire cell number estimates. Cell size was quantified using the total fluorescence intensity from SE-A647 at a single-cell level. Growth rate and cell cycle length were quantified from population averages of cell size and cell number over time.

In brief, the trajectory is detected as the probability density ridge in the DNA-Geminin distribution, and individual cells were projected to the trajectory through the shortest distance. Note the cell cycle trajectory detected in this study corresponds to an average progression over the cell cycle but does not necessarily reflect the relative duration of each phase.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing Editor eLife, founder and member of the scientific advisory board of Nurix Therapeutics, a member of the scientific advisory board of Monte Rosa Therapeutics, and an iPartner with The Column Group</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-75393-transrepform1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data presented in this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Large cells activate global protein degradation to maintain cell size homeostasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer , including Bruce A Edgar as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. We apologize for the very long time this manuscript has taken in review.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers appreciated the significance of the new central finding, that protein degradation can be used as a mechanism to regulate cell size, and compensate for changes in division rates. However, for several reasons, the reviewers were not entirely confident in the results used to support this interesting mechanism, and so they have requested major revisions with new data and new data analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) As reviewer 2 noted: &quot;something is wrong with the cell size measurements in Figure 2 because many cells basically have almost negligible size (near 0) while others have sizes up to 5 or 6 arbitrary units. It makes no sense that there should be a 10-fold or even 100-fold range in cell sizesâ¦ The data supporting higher rates of protein degradation per unit mass in large cells suffers from a similar problem as Figure 3E has the same issue as Figure 2 with too many tiny 'cells'.&quot; Please address this concern with an explanation, and if necessary, add new data or a new analysis of existing data.</p><p>2) Review #1 was concerned that only CDK2 inhibition was used as a tool to alter rates of cell cycle progression. The reviewer reasonably requests that an alternate tool be used to demonstrate that the effect on protein degradation is a general one, and not a direct and specific effect of CDK2 inhibition.</p><p>3) Reviewer #3 makes the important point (2) that &quot;If translation rate is higher in large cells, then basal protein degradation may also be correspondingly higher.&quot; Some control experiments should be provided that rule out this trivial possibility.</p><p>4) The reviews mention many other small and large changes that could improve the paper. Please consider these and address them at your discretion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper falls short of demonstrating, or proposing, a molecular mechanism explaining the connection between cell size and protein degradation. This is not strictly necessary provided the basic phenomenon is definitely demonstrated, but additional data on mechanism would certainly elevate the paper considerably.</p><p>1. A very relevant paper on cell growth from Mu, Meittinen et al. (PNAS 2020) should be discussed and cited. This paper concludes that larger cells (of a different type) do not grow slower.</p><p>2. The figure legends generally have too little information about the experimental design, making it difficult to interpret the results. In some cases the relevant details about an experiment can be found in the methods, but not always. Please review the figure legends and add detail explaining how the experiment was done.</p><p>3. Figure 1 C presents &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; cells. Please denote the time/treatments these cells received.</p><p>4. Figure 3A is not really informative, since the change in cell mass is shown in AU rather than % of cell mass. Please show this as a fraction of cell mass.</p><p>5. Figure 3E is essentially a control example, but it is presented as a result. To support the hypothesis that this data shows more active proteasomes in larger cells, the data should: (a) include a similar dataset for SNS-032 treated cells; and (b) be normalized to cell sizes. From the data presented, it looks like active proteasome amounts scale linearly with cell size, and that larger cells do not have a fractionally high number of active proteasomes (per unit mass). This doesn't support the authors' hypothesis.</p><p>6. The authors' general conclusions might be tested by decreasing protein degradation or ubiquitination in the CDK2-inhibited cells. This would be predicted to further increase cell size.</p><p>7. Line 467-468: were the deltaK48-polyUB data in Figure 4 supplement 1 also normalized to cell volumes? Please clarify in the figure legend and/or methods.</p><p>8. The authors present a number of assays with immunodetection of K48-polyUB. I believe what they are measuring here is k48-polyubiquitinated proteins of all sorts. If so, they should refer to this metric as &quot;K48-polyUB-protiens&quot; in the text and figures.</p><p>9. Figure 3F needs to present statistical differences between the SNS-032-treated and control cells.</p><p>10. It was not clear to me how Figure 4 supplement 2 supports the conclusions of the paper. The authors should explain this better, or leave it out.</p><p>11. It is interesting that generally cells with larger size have higher protein degradation rate (S, G2 cells degrade proteins faster than early G1), except that G1/S cells possess the highest degradation rate among all cell cycle phases. Since G1/S cells are not in the phase with the largest cell size, this is rather puzzling. Does it suggest that protein degradation rate is primarily regulated by some other mechanism, like CDK activity, rather than cell size? Please comment.</p><p>12. In Figure 1B, the authors characterize the average cell size changes after rapamycin or SNS-032 treatment. Because cell size is a distribution over a range, simply averaging all cells together may obscure some informational content. It is probably preferable to plot the distribution of cell sizes (e.g. dot plots or violin plots), comparing control and treatment groups.</p><p>13. Figure 1D shows that the nuclear area drops around G1/S when Cdk2 inhibitor is used. However, when they replotted the data by aligning cells based on the timeline relative to G1/S, this phenotype is not obvious anymore (Figure 1E). Please comment on why this is.</p><p>14. Page 3, line 112: should the reference be to Figure 1B?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. While the main conclusion of the paper that larger cells size compensate by increased proteasome-dependent protein turnover is supported by key experiments (Figure 3 D,E; Figure 4 A,E) the link to cell size is largely correlative, as supported by exploiting stochastic size variation in unperturbed cells and treatment with the CDK2 inhibitor in a perturbed context. To my mind, an important control would be to look in the situation where cells become large and size compensation does not occur, i.e., CDK6 inhibitor treated cells. The authors' model predicts that there should be no increase in proteasomal activity in the CDK6 inhibitor-treated cells. It seems likely that authors would have considered this experiment given their published observation that CDK6 inhibition is accompanied by unrestrained growth without size compensation.</p><p>2. One mechanism that could contribute to the increased rate of degradation is abortive translation that requires proteasome mediated clearance of partial translation products. It has long been known that turnover of nascent translated proteins accounts for a substantial fraction of proteasomal flux (~50% if I recall correctly). If translation rate is higher in large cells, then basal protein degradation may also be correspondingly higher. Although the size normalization of K48 chain turnover suggests that additional degradation indeed occurs in large cells, a possible further control to test this idea would be to treat cells with an acute sub-lethal dose of cycloheximide to slow translation followed by measurement of proteasome activity. Alternatively, treatment of cells with a low dose proteasome inhibitor would be predicted to reduce size compensation and allow cells to become larger.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75393.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) As reviewer 2 noted: &quot;something is wrong with the cell size measurements in Figure 2 because many cells basically have almost negligible size (near 0) while others have sizes up to 5 or 6 arbitrary units.

The previous visualization inadvertently emphasized the presence of rare image processing cell-segmentation errors that make the appearance of extremely-sized âcellsâ. Although these outliers are rare in our scatter plots, they are visually prominent, leading to an overestimation of the actual cell size range. It is worth noting that when processing thousands of images to extract single cell data, the presence of such rare segmentation errors is currently inevitable. While these false positives do not affect statistics nor overall trends, they do jump to eye when presented as scatter plots, especially in the sparse regions of the scatter plots.</p><p>To correct this misleading representation, we now revised Figure 2 to more effectively depict the actual cell size distributions in our data and de-emphasized the outliers laying at the extremes. The inclusion of cell size histograms further clarifies the true distribution of cell sizes. To rectify the misleading representation in the original manuscript, we have implemented the following changes:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Data Representation: We have applied a transparency setting to the scatter plot data points. This method offers a more accurate depiction of the data distribution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cell Size Histograms: We have included histograms in Figure 2A to illustrate the actual distribution of cell size. This provides a clearer view of the range of our measurements.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Normalization: We now present cell size data normalized to the average G1 size in control conditions, whenever applicable. This normalization helps to interpret cell size measurements within a more meaningful context, allowing for better comparison across different cell cycle stages and treatment conditions.</p></list-item></list><p>By implementing these changes, we aim to provide a more accurate representation of our data and address the reviewer's concerns effectively. These adjustments have also been applied to Figure 3E (currently Figure 3F) to ensure consistency and clarity across our analyses.</p><p>As clarified by the revised figure, our cell size measurements show a much narrower and biologically plausible range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> and revised Figure 2A). For example, when comparing the average of G1 phase cells to that of the G2+M phase, we observe a ~1.5-fold change in size, which aligns with typical expectations.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Cell size distribution in DMSO control condition.</title><p>A.

The reviewer reasonably requests that an alternate tool be used to demonstrate that the effect on protein degradation is a general one, and not a direct and specific effect of CDK2 inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the reviewerâs critique. In the revision, we explored additional perturbations that slow rates of cell cycle progression, and these new data have further strengthened our conclusions.</p><p>Generally speaking, cell cycle lengthening can be caused by delaying progression through G1, S, or G2/M phases. With respect to G1, the three primary targets are CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. However, in the context of the present study, only CDK2, but not CDK4/6, is an appropriate target. As described in our previous studies (Ginzberg et al., 2018, doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.26957; Tan et al., 2021, doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2021.04.030), inhibiting CDK2 extends the duration of G1, leading to an initial increase in cell size that is subsequently counteracted by a compensatory slowdown in growth rate. In contrast, inhibiting CDK4/6 not only affects cell cycle progression but also alters the cell's target size. Thus, we applied CDK4/6 inhibition (by palbociclib) as an additional ânegative controlâ in the revision. Indeed, we found that although CDK4/6 inhibition significantly increases cell size and protein degradation rates, the two maintain a similar linear relationship as the control (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A-C).</p><p>We also expanded our study and included in our revision not only G1 perturbations, but also perturbations that lengthen the cell cycle by slowing down progression through S phase and mitosis. We identified chemicals from a previous in-house screen (Kaufman et al., 2022, doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-30008-0) that significantly altered cell size while extending the S phase or G2/M phase, without significantly disrupting cell size uniformity. Another criterion was to avoid perturbations that directly disrupt the structural integrity (e.g., DNA, cytoskeleton) of the cell. This allowed us to employ two alternate compounds: JNJ-26854165, which slows S phase progression, and barasertib, which inhibits mitosis. The new data (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D-I) revealed that inhibiting progression of either S or M phase triggered a compensatory increase in global protein degradation, as evidenced by elevated levels of ÎK48-polyUb. This effect is particularly pronounced in the specific cell cycle stages targeted by the inhibitors. And like CDK2 inhibition, these increases in ÎK48-polyUb are disproportionately larger than the corresponding increases in cell size, suggesting an active upregulation of protein degradation beyond what would be expected solely due to increased cell size. These new results suggest that the activation of protein degradation functions as a general compensatory mechanism for oversized cells to maintain size homeostasis, regardless of the specific cell cycle stage affected.</p><p>These new data and analyses have been incorporated in the revised manuscript line 224-253.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer #3 makes the important point (2) that &quot;If translation rate is higher in large cells, then basal protein degradation may also be correspondingly higher.&quot; Some control experiments should be provided that rule out this trivial possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer's insightful comment raises two important questions:</p><list list-type="roman-upper"><list-item><p>Is the higher rate of protein degradation in large cells simply due to larger cells having more proteins, rather than a compensatory mechanism?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Which types of protein are degraded: newly synthesized nascent proteins (canonically associated with protein quality control) or non-nascent/long-lived proteins?</p></list-item></list><p>Addressing the first question: While we do observe a positive correlation between cell size and protein degradation rate, cells under CDK2 inhibition show a superlinear increase in ÎK48-polyUb relative to their increase in cell size. This is particularly evident when examining different cell cycle stages (Figure 3D). While control cells in G1, S, and G2+M phases show a positive correlation between size and ÎK48-polyUb, CDK2 inhibited cells sit above this trend, indicating an increase in protein degradation beyond what would be expected from increased cell size alone. In addition, naturally large cells at G1/S transition also show higher efficiency of protein degradation (i.e., degradation rates per unit mass) compared to similarly-sized or even larger cells in S and G2 (Figure 4E). These observations are not consistent with the simple model that large cells have higher protein degradation simply because of their higher translation rate. In the new manuscript, we now better present these points in Results line 203-253 and line 296-314, and in Discussion line 341-365.</p><p>To address the second question, we followed the reviewer's suggestion and measured proteasome-mediated protein degradation rates in cells subject to an acute, sub-lethal dose of cycloheximide (CHX, 3 Î¼M for 3h). We applied this treatment with or without CDK2 inhibition (SNS+/-). This approach allowed us to discriminate degradation of nascent (CHX-sensitive) and non-nascent (CHX-insensitive) proteins:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ÎK48-polyUb in non-CHX-treated cells (CHX-) reflects degradation of both nascent and non-nascent proteins</p></list-item><list-item><p>ÎK48-polyUb in CHX-treated cells (CHX+) reflects degradation of only non-nascent proteins Our results (Figure 3G, Figure 3âfigure supplement 6) show:</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>ÎK48-polyUb significantly decreases with CHX treatment, consistent with previous understanding that nascent proteins constitute a substantial fraction of the proteasomal flux.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In CHX+ conditions, SNS treatment significantly increases (+120%) degradation of non-nascent proteins in cells at the G1/S transition, but not at or to a much smaller extent at other cell cycle stages.</p></list-item><list-item><p>SNS treatment increases ÎK48-polyUb across all cell cycle stages in CHX- conditions, indicating increased degradation of both nascent and non-nascent proteins, with significant contribution from nascent proteins.</p></list-item></list><p>These findings suggest that compensatory protein degradation involves both nascent and non-nascent proteins, with the balance depending on the cell cycle stage. Notably, this indicates that degradation of nascent proteins, typically associated with protein quality control, can be employed for growth rate modulation and control of cell size homeostasis. At the G1/S transition, a time point of stringent size control, large cells appear to activate degradation of non-nascent proteins to modulate growth rate. These new results are now incorporated in the revised manuscript line 278-295.</p><p>Regarding the reviewerâs suggestion to use a low-dose proteasome inhibitor, we have actually performed this very experiment in a previous publication (Kafri et al., 2013, doi: 10.1038/nature11897). Consistent with the thesis of the present study, low-dose proteasomal inhibition not only decreased cell size but also significantly increased cell size variance, particularly at the G1/S transition. Those results are consistent with our thesis that protein degradation serves to maintain cell size homeostasis.</p><p>In the current study, we used short-term (30 min) treatment with the proteasome inhibitor CFZ as a tool to quantify protein degradation rates. This short-term inhibition did not significantly affect cell size or cell cycle distribution (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2). As for the suggestion for long-term proteasome inhibition, while the experiments can be interesting, we feel they may not be compatible with the goals and context of our present study. Because cell cycle progression is directly controlled by proteasome-mediated cyclin degradation, it would be challenging to distinguish between the inhibitor's effects on global protein metabolism, cell cycle perturbation, and cell size regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviews mention many other small and large changes that could improve the paper.

From years long research on the subject, we think the mechanisms in play should involve three distinct layers: (1) cell size sensing â biophysical or biochemical mechanisms that allow individual cells to detect their own size; (2) cell size-dependent signal transduction â signaling pathways downstream of the size sensors that mediate signaling events (e.g., gene expression, phosphorylation, etc.) depending on cell size; and (3) effector mechanisms â processes that regulate proteasomal activity based on the size-dependent signaling.</p><p>Identifying these mechanisms has been, and continues to be, a central focus of our lab and the field. However, while we are committed to pursuing this goal, addressing the full scope of these questions will require years of research that extends beyond the scope of the current paper. It is worth noting that despite the discovery of cell size checkpoints in the 1960s by Killander and Zetterberg, the molecular mechanisms of cell size sensors and checkpoints remain not well understood today.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the Discussion section to address the open questions raised by our study and highlight the importance of future research in elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this newly identified cell size control pathway (line 388-392, line 371-379).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

A related experiment has been previously reported, where we measured cell size dynamics under the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Kafri et al., 2013, doi: 10.1038/nature11897). This study revealed that proteasome inhibition not only caused cells to become larger but also increased cell size variability, particularly at the G1/S transition. These findings align with our proposed model, suggesting that compensatory degradation acts as a general mechanism to buffer natural cell size variations.</p><p>For the current study, we considered applying long-term proteasome inhibition (e.g., 24 hours) in combination with CDK2 inhibitors. However, since cell cycle progression is tightly regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation of key cell cycle regulators, we believe that long-term inhibition would complicate interpretation. Specifically, it would be difficult to distinguish whether observed changes in cell size were due to global alterations in protein metabolism or direct disruptions to cell cycle regulation. For this reason, we opted not to pursue long-term proteasome inhibition in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

If so, they should refer to this metric as &quot;K48-polyUB-protiens&quot; in the text and figures.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We use âK48-polyUBâ as an abbreviation for K48-linked polyubiquitinated proteins. We define this abbreviation when it first appears in the text (line 178-179) and in figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3F needs to present statistical differences between the SNS-032-treated and control cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now included statistical significance for comparisons between SNS-032treated and control cells for each cell cycle stage in the figure legend (currently Figure 3D legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It was not clear to me how Figure 4 supplement 2 supports the conclusions of the paper. The authors should explain this better, or leave it out.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment and understand the need for clarity.</p><p>The data presented in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A-B are derived from live-cell tracking experiments under mTOR inhibition. The key insight offered by the figure extends from the contrast between panels A and C. In panel A, mTORinhibited large and small cells show converging growth rates prior to the G1/S transition. However, as shown in panel C, mTOR-inhibited large cells synthesize proteins at a much faster rate than smaller cells. This discrepancy indirectly points to an elevated level of protein degradation in large cells prior to the G1/S transition. This result corroborates the more direct measurements of protein degradation presented in the main Figure 4.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have clarified the relevant Results section to better explain these points (line 315327). While reviewer #3 suggested including these data in the main figure, we believe it is more appropriate to keep it as a supplement to avoid overcomplicating the main figure layout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. It is interesting that generally cells with larger size have higher protein degradation rate (S, G2 cells degrade proteins faster than early G1), except that G1/S cells possess the highest degradation rate among all cell cycle phases. Since G1/S cells are not in the phase with the largest cell size, this is rather puzzling. Does it suggest that protein degradation rate is primarily regulated by some other mechanism, like CDK activity, rather than cell size? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this interesting phenomenon. We were indeed surprised to find that G1/S cells in control show the highest global protein degradation rates despite being generally smaller than S and G2 phase cells (Figure 4A-B). Figure 4E better demonstrates protein degradation efficiency as a function of both the cell size and cell cycle stage. In particular, large cells at G1/S transition show the highest protein degradation efficiency (i.e., degradation rates per unit mass). These data suggest that protein degradation rates may be regulated by both cell size and the cell cycle, and possibly directly regulated by the cell cycle machinery or other cell cycle events. We now comment about this and highlight these important questions in the discussion (line 380-392).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In Figure 1B, the authors characterize the average cell size changes after rapamycin or SNS-032 treatment. Because cell size is a distribution over a range, simply averaging all cells together may obscure some informational content. It is probably preferable to plot the distribution of cell sizes (e.g. dot plots or violin plots), comparing control and treatment groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The previous Figure 1B-C panels were reproduced from our earlier work (Ginzberg et al., 2018, doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.26957) to illustrate the assay to a general audience. We agree with the reviewerâs suggestion that presenting the distribution of cell sizes can provide additional clarity. However, considering reviewer #3âs recommendation to omit these figures and cite the original publication instead, we have moved these panels to the supplement (now Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). For consistency in the figure presentation, we have retained the original figure format as in the published version. We will consult with the editorial team regarding the use and reformatting of these reproduced figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 1D shows that the nuclear area drops around G1/S when Cdk2 inhibitor is used. However, when they replotted the data by aligning cells based on the timeline relative to G1/S, this phenotype is not obvious anymore (Figure 1E). Please comment on why this is.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful observation.</p><p>Figure 1D-E are derived from live-cell imaging experiments and are intended to illustrate the phenomenon of size dependent compensatory growth control. Under CDK2 inhibition, cells spend a longer time in G1 but compensate by reducing their growth rate, ultimately entering the S phase at a size comparable to that of control cells. This conclusion is based on growth rate measurements averaged across the cell cycle.</p><p>As the reviewer noted, Figure 1D shows a decrease in the nuclear area as cells approach the G1/S transition under CDK2 inhibition. However, when the data is synchronized based on the G1/S transition (Figure 1E), this decrease seems less apparent. This may be partly due to the two figures being displayed at different timescales.</p><p>Nevertheless, while the data allows us to conclude the overall slowdown of the growth rate in CDK2-inhibited cells averaged across the entire cell cycle, the current datasets do not provide sufficient statistical power to conclude whether CDK2-inhibited cells exhibit particularly prominent growth slowdown during a short period around G1/S transition compared to other cell cycle stages. Thus we have decided not to comment further on this aspect in the manuscript. However, this is an intriguing area for future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Page 3, line 112: should the reference be to Figure 1B?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Thank you. We have now corrected this typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. While the main conclusion of the paper that larger cells size compensate by increased proteasome-dependent protein turnover is supported by key experiments (Figure 3 D,E; Figure 4 A,E) the link to cell size is largely correlative, as supported by exploiting stochastic size variation in unperturbed cells and treatment with the CDK2 inhibitor in a perturbed context. To my mind, an important control would be to look in the situation where cells become large and size compensation does not occur, i.e., CDK6 inhibitor treated cells. The authors' model predicts that there should be no increase in proteasomal activity in the CDK6 inhibitor-treated cells. It seems likely that authors would have considered this experiment given their published observation that CDK6 inhibition is accompanied by unrestrained growth without size compensation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and have incorporated measurements with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A-C). CDK4/6 inhibition led to a significant increase in cell size. And aligning with the reviewer expectation, while protein degradation rates did increase with CDK4/6 inhibition, this increase was proportional to the increase in cell size. This is in contrast to the phenotype of CDK2 inhibition, where the increase in degradation rates was superlinear and exceeded the expectation based on cell size alone. Taken together, the new data aligns with the reviewerâs suggestion that compensatory degradation is not activated in CDK4/6-inhibited cells that reprograms a larger target size without inducing compensatory growth slowdown. These new results are now incorporated in the revised manuscript line 224-234.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One mechanism that could contribute to the increased rate of degradation is abortive translation that requires proteasome mediated clearance of partial translation products. It has long been known that turnover of nascent translated proteins accounts for a substantial fraction of proteasomal flux (~50% if I recall correctly). If translation rate is higher in large cells, then basal protein degradation may also be correspondingly higher. Although the size normalization of K48 chain turnover suggests that additional degradation indeed occurs in large cells, a possible further control to test this idea would be to treat cells with an acute sub-lethal dose of cycloheximide to slow translation followed by measurement of proteasome activity. Alternatively, treatment of cells with a low dose proteasome inhibitor would be predicted to reduce size compensation and allow cells to become larger.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.
