The C-terminal helices of Nsp1 (Nsp1-C-ter) from SARS-CoV-2 bind in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and blocks mRNA entry, thereby shutting down host protein synthesis. Nsp1 suppresses host immune function and is vital for viral replication. Hence, Nsp1 appears to be an attractive target for therapeutics. In this study, we have in silico screened Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs against Nsp1-C-ter. Among the top hits obtained, montelukast sodium hydrate binds to Nsp1 with a binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10.8 ± 0.2 µM in vitro. <italic>It forms a stable complex with</italic> Nsp1-C-ter in simulation runs <italic>with –95.8 ± 13.3 kJ/mol binding energy</italic>. Montelukast sodium hydrate also rescues the inhibitory effect of Nsp1 in host protein synthesis, as demonstrated by the expression of firefly luciferase reporter gene in cells. Importantly, it shows antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral replication in HEK cells expressing ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. We, therefore, propose montelukast sodium hydrate can be used as a lead molecule to design potent inhibitors to help combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Nsp1</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/17/2/503313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hussain</surname><given-names>Tanweer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IRPHA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IPA/2020/000094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hussain</surname><given-names>Tanweer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/I/18/1/503613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>Shashank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swarnajayanti Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SB/SJF/2020-21/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eswarappa</surname><given-names>Sandeep M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014825</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/CS0007/CS/02/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>Shashank</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Drug targeting Nsp1-ribosome interaction shows rescue of Nsp1-mediated translation inhibition and has antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of severe coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, is an enveloped positive-strand RNA-containing virus and belongs to beta coronavirus family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>). The virus contains nearly 30 kb RNA genome with 5'-cap and 3' poly-A tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Finkel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">V’kovski et al., 2021</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for 14 open reading frames (ORFs). Upon entry into host cells, ORF1a and ORF1b encode for two polyproteins, which are later auto-proteolytically cleaved into 16 proteins, namely Nsp1–Nsp16. Among these proteins, Nsp1 binds in the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosomal subunit and blocks the entry of mRNAs, thereby shutting down host protein synthesis. Nsp1 also induces endonucleolytic cleavage of host RNAs.</p><p>The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ribosomes from Nsp1-transfected human HEK293T cells indicate the binding of Nsp1 with 40S and 80S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tidu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Vankadari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Nsp1 contains 180 amino acids with N-terminal (1–127 amino acids) and C-terminal (148–180 amino acids) structured regions connected by a loop region of about 20 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This C-terminal region of Nsp1 (Nsp1-C-ter) contains two helices that harbors a conserved positively charged motif (KH-X<sub>5</sub>-R/Y/Q-X<sub>4</sub>-R). The deposition of positive charge toward one edge of these helices enhances their ability to bind helix h18 of 18S rRNA. The other side of C-terminal helices interacts with ribosomal proteins uS3 and uS5 in mRNA entry tunnel of the 40S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, zoomed view). These interactions enable Nsp1-C-ter to bind deep into the mRNA entry tunnel and prevent the binding of mRNAs, thereby inhibiting host protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tidu et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, Nsp1 helps in hijacking the host translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>) and renders the cells incapable of mounting an innate immune response to counter the viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Narayanan et al., 2008</xref>). Mutating the positively charged residues K164 and H165 in Nsp1-C-ter to alanines leads to a decrease in binding affinity of Nsp1 with ribosome and fails to inhibit host protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Schubert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tidu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Nsp1 is a highly conserved protein and less than 3% of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences analyzed showed mutation in Nsp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Min et al., 2020</xref>). Further, Nsp1-C-ter showed a much reduced frequency of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Min et al., 2020</xref>). The crucial role of Nsp1 in inhibiting host gene expression, suppression of host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Thoms et al., 2020</xref>) and, notably, the reduced mutation frequency in Nsp1-C-ter across global SARS-CoV-2 genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Min et al., 2020</xref>) advocate targeting Nsp1 for therapeutics. In this study, we have employed computational, biophysical, in vitro, and mammalian cell line based studies to identify FDA-approved drugs targeting Nsp1-C-ter and check for its antiviral activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Since repurposing a drug is a quicker way to identify an effective treatment, we screened FDA-approved drugs against Nsp1-C-ter (148–180 amino acids) which binds in the mRNA channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We identified top hits with at least three hydrogen bonds;(H-bonds) near the ribosome binding site of Nsp1-C-ter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Further, the clash that the drugs may have against ribosome in its bound form with Nsp1-C-ter was also analyzed. Montelukast sodium hydrate (hereafter referred to as montelukast) and saquinavir mesylate (hereafter referred to as saquinavir) showed high clash scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Montelukast is regularly used to make breathing easier in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Paggiaro and Bacci, 2011</xref>), while saquinavir is an anti-retroviral drug used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Khan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Next, all 12 drugs were tested in vitro for their ability to bind to Nsp1. <italic>The purified proteins</italic>, i.e., full-length Nsp1 and C-terminal helices truncated Nsp1 (Nsp1∆C) proteins, were loaded on the Ni-NTA sensors in bio-layer interferometry (BLI), and the compounds were screened to determine its binding to these proteins.

Relative intensity of bands was quantified using imagej/Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Virus infection</title><p>HEK293T-ACE2 cells were seeded in poly-L-lysine coated 24-well plate to reach 80% confluency at the time of infection. Vero-E6 cells were seeded in a regular 24 well plate to reach similar confluency. Cells, in quadruplicates, were first pre-treated with 5 and 10 µM concentrations of montelukast sodium hydrate (PHR1603, Merck) or saquinavir mesylate (1609829, Merck) for 3 hr in complete media, washed and infected with 0.1 MOI (HEK ACE2) or 0.001 MOI (Vero-E6 cells) SARS-CoV-2. After 48 hr, cell culture supernatants were collected for plaque assay, and cells were harvested for western blot analysis or processed for total RNA extraction using TRIzol (15596018, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The drugs were present in the media for the entire duration of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Plaque assay</title><p>Infectious virus particles from cell culture supernatants were quantified by plaque assay. Briefly, Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 12-well cell culture dishes, and once confluent, cells were washed with warm PBS and incubated with dilutions of cell culture supernatants in 100 μL complete DMEM for 1 hr at 37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The virus inoculum was then removed, and cells overlaid with 0.6% Avicel (RC-591, Dupont) in DMEM containing 2% HI-FBS. After 48 hr incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and crystal violet (C6158, Merck) staining was done to visualize the plaques.</p><p>Plasmids pLVX-EF1alpha-SARS-CoV-2-nsp1-2xStrep-IRES-Puro expressing SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 was a kind gift from Prof. Nevan Krogan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>).

The Non-structural protein (Nsp)-1 from SARS-CoV2 mimics the binding mode of eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3j) to the mRNA entry tunnel of the 40S ribosomal subunits and blocks the entry of mRNA, which shuts down host protein synthesis. As a result, the host immune function is suppressed. This makes Nsp-1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. In the revised manuscript the authors' claims are supported using Biophysical and cellular assays. They also rationalize their findings using molecular dynamics simulations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74877.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Haider</surname><given-names>Shozeb</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Haider</surname><given-names>Shozeb</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.02.466951">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.02.466951v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Shozeb Haider as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please see the recommendation for the authors below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The short report is well written and the experimental data supports the findings. The only shortcoming (though not a limitation) is the length of the MD simulation. They should be at least be 500ns to remove any doubts of the system still equilibrating.</p><p>There are too many figures for a short report. The drug screening data (in Figure 1C D E F) should be moved to SI and Figure 2 merged with Figure 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In my understanding the c-terminal region on Nsp1 is disordered in solution and folds only upon binding. Thus, it might be not a solid target for virtual screening and the proposed binding modes might be greatly affected by the flexibility of the region. In this respect the MD simulations might help to confirm the binding mode, but the simulations reported are too short (200ns) to be really conclusive.</p><p>2. The calculated binding free energies (-76 and -72 kJ/mol) are far better than the reported 10 and 7 μM binding affinities. Even accounting for the well-known lack of accuracy of MM-PBSA, the discrepancy is too large. Thus, a more predictive method, such as alchemical free energy calculations, should be used to confirm that the proposed binding modes are indeed the correct ones.</p><p>3. The experimental binding affinities to Nsp1 are quite low. Thus, the observed in vivo effects might be due to the targeting of a different viral protein, perhaps even the reported anti-protease activity.</p><p>Overall, there are many important points to clarify and thus the conclusions are not currently supported by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I recommend that the authors change &quot;in vivo&quot; models to cellular models on page 4, line 84.</p><p>The last sentence in the discussion should be changed to stating that montelukast will be an excellent starting point for the development of more potent drugs.</p><p>Abstract, lines 35 and 37: change &quot;cov&quot; to &quot;CoV&quot;.</p><p>Lines 46 and 47: change sentence as montelukast will not help to combat SARS-CoV-2 as the Kd valu is too weak with ca. 10 uM. But one could argue that it is a good starting point for the development of more potent drugs.</p><p>I think the authors could improve their manuscript by polishing the English used. Please also adjust the use of the article &quot;the&quot;. In addition, sentences could be improved in line 97, lines 136 to 137 (improve first part of the sentence), lines 143 to 144 (change &quot;was&quot; to &quot;were&quot;), lines 155 to 156, line 285 (change to &quot;amino acids 145 to 180&quot;), line 352 and line 381, to name a few. As this is an interesting manuscript, it is worth improving it!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74877.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The short report is well written and the experimental data supports the findings.

Secondly, the presence of hydrophobic interactions between the F157, P153, W161 from helix1 and V169, L173, L177 from helix2 indicate the likelihood of attaining this conformation in solution (as the hydrophobic residue would be shielded away from water).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Hydrophobic amino acids in C terminal helices of Nsp1 shows the presence of hydrophobic interactions between the two helices.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74877-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Thirdly, the molecular dynamic runs for 500 ns show the formation of stable complexes.</p><p>While we agree with the reviewer that there may some flexibility in the C-terminal region of Nsp1 in solution; however, the ribosome-bound structure (also only available structure) was a good starting structure for <italic>in silico</italic> screening, which we were able to validate with in vitro ligand binding assays and cell based assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The calculated binding free energies (-76 and -72 kJ/mol) are far better than the reported 10 and 7 μM binding affinities. Even accounting for the well-known lack of accuracy of MM-PBSA, the discrepancy is too large. Thus, a more predictive method, such as alchemical free energy calculations, should be used to confirm that the proposed binding modes are indeed the correct ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this suggestion to use more accurate method for calculating binding energy of protein-ligand complexes. We have performed End-State Free Energy Calculations for initial 5000 frames using the Ambertools20 to calculate binding energy. We found that montelukast binds with -95.8±13.3 kJ/mol (-22.9±3.2 kcal/mol) and saquinavir binds with -42.7±5.2 kJ/mol (-10.2±1.2 kcal/mol). These free energy calculations suggest stable binding of montelukast compared to saquinavir.</p><p>We note that the discrepancy is large between the calculated binding free energies and binding affinities. This may be because the <italic>in silico</italic> binding free energies are calculated with only the C-terminal region of Nsp1 only while the in vitro binding affinities are obtained from experiments with full Nsp1. In the absence of structure of full Nsp1, it is difficult to ascertain the position of C-terminal region with respect to the N-terminal domain. It is likely that in the context of full Nsp1, the C-terminal region is not as accessible (when compared to only ‘C-terminal region of Nsp1’ used for calculating binding free energies).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The experimental binding affinities to Nsp1 are quite low. Thus, the observed in vivo effects might be due to the targeting of a different viral protein, perhaps even the reported anti-protease activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed cell-based translational rescue of luciferase activity in the presence of drugs in HEK293 cells when co-transfected with Nsp1. So, the only viral protein co-transfected in this experiment was Nsp1. Here we observed that co-transfection of Nsp1 decreased the luciferase activity by almost half, which is restored by the increasing amount of montelukast (Figure 2A). This experiment shows that montelukast targets Nsp1-ribosome interaction to restore translation. SARS-CoV-2 evades immune response by blocking the translation of antiviral defence factors using Nsp1. Restoring host translation would aid in viral clearance as it allows synthesis of major immune effectors like IFN-β, IFN-l1, and interleukin-8, retinoic acid–inducible gene I (Thoms et al., 2020, Science <italic>369</italic>, 1249-1255. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680882).</p><p>We agree that the binding affinity of montelukast to Nsp1 is low. Hence we have now modified our statement to say that montelukast would be a good starting point for designing more potent drug molecules against SARS-CoV-2 (Pg 2 lines 46-47 and Pg 7, line 207-208).</p><p>Regarding the reported anti-protease activity of montelukast, Ma and Wang showed that montelukast gives false positive anti-protease activity and it cannot bind the GST-tagged-M<sup>pro</sup> in thermal shift assay and native mass spectrometry experiments. Hence, they concluded that montelukast is not SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor (Ma and Wang, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 2021; doi: 10.1073/pnas.2024420118). We have discussed this work in discussion (Pg 7, line 198-200).</p><p>Hence, the observed antiviral effects of montelukast appears to be because of targeting of the C-terminal helices of Nsp1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, there are many important points to clarify and thus the conclusions are not currently supported by the data.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I recommend that the authors change &quot;in vivo&quot; models to cellular models on page 4, line 84.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for this valuable suggestion.
