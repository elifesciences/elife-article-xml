histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) contributes to immunity to tuberculosis (TB), but the principles that govern presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I are incompletely understood. In this study, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the MHC-I repertoire of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected primary human macrophages reveals that substrates of <italic>Mtb</italic>’s type VII secretion systems (T7SS) are overrepresented among <italic>Mtb</italic>-derived peptides presented on MHC-I. Quantitative, targeted MS shows that ESX-1 activity is required for presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides derived from both ESX-1 substrates and ESX-5 substrates on MHC-I, consistent with a model in which proteins secreted by multiple T7SSs access a cytosolic antigen processing pathway via ESX-1-mediated phagosome permeabilization. Chemical inhibition of proteasome activity, lysosomal acidification, or cysteine cathepsin activity did not block presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I, suggesting involvement of other proteolytic pathways or redundancy among multiple pathways. Our study identifies <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens presented on MHC-I that could serve as targets for TB vaccines, and reveals how the activity of multiple T7SSs interacts to contribute to presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>m. tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>MHC-I</kwd><kwd>secretion systems</kwd><kwd>phagosome</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM142900-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leddy</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01A1022553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leddy</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P42 ES027707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leddy</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Forest M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Precision Cancer Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leddy</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Forest M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AI06035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leddy</surname><given-names>Owen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human macrophages infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> present peptides derived from substrates of type VII secretion systems on MHC class I via a pathway dependent on the ESX-1 secretion system and independent of antigen processing by the proteasome and cathepsins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), is a leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide, causing approximately 10 million new cases of active TB disease and 1.5 million deaths per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">World Health Organization 2022, 2021</xref>). Currently, the only clinically licensed vaccine to prevent TB is Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which protects children against disseminated <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roy et al., 2014</xref>), but provides limited and highly variable protection against pulmonary TB in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fine, 1995</xref>). More effective vaccines against TB are therefore needed, but identifying <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens capable of eliciting protective immunity remains challenging.</p><p>Multiple convergent lines of evidence from experiments in mouse and non-human primate models of TB show that CD8+ T cells can contribute to immune control of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flynn et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woodworth et al., 2008b</xref>), but the antigenic targets of protective CD8+ T cell immunity to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection have not been conclusively defined. In murine models, CD8+ T cells specific for some immunodominant <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens poorly recognize <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), implying that infected macrophages may not present all <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens that elicit cytokine-producing CD8+ T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamath et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewinsohn et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest a need to directly identify which <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens are presented on MHC-I by infected phagocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flynn et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>It is currently unknown which <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins are able to enter MHC-I antigen processing pathways in macrophages infected with virulent <italic>Mtb</italic>. Whereas some bacterial species are lysed following phagocytosis and expose their internal cell contents to antigen processing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shen et al., 1998</xref>), a high proportion of virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> remains intact and viable in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong and Hart, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that only a subset of <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins may be accessible for processing and presentation on MHC-I. Here, we use MS-based identification of peptides bound to MHC-I (immunopeptidomics) to directly identify <italic>Mtb</italic>-derived peptides presented on MHC-I in primary human macrophages infected with virulent <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv, revealing potential targets for CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity. Additionally, we use targeted MS to quantify changes in the presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides resulting from genetic perturbations to <italic>Mtb</italic> and chemical perturbations to the host cell, allowing us to probe host and bacterial determinants of antigen presentation on MHC-I in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To identify <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens presented on MHC-I, we infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages with <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv, isolated MHC-I by immunoprecipitation 72 hours post-infection, purified the associated peptides, and identified peptides by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We selected the 72 hour time point over shorter time points to allow sufficient time for antigen processing and presentation on MHC-I. Past experience suggested that choosing a longer time point would have resulted in a high rate of cell death. For an initial set of three analyses, we adapted a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stopfer et al., 2020</xref>; Protocol 1 – see Methods) for use in a biosafety level 3 (BL3) setting. We developed a further optimized protocol (Protocol 2 – see Methods) that we used for 3 additional analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes of the 6 donors analyzed were largely distinct from one another (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), enabling us to identify peptides associated with a variety of HLA alleles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The MHC-I immunopeptidome of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected human macrophages is enriched for T7SS substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of two immunopeptidomics workflows used to profile the MHC-I repertoire of <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected primary human macrophages.

For several T7SS substrates, we identified multiple peptides from the same protein, and/or identified the same peptide across multiple donors. These antigens included EsxA, PPE20, EspC, and PE35, as well as sequences conserved among the four nearly identical members of the EsxJ family of proteins (EsxJ, EsxK, EsxP, and EsxW – referred to here as EsxJKPW). T7SS substrates were significantly overrepresented in the MHC-I repertoire relative to the whole <italic>Mtb</italic> proteome, both at the peptide level (p&lt;10<sup>–10</sup>; binomial test with Bonferroni correction) and at the protein level (p&lt;10<sup>–7</sup>; hypergeometric test with Bonferroni correction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

If this were the case, ESX-1 activity would be required for presentation not only of peptides derived from ESX-1 substrates (e.g. EsxA<sub>28-36</sub> – sequence LLDEGKQSL), but also peptides derived from substrates of other T7SSs (e.g. EsxJKPW<sub>24-34</sub> – sequence QTVEDEARRMW – which is derived from ESX-5 substrates that do not require ESX-1 for secretion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champion et al., 2006</xref>).

Because methionine residues of peptides can oxidize during sample handling, we targeted both the oxidized and non-oxidized form of EsxJKPW<sub>24-34</sub> where possible. In addition to the SIL synthetic trigger peptides required for SureQuant, we also spiked pre-formed heavy isotope labeled peptide-MHC complexes (hipMHCs) into the lysates prior to immunoprecipitation to provide an internal standard that can be used to normalize out technical variation, which improves the accuracy of label-free quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stopfer et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ESX-1 activity is required for presentation of EsxA<sub>28-36</sub> and EsxJKPW<sub>24-34</sub> on MHC-I, independently of type I interferon signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the localization of EsxA and EsxJKPW in macrophages infected with wild-type <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv or the ESX-1-deficient <italic>eccCa1:Tn</italic> transposon mutant.

Our results suggest that processing of <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides for presentation on MHC-I relies on antigen processing proteases other than the proteasome, cysteine cathepsins, or other acidification-dependent lysosomal proteases, and/or that multiple redundant pathways contribute to processing of <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides for presentation on MHC-I.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our analysis of the MHC-I repertoire of primary human macrophages infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> revealed that T7SS substrates are a prominent source of <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides presented on MHC-I.

The absence of ESX-1 in BCG therefore could limit the ability of BCG to prime effective T cell responses against <italic>Mtb</italic>, not only because of the absence of antigens encoded in the ESX-1 locus but also because of altered or reduced presentation of other antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pym et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our findings contrast with previous work arguing that ESX-1 activity is dispensable for presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewinsohn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodworth et al., 2008a</xref>). ESX-1 activity is not required for <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected human monocyte-derived dendritic cells to present an epitope derived from TB8.4 (a Sec pathway substrate) to cognate T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewinsohn et al., 2006</xref>). While ESX-1 activity is required for priming of CD8+ T cell responses specific for EsxB in vivo in mice, it is dispensable for priming of CD8+ T cell responses specific for antigens exported via other secretion systems (such as TB8.4 and EsxH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Woodworth et al., 2008b</xref>). While these prior results suggest that the requirements for presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I may vary among <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens and/or vary among antigen presenting cell types, our results show that ESX-1 activity is essential for the presentation of certain <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens in infected human macrophages, beyond ESX-1 substrates alone. Whereas in axenic culture, secretion of ESX-5 substrates is independent of ESX-1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champion et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shah and Briken, 2016</xref>), the fact that presentation of peptides derived from an ESX-5 substrate on MHC-I requires ESX-1 activity supports the hypothesis that the localization of secreted <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins within a host cell may depend on the activity of multiple T7SSs. This dependence on multiple T7SSs has previously been shown for other ESX-5 substrates such as CpnT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Izquierdo Lafuente et al., 2021</xref>), and a functional interdependence between ESX-1 and ESX-3 (which respectively damage the phagosome membrane and prevent host membrane repair) has previously been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mittal et al., 2018</xref>). Our results suggest that the interdependence of <italic>Mtb</italic> T7SSs in an intracellular context influences the availability of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens for processing and presentation on MHC-I.</p><p>Prior studies have shown that <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens must access the cytosol to be presented on MHC-I in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grotzke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grotzke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewinsohn et al., 2006</xref>), and our results are consistent with a model in which ESX-1-mediated phagosomal membrane damage enables <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens to access cytosolic antigen processing and presentation pathways. However, further evidence will be needed to establish whether phagosomal membrane damage alone is sufficient to enable presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I in the absence of other ESX-1 functions. Given that our quantitative MS experiments only targeted two <italic>Mtb</italic>-derived epitopes, further experiments will also be needed to determine whether these results extend to all <italic>Mtb</italic> T7SS substrates or all <italic>Mtb</italic> MHC-I antigens, or only a subset.</p><p>In this study, we used strain H37Rv for the sake of consistency with other prior studies on antigen presentation on MHC-I and phagosome membrane damage in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infection, but antigen presentation may vary among <italic>Mtb</italic> isolates. <italic>Mtb</italic> isolates have been shown to differ in their level of ESX-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Solans et al., 2014</xref>), as well as carrying mutations in Esx-family proteins and other T7SS substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saelens et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uplekar et al., 2011</xref>).

Other proteases have previously been proposed to contribute to proteolytic processing of antigens for presentation on MHCs, including tripeptidyl peptidase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lázaro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">York et al., 2006</xref>), nardilysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kessler et al., 2011</xref>), thimet oligopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kessler et al., 2011</xref>), metalloproteinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lorente et al., 2012</xref>), and serine cathepsins such as Cathepsin G that are not inhibited by E64d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burster et al., 2010</xref>). Some of these or other enzymes may be responsible for proteolytic processing of EsxA<sub>28-36</sub> and EsxJKPW<sub>24-34</sub>, or may have a redundant role that can compensate for inhibition of conventional antigen processing pathways. Further work will be needed to determine which proteolytic pathways contribute to presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> T7SS substrates on MHC-I.</p><p>In addition to T7SS substrates, we also identified peptides derived from a Sec pathway substrate (TB8.4), and from uncharacterized hypothetical proteins (Rv1211, Rv3196A). Rv1211 and Rv3196A have both previously been detected by MS in culture filtrates of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2012</xref>), as has the <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> ortholog of Rv3196A (MMAR_1367; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cronin et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that either or both of these proteins could be secreted despite lacking readily identifiable secretion signals. TB8.4, Rv1211, and Rv3196A are all low-molecular-weight proteins, which we speculate could make it easier for them to translocate through pores in a permeabilized phagosomal membrane. Further investigation of the localization of these proteins may help us better understand how and to what extent small secreted <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins other than known T7SS substrates can contribute to the MHC-I repertoire.</p><p>Some of the <italic>Mtb</italic> MHC-I peptides we identified derive from proteins known or suspected to be associated with the mycobacterial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdallah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sampson et al., 2001</xref>). These include PPE51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), PPE20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boradia et al., 2022</xref>), PPE60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Su et al., 2018</xref>), EspC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champion et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lou et al., 2017</xref>), and PE13 [the co-transcribed binding partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) of the putative outer membrane protein PPE18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nair et al., 2009</xref>)]. While some of these proteins can also be found in soluble form in culture filtrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tufariello et al., 2016</xref>), others may be stably associated with the mycobacterial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The mechanism by which antigens associated with the outer membrane are processed and presented could differ from that of soluble secreted proteins.</p><p>Prior work shows that at least some of the MHC-I antigens we identified as potential vaccine targets are immunogenic in humans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lewinsohn et al., 2017</xref> showed that in humans with prior exposure to <italic>Mtb</italic>, EsxA, EsxB, PPE51, and EsxJKPW are sources of immunodominant CD8+ T cell antigens, while other antigens identified in our study elicited intermediate responses (PE13, PE35, PPE60, PPE19), and one elicited no detectable response (PPE20). In a separate study, CD8+ T cells (as well as CD4+ T cells) recognized multiple epitopes derived from EspC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Millington et al., 2011</xref>). Individual peptides we identified by MS have also been previously shown to be recognized by human T cells, including EsxJ<sub>24-34</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grotzke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewinsohn et al., 2013</xref>) and EsxA<sub>28-36</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tully et al., 2005</xref>), providing a proof of concept that particular epitopes identified by MS can be immunogenic. Antigens like PPE20 that did not elicit measurable CD8+ T cell responses in the context of natural infection should not necessarily be ruled out as vaccine targets, as a lack of CD8+ T cell recognition in the setting of natural infection does not necessarily imply that these antigens could not be immunogenic. Bioinformatic studies have also shown that predicted class I HLA-binding motifs are statistically underrepresented in several Esx-family protein sequences, suggesting that these proteins may be under selective pressure to escape recognition by CD8+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maman et al., 2011</xref>). This finding provides further support for the idea that T cell recognition of T7SS substrates presented on MHC-I is functionally relevant to protective immunity against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p><p>We did not detect any peptides derived from several antigens previously shown to stimulate CD8+ T cell responses in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, including responses restricted to HLA alleles represented in our DDA MS analyses [for example, EsxH and FbpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Axelsson-Robertson et al., 2015</xref>)]. This could be due to any of several biological and/or technical reasons. Given that the <italic>Mtb</italic>-derived MHC-I peptides we detected were enriched for T7SS substrates but not for substrates of the Sec or Tat secretion pathways, it is possible that the subcellular localization of antigens secreted via these pathways is not optimal for efficient presentation on MHC-I in macrophages. In this case, other types of APCs that differ in their antigen processing and presentation capabilities could still present peptides from these antigens to prime the previously observed CD8+ T cell responses. The same could also be true of certain T7SS substrate antigens (such as EsxH) if T7SS substrates vary in their subcellular localization or if presentation of certain epitopes requires antigen processing pathways not active in macrophages. In future studies, isolating MHC peptides from multiple myeloid cell types may help determine whether heterogeneity in antigen presentation among cell types contributes to apparent discrepancies between the <italic>Mtb-</italic>specific CD8+ T cell repertoire and the macrophage pMHC repertoire. Some peptides may also have been missed because they were lost to adsorption during sample handling, because they were below the limit of detection due to low abundance or ionization efficiency, or because they co-eluted with other, more abundant peptides and were therefore not prioritized for acquisition in DDA analyses. In future work, pMHC internal standards added prior to immunoprecipitation may enable accurate estimates of the limit of MS detection for specific peptides, to determine whether technical factors led to a lack of detection. Our results do not rule out presentation of additional categories of antigens besides those we detected.</p><p>Our results identify several <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins that are accessible for presentation on MHC-I in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected human macrophages, suggesting that these could serve as targets for subunit vaccines designed to elicit CD8+ T cell-mediated protection against TB. By showing that T7SS substrates are overrepresented in the MHC-I repertoire of macrophages and revealing mechanistic determinants of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen processing, our results have the potential to guide future screens to identify additional vaccine targets.

Cells were washed twice with HBSS and fixed with PBS containing 4% PFA for 1 hr, then stained with DAPI and mounted as described above (see immunofluorescence microscopy). Slides were imaged using a TissueFAXS Confocal slide scanner system (TissueGnostics). Using a ×40 objective lens, 100 fields of view were acquired per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Automated counting of nuclei</title><p>Image segmentation was performed using opencv-python 4.5.4.60. A two-dimensional Gaussian blur with a standard deviation of five pixels was applied to de-noise DAPI fluorescence images. A binary mask was generated from the smoothed DAPI image using a fluorescence intensity threshold that was determined automatically using Otsu’s thresholding method, as implemented in opencv-python.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Could the authors speculate why certain antigens (e.g. Rv0288, Rv1886c) that were previously found to be HLA*A2 restricted and elicit abundant Class-I restricted CD8 T cell responses in humans (Axelsson-Robertson, Int J Inf Dis, 2015), were not found to be presented by infected macrophages in this study? It would be useful to cite and discuss this point.</p><p>2. Although the authors used macrophages from donors expressing HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-A*02:01, other HLA alleles are expressed on these macrophages. Furthermore, other Mtb peptides were also likely to be presented (such as the PE-PPE proteins, those associated with the mycobacterial outer membrane, or sec substrate TB8.4 mentioned in lines 318-320). Were other peptides found in these quantitative MS experiments? How did their repertoire compare to those found in the initial experiments (even though the focus was on quantifying the 2 peptides mentioned)? If data are available, they would strengthen the results, if not, this should be discussed.</p><p>Related: Were peptides other than the 2 that were quantified affected by the Esx1 deletion mutant? (ie non-ESX proteins)</p><p>3. Bafilomycin and E64D appear to increase the relative abundance of both the Mtb peptides and other self-peptides. Does the use of these agents also correlate with a shift in MHC-I vs. MHC-II expression on the cell surface? Perhaps related to the mass effect if the Class-II pathway is stalled due to impaired phagolysosomal fusion.</p><p>4. If the peptides presented on MHC-I are not affected by proteasome or cathepsin B inhibition, it would be helpful if the authors could discuss why that is the case and which processes are likely responsible for antigen processing in this case (in addition to what is written in lines 252-255).</p><p>5. There are a few limitations of this study that should be addressed in the discussion. First, please address in the text why H37Rv was chosen- this is a virulent lab strain but perhaps not the best choice, as it is known to be less virulent than other strains like Erdman, CDC1551 or the Beijing strains. Adding something about this choice and why it might be a limitation of the study would be worth the author's time. Second, the suggestion that ESX-1 is required for the presentation of the antigens from other ESX systems is based on the quantification of two peptides (one from ESX-1 and one from Esx3/5). This may be a limitation of the current study. If it is not, please discuss.</p><p>Other points that should be addressed:</p><p>1. The authors should mention the rationale/significance of infecting the macrophages for 72h (rather than 24-48h) in the first set of immunopeptidomics experiments. Mtb infection &gt;48h has been associated with the downregulation of MHC-II in infected cells.</p><p>2. Hypotheses 1 and 2 are presented in the opposite order in the text (lines 133-134) as in Figure 2a.</p><p>3. Citation for the statement in line 292</p><p>4. It would be helpful if the rationale for (and the difference between) the Esx5 peptides QTVEDEARRMW vs. QTVEDEARRM(ox)W were mentioned in the Results section in addition to the legend for Figure 3. I had to search to understand why only 2 peptides were mentioned in the text, but data for 3 peptides were shown in the figure.</p><p>5. MG-132 increased the expression of extracellular and endosomal peptides, but reduced Mtb and nuclear/cytosolic proteins, which is internally consistent and strengthens the authors' conclusions that the inhibitor worked, but did not affect the expression of the two Mtb peptides quantified.</p><p>6. It is unclear why the authors think that Rv1211 and Rv3196A are candidates for proteins that facilitate protein transport across the phagosomal membrane. This seems to be speculation and completely unsupported. (lines 312)</p><p>7. There are a few typos in the figure legends (sometimes panels are bolded, and sometimes they are not), and sometimes the order of the figure doesn't align with the figure legends.</p><p>8. The manuscript is lacking many of the key citations required to put this work into context.

It would be useful to cite and discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we appreciate the reviewers bringing it up. In general, while identifying a peptide in the MHC-I repertoire by MS provides strong positive evidence for its presentation, the fact that a given epitope was not detected in our MS analyses should not be interpreted as conclusive evidence that it cannot be presented on MHC-I in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. We’ve made an effort to emphasize that there are several reasons why previously described T cell epitopes may not have been detected in our MS analyses:</p><p>1. Other types of APCs besides macrophages can also become infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> or otherwise take up <italic>Mtb</italic> antigen and prime CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. If other cell types such as dendritic cells differ in the antigen processing proteases or antigen presentation pathways they express, they may present different sets of epitopes that could prime T cell responses such as those observed by Axelsson-Robertson et al. that are specific for epitopes we did not detect.</p><p>2. Depending on their physical and chemical properties, some MHC-I peptides may be partially or completely lost during sample handling (for example, very hydrophobic peptides may be retained on the C18 SPE column – see PMID: 36194871), or may not ionize efficiently and therefore produce an MS signal below the limit of detection.</p><p>3. DDA MS analyses are inherently stochastic (as the instrument makes real-time decisions in each analysis about which MS peaks to select for fragmentation) and. MHC-I peptides that were not picked for fragmentation, either due to lower abundance compared to other simultaneously eluting peptides, or by chance, will not be identified.</p><p>We’ve added a summary of these possible reasons to the discussion text (lines 432-447):</p><p>“We did not detect any peptides derived from several antigens previously shown to stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in Mtb infection, including responses restricted to HLA alleles represented in our DDA MS analyses [for example, EsxH and FbpB (Axelsson-Robertson et al., 2015)]. This could be due to any of several biological and/or technical reasons. Given that the Mtb-derived MHC-I peptides we detected were enriched for T7SS substrates but not for substrates of the Sec or Tat secretion pathways, it’s possible that the subcellular localization of antigens secreted via these pathways does not enable efficient presentation on MHC-I in macrophages. In this case, other types of APCs that differ in their antigen processing and presentation capabilities could still present peptides from these antigens to prime the previously observed CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. The same could also be true of certain T7SS substrate antigens (such as EsxH) if T7SS substrates vary in their subcellular localization or if presentation of certain epitopes requires antigen processing pathways not active in macrophages. Some peptides may also have been missed because they were lost during sample handling, because they were below the limit of detection due to low abundance or ionization efficiency, or because they co-eluted with many more abundant peptides and were therefore not prioritized for acquisition in DDA analyses. Our results don’t rule out presentation of additional antigens besides those we detected.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although the authors used macrophages from donors expressing HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-A*02:01, other HLA alleles are expressed on these macrophages. Furthermore, other Mtb peptides were also likely to be presented (such as the PE-PPE proteins, those associated with the mycobacterial outer membrane, or sec substrate TB8.4 mentioned in lines 318-320).

If data are available, they would strengthen the results, if not, this should be discussed.</p><p>Related: Were peptides other than the 2 that were quantified affected by the Esx1 deletion mutant? (ie non-ESX proteins)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out a lack of clarity in the manuscript about the nature of the data we get out of our targeted quantitative MS analyses. We’ve attempted to clarify that these analyses only target the specific peptides for which we spike in corresponding stable isotope labeled (SIL) synthetic standards – specifically LLDEGKQSL (from EsxA), QTVEDEARRMW (from EsxJKPW) and, in the drug treatment experiments in Figure 4, several self peptides. Detection of the synthetic standard triggers acquisition of the biological peptide, so other peptides are not detected. Given that the primary cells used for these quantitative experiments were chosen such that all three donors expressed HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*57:01 but did not have any other HLA alleles in common, none of the other peptides we identified would have been detectable in cells from all three donors, even if corresponding SIL standards had been added. It’s unlikely that we would have been able to readily obtain cells from three or more donors all sharing three or more HLA of the relevant alleles.</p><p>We also emphasize the advantages of this approach that we feel compensate for the narrow focus on only a few peptides, including reliable acquisition across experimental conditions and the low limit of detection, which decreases the required sample input and makes experiments with many experimental conditions tractable.</p><p>We introduce these points in lines 202-205, which now read as follows: “Because the other Mtb epitopes detected in our untargeted MS experiments are not expected to bind these HLA alleles, we only targeted EsxA28-36 and EsxJKPW24-34. While this targeted approach is limited in the number of epitopes it can detect, it enables reliable and accurate quantification of peptides across experimental conditions with low sample input.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Bafilomycin and E64D appear to increase the relative abundance of both the Mtb peptides and other self-peptides. Does the use of these agents also correlate with a shift in MHC-I vs. MHC-II expression on the cell surface? Perhaps related to the mass effect if the Class-II pathway is stalled due to impaired phagolysosomal fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting hypothesis that we hadn’t previously considered. To determine whether a tradeoff between antigen presentation on MHC-I vs. MHC-II could lead to an increase in presentation of certain MHC-I epitopes in response to E64d or bafilomycin treatment, we analyzed flow cytometry data we had previously collected measuring surface MHC-I levels in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages treated with these drugs, and also stained <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages treated with E64d or bafilomycin for surface HLA-DR and HLA-DQ. We found that treatment with E64d led to a slight and not statistically significant decrease in MHC-I and MHC-II expression while the effect of bafilomycin treatment on MHC-I and MHC-II surface levels was minimal. This led us to conclude that a tradeoff between directing antigen to MHC-I vs. MHC-II processing pathways was unlikely to be a major contributor to the effects of drug treatment that we observed in our targeted MS experiments. To present these data, we’ve extended Figure 4 —figure supplement 3 to include two additional panels D and E that present the MHC-I data, and added Figure 4 —figure supplement 4 to present the MHC-II data.</p><p>We describe the results of our analysis of surface MHC-I on drug-treated cells on lines 272-275, which now read “All three drugs exhibited minimal cytotoxicity in macrophages at the doses used in our immunopeptidomic experiments (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2), and did not inhibit phagocytosis of Mtb or bacterial outgrowth (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3), and did not have a significant effect on surface MHC-I levels (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3).”</p><p>We describe the results of our analysis of surface MHC-II on E64d and bafilomycin-treated cells on lines 284-288, which read: “Cell surface levels of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ were not significantly affected by bafilomycin or E64d treatment (Figure 4 —figure supplement 4), suggesting that E64d and bafilomycin did not substantially stall MHC-II antigen presentation and their effects of on MHC-I presentation could not be explained as indirect effects of modulating antigen entry into the MHC-II antigen processing pathway.”</p><p>We’ve amended the Methods subsection on flow cytometry to include a description of the MHC-II-specific antibodies used (lines 743-752).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. If the peptides presented on MHC-I are not affected by proteasome or cathepsin B inhibition, it would be helpful if the authors could discuss why that is the case and which processes are likely responsible for antigen processing in this case (in addition to what is written in lines 252-255).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in possible alternative pathways of antigen processing, and we are eager to explore these possibilities in future work. We have added a paragraph to the discussion outlining some possible alternative proteolytic pathways that have previously been proposed to contribute to antigen processing on MHCs that could be involved in processing <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens presented on MHC-I (lines 379-389).</p><p>“We showed that presentation of two Mtb-derived peptides on MHC-I was independent of the activity of proteases commonly associated with antigen processing (the proteasome and cysteine cathepsins), suggesting an alternate processing mechanism. Other proteases have previously been proposed to contribute to proteolytic processing of antigens for presentation on MHCs, including tripeptidyl peptidase II (Geier et al., 1999; Guil et al., 2006; Lázaro et al., 2015; York et al., 2006), nardilysin (Kessler et al., 2011), thimet oligopeptidase (Kessler et al., 2011), metalloproteinases (Lorente et al., 2012), and serine cathepsins such as Cathepsin G that are not inhibited by E64d (Burster et al., 2010). Some of these or other enzymes may be responsible for proteolytic processing of EsxA<sub>28-36</sub> and EsxJKPW<sub>24-34</sub>, or may have a redundant role that can compensate for inhibition of conventional antigen processing pathways. Further work will be needed to determine which proteolytic pathways contribute to presentation of Mtb T7SS substrates on MHC-I.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There are a few limitations of this study that should be addressed in the discussion. First, please address in the text why H37Rv was chosen- this is a virulent lab strain but perhaps not the best choice, as it is known to be less virulent than other strains like Erdman, CDC1551 or the Beijing strains. Adding something about this choice and why it might be a limitation of the study would be worth the author's time. Second, the suggestion that ESX-1 is required for the presentation of the antigens from other ESX systems is based on the quantification of two peptides (one from ESX-1 and one from Esx3/5). This may be a limitation of the current study. If it is not, please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in how antigen presentation might vary among <italic>Mtb</italic> isolates. This is a question we also think will be interesting and important to investigate to understand both the fundamental biology of antigen presentation in TB and how to ensure broad vaccine protection across <italic>Mtb</italic> strains. We’ve added a paragraph addressing this point to the discussion (lines 372-377), which reads as follows:</p><p>“In this study, we used strain H37Rv for the sake of consistency with other prior studies on antigen presentation on MHC-I and phagosome membrane damage in Mtb-infection, but antigen presentation may vary among Mtb isolates. Mtb isolates have been shown to differ in their level of ESX-1 activity (Solans et al., 2014), as well as carrying mutations in Esx-family proteins and other T7SS substrates (Saelens et al., 2022; Uplekar et al., 2011). Further studies across multiple isolates may therefore reveal differences in antigen presentation that could be relevant for the design of broadly protective vaccines.”</p><p>Our ability to generalize about the ESX-1-dependence of MHC-I antigen presentation in <italic>Mtb</italic> infection is indeed limited by the fact that our quantitative experiments targeted two specific epitopes. To clarify this point, we’ve added more language in the discussion acknowledging the possibility that the requirements for antigen presentation on MHC-I may vary among different <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens. We’ve revised lines 340-343 to read “While ESX-1 activity is required for priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses specific for EsxB in vivo in mice, it is dispensable for priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses specific for antigens exported via other secretion systems (such as TB8.4 and EsxH) in vivo in mice (Woodworth et al., 2008a).” to emphasize the possibility of differences among antigens, and added lines 368-370, which read “Given that our quantitative MS experiments only targeted two Mtb-derived epitopes, further experiments will also be needed to determine whether these results extend to all Mtb T7SS substrates or all Mtb MHC-I antigens, or only a subset.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points that should be addressed:</p><p>1. The authors should mention the rationale/significance of infecting the macrophages for 72h (rather than 24-48h) in the first set of immunopeptidomics experiments. Mtb infection &gt;48h has been associated with the downregulation of MHC-II in infected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the time point selected is an important methodological consideration. Based on prior experience in our lab, we knew that infection of hMDMs with Mtb at MOI 2-3 for &gt;72 hours would result in a high rate of cell death, whereas cell viability is high at 72 hours. We did not want to select an earlier time point because antigens transiently presented early in infection might not be protective if T cell responses take multiple days to initiate. Also, we show in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 that infection with H37Rv does not result in down-regulation of surface MHC-I at 72 hours, which led us to conclude that global down-regulation of MHC-I antigen presentation was not a concern when analyzing antigen presentation in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected hMDMs at that time point.</p><p>We’ve added the following on lines 62-66 to clarify our rationale: “We selected the 72 hour time point over shorter time points because it has previously been reported that some Mtb antigens are expressed only transiently, early in infection (Moguche et al., 2017), whereas Mtb-specific T cell responses may take multiple days to initiate, either upon priming (Chackerian et al., 2002) or during a recall response (Gallegos et al., 2008). Past experience suggested that choosing a longer time point would have resulted in a high rate of cell death.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

It would be helpful if the rationale for (and the difference between) the Esx5 peptides QTVEDEARRMW vs. QTVEDEARRM(ox)W were mentioned in the Results section in addition to the legend for Figure 3.

In lines 205-207 of the text, we added a sentence explaining the rationale for targeting both the oxidized and non-oxidized form of the peptide: “Because methionine residues of peptides can oxidize during sample handling, we targeted both the oxidized and non-oxidized form of EsxJKPW<sub>24-34</sub> where possible.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. MG-132 increased the expression of extracellular and endosomal peptides, but reduced Mtb and nuclear/cytosolic proteins, which is internally consistent and strengthens the authors' conclusions that the inhibitor worked, but did not affect the expression of the two Mtb peptides quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We agree that the effect of MG-132 on peptides derived from cytosolic and nuclear proteins supports our conclusion that the inhibitor worked, even though we did not see the expected effect on <italic>Mtb</italic> peptides.

It is unclear why the authors think that Rv1211 and Rv3196A are candidates for proteins that facilitate protein transport across the phagosomal membrane. This seems to be speculation and completely unsupported. (lines 312)</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in this passage and thank the reviewer for pointing out that our wording here was ambiguous. What we meant was not that Rv1211 and Rv3196A might facilitate the transport of other proteins across the phagosome membrane but rather that the fact that Rv1211 and Rv3196A are small, low molecular weight proteins might make it easier for them to diffuse through pores introduced into the phagosome membrane by <italic>Mtb</italic>. We’ve reworded and attempted to clarify this sentence, which now reads “TB8.4, Rv1211, and Rv3196A are all low molecular weight proteins, which we speculate could make it easier for them to translocate through pores in a permeabilized phagosomal membrane.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

PMID: 19360129, defining the pathway used by MHC during M. tb infection for phagosomal antigens, PMID: 22901810, showed ESX-1 dependent localization of p62; It is already known that MTb localizes with markers of phagosomal membrane damage in an ESX-1 dependent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s guidance on contextualizing the relationship between ESX-1 function and MHC-I antigen presentation. We’ve added a discussion of how the bioinformatic studies in PMID: 22022257 support the functional relevance of presentation of T7SS substrates on MHC-I on lines 426-430, which read “Bioinformatic studies have also shown that predicted class I HLA-binding motifs are statistically underrepresented in several Esx-family protein sequences, suggesting that these proteins may be under selective pressure to escape recognition by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Maman et al., 2011). This finding provides further support for the idea that T cell recognition of T7SS substrates presented on MHC-I is functionally relevant to protective immunity against Mtb infection.”</p><p>We’ve added some additional detail and nuance to our discussion of PMID: 18591224 in lines 340-346 to acknowledge that the authors of this paper argue that ESX-1 is dispensable for non-ESX-1 substrates, but required for ESX-1 substrates. These lines now read “While ESX-1 activity is required for priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses specific for EsxB in vivo in mice, it is dispensable for priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses specific for antigens exported via other secretion systems (such as TB8.4 and EsxH) (Woodworth et al., 2008a). While these prior results suggest that the requirements for presentation of Mtb antigens on MHC-I may vary among Mtb antigens and/or vary among antigen presenting cell types, our results show that ESX-1 activity is essential for the presentation of certain Mtb antigens in infected human macrophages, beyond ESX-1 substrates alone.”</p><p>We’ve also made an effort to highlight prior evidence that cytosolic antigen processing is required for presentation of <italic>Mtb</italic> antigens on MHC-I in human dendritic cells. Lines 363-366 now read “Prior studies have shown that Mtb antigens must access the cytosol to be presented on MHC-I in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Grotzke et al., 2010, 2009; Lewinsohn et al., 2006), and our results are consistent with a model in which ESX-1-mediated phagosomal membrane damage enables Mtb antigens to access cytosolic antigen processing and presentation pathways.”</p><p>We’ve expanded on the passage where we highlight prior results showing ESX-1-dependent phagosome membrane damage to emphasize that the purpose of our microscopy experiments was primarily to demonstrate that this phenomenon was occurring in our primary hMDM model system at timepoints relevant to our MS analyses. Lines 159-161 now read “Our results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that ESX-1 activity is required for Mtb to damage the phagosome membrane (Augenstreich et al., 2017; Simeone et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2012) and show that this phenomenon occurs in our primary human macrophage infection model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider these references demonstrating that BCG lacks ESX-1 activity (lines 288-290) References demonstrating BCG is attenuated because it lacks ESX-1: PMID: 10320585 , BCG is missing RD1, PMID: 12410828 RD1 contributes to BCG attenuation, PMID: 12508154 deletion of RD1 from TB leads to attenuation, PMID: 12692540 restoring ESAT-6 secretion to BCG.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers for these additional references. The last reference above (PMID: 12692540) suggested a possible implication of our study that we hadn’t explicitly spelled out in our discussion – namely that. In addition to adding the suggested citations, we’ve added the following on lines 332-335: “The absence of ESX-1 in BCG therefore could limit the ability of BCG to prime effective T cell responses against Mtb, not only because of the absence of antigens encoded in the ESX-1 locus but also because of altered or reduced presentation of other antigens (Pym et al., 2003).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should review these references (lines 300-302) first suggesting the model that the ESX-1 function precedes that of the other ESX systems (2-5). PMID: 33653883 first suggested that ESX-1 functions to lyse the phagosome, and that ESX-1 activity is followed by the activity of the other ESX secretion systems (see the final model in this paper). ESX-3 was first shown to function downstream of ESX-1 in this paper (PMID: 30482832).</p></disp-quote><p>These are both excellent precedents to cite. We’ve expanded our discussion of the interdependence of T7SSs in the intracellular setting as follows (lines 346-355): “Whereas in axenic culture, secretion of ESX-5 substrates is independent of ESX-1 function (Champion et al., 2006; Shah and Briken, 2016), the fact that presentation of peptides derived from an ESX-5 substrate on MHC-I requires ESX-1 activity supports the hypothesis that the localization of secreted Mtb proteins within a host cell may depend on the activity of multiple T7SSs. This dependence on multiple T7SSs has previously been shown for other ESX-5 substrates such as CpnT (Izquierdo Lafuente et al., 2021), and a functional interdependence between ESX-1 and ESX-3 (which respectively damage the phagosome membrane and prevent host membrane repair) has previously been proposed (Mittal et al., 2018). Our results suggest that the interdependence of Mtb T7SSs in an intracellular context influences the availability of Mtb antigens for processing and presentation on MHC-I.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The original papers reporting these proteins are secreted/ localized should be cited. PMID: 19682254 EspC was first reported as an ESX substrate here. For the list of proteins in 318-320. Please address the rest.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added a citation to PMID: 19682254. We were unable to find any earlier reports of PPE51, PPE60, or PPE20 being localized to the outer membrane than the references already cited and are convinced these are the earliest reports conclusively showing outer membrane localization of these particular PPE proteins. On line 406 we’ve added citations to PMID: 11800581 and PMID: 17076665, which to the best of our knowledge established (respectively) that PE/PPE proteins can be localized to the outer membrane and that this process depends on type VII secretion systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 308-315, did the authors check if other papers that have defined the ESX-1 secretome have seen these proteins? Check PMID: 35671426 for the M. marinum orthologs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion! <italic>M. marinum</italic> does not encode a known ortholog of Rv1211, but does encode an ortholog of Rv3196A (MMAR_1367), which is detected in the supernatants of <italic>M. marinum</italic> in PMID: 35671426 in a non-ESX-1-dependent manner. This is consistent with the idea that Rv3196A could be secreted, albeit not by ESX-1. Accordingly, we’ve added a citation to PMID: 35671426 in lines 392-395, which now read “Rv1211 and Rv3196A have both previously been detected by MS in culture filtrates of Mtb (Bell et al., 2012), as has the Mycobacterium marinum ortholog of Rv3196A (MMAR_1367) (Cronin et al., 2022), suggesting that either or both of these proteins could be secreted despite lacking readily identifiable secretion signals.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
