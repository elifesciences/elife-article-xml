understanding how populations of neurons collectively encode information. While two-photon calcium imaging has created a unique opportunity to record the activity of large populations of neurons, existing methods for inferring correlations from these data face several challenges. First, the observations of spiking activity produced by two-photon imaging are temporally blurred and noisy. Secondly, even if the spiking data were perfectly recovered via deconvolution, inferring network-level features from binary spiking data is a challenging task due to the non-linear relation of neuronal spiking to endogenous and exogenous inputs. In this work, we propose a methodology to explicitly model and directly estimate signal and noise correlations from two-photon fluorescence observations, without requiring intermediate spike deconvolution. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the proposed estimator and demonstrate its utility through applications to simulated and experimentally recorded data from the mouse auditory cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>signal and noise correlations</kwd><kwd>bayesian inference</kwd><kwd>point process modeling</kwd><kwd>mouse auditory cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1807216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babadi</surname><given-names>Behtash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2032649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Babadi</surname><given-names>Behtash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U19NS107464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanold</surname><given-names>Patrick O</given-names></name><name><surname>Babadi</surname><given-names>Behtash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An inference paradigm for extracting neuronal correlations from two-photon imaging data, without requiring intermediate spike deconvolution, provides significant performance gains over existing methods as demonstrated by theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and real-data applications.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal activity correlations are essential in understanding how populations of neurons encode information. Correlations provide insights into the functional architecture and computations carried out by neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohn and Smith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lyamzin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Montijn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sompolinsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yatsenko et al., 2015</xref>). Neuronal activity correlations are often categorized in two groups: <italic>signal</italic> correlations and <italic>noise</italic> correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen and Kohn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gawne and Richmond, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Josić et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lyamzin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vinci et al., 2016</xref>). Given two neurons, signal correlation quantifies the similarity of neural responses that are time-locked to a repeated stimulus across trials, whereas noise correlation quantifies the stimulus-independent trial-to-trial variability shared by neural responses that are believed to arise from common latent inputs.</p><p>Two-photon calcium imaging has become increasingly popular in recent years to record in vivo neural activity simultaneously from hundreds of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Romano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stosiek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Svoboda and Yasuda, 2006</xref>). This technology takes advantage of intracellular calcium flux mostly arising from spiking activity and captures calcium signaling in neurons in living animals using fluorescence microscopy. The observed fluorescence traces of calcium concentrations, however, are indirectly related to neuronal spiking activity. Extracting spiking activity from fluorescence traces is a challenging signal deconvolution problem and has been the focus of active research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deneux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grewe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jewell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jewell and Witten, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kazemipour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pachitariu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stringer and Pachitariu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Theis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vogelstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vogelstein et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The most commonly used approach to infer signal and noise correlations from two-photon data is to directly apply the classical definitions of correlations for firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lyamzin et al., 2015</xref>), to fluorescence traces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fallani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Francis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rothschild et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>). However, it is well known that fluorescence observations are noisy and blurred surrogates of spiking activity, because of dependence on observation noise, calcium dynamics and the temporal properties of calcium indicators. Due to temporal blurring, the resulting signal and noise correlation estimates are highly biased. An alternative approach is to carry out the inference in a two-stage fashion: first, infer spikes using a deconvolution technique, and then compute firing rates and evaluate the correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerlin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Najafi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramesh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soudry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yatsenko et al., 2015</xref>). These two-stage estimates are highly sensitive to the accuracy of spike deconvolution, and require high temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lütcke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pachitariu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, these deconvolution techniques are biased toward obtaining accurate first-order statistics (i.e. spike timings) via spatiotemporal priors, which may be detrimental to recovering second-order statistics (i.e. correlations). Finally, both approaches also undermine the non-linear dynamics of spiking activity as governed by stimuli, past activity and other latent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Truccolo et al., 2005</xref>). There are a few existing studies that aim at improving estimation of neuronal correlations, but they either do not consider signal correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rupasinghe and Babadi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yatsenko et al., 2015</xref>), or aim at estimating surrogates of correlations from spikes such as the connectivity/coupling matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitchison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mishchenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soudry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we propose a methodology to <italic>directly</italic> estimate both signal and noise correlations from two-photon imaging observations, without requiring an intermediate step of spike deconvolution. We pose the problem under the commonly used experimental paradigm in which neuronal activity is recorded during trials of a repeated stimulus. We avoid the need to perform spike deconvolution by integrating techniques from point processes and state-space modeling that explicitly relate the signal and noise correlations to the observed fluorescence traces in a multi-tier model. Thus, we cast signal and noise correlations within a parameter estimation setting. To solve the resulting estimation problem in an efficient fashion, we develop a solution method based on variational inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jordan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blei et al., 2017</xref>), by combining techniques from Pólya-Gamma augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Polson et al., 2013</xref>) and compressible state-space estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rauch et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kazemipour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ba et al., 2014</xref>). We also provide theoretical guarantees on the bias and variance performance of the resulting estimator.</p><p>We demonstrate the utility of our proposed estimation framework through application to simulated and real data from the mouse auditory cortex during presentations of tones and acoustic noise. In application to repeated trials under spontaneous and stimulus-driven conditions within the same experiment, our method reliably provides noise correlation structures that are invariant across the two conditions. In addition, our joint analysis of signal and noise correlations corroborates existing hypotheses regarding the distinction between their structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartolo et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, while application of our proposed method to spatial analysis of signal and noise correlations in the mouse auditory cortex is consistent with existing work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>), it reveals novel and distinct spatial trends in the correlation structure of layers 2/3 and 4. In summary, our method improves on existing work by: (1) explicitly modeling the fluorescence observation process and the non-linearities involved in spiking activity, as governed by both the stimulus and latent processes, through a multi-tier Bayesian forward model, (2) joint estimation of signal and noise correlations directly from two-photon fluorescence observations through an efficient iterative procedure, without requiring intermediate spike deconvolution, (3) providing theoretical guarantees on the performance of the proposed estimator, and (4) gaining access to closed-form posterior approximations, with low-complexity and iterative update rules and minimal dependence on training data. Our proposed method can thus be used as a robust and scalable alternative to existing approaches for extracting signal and noise correlations from two-photon imaging data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>In this section, we first demonstrate the utility of our proposed estimation framework through simulation studies as well as applications on experimentally recorded data from the mouse auditory cortex.

Next, we tested our proposed estimation framework on data simulated with a different calcium decay model. Specifically, we simulated data with second-order autoregressive calcium dynamics, and at a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the setting of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and used our inference framework which assumes first order calcium dynamics for estimation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> shows the corresponding noise and signal correlations estimated by the proposed method under these conditions. Even though the performance slightly degrades (in terms of NMSE and leakage ratio), our method is able to recover the underlying correlations faithfully under this setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Robustness to SNR level and firing rate. Next, we compared the performance of Pearson and Two-Stage Pearson methods with our proposed method under varying SNR levels and average firing rates, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>. While the performance of all methods degrades at low SNR levels or firing rates (SNR &lt; 10 dB, firing rate &lt; 0.5 Hz), our proposed method outperforms the existing methods for a wide range of SNR and firing rate values. To quantify this comparison, we have also indicated the mean and standard deviation of the relative performance gain of our proposed estimates across SNR levels and firing rates as insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Robustness to observation noise model mismatch. Finally, we repeated the foregoing comparisons under varying SNR levels and firing rates, only now we included an additional observation noise model mismatch. Similar to the treatment in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deneux et al., 2016</xref>, we considered two temporally correlated observation noise models: white noise with a low frequency drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, top panels) and pink noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>, bottom panels). In accordance with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>, our proposed method outperforms the existing ones for a wide range of SNR and firing rate values and under both observation noise model mismatch conditions. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C and F</xref>, it can be observed that the ground truth spikes are favorably recovered as a byproduct of our method, even though the estimated calcium concentrations are contaminated by the temporally correlated fluctuations in observation noise.

we have depicted the scatter plots of signal vs. noise correlations estimated by each method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. To examine the possibility of the leakage effect on a pairwise basis, we performed linear regression in each case. The slope of the model fit, the p-value for the corresponding t-test, and the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf127"><mml:msup><mml:mo>R</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> values are reported in the third and fourth columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> (the slope and p-values are also shown as insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>, the Pearson estimates suggest a significant correlation between the signal and noise correlation pairs (as indicated by the higher slope in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, none of the other estimates (including the proposed estimates) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> register a significant trend between signal and noise correlations. This further corroborates our assessment of the high leakage between signal and noise correlations in Pearson estimates, since such a leakage effect could result in overestimation of the trend between the signal and noise correlation pairs. The signal and noise correlations estimated by our proposed method show no pairwise trend, suggesting distinct patterns of stimulus-dependent and stimulus-independent functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kohn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Montijn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rothschild et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keeley et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A key advantage of our proposed method over the Pearson and two-stage approaches is the explicit modeling of stimulus integration. The relevant parameter in this regard is the length of the stimulus integration window <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf128"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. While in our simulation studies the value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf129"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was known, it needs to be set by the user in real data applications. To this end, domain knowledge or data-driven methods such as cross-validation and model order selection can be utilized (see Guidelines for model parameter settings for details). Noting that the number of parameters to be estimated linearly scales with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf130"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, it must be chosen large enough to capture the stimulus effects, yet small enough to result in favorable computational complexity.

This effect is due to successive closely spaced spikes, which implies the occurrence of more than one spike per frame and thus violates our Bernoulli modeling assumption. To inspect the performance of our method more carefully under this scenario, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> a zoomed-in view of the estimated latent processes <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf140"><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> (calcium concentration) and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf141"><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> (putative spikes) for a sample data segment with high fluorescence activity. The estimated latent processes reveal two mechanisms leveraged by our inference method to mitigate the aforementioned model mismatch: first, our proposed method predicts spiking events in adjacent time frames to compensate for rapid increase in firing rate and thus infers calcium concentration levels that match the observed fluorescence; secondly, even though our generative model assumes that there is only one spiking event in a given time frame, this restriction is mitigated in our inference framework by relaxing the constraint <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf142"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>:=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, as explained in Low-complexity parameter updates.

Fluorescence observations exhibit structured dynamics due to the exponential intracellular calcium concentration decay (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, for example), which are in turn related to the underlying spikes that are driven non-linearly by intrinsic/extrinsic stimuli as well as the properties of the indicator used. As such, an accurate inference method is expected to be specific to this temporal structure. To test this, we randomly shuffled the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf144"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> time frames consistently in the same order in all trials, in order to fully break the temporal structure governing calcium decay dynamics, and then estimated correlations from these shuffled data using the different methods. The resulting estimates of noise correlations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> for one instance of such shuffled data. The average NMSE for a total of 50 shuffled samples with respect to the original un-shuffled estimates (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are tabulated in the fifth and sixth columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and are also indicated below each panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Assessing the specificity of different estimation results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</title><p>Rows from left to right: proposed method, Pearson correlations from two-photon data, two-stage Pearson and two-stage GPFA estimates.

Since this method treats each time frame to be independent, temporal shuffling does not impact the correlations in anyway. On the other extreme, both of the two-stage estimates seem to detect highly variable and large correlation values, despite operating on data that lacks any relevant temporal structure. Our proposed method, however, remarkably produces negligible correlation estimates. Although both the two-stage and proposed estimates show variability with respect to the shuffled data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, fifth column), the standard deviation of the NMSE values of our proposed method are considerably smaller than those of the two-stage methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, fifth column).

The original un-shuffled estimates are marked by the dashed vertical lines in each case. The proposed estimate in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> is highly concentrated around zero, even though the un-shuffled estimate is non-zero. However, the two-stage estimates produce correlations that are widely variable across the shuffling trials. This analysis demonstrates that our proposed method is highly specific to the temporal structure of fluorescence observations, whereas the Pearson correlations from two-photon recordings, two-stage Pearson and two-stage GPFA methods fail to be specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Real data study 2: spontaneous vs. stimulus-driven activity in the mouse A1</title><p>To further validate the utility of our proposed methodology, we applied it to another experimentally-recorded dataset from the mouse A1 layer 2/3.

The dataset included fluorescence activity recorded during multiple experiments of presenting sinusoidal amplitude-modulated tones, with each stimulus being repeated across several trials (see Experimental procedures and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowen et al., 2020</xref> for experimental details). In each experiment, we selected on average around 20 responsive neurons for subsequent analysis (according to the criterion described in Guidelines for model parameter settings). For brevity, we compare the estimates of signal and noise correlations using our proposed method only with those obtained by Pearson correlations from the two-photon data. The latter method was also used in previous analyses of data from this experimental paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In parallel to the results reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> illustrate the correlation between the signal and noise correlations in layers 2/3 and 4, respectively. Consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>, the signal and noise correlations exhibit positive correlation in both layers, regardless of the method used. However, the correlation coefficients (i.e. slopes in the insets) identified by our proposed method are notably smaller than those obtained from Pearson correlations, in both layer 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and layer 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Comparing this result with our simulation studies suggests that the stronger linear trend between the signal and noise correlations observed using the Pearson correlation estimates is likely due to the mixing between the estimates of signal and noise correlations. As such, our method suggests that the signal and noise correlations may not be as highly correlated with one another as indicated in previous studies of layer 2/3 and 4 in mouse A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Next, to evaluate the spatial distribution of signal and noise correlations, we plotted the correlation values for pairs of neurons as a function of their distance for layer 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and layer 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

This further corroborates our hypothesis on the possibility of high mixing between the signal and noise correlation estimates obtained by the Pearson correlation of two-photon data. To further examine the differences between the signal and noise correlations, the marginal distributions along the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal axes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>, selectively overlaid for ease of visual comparison. To quantify the differences between the spatial distributions of signal and noise correlations estimated by each method, we performed Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on each pair of marginal distributions, which are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.

To test this effect, we computed the angular marginal distributions and performed KS tests for non-uniformity, which are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>. These tests indicate that all distributions are significantly non-uniform.

The improved correspondence of our proposed method compared to results obtained using Pearson correlations could be the result of the demixing of signal and noise correlations in our method. As a result of the demixing, our proposed method also suggests that noise correlations have a negative trend with distance in layer 2/3, but are much sparser and spatially flat in layer 4. In addition, the spatial spread patterns of signal and noise correlations are more structured and remarkably more distinct for our proposed method than those obtained by the Pearson estimates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Theoretical analysis of the bias and variance of the proposed estimators</title><p>Finally, we present a theoretical analysis of the bias and variance of the proposed estimator.

Existing widely used methods either take the fluorescence traces as surrogates of spiking activity, or first recover the unobserved spikes using deconvolution techniques, both followed by computing Pearson correlations or connectivity matrices. As such, they typically result in estimates that are highly biased and are heavily dependent on the choice of the spike deconvolution technique. We addressed these issues by explicitly relating the signal and noise covariances to the observed two-photon data via a multi-tier Bayesian model that accounts for the observation process and non-linearities involved in spiking activity. We developed an efficient estimation framework by integrating techniques from variational inference and state-space estimation. We also established performance bounds on the bias and variance of the proposed estimators, which revealed favorable scaling with respect to the observation noise and trial length.</p><p>We demonstrated the utility of our proposed estimation framework on both simulated and experimentally recorded data from the mouse auditory cortex. In our simulation studies, we evaluated the robustness of our proposed method with respect to several model mismatch conditions induced by the stimulus integration model, calcium decay, SNR level, firing rate, and temporally correlated observation noise. In all cases, we observed that our proposed estimates outperform the existing methods in recovering the signal and noise correlations.</p><p>There are two main sources for the observed performance gap between our proposed method and existing approaches. The first source is the favorable <italic>soft</italic> decisions on the timing of spikes achieved by our method as a byproduct of the iterative variational inference procedure. An accurate probabilistic decoding of spikes results in better estimates of the signal and noise correlations, and conversely having more accurate estimates of the signal and noise covariances improves the probabilistic characterization of spiking events. This is in contrast with both the Pearson correlations computed from two-photon data and two-stage methods: in computing the Pearson correlations from two-photon data, spike timing is heavily blurred by the calcium decay; in the two-stage methods, erroneous <italic>hard</italic> decisions on the timing of spikes result in biases that propagate to and contaminate the downstream signal and noise correlation estimation and thus results in significant errors.</p><p>The second source of performance improvement is the explicit modeling of the non-linear mapping from stimulus and latent covariates to spiking through a canonical point process model, which is in turn tied to a two-photon observation model in a multi-tier Bayesian fashion. Our theoretical analysis in Theorem 1 corroborates that this virtue of our proposed methodology results in robust performance under limited number of trials. As we have shown in Appendix 1, as the number of trials <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf249"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and trial duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf250"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> tend to infinity, conventional notions of signal and noise correlation indeed recover the ground truth signal and noise correlations, as the biases induced by non-linearities average out across trial repetitions. However, as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, in order to achieve comparable performance to our method using few trials (e.g. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf251"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), the conventional correlation estimates require considerably more trials (e.g. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf252"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).</p><p>Application to two-photon data recorded from the mouse primary auditory cortex showed that unlike the aforementioned existing methods, our estimates provide noise correlation structures that are expectedly invariant across spontaneous and stimulus-driven conditions within an experiment, while producing signal correlation structures that are largely distinct from those given by noise correlation. These results provide evidence for the involvement of distinct functional neuronal network structures in encoding the stimulus-dependent and stimulus-independent information.</p><p>Our analysis of the relationship between the signal and noise correlations in layers 2/3 and 4 in mouse A1 indicated a smaller correlation between signal and noise correlations than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>). Thus, our proposed method suggests that the signal and noise correlations reflect distinct circuit mechanisms of sound processing in layers 2/3 vs 4. The spatial distribution of signal correlations obtained by our method was consistent with previous work showing significant negative trends with distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winkowski and Kanold, 2013</xref>). However, in addition, our proposed method revealed a significant negative trend of noise correlations with distance in layer 2/3, but not in layer 4, in contrast to the outcome of Pearson correlation analysis. The lack of a negative trend in layer 4 could be attributed to the sparse nature of the noise correlation spread in layer 4, as revealed by our analysis of two-dimensional spatial spreads. The latter analysis indeed revealed that the noise correlations in layer 2/3 are more widespread than those in layer 4, consistent with existing work based on whole-cell patch recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meng et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>The two-dimensional spatial spreads of signal and noise correlations obtained by our method are more distinct than those obtained by Pearson correlations. The spatial spreads also allude to directionality of the functional connectivity patterns, with a notable rostrocaudal preference in layer 4. This result seems surprising in light of existing evidence for quasi-rostrocaudal organization of the tonotopic axis in mouse A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Romero et al., 2020</xref>). However, given the heterogeneity of tuning in both layers 2/3 and 4 with a best frequency interqartile range of ∼1–1.5 octaves over the imaging field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>) and using supra-threshold tones, we expect that the tones will drive not only neurons with the corresponding best frequency, but also neurons tuned to neighboring frequencies. Moreover, there is high connectivity between layer 4 cells within a few 100 μm across the tonotopic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kratz and Manis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2017a</xref>), potentially amplifying and broadening the effect of supra-threshold tones.</p><p>Our proposed method can scale up favorably to larger populations of neurons, thanks to the underlying low-complexity variational updates in the inference procedure. Due to its minimal dependence on training data, our estimation framework is also applicable to single-session analysis of two-photon data with limited number of trials and duration. Another useful byproduct of the proposed framework is gaining access to approximate posterior densities in closed-form, which allows further statistical analyses such as construction of confidence intervals. Our proposed methodology can thus be used as a robust and scalable alternative to existing approaches for extracting neuronal correlations from two-photon calcium imaging data.</p><p>A potential limitation of our proposed generative model is the assumption that there is at most one spiking event per time frame for each neuron, in light of the fact that typical two-photon imaging frame durations are in the range of 30–100 ms. Average spike rates of excitatory neurons in mouse A1 layers 2/3 and 4 are of the order of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf253"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petrus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forli et al., 2018</xref>) and thus our model is reasonable for the current study, although it might not be optimal during bursting activity. It is noteworthy that we relax this assumption in the inference framework by allowing the magnitude of putative spikes to be greater than one, thus alleviating the model mismatch during episodes of rapid increase in firing rate. This assumption can also be made more precise by adopting a Poisson model, but that would render closed-form variational density updates intractable.</p><p>Furthermore, in the regime of extremely low spiking rate and high observation noise, the proposed method may fail to capture the underlying correlations faithfully and its performance degrades to those of existing methods based on Pearson correlations, as we have shown through our simulation studies. Nevertheless, our method addresses key limitations of conventional signal and noise correlation estimators that persist even in high spiking rate and high SNR conditions.</p><p>Our proposed estimation framework can be used as groundwork for incorporating other notions of correlation such as the connected correlation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2020</xref>), and to account for non-Gaussian and higher order structures arising from spatiotemporal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kadirvelu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2011</xref>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This study establishes a new method for more precise estimation of pairwise noise and signal correlations in two-photon calcium imaging, by modeling generically the influence of calcium dynamics and subtracting the interaction between response signals and variability when the trial number is low. The accuracy of this new estimator is demonstrated here for the mouse auditory cortex, but this tool will find useful applications on a large diversity of datasets.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Direct Extraction of Signal and Noise Correlations from Two-Photon Calcium Imaging of Ensemble Neuronal Activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Brice Bathellier as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1. and the evaluation has been overseen by Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers agree on the quality of the method proposed in this study and it potential for assessing correlations in two-photon calcium imaging data. However, two points should be carefully addressed according to the comments below. First the authors should better explain what aspect of your method is key for your approach to outperform others methods. Second, the authors should better explore the behavior of your method on data that does not fulfil the core assumptions you make (uncorrelated noise, LN response model).</p><p>1. Surrogate data use a measurement noise model that has no temporal correlations. This is not the case in real two-photon imaging data, which include both correlation-free noise (photon count statistics) and temporally (and spatially) correlated artefacts. As in Deneux et al. 2016 (cited in the paper), the authors should provide simulations with different types of noise and show how this affects their correlation estimates. Is it still more robust than more classical methods?</p><p>2. Another simplifying assumption used by the authors is their model of spiking activity which is composed of a linear receptive field followed by a non-linear mapping function. Several papers have shown that this only imperfectly models neural responses (e.g. to sound in auditory cortex). There are, in fact in real neural data, non-linearities that are more complex than what the mapping function can capture. How does this impact their estimate? The authors should simulate this with e.g. a multilayer network (two-layer linear non-linear cascade, deep net) or simulate neurons that respond to the quadratic sum of the output of several linear filter (see e.g. recent work by the Shamma and colleagues).</p><p>3. There is a lack of intuition about the key aspects in their approach that makes it overperform other methods. This should be introduced in the results and/or discussion to better guide and convince the reader.</p><p>It is crucial that any end-user be able to get a clear picture of the conditions under which the method can or cannot be applied before diving in. The fact that such an applicability domain is not well defined is a major concern. Notably, each Real Data Study presented in the paper uses a preliminary selection of &quot;highly active cells&quot; (1rst study: N = 16; 2nd study: N = 10; 3rd study: N~20 per field), as the authors succinctly discuss that performance is expected to degrade &quot;in the regime of extremely low spiking rate and high observation noise&quot; (l. 518-519). But no precise criteria are provided to specify what is meant by &quot;highly active cells&quot;. On the other hand, the authors also assume that there is at most one spiking event per time frame for each neuron, which seems to exclude bursting neurons. The latter assumption seems to be a challenge with respect to the example traces shown on Figure 4C (∆F/F reaches 400%) and on Figure 6C (∆F/F reaches 100%), considering that the GCaMP6s signal for a single spike is expected to peak below 10-20%. This forces the authors to take a scaling factor of the observations A = 1 x I (Real Data Study 1 and 3) or A = 0.75 x I (Real Data Study 2) compared to the A = 0.1 x I taken in the Simulation Studies. Therefore, it looks like if the Real Data Studies were performed on mainly bursting cells and each burst was counted as one spiking event. A detailed discussion of the usable range of firing rates, whether in spike or burst units, as well as the usable range of SNR should be added to the main text to allow future users to assess the suitability of their data for this analysis.</p><p>4. Another parameter seems to be set by the authors on a criterion that is unclear to me: the number of time lags R to be included in the sound stimulus vector st. It seems to act as a memory of the past trajectory of the stimulus and probably serves to enhance the effect of stimulus onset/offset relative to the rest of the sound presentation. It is consistent with the known tendency of neurons in the primary auditory cortex to respond to these abrupt changes in sound power. However, this R is set at 2 in the Simulation Study 1, whereas it is set at 25, in the Real Data Studies 1 and 3, and to 40 in the Real Data Study 2. What leads to these differences escaped to me and should be explained more clearly.</p><p>5. This memory of the past stimulus trajectory appears to be specific to the proposed method and is not accounted for in the 2-stage Pearson estimation, for example. Since it probably helps to reflect the common sensitivity of neurons to onset/offset, it alone provides an advantage to the proposed method over the 2-stage Pearson estimation. It would be instructive to also perform this comparison with R set to 1 to get an idea of the magnitude of this advantage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

As explained earlier in response to the public portion of Reviewer 1’s comments, motivated by this suggestion, we have substantially enhanced our performance analyses in the revised manuscript and compiled them in a new subsection titled “Analysis of Robustness with respect to Modeling Assumptions” for better clarity and consistency.</p><p>Specifically, we considered two observation noise model mismatch conditions, namely, white noise + low frequency drift and pink noise, similar to the treatment in Deneux et al. (2016). For each noise mismatch model, we also varied the SNR level and firing rate and compared the performance of the different algorithms as reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 6. These new analyses demonstrate that our proposed estimates outperform the existing methods, under correlated generative noise models, and also with respect to varying levels of SNR and firing rate. As clearly evident in panels C and F of Figure 2—figure supplement 6, even though the estimated calcium concentrations are contaminated by the temporally correlated fluctuations in observation noise, the putative spikes estimated as a byproduct of our iterative method closely match the ground truth spikes, which in turn results in accurate estimates of signal and noise correlations.</p><p>To address this comment, we performed extensive simulations to evaluate the robustness of different algorithms under model mismatch conditions induced by temporal correlations of observation noise. These new analyses are included in a new subsection called “Analysis of Robustness with respect to Modeling Assumptions” (Pages 6-7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another simplifying assumption used by the authors is their model of spiking activity which is composed of a linear receptive field followed by a non-linear mapping function. Several papers have shown that this only imperfectly models neural responses (e.g. to sound in auditory cortex). There are, in fact in real neural data, non-linearities that are more complex than what the mapping function can capture. How does this impact their estimate? The authors should simulate this with e.g. a multilayer network (two-layer linear non-linear cascade, deep net) or simulate neurons that respond to the quadratic sum of the output of several linear filter (see e.g. recent work by the Shamma and colleagues).<disp-formula id="equ123"><mml:math id="m123"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">Bernoulli</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">logistic</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>⊤</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mover><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̃</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>⊤</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="true">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mover><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̃</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>⊤</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="true">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. As explained earlier in response to the public portion of Reviewer 1’s comments, we have addressed this comment in the revised manuscript in the new subsection titled “Analysis of Robustness with respect to Modeling Assumptions”. To examine the robustness of our method with respect to model mismatch in stimulus integration, as suggested, we generated data according to a non-linear (i.e., quadratic sum of linear filters) receptive field model:but assumed a linear stimulus integration model in our inference procedure (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf972"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̃</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̃</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). The comparison of the correlations estimated under this setting by each method are shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 3. While the performance of our proposed signal correlation estimates under this setting degrade as compared to that in Figure 2 with no model mismatch, our proposed estimates still outperform the other methods and recovers the ground truth signal correlation structure reasonably well.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the model mismatch in the stimulus integration component does not affect the accuracy of noise correlation estimates in our method, as is evident from the noise correlation estimates in Figure 2—figure supplement 3. In comparison, the biases induced in the other methods due to model mismatch and various other factors such as observation noise, temporal blurring, undermining non-linear mappings between spikes and underlying covariates, results in significantly larger errors in both signal and noise correlation estimates.</p><p>Finally, we would like to note that since our model is a baseline framework for signal and noise correlation estimation from two-photon imaging data, it has the inherent limitations of the underlying modeling assumptions such as linear receptive fields and binary spiking. However, it is possible to generalize our approach beyond linear stimulus integration by extending to non-linear models such as those parameterized by neural networks, as we have also outlined towards the end of the Discussion.</p><p>To address this comment, we performed a new simulation study to evaluate the robustness of different algorithms under model mismatch conditions induced by non-linear stimulus integration model.

There is a lack of intuition about the key aspects in their approach that makes it overperform other methods. This should be introduced in the results and/or discussion to better guide and convince the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this source of ambiguity. The two main sources for the observed performance gap between our proposed method and existing approaches can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) Favorable <italic>soft</italic> decisions on the timing of spikes achieved by our method, as a byproduct of the iterative variational inference procedure: an accurate probabilistic decoding of spikes results in better estimates of the signal/noise correlations, and conversely having more accurate estimates of the signal/noise covariances improves the probabilistic characterization of spiking events. This is in contrast with both the Pearson and Two-Stage methods: in the Pearson method, spike timing is heavily blurred by the calcium decay; in the two-stage methods, erroneous <italic>hard</italic> (i.e., binary) decisions on the timing of spiking events result in biases that propagate to and contaminate the downstream signal and noise correlation estimation and thus result in significant errors.</p><p>2) Explicit modeling of the non-linear mapping from stimulus and latent noise covariates to spiking through a canonical point process model (which is in turn tied to a two-photon observation model in a multi-tier Bayesian fashion) results in robust performance under limited number of trials and observation duration. As we have shown in Appendix 1, as the number of trials L and trial duration T tend to infinity, conventional notions of signal and noise correlation indeed recover the ground truth signal and noise correlations, as the biases induced by non-linearities average out across trial repetitions. However, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, in order to achieve comparable performance to our method using 20 trials, the conventional correlation estimates require ~1000 trials.</p><p>To address this comment, we have now included the aforementioned sources of performance gap in the revised Discussion section, highlighting the key aspects of our method that makes it outperform existing approaches (Pages 17-18).</p></body></sub-article></article>
