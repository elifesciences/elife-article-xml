effective cell source for cell transplantation to treat liver diseases; however, their availability is limited due to a donor shortage. Thus, a novel cell source must be developed. We recently reported that mature rodent hepatocytes can be reprogrammed into progenitor-like cells with a repopulative capacity using small molecule inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate that hepatic progenitor cells can be obtained from human infant hepatocytes using the same strategy. These cells, named human chemically induced liver progenitors (hCLiPs), had a significant repopulative capacity in injured mouse livers following transplantation. hCLiPs redifferentiated into mature hepatocytes in vitro upon treatment with hepatic maturation-inducing factors. These redifferentiated cells exhibited cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymatic activities in response to CYP-inducing molecules and these activities were comparable with those in primary human hepatocytes. These findings will facilitate liver cell transplantation therapy and drug discovery studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the most successful treatments for liver disease is transplanting a donor liver into a patient. But demands for donor livers far outstrips supply. A promising alternative could be, rather than replacing the whole organ, to transplant patients with individual liver cells called hepatocytes. These cells can then move into the liver, replace damaged cells, and help support the organ. However, hepatocytes are also in short supply, as despite the liver’s amazing regenerative abilities, these cells struggle to divide outside of the body. Improving how these cells multiply, could therefore help more people receive hepatocyte transplants.</p><p>In 2017, researchers found a way to convert mouse and rat hepatocytes into cells that could divide more rapidly using a cocktail of three small molecules. These 'chemically induced liver progenitors', or CLiPs for short, were able to mature into working hepatocytes and support injured mouse livers. But, discoveries made in rats and mice are not always applicable to humans. Now, Katsuda et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2017 work – have set out to investigate whether CLiPs can also be made from human cells, and if so, whether these cells can be used for hepatocyte transplantations.</p><p>Using a similar cocktail of molecules, Katsuda et al. managed to convert infant human hepatocytes into CLiPs. As with the rodent cells, these human CLiPs were able to turn back into mature, working liver cells. When transplanted into mice with genetic liver diseases, the human CLiPs moved into the liver and became part of the organ. These transplanted cells were able to reconstruct the liver tissue of diseased mice, and in some cases, replaced more than 90% of the liver’s damaged cells.</p><p>Developing human CLiP technology could provide a new way to support people on the waiting list for liver transplantation. But there are some obstacles still to overcome. At present the technique only works with hepatocytes from infant donors. The next step is to improve the method so that it works with liver cells donated by adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatocyte</kwd><kwd>liver progenitor cell</kwd><kwd>transplantation</kwd><kwd>liver repopulation</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16fk0310512h0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ochiya</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17fk0310101h0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ochiya</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>InterStem Co, Ltd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ochiya</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000646</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16K16643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Katsuda</surname><given-names>Takeshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human chemically induced liver progenitors (hCLiPs), which are generated from primary human hepatocytes, exhibit the potential to repopulate injured livers of host mice with efficiency &gt; 90%.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Expansion of functional human hepatocytes is a prerequisite for liver regenerative medicine. Human hepatocytes are currently regarded as the only competent cell source for transplantation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisher and Strom, 2006</xref>); however, their availability is limited due to a shortage of donors. Moreover, the therapeutic application of hepatocytes is hampered by their inability to proliferate in vitro. To overcome this, researchers have sought to generate expandable cell sources as alternatives to primary hepatocytes. Such cell sources include embryonic stem cell- and induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived hepatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carpentier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takebe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), lineage-converted hepatic cells (induced hepatic cells; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 2014</xref>), and facultative liver stem/progenitor cells (LPCs) residing in adult liver tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huch et al., 2015</xref>). However, while primary hepatocytes efficiently repopulate injured mouse livers (repopulation indexes (RIs) &gt; 50%), the repopulation efficiency of these laboratory-generated hepatocytes is limited, with reported RIs generally less than 5% (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rezvani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Researchers have also attempted to expand primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) in vitro. Several studies reported the expansion of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Utoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walldorf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamasaki et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that they are potentially applicable for transplantation therapy. However, the growth rate and proliferative lifespan of PHHs are limited. For example, Yoshizato’s group reported that PHHs can be cultured for several passages, but their growth rate is slow (population doubling time of 20–300 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamasaki et al., 2006</xref>). This finding indicates that culture of PHHs must be improved for the clinical application of these cells.</p><p>We recently reported that a cocktail of small molecule signaling inhibitors reprograms rodent adult hepatocytes into culturable LPCs, named chemically induced liver progenitors (CLiPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuda et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, rat CLiPs extensively repopulate chronically injured mouse livers without causing any tumorigenic features. Here, using the same strategy, we demonstrate that human infant hepatocytes can be also converted into proliferative LPC-like cells, which are named human CLiPs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Small molecules support expansion of PHHS</title><p>In a pilot study, we tested whether the combination of Y-27632 (Y), A-83–01 (A), and CHIR99021 (C), the chemical cocktail used to reprogram rodent hepatocytes, also induced proliferation of commercially available cryopreserved adult PHHs (APHHs) (donor information is summarized in (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast with the basal culture medium (small hepatocyte medium (SHM)), culture in YAC-containing SHM (SHM+YAC) induced the proliferation of cells that morphologically resembled epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These cells were small and had a higher nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio than hepatocytes, which is a typical morphological feature of LPCs. When colonies became densely packed, rat and mouse CLiPs exhibited a compact polygonal cell shape delimited by sharply defined refractile borders with bright nuclei in phase contrast images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). However, unlike rat and mouse CLiPs, the morphology of human cells did not clearly change after colonies became densely packed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although we did not perform further characterization, these proliferating cells likely arose from non-hepatic cells, such as biliary epithelial cells (BECs) or so-called liver epithelial cells, the origins of which are not well-defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitaka et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, we speculated that human hepatocytes require additional proliferative stimuli. Therefore, we tested the ability of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to support the proliferation of these cells. One of three lots of APHHs formed proliferative and densely packed colonies, and exhibited a hepatocytic morphology upon culture in medium supplemented with YAC and 10% FBS (FYAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, all three lots of APHHs formed proliferative colonies with hepatic morphologies upon culture in medium supplemented with AC and 10% FBS (FAC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). However, the proliferative capacity of these hepatic colony-forming cells was limited, and the number of these cells markedly decreased after the first passage, while non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) with non-hepatic morphologies became the dominant population (data not shown).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Donor information of primary human hepatocytes

Consistent with the observations made in APHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), these cells proliferated most efficiently in FAC and thus we used this medium in all subsequent experiments. Robust proliferation of hepatocytes was not supported by culture in the presence of AC or FBS alone, but was synergistically supported by culture in the presence of both AC and FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although proliferating cells cultured in FAC did not morphologically resemble hepatocytes when the cell density was low, they spontaneously acquired a hepatocyte-like morphology as colonies became densely packed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This observation strongly suggests that human proliferative cells cultured in FAC more closely resembled rodent CLiPs than those cultured in the presence of YAC. Unlike APHHs, IPHHs proliferated efficiently and became the predominant population over 2 weeks of culture. Two other lots of IPHHs (lot DUX from an 8-month-old donor and lot JFC from a 1-year-old donor) (Table 1) also proliferated in this culture condition, although the proliferative capacity varied among the lots: FCL, DUX and JFC proliferated 49.2 ± 9.34 (at day 14), 46.2 ± 2.12 (at day 14) and 3.66 ± 0.321 (at day 12) folds, respectively (mean ± SEM, determined by two repeated experiments for each lot). We also confirmed by microscopy that FAC enabled two more donors (11 months and 2-year-old)-derived IPHHs and one juvenile donor (7-year-old)-derived hepatocytes to proliferate and spontaneously change their morphologies to hepatocyte-like ones in the densely packed region of the proliferating colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AC together with FBS support the expansion of IPHHs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) WST assay assessing the effects of various combinations of Y, A, and C together with 10% FBS on proliferation of 8-month-old IPHHs (lot FCL).

It should be noted that PHHs before plating minimally expressed these LPC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Although we used PHHs which underwent a freeze-thaw cycle, we confirmed that expression of DPP4/CD26, a general hepatocyte marker, was still preserved, supporting the validity of this flow cytometry analysis. We observed that PHHs were slightly positive for ITGA6, but this is likely to be a nature of primary hepatocytes, because lineage-traced mouse primary hepatocytes also exhibited a slight signal of Itga6, while none of the other analyzed LPC markers, Epcam, Prom1 and Cd24 were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed microarray-based transcriptome analysis of previously identified BEC/LPC marker genes to further characterize these cells. Expression of many of these genes was induced during the 2 weeks of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Some of these genes, such as <italic>PROM1</italic> and <italic>SPP1</italic>, were expressed at comparable levels regardless of whether cells were cultured in the presence of AC, suggesting that their expression was spontaneously induced by the basal culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, expression of multiple BEC/LPC marker genes, including <italic>EPCAM</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>KRT19</italic>, <italic>TACSTD2</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>PROX1</italic>, was increased in cells cultured in FAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Of these, expression of <italic>EPCAM</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, and <italic>KRT19</italic> was affected not only by the presence of AC but also by the culture duration, suggesting that AC-induced expression of these genes during in vitro culture. By contrast, expression of <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>PROX1</italic> was maintained, but not increased, upon culture in the presence of AC. Gene signature enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing cells cultured in the presence of FBS and those cultured in FAC demonstrated that the majority of gene sets enriched in the latter cells were related to hepatic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that AC also helped to maintain the hepatocytic characteristics of cultured hepatocytes. Although cell-cycle-related gene sets were also identified by GSEA, their enrichment scores were relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is likely because cell proliferation was also increased in part by culture in FBS alone. Indeed, proliferation-related gene sets were enriched both in cells cultured in FBS only and in FAC compared with D1 hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">3</xref>). In summary, two small molecules, AC, together with FBS, support the proliferation of hepatic epithelial cells with characteristics of both hepatocytes and LPCs/BECs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison of IPHHs and APHHs in terms of their responsiveness to FAC</title><p>To investigate the difference regarding the responsiveness to FAC of IPHHs and APHHs, we compared their transpcriptome by microarray analysis. Hierarchical clustering of the whole transcriptome demonstrated that IPHHs cultured in FAC for 7 or 14 days formed a cluster distinct from those cultured in FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, APHHs cultured in FAC for 7 or 14 days were not clearly separated from those cultured in FBS. These results suggest that APHHs are less sensitive to AC than IPHHs. GSEA indicated that many of the signaling pathways enriched for IPHHs cultured in FAC for 7 days compared with APHHs were cell-cycle-related pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>) (we avoided comparing cells at D14, because lot 187271 APHHs were severely contaminated with NPCs at D14, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, (iv)). In contrast, pathways enriched for APHHs included hepatic function-associated ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). These results suggest that APHHs were not susceptible to the pro-proliferative effect of AC. Intriguingly, we observed a relatively similar expression profile of LPC marker genes between IPHHs and APHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), except for <italic>EPCAM</italic> and <italic>ANPEP</italic>. We then asked whether APHHs indeed responded to A83-01 and CHIR99021. GSEA indicated enrichment of Wnt signaling in IPHHs compared with APHHs (nominal p-value=0.019), suggesting that APHHs less efficiently responded to CHIR99021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). In contrast, to our surprise, TGFβ signaling was enriched in IPHHs compared with APHHs (nominal p-value&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). We further investigated the expression of individual genes which are known to be in the downstream of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Russell and Monga, 2018</xref>) and TGFβ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cicchini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fabregat and Caballero-Díaz, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). Both IPHHs and APHHs upregulated typical Wnt target genes in hepatocytes, such as <italic>GLUL</italic> and <italic>CYP1A2</italic> in the presence of AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On the other hand, we found that LPC-related Wnt-target genes, <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LGR5</italic>, were expressed at higher levels in IPHHs than APHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also confirmed that TGFβ downstream genes were downregulated in both IPHHs and APHHs treated with FAC compared with their FBS counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that expression levels of some of these genes, for example <italic>VIM</italic>, <italic>SNAI1</italic> and <italic>ZEB1</italic>, were higher in IPHHs than APHH, which explains the reason for the enrichment of TGFβ signaling in IPHHs by GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). Another signaling pathway enriched in IPHHs was mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). mTORC1 is activated specifically in pericentral hepatocytes in a Wnt signaling-dependent manner, and suggested to regulate their growth in normal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adebayo Michael et al., 2019</xref>). mTORC1 is also reported to be essential for BEC expansion during ductular reaction in regenerating liver as well as BEC organoid formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Planas-Paz et al., 2019</xref>). In summary, although a more detailed analysis is needed, the low proliferative capacity of APHHs might be partly explained by their lower responsiveness to Wnt signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of responsiveness to FAC of IPHHs and APHHs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hierarchical clustering for whole transcriptome of IPHHs (red) and APHHs (blue).

As noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, the proliferative cells spontaneously acquired hepatic morphologies when they reached 100% confluency, even in the absence of hepatic maturation inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, middle panels for each lot). However, this morphological change was more evident in the presence of hepatic maturation inducers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panels for each lot). In particular, cells acquired a polygonal and cytoplasm-rich morphology, which is similar to that of PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Accordingly, microarray analysis confirmed that expression of representative hepatic marker genes, including <italic>ALB</italic>, <italic>TDO2</italic> and <italic>SERPINA1</italic> was increased after hepatic maturation induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, the expression levels of these genes were not markedly changed in cells from lot JFC. This is presumably because expression of hepatic maturation genes was already high in these cells even before hepatic induction. In contrast with the hepatic marker genes, expression of the BEC/LPC marker genes including <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>KRT19</italic>, and <italic>KRT7</italic> was decreased, suggesting that the proliferative cells lost their BEC/LPC phenotype and acquired a mature hepatic phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hierarchical cluster analysis of genes that were differentially expressed between cells cultured in the presence of hepatic maturation inducers (Hep-i(+)) and cells cultured for the same duration in the absence of hepatic maturation inducers (Hep-i(-)) indicated that the characteristics of Hep-i(+) cells were relatively similar to those of PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Overrepresented pathways in Hep-i(+) cells in comparison with Hep-i(-) cells were associated with the immune response and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), both of which are important functions of the liver. These findings were further validated by GSEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). By contrast, overrepresented pathways in Hep-i(-) cells in comparison with Hep-i(+) cells were associated with developmental processes and morphogenesis, implying that Hep-i(-) cells were functionally immature compared with Hep-i(+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Expression of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 is induced in hepatocytes via transcriptional activation in response to certain chemicals. Thus, we investigated whether the expression and activities of these CYPs were increased in hCLiP-derived hepatocytes treated with prototypical inducers of each CYP isoform, namely, omeprazole (aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligand) for CYP1A2, phenobarbital (indirect activator of constitutive active androstane receptor) for CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, and rifampicin (pregnane X receptor ligand) for CYP3A4.

Thus, we investigated the feasibility of long-term culture of hCLiPs. Cells derived from lots FCL and DUX could be serially passaged until at least passage 10 (P10) without growth arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or obvious morphological changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The population doubling times of FCL and DUX hCLiPs were 1.27 ± 0.0066 and 1.43 ± 0.0086 d, respectively (mean ± SEM, determined by three repeated experiments for each lot). However, non-hepatic cells with a fibroblast-like morphology were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, arrows), and the percentage of these cells varied among repeated experiments for each lot, as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of the epithelial-cell surface marker proteins EPCAM and CD24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Cultures of cells from lot JFC contained more fibroblast-like cells than cultures of cells from lots FCL and DUX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon culture of cells from lot JFC, the percentage of fibroblastic cells increased with the passage number and fibroblastic cells overwhelmed hCLiPs by P5, as assessed by microscopic observation (n = 3 repeated experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and flow cytometric analysis of LPC markers (n = 1 experiment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, when EPCAM<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted from primary hCLiPs at the first passage, proliferative epithelial cells were observed for at least the next three passages (total of four passages) with their population doubling time 1.24 d (n = 1 experiment) between P1 and P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), confirming the proliferative capacity of hCLiPs obtained from lot JFC. Although expression of surface markers varied among experimental batches at later passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it was relatively stable up to P5 in cells derived from lots FCL and DUX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also investigated the karyotype of cells derived from lots FCL and DUX at P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). hCLiPs derived from lot JFC were contaminated by an increased percentage of fibroblast-like cells; therefore, we karyotyped FACS-sorted EPCAM<sup>+</sup> cells (at the first passage) which were then passaged four times after sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). None of the analyzed cells exhibited any chromosomal abnormality (20 cells analyzed per lot) and all the analyzed cells were diploid (50 cells analyzed per lot) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This implies that hCLiPs were derived from diploid hepatocytes, which is consistent with our previous observations in rat CLiPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuda et al., 2017</xref>). We further investigated transcriptomic changes in hCLiPs derived from lots FCL and DUX between P0 and P10 using cells from the experimental batches that maintained higher levels of EPCAM and CD24 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (experimental batch #3 and #2 for lots DUX and FCL, respectively). A heatmap of genes that were differentially expressed between P0 and P10 showed that the phenotype of hCLiPs gradually changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As indicated on the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, genes whose expression decreased included those related to hepatic functions, indicating that hCLiPs lost their hepatic phenotypes during repeated passage. Nonetheless, the heatmap suggested that hCLiPs retained at least some of their original characteristics until approximately P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, we investigated the hepatic phenotype of hCLiPs at P3 and P5. qRT-PCR analysis of hCLiPs derived from each lot indicated that absolute expression levels of hepatic genes consistently decreased as the passage number increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Nevertheless, hCLiPs derived from each lot, particularly lots FCL and DUX, could undergo hepatic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Immunocytochemistry revealed that Hep-i(+) cells derived from lot FCL expressed hepatic marker proteins at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also investigated CYP enzymatic activities in these cells. Although the CYP enzymatic activities clearly decreased upon repeated passage, the basal activities of these enzymes, with the exception of CYP2C19, were maintained at P3 and P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Induction of CYP3A enzymatic activity in response to rifampicin and phenobarbital was relatively stable even at P3 and P5, especially in Hep-i(+) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In summary, functional decline of hCLiP-derived hepatocytes during continuous culture is unavoidable; however, CYP3A, the most important CYP in human drug metabolism, is still induced in these cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>hCLiPs stably expand in vitro and retain their hepatic differentiation ability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth curves of hCLiPs from P0–10 (lots FCL and DUX) or P0–four or P0–5 (lot JFC).

Laboratory-generated hepatocytes typically have RIs of less than 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rezvani et al., 2016</xref>), but a few studies reported maximum RIs of 20% or 30% in individual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carpentier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, in a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref> achieved much higher RI (&gt;60%) by transplanting expandable hepatic cells named ProliHH, which were generated from PHHs as with hCLiPs. Thus, it is important to evaluate the repopulative capacity of hCLiPs from a comparative point of view.</p><p>We assessed the repopulative capacity of hCLiPs in immunodeficient mice with chronically injured livers. Our previous study revealed that rat CLiPs repopulate the liver of cDNA-uPA/SCID mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuda et al., 2017</xref>); therefore, we first transplanted hCLiPs derived from lots FCL, DUX and JFC at P0–P2 into this model. After intrasplenic transplantation of primary hCLiPs that had been expanded in vitro for approximately 2 weeks (11–13 days) (hereafter designated P0-hCLiPs), the human ALB (hALB) level was exponentially increased in the blood of some, but not all, mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, red lines). The maximum hALB level in blood was &gt;10 mg/ml, which is comparable with that observed following transplantation of PHHs in this animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tateno et al., 2015</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of human-specific CYP2Cs (including CYP2C9 and other CYP2Cs according to the manufacturer’s datasheet) demonstrated extensive repopulation in mouse livers extracted at 10–11 weeks after transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Although the RI varied among mice (32.2 ± 13.5% for lot FCL, n = 11; 39.3 ± 13.5% for lot JFC, n = 11; 17.8 ± 16.4% for lot DUX, n = 4, mean ± SEM), it reached &gt;90% in some animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This maximum RI is comparable with that achieved after transplantation of PHHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rezvani et al., 2016</xref>). The repopulative capacity declined as the culture period increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>). Nonetheless, one mouse transplanted with FCL-P1-hCLiPs (hCLiPs derived from lot FCL that were passaged once before transplantation) (67.4%) and two mice transplanted with JFC-P2-hCLiPs (hCLiPs derived from lot JFC that were passaged twice before transplantation) (83.1% and 91.1%) exhibited high RIs. It should be noted that FCL-P1-hCLiPs and JFC-P2-hCLiPs underwent approximately 1000- and 400-fold expansion from the initial PHHs, respectively. These fold expansion is comparable to that achieved by ProliHH developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref>. They reported high repopulative capacity of ProliHH at P4-P6. The fold expansion based on the initial number of PHHs, ProliHH at P4-P6 in their culture system underwent approximately 400–1000-fold expansion. Thus, hCLiPs have repopulative capacity at the comparable levels with ProliHH. We further confirmed the repopulative capacity of FCL-P0-hCLiPs using another model, namely, TK-NOG mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hasegawa et al., 2011</xref>). In this model, the serum hALB level was dramatically elevated to at most 8.1 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The maximum RI was lower in TK-NOG mice (57.5%) than in cDNA-uPA/SCID mice (96.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). However, engraftment was more efficient in TK-NOG mice than in cDNA-uPA/SCID mice; significant repopulation (&gt;15% RI) with FCL-P0-hCLiPs was observed in 83% (5/6 mice) of TK-NOG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), but only in 50% (3/6 mice) of cDNA-uPA/SCID mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Examination of the area repopulated by hCLiPs by staining with an antibody against human mitochondria showed that repopulating human cells expressed MDR1 and TTR, which are associated with hepatic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>). MDR1 was detected on the apical side of adjacent mouse and human hepatocytes, suggesting that hCLiP-derived cells successfully reconstructed the normal liver architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, arrows). Accordingly, hepatic zonation was correctly established in the repopulated regions, as assessed by expression of glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL, also known as glutathione synthetase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>), CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>hCLiPs repopulate chronically injured mouse livers and contribute to reconstruction of the normal liver architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) hALB levels in blood of cDNA-uPA/SCID mice.

Based on the growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we estimated that these cells underwent 2.2 ± 0.94×10<sup>6</sup> fold (n = 3, mean ± SEM) expansion from the initial PHHs. We observed increase of blood hALB levels in these mice, but the hALB increasing rates were much slower than in the animals transplanted with FCL-P0-hCLiP or FCL-P1-hCLiPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The hALB levels 8 weeks after transplantation was 10 μg/ml at most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which was approximately 1/1000 of the mice with high RI (&gt;60% RI). As expected, hCYP2C staining indicated that all the mice transplanted with FCL-P4-hCLiPs exhibited very low RI (&lt;1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also transplanted FCL-P3-hCLiPs to TK-NOG mice. In this experiment, we prepared EPCAM-expressing cells at the first passage by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS), and cultured them for another two passages (three passages in total). During the culture at P3, we separated these cells to two groups, one with hepatic induction (P3 Hep-i(+)) and the other without hepatic induction (P3 Hep-i(-)). After transplantation to TK-NOG mice, we observed serum hALB increase in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, we confirmed that Hep-i(+) cell-transplanted group showed consistently higher hALB levels than the Hep-i(-) cell-transplanted group. However, the serum hALB levels of FCL-P3-hCLiP-Hep-i(+)-transplanted mice at 8 weeks were still only 9.1 ± 1.8 μg/ml (n = 4, mean ± SEM), which were again much lower than the mice transplanted with FCL-P0-hCLiPs. These results collectively show that hCLiPs unavoidably decrease their repopulative capacity following extended in vitro culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Functional characterization of hCLiP-derived hepatocytes in chimeric livers</title><p>Finally, we isolated human cells from chimeric mouse livers and investigated their functionality because it has been argued that some types of laboratory-generated hepatocytes are not fully functional after repopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rezvani et al., 2016</xref>). We first performed microarray-based transcriptomic analysis. After isolating hepatocytes from chimeric livers of cDNA-uPA/SCID mice by a two-step collagenase perfusion method, we eliminated mouse cells using a magnetic bead separation system. Microscopic observation revealed that 32.7%, 16.8% and 33.1% of hepatocytes isolated from chimeric livers of mice transplanted with hCLiPs derived from lots FCL, JFC and DUX bound to magnetic beads conjugated with a specific anti-mouse antibody prior to magnetic separation, respectively, while these percentages were reduced to 2.9%, 0.0%, and 1.6% after magnetic separation, respectively. Thus, we assumed that the results of experiments performed with these cells should be mostly ascribed to human cells. Magnetically separated human cells exhibited typical morphologies of mature hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). However, unexpectedly, hierarchical clustering and principle component analysis (PCA) of the entire transcriptome showed that chimeric liver-derived human cells were distinct from PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>). A control sample of human hepatocytes isolated from chimeric livers following transplantation of IPHHs (lot JFC) yielded similar results as human hepatocytes isolated from chimeric livers following transplantation of hCLiPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>), indicating that the transcriptomic difference between human hepatocytes in chimeric livers and PHHs is due to environmental differences between human and mouse livers. Surprisingly, GSEA demonstrated that multiple hepatic function-related gene sets were overrepresented in human hepatocytes isolated from chimeric livers in comparison with PHHs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). The majority of these gene sets were associated with metabolic pathways.

An efficient repopulative capacity is one of the most important requirements of a candidate cell source for transplantation therapy; however, it is very challenging to develop such a cultured cell source. Laboratory-generated hepatic cells, such as pluripotent cell-derived hepatic cells and those transdifferentiated from cells of different lineage origins, have a poor repopulative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rezvani et al., 2016</xref>). The RI of laboratory-generated hepatocytes is typically less than 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rezvani et al., 2016</xref>). After our report of rodent CLiPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuda et al., 2017</xref>), four groups recently reported methods for in vitro generation of proliferative liver (progenitor) cells from human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In three of these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), the generated cells exhibited relatively low repopulative efficiency with approximately 13% of RI at maximum. In contrast, Zhang el al. reported strikingly high repopulation efficiency with as high as 64% of RI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, although the proliferative efficiency is limited compared with IPHHs, they succeeded in induction of proliferative hepatic cells even from APHHs. Moreover, contrary to the dichotomous repopulation of hCLiPs in our study (RI &gt;80% or nearly 0%), Zhang et al demonstrated highly stable repopulation among transplanted animals. Our study is, thus, not the first one to report substantial repopulation using an in vitro-generated human hepatic cell source. Nonetheless, to solidify a novel concept, more evidence must be provided independently from multiple laboratories. As such, we still believe that our work also plays an important role in pioneering this new field.</p><p>Another important finding in this study is that hCLiPs may be a novel cell source for drug discovery studies. The major criterion for the application of cultured hepatic cells in drug discovery studies, particularly to evaluate the functions of drug-metabolizing enzymes, is the inducibility of CYP enzymatic activities. CYP enzymes play central roles in the metabolism of clinically used drugs and xenobiotics. In general, CYP induction accelerates the clearance of xenobiotics, leading to beneficial or harmful outcomes depending on the context. Thus, recapitulation of CYP induction in cultured hepatocytes or their equivalents is important to precisely predict the effects of a tested drug on hepatocytes. However, PHHs lose their hepatic functions, including CYP inducibility, upon in vitro culture. Laboratory-generated hepatocytes reportedly exhibit basal CYP activities after maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanninen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takayama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takayama et al., 2014</xref>). Although a few groups described CYP inducibility in terms of enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettinato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Takayama et al., 2012</xref>), such reports are very limited, to the best of our knowledge. We propose that hCLiPs are a novel platform for drug discovery studies.</p><p>An issue yet to be addressed is clarification of the mechanism underlying the small molecule-mediated conversion of PHHs to hCLiPs. Mini-screen of three small molecules Y, A and C demonstrated that A and C individually accelerated proliferation of PHHs, while Y alone exhibited no beneficial effect on proliferation, and even negatively affected proliferation when combined with AC (in comparison of YAC with AC). This is in line with our previous observation in rodent hepatocyte culture, in which Y minimally affected the proliferation of these three small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuda et al., 2017</xref>). AC substantially induced the proliferation of rodent hepatocytes at the comparable, if not at the same, level with YAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katsuda et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the synergistic effect of A83-01 and CHIR99021 is the key to hepatocyte proliferation in rodent and human hepatocytes. Importantly, comparative analysis of APHHs and IPHHs suggested that activity of Wnt signaling in response to CHIR99021 may partly explain the proliferative ability of IPHHs. On the other hand, APHHs responded to A83-01 equally or even more efficiently than IPHHs, leaving a question how A83-01 affected the proliferation of IPHHs, but not APHHs. Since A83-01 is essential to IPHH proliferation as assessed in the mini-screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), this small molecule might affect IPHHs in a TGFβ-independent manner. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the difference between the proliferative ability endowed by FAC between IPHHs and APHHs. Another important issue to be considered is the requirement for FBS in hCLiP induction, which is not the case for rodent CLiP induction. FBS-derived factor(s) essential for hCLiP induction should be identified in a future study.</p><p>Comparison of our study with the recently reported four studies provides hints to mechanistic understanding of in vitro PHH expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is not included in our culture condition, is used in all these four studies, suggesting its critical role. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al. (2019)</xref> particularly emphasizes its essential role in the presence of AC. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al. (2018)</xref> ascribe the proliferative capacity of PHHs particularly to Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, these authors reported that Wnt3a plays an essential role, while neither CHIR99021 nor Wnt signaling amplifier Rspo1 substituted for the pro-proliferative effect of Wnt3a. Moreover, these authors proposed a unique idea that hypoxic culture condition supports the stable proliferation of PHHs by suppressing PHH senescence. In line with this observation, Fu et al. also demonstrated that a sirtuin suppressor nicotinamide decreases proliferation of PHH. This finding highlights the difference between human and rodent PHHs: nicotinamide is known to induce proliferation of rat hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitaka et al., 1991</xref>) and thus is frequently added to hepatocyte culture medium (including ours), but this may not be the case for induction of PHH proliferation. Collectively, these findings, including ours, provide important insight to optimization of the methodology of PHH expansion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary human hepatocytes</title><p>Infant primary human hepatocytes (IPHHs) (lots FCL, DUX, JFC and MRW) were purchased from Veritas Corporation (Tokyo, Japan).

For lots FCL and JFC, primary cultured cells at D11–14 (P0-hCLiPs), cells passaged once (P1-hCLiPs), and cells passaged twice (P2-hCLiPs) were used. For lot FCL, P4-hCLiP transplantation was also performed. For lot DUX, P0-hCLiPs were used. After harvesting cells using TrypLE Express, 0.2–1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mouse were intrasplenically transplanted into 2–4 week-old cDNA-uPA/SCID mice (PhoenixBio Co., Ltd, Higashihiroshima, Japan) under isoflurane anesthesia. From 2 weeks after transplantation, 10 μl blood was retro-orbitally collected each week and the hALB concentration was measured using a Human Albumin ELISA Quantitation Kit (Bethyl, TX) or a Latex agglutination turbidimetric immunoassay with a BioMajesty analyzer (JCA-BM6050; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Livers were extracted at 8–11 weeks after transplantation and histologically analyzed. The transplantation experiments were approved by animal care committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Liver repopulation assay using TK-NOG mice with P0-hCLiPs</title><p>FCL-P0-hCLiPs were used. Seven-week-old TK-NOG mice were obtained from the Central Institute of Experimental Animals (Kawasaki, Japan). One day after arrival at the National Cancer Center, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/ml ganciclovir (Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Osaka, Japan) at a dose of 10 μl/g body weight to induce thymidine kinase-mediated injury in host mouse hepatocytes. One week after injection, approximately 30 μl blood was obtained from the tail. Serum was separated and diluted 1/5 with PBS, and the serum ALT level was measured using a DRI-CHEM 3500 analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Mice with serum ALT levels of 500–1600 U/l were chosen as host animals for transplantation. At 1–3 days after ALT measurement, 0.4–1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were intrasplenically transplanted into these mice under isoflurane anesthesia. From 2 weeks after transplantation, approximately 20 μl blood was collected each week from the tail and the hALB concentration was measured using a Human Albumin ELISA Quantitation Kit (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX). Livers were extracted at 8–10 weeks after transplantation and histologically analyzed. The transplantation experiments were approved by animal care committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Liver repopulation assay using TK-NOG mice with P3-hCLiPs</title><p>For transplantation of FCL-P3-hCLiPs, EPCAM<sup>+</sup> FCL-hCLiPs were magnetically sorted at the first passage (using P0 hCLiPs) by MACS cell sorting system using MidiMACS Separator (Miltenyi) using CD326 (EpCAM) MicroBeads (Miltenyi). These EPCAM+ cells were subjected to another two passages (P3 in total). During the culture at P3, we separated these cells to two groups, one with hepatic induction (P3 Hep-i(+)) and the other without hepatic induction (P3 Hep-i(-)). 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mouse were transplanted into GCV-treated TK-NOG mice as described before. Throughout this experiment, hCLiPs were cultured in a slightly different condition from other experiments (FBS concentration was 5% instead of 10%), but we do not think the obtained results were severely changed by this minor modification. Hepatic induction was conducted in SHM supplemented with 5%FBS and AC with 10 ng/ml hOSM (matrigel was not used). The transplantation experiments were approved by animal care committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Estimation of RIs</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, RIs were estimated based on CYP2C positivity using image analysis software and a Keyence BZX-710 microscope.

To remove contaminating mouse hepatocytes, isolated cells were incubated with the 66Z antibody, which recognizes the surface of mouse hepatocytes, but not of human hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamasaki et al., 2010</xref>). Cells were washed with DMEM containing 10% FBS and then incubated with Dynabeads M450-conjugated sheep anti-rat IgG (Dynal Biotech, Milwaukee, WI) for 30 min on ice. The tube was placed in a Dynal MPC-1 holder (Dynal Biotech) for 1–2 min to remove 66Z<sup>+</sup> mouse hepatocytes. Human hepatocytes were collected as 66Z<sup>-</sup> cells. 66Z<sup>+</sup> and 66Z<sup>-</sup> hepatocytes were counted using a hemocytometer before and after magnetic separation to estimate the repopulation efficiency and purity of human hepatocytes after separation, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Culture of chimeric liver-derived human hepatocytes</title><p>Magnetically purified human hepatocytes were resuspended in SHM containing 2% FBS and seeded into a 24-well collagen I-coated plate. One day later, RNA was prepared from cells in some wells for microarray-based transcriptomic analysis. As a control, RNA was also prepared from hepatocytes isolated from the chimeric liver of a mouse transplanted with IPHHs (lot JFC) immediately after thawing the original cell suspension (kindly prepared by PhoenixBio Co., Ltd). Other hCLiP-derived hepatocytes were used for the CYP activity assay, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data represent the mean ± SEM of independently repeated experiments or the mean ± SD of technical replicates in separate culture wells. Two groups were statistically compared using the Student’s t-test, unless otherwise stated. Time-dependent alteration of gene expression was analyzed by the linear mixed models using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Group allocation (FBS or FAC), time (culture period [day]), and the interaction of group and time were included in the model as fixed effects.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bruce Wang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is great interest in ex vivo sources of hepatocytes for transplantation or experimental studies. Derivation or expansion of these cells from ESCs or IPSCs or hepatocytes have not been satisfactory in terms of their ability to repopulate mice. Here, the authors explore a combination of factors plus FBS that causes the proliferation of infant but not adult hepatocytes and thus allows for the expansion of this population in vitro and in vivo. Upon addition of maturation media, there is also an increase in differentiation gene expression and a decrease of proliferation genes. This is important because it shows that the proliferating hepatocytes are indeed capable of returning to the well differentiated state. Moreover, there is good CYP expression, which allows for drug studies. Transplantation into a liver damage model shows that these cells can recover up to 90% of the recipient livers, although the effects are highly variable between animals. Overall, this is a compelling and balanced presentation of a new protocol for expansion and differentiation of hepatocytes from an infant hepatic source. This adds to the discussion about best ways to promote hepatocyte expansion.</p><p>The results are significant, and the work is done well, but there were concerns about cell purity, limits to passaging ability, and there needs to be more discussion about how the paper compares to other methods of expanding hepatocytes. Since their main reason to moving to young human cells is that they can be expanded more, we think it's crucial that they transplant the later passage cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The key requests that need to be addressed by experimental work are to transplant later passage cells and to do some purifications or elucidation of heterogeneity of cells in the culture.</p><p>1) There is no comment about the mechanisms or targets of the small molecules used and how this allows for proliferation ex vivo. At least a discussion about all of the relevant molecules is needed, as well as a comparison with other approaches, ie Hui et al.</p><p>2) One issue that consistently comes up in this paper is the heterogeneity in the cell culture samples. The authors should clarify whether this is due to contamination in their source hepatocytes with non-hepatocytes, or if the culture conditions generate heterogeneous cell fates. If due to contamination with non-hepatocytes, can the authors purify the cells before culturing? If they continue to find heterogeneity in their culture conditions despite starting with a pure hepatocyte population, it would be important to discuss why this might be occurring.</p><p>3) Related to the above point, the use of bulk gene expression profiling to make inferences about the cell types involved is not that definitive, and thus it would be better to minimize these inferences. For example, in subsection “Characterization of proliferating cells cultured in FAC” there is a lot of discussion about potential gene expression correlates of possible cell types, and it is not clear if this is true. It is not certain that TGFB signaling really says that there is a presence of fibroblastic LPCs in the culture. Single cell sequencing would be better for this. If single cell sequencing will not be done, then the discussion about how bulk sequencing can infer cell populations should be limited.</p><p>4) We believe that more transplantation experiments need to be performed in order to (A) understand why the RI is either very high or almost zero, and (B) understand if later passage cells will repopulate. This is the central issue with the first submission of the paper. For A), there needs to be an explanation for why there is a dichotomous result here. Otherwise it is hard to know what the actual RI is for these cells. Related to this, it is unclear how many passages can be performed while retaining hepatic differentiation potential. If the cells cannot be passaged many times, then it will be extremely difficult to generate enough cells for transplantation. Given that the in vitro expansion by passage 2 is limited, can the authors transplant cells after passage 4, when the cells are still relatively pure in vitro and have expanded more extensively. This is a significant issue with the paper, especially if there is going to be no mechanistic exploration of FAC.</p><p>5) The data are consistent with two recent publications showing that primary human hepatocytes can be maintained and expanded in vitro (Hu et al., 2018, and Zhang et al., 2018). In particular the paper from Zhang et al., is very comparable to the findings in this paper. Both papers use primary human hepatocytes cultured in 2D culture. The authors need to discuss their findings in the context of these recent publications. In particular, it would be very interesting to compare their culture conditions and results with that of Zhang et al., including the gene expression profiles and proliferative capacity.</p><p>We have also included the separate reviews for your consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>There is great interest in ex vivo sources of hepatocytes for transplantation or experimental studies.

They showed that while adult primary human hepatocytes have limited proliferative capacity in their culture conditions, hepatocytes from young human livers can expand efficiently, and over multiple passages. They show extensive characterization of these in vitro expanded cells, including transplantation into mouse models of liver failure to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to function as hepatocytes in vivo.</p><p>Overall, this is a well written manuscript, with carefully conducted studies and detailed characterization. It addresses an important bottleneck in the field of liver regenerative medicine, the ability to maintain and expand hepatocytes in vitro for either in vitro drug testing or in vivo transplantation. However, I have a few concerns about the manuscript that need to be addressed prior to publication. My specific comments are below.</p><p>1) Their data is consistent with two recent publications showing that primary human hepatocytes can be maintained and expanded in vitro (Hu et al., 2018, and Zhang et al., 2018).

If due to contamination with non-hepatocytes, can they purify the cells before culturing? If they continue to find heterogeneity in their culture conditions despite starting with a pure hepatocyte population, it would be interesting to separate the different resulting cell populations in vitro and analyze them separately.</p><p>3) In transplantation studies, the authors state in the text that repopulation capacity declines as culture period increased, but this is not clearly seen in figure 5C. Since the authors think the uPA/SCID mice have lower engraftment efficiency, it would be nice to see transplantation of P1 and P2 cells in the TK-NOG mice.</p><p>4) The in vitro expansion by passage 2 is limited. Can they transplant cells after passage 4, when the cells are still relatively pure in vitro and have expanded more extensively?</p><p>5) Characterization of the gene expression and enzymatic function in vitro is well done.

This progress shown in this paper is important. I have a few concerns and requests about this paper.</p><p>1) The authors also expected that hCLiPs would be used in the liver cell transplantation.

In addition to these discussions, we also performed microarray analysis to compare the responsiveness to FAC of IPHHs (infant PHHs) and APHHs (adult PHHs) (Figure 3, and its supplementary figures). The results suggested that IPHHs are more sensitive to CHIR99021 than adult PHHs, since Wnt signaling was more efficiently upregulated in IPHHs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of bulk gene expression profiling to make inferences about the cell types involved is not that definitive, and thus i would minimize this.

Please comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 6, we described that hCLiPs can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes until passage 5. At the end of the 5th passage, we can obtain 1.2 ± 0.35 x 10<sup>8</sup>, 3.3 ± 0.44 x 10<sup>7</sup> and 2.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> hCLiPs from one starting PHH for lots FCL, DUX and JFC, respectively. We believe these data suggest substantial benefit of using hCLiPs, given the limited availability of PHHs.</p><p>Also please note that the in vitro proliferative capacity of hCLiPs is much higher than that reported in the recently reported similar papers: FCL and DUX hCLIPs underwent 2.9 x 10<sup>13</sup>- and 2.2 x 10<sup>12</sup>-fold expansion at the end of P10 culture, and JFC hCLiPs underwent 2.0 x 10<sup>6</sup>-fold expansion at the end of P5. In contrast, Zhang et al. reported that ProliHH achieved 1,000- to 10,000-fold expansion at P8; this fold-expansion is nearly equivalent to that of hCLiPs at P3 (Zhang et al., 2018). Kim et al. reported that hCdHs were passaged at 1:3-1:5 in each passage, which corresponds to 5.9 x 10<sup>4</sup> – 9.7 x 10<sup>6</sup>-fold expansion at P10; this fold-expansion is nearly equivalent to that of hCLiPs at P4-5 (Kim et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe more transplantation experiments need to be performed in order to understand why the RI is either very high or almost zero.

Although we do not have any evidence, it seems to us that the high/low RI is determined by the initial engraftment efficiency. Whether this idea is correct or not, and if it is correct, what molecular mechanism specifically determines the successful engraftment must be addressed in future studies.</p><p>This reviewer requested to increase the “n” by repeating the same transplantation experiment. We acknowledge that this is an important comment. However, the editor suggested us to rather perform repopulation experiments using hCLiPs at later passages. Following the editor’s suggestion, we performed repopulation study using FCL<sup>-</sup>P3-hCLiPs and FCL<sup>-</sup>P4-hCLiPs, which were transplanted to TK-NOG and cDNA-uPA/SCID mice, respectively. As you can see in Figure 8—figure supplement 1, repopulation efficiency of hCLiPs at late passages is overall much lower than that at early passage (P0-P1). We sincerely accept that the low repopulation efficiency of late passaged hCLiPs is one of the critical limitations in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>[…] Overall, this is a well written manuscript, with carefully conducted studies and detailed characterization.

If they continue to find heterogeneity in their culture conditions despite starting with a pure hepatocyte population, it would be interesting to separate the different resulting cell populations in vitro and analyze them separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think it is feasible to purify cells before culturing, because almost none of LPC markers or an NPC marker are expressed in the initial PHH source (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). To investigate the population heterogeneity of the starting PHHs, we performed flow cytometry using PHHs immediately after thawing the cryopreserved cell stocks. A hepatic surface marker DPP4/CD26 expression was detected in each of the tested cells (except JFC PHHs, in which this antigen was accidentally not tested), thereby confirming that surface antigens of these cells were at least partly preserved even after a freeze/thaw cycle. We tested the surface expression of LPC markers EPCAM, PROM1, CD24, CD44 and ITGA6. Except for ITGA6, none of these surface proteins were detected in these cells. ITGA6 expression in PHHs, including APHHs (HC5-25, derived from a 56 year-old donor), was surprising to us. Thus, we interrogated whether this slight ITGA6 expression in PHHs would be caused by LPC contamination or a nature of primary hepatocytes, using a mouse lineage tracing model. We genetically labeled hepatocytes with YFP by injecting AAV-TBG-Cre to a Rosa<sup>YFP</sup> adult mouse, harvested its hepatocytes, and performed flow cytometry. While YFP<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes were negative for any of Epcam, Prom1 and Cd24, we observed a slight signal of Itga6 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C), just like in the case of human hepatocytes. Thus, we conclude that the slight expression of ITGA6 in PHHs does not reflect LPC contamination. As pointed out by the reviewer, we also investigated the contamination of fibroblastic cells with the use of general fibroblastic marker, THY1/CD90. THY1 expression in FCL hCLiPs was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image1</xref>), indicating that our starting cells are mostly composed of PHHs.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-47313-resp-fig1-v3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></fig><p>Nonetheless, we know that morphologically fibroblastic cells emerge during culture, and thus we carefully followed up the cultured cells using THY1 antibody in combination with LPC markers. After primary expansion of hCLiPs (P0), we confirmed that a certain population of cells were THY1<sup>+</sup>. Without genetic lineage tracing, which is practically unfeasible with PHHs, we cannot determine whether these cells were derived from minimally-contaminated fibroblasts or cells de-differentiated from PHHs per se. Thus, we refrained from discussing much about the cellular origin of these cells in the manuscript.</p><p>Then, we sorted LPC marker<sup>+</sup>THY1<sup>-</sup> putative LPC fractions and LPC marker<sup>-</sup>THY<sup>+</sup> fractions, and compared their gene expression profiles using a panel of genes (LPC markers, hepatic markers and fibroblastic markers). As expected, LPC marker<sup>+</sup>THY1<sup>-</sup> populations were rich in LPC/hepatic cells, while LPC marker<sup>-</sup>THY1<sup>+</sup> populations were rich in fibroblastic cells (Figure 7B). We then continued culture of these cells for another two weeks and followed up their gene expression profiles. The sorted populations still maintained their characteristics partly, but LPC marker<sup>-</sup>THY1<sup>+</sup> cells again emerged in LPC marker<sup>+</sup>THY1<sup>-</sup> fractions, suggesting that LPC marker<sup>-</sup>THY1<sup>+</sup> cells which were not fully excluded by sorting grew in these fractions in the following culture. Moreover, we noted the substantial reduction in the expression of hepatic genes in LPC marker<sup>+</sup>THY1<sup>-</sup> fractions when compared with P0 cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Thus, we conclude that surface marker-based selection can temporarily enrich LPC/hepatic cells, but the decline of hepatic/LPC phenotype in hCLiPs is unavoidable at least in the present sorting strategy and culture condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In transplantation studies, the authors state in the text that repopulation capacity declines as culture period increased, but this is not clearly seen in figure 5C. Since the authors think the uPA/SCID mice have lower engraftment efficiency, it would be nice to see transplantation of P1 and P2 cells in the TK-NOG mice.</p></disp-quote><p>In our pilot study, we transplanted FCL<sup>-</sup>hCLiPs which were enriched for EPCAM expression by MACS at the first passage (namely, using P0 cells) and subsequently passaged twice (thus, P3 in total). Since we supposed that the reduction of repopulative capacity of hCLiPs in the later passages was largely due to the loss of hepatic phenotype, we also prepared hCLiPs with hepatic induction (<italic>Hep</italic>-i(+) cells). The data indicated that <italic>Hep</italic>-i(+) hCLiPs had higher repopulative capacity than <italic>Hep</italic>-i(-) cells. However, the repopulative capacity of <italic>Hep</italic>-i(+)-P3-hCLiPs was still much lower than P0-hCLiPs, highlighting the difficulty for hCLiPs to retain their repopulative capacity after extended culture periods.</p><p>By the way, in this experiment (which was a part of our pilot study), hCLiPs were cultured in a slightly different condition (FBS concentration was 5% instead of 10%.

Although each mouse exhibited increase in blood hALB levels, its increasing rate was much slower than that of highly repopulated mice which were transplanted with P0- or P1-FCL<sup>-</sup>hCLiPs (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A). CYP2C IHC indicated that RIs were &lt; 1% for each of the P4-hCLiP-transplanted animals 8 weeks after transplantation (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B). Because we observed very few foci formed in these mice, it seems that engraftment of hCLiPs at later passages were much less efficient than that at earlier passages.</p><p>On the other hand, we caution reviewers about the interpretation of the results regarding in vitro cellular expansion and repopulation. First, we noted that fold expansion of hCLiPs at P0-P2 are comparable to that of ProliHH at P4-P6 (Zhang et al., 2018). When comparing our study with Zhang et al’s one, it seems more appropriate to use the term “fold expansion” (from the initial cell number) rather than “passage number” to indicate the age of cultured cells. According to Figure S5A in Zhang et al.’s study, “Early ProliHH (P4)” and “Late ProliHH (P6)” underwent approximately 400- and 1000- fold expansion from the initial cell number (also note that their passage counting is different from ours: P4 and P6 in their counting system correspond to P3 and P5 based on our passage counting) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). FCL hCLiPs underwent &gt; 40- fold expansion during primary culture (P0), approximately 1000-fold expansion at the endpoint of P1 (FCL<sup>-</sup>hCLiPs expand approximately 25-fold during P1 culture), and 6.4 x 10<sup>6</sup>-fold expansion at the end of P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Thus, to our surprise, the fold expansion of our FCL P1 hCLiPs is comparable to that of Zhang et al.’s “Late ProliHH”. In our study, JFC-hCLiPs exhibited obviously slower growth rate compared to FCL<sup>-</sup> and DUX-hCLiPs (Figure 6A). Nonetheless, we confirmed that JFC-hCLiPs at P2, which exhibited high RIs in 2 of 3 transplanted mice, underwent 456 ± 156-fold expansion (n = 2) at the end of P2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>), which is comparable to that achieved by ProliHH at P3-P5. We mentioned this issue concisely in the Results section.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison between ProliHHs and hCLiPs in terms of in vitro growth rates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) According to Figure S5A in Zhang et al., 2018, Early ProliHH and Late ProliHH underwent approximately 200 and 1000 fold expansion from the starting cell number. Note that our passage counting manner is different from theirs. (<bold>B</bold>) FCL hCLiPs underwent &gt; 40-fold expansion during primary culture (P0), approximately 1000-fold expansion at P1, and 6.4 x 106-fold expansion at P4. It should be noted that our P1 cells correspond to Zhang et al.’s P6 cells in terms of fold expansion form the initial cell number.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-47313-resp-fig2-v3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></fig><p>Second, we noted that the repopulation rate (speed) is very different between hCLiPs and ProliHH. When hCLiPs achieved high RI, blood hALB levels reached 1 mg/ml as early as at 30 days post transplantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2B</xref>), whereas ProliHH even at early passage (P4) reached this level approximately at 120 days post transplantation; they reached approximately 30-40 μg/ml (estimation from the graph) at 30 days post transplantation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). This finding implies differences in repopulation modes between hCLiPs at early passage and ProliHH at both early and late passages. Another finding was that when we adjusted the range of x-axis to the 0-180 days post transplantation (same as ProliHH data), repopulation rate of FCL<sup>-</sup>P4-hCLiPs was comparable with that of Late ProliHH. Since FCL<sup>-</sup>P4-hCLiP’s hALB increasing rate was much slower than we expected based on our previous observation with P0- or P1-hCLiPs, we quitted this experiment at the standard endpoint of our experiment (8 weeks post transplantation). But, if we had extended this transplantation study until 150 days, it could be possible for P4 hCLiPs to achieve similar RI levels as ProliHH. However, this comparative investigation includes uncertain assumption/imagination which we are afraid to be “over-speculation”, and thus we did not include this discussion in our manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison between ProliHHs and hCLiPs in terms of their repopulation efficiency.</title><p>(A)Repopulation experiments in FRG mice using ProliHHs at early (P4) and late (P6) passages.
