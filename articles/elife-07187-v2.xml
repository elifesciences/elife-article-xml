Little is known about the factors that determine preferential onset of fibrosis in particular tissues. Here we show that plasma membrane (PM) overgrowth causes pericellular Collagen accumulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipocytes. We found that loss of Dynamin and other endocytic components causes pericellular trapping of outgoing Collagen IV due to dramatic cortex expansion when endocytic removal of PM is prevented. Deposits also form in the absence of negative Toll immune regulator Cactus, excess PM being caused in this case by increased secretion. Finally, we show that trimeric Collagen accumulation, downstream of Toll or endocytic defects, activates a tissue damage response. Our work indicates that traffic imbalances and PM topology may contribute to fibrosis. It also places fibrotic deposits both downstream and upstream of immune signaling, consistent with the chronic character of fibrotic diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07187.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07187.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07187.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, so-called ‘basement membranes’ surround organs and help to both anchor certain tissue types together and control which molecules move between them. The basement membrane is made up of various proteins, and a large protein called Collagen IV is the most abundant component.</p><p>Collagen IV is made inside cells and packaged into bubble-like compartments called vesicles. These vesicles then merge with the cell membrane, which releases the collagen into the space outside the cell. Sometimes, after it has been released from the cell, Collagen IV forms harmful aggregates that the body finds difficult to break down. This condition is known as fibrosis, and can severely damage organs and tissues.</p><p>Zang, Wan et al. have now studied how fat cells—also known as adipocytes—in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> release Collagen IV. This fly is widely used to study collagen production because it is relatively easy to perform genetic investigations on it, and it releases collagen from its cells in the same way as many other species. Unexpectedly, it was observed that proteins that control a process known as endocytosis—which takes substances into the cell—are also involved in releasing Collagen IV from the cell. Zang, Wan et al. found that this is because endocytosis removes part of the cell membrane: if endocytosis is blocked, then the excess cell membrane traps Collagen IV molecules after they have been released, causing aggregates like those seen during fibrosis. However, artificially decreasing the amount of cell membrane restored normal collagen release.</p><p>Zang, Wan et al. next found that a pathway called Toll, which is important for protecting flies against infections, can also affect collagen release. When a protein that inactivates the Toll pathway is absent, too much cell membrane grows and Collagen IV forms aggregates as well. In both cases, Toll activation or lack of endocytosis, the aggregates trigger a reaction that damages the adipocytes. Understanding this reaction in more detail could help to develop treatments for conditions that produce fibrosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07187.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07187.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>basement membrane</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General program grant, 31371459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlos Pastor-Pareja</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003512</institution-id><institution>State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1000 Young Talents award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlos Pastor-Pareja</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004147</institution-id><institution>Tsinghua University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tsinghua Initiative Program, 20131089281</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlos Pastor-Pareja</surname><given-names>José</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Excess membrane can trap outgoing extracellular matrix proteins in secreting cells, leading to pericellular deposits that cause tissue damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Basement membranes are polymers of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that underlie epithelia and surround organs in all animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yurchenco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelley et al., 2014</xref>). Their main constituent is <italic>Collagen</italic> IV, a helical trimer consisting of three α chains, capable of forming polymeric networks that interact with other ECM proteins. The fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has emerged in recent years as an excellent model to study production of Collagen and other ECM proteins thanks to evolutionary conservation, powerful genetic tools and little genetic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denef et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martinek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drechsler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lerner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Na et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devergne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Two Collagen IV chains exist in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, encoded by <italic>Collagen at 25C</italic> (<italic>Cg25C</italic>, α1 chain) and <italic>viking</italic> (<italic>vkg</italic>, α2 chain). Apart from Collagen IV, BMs include Laminin, Nidogen and Perlecan, which are conserved from flies to humans as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hynes, 2012</xref>). In the larva, the main source of Collagen IV is the adipocytes of the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>), known for their role in lipid storage and metabolic regulation, but also as an active secretory tissue which produces serum proteins and clotting factors normally present in the hemolymph (insect blood). The fat body is also a key effector of innate immunity, known to produce and secrete to the hemolymph large amounts of antimicrobial peptides in response to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Secreted proteins like Collagen reach the extracellular space through a controlled series of membrane traffic events ensuring fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (PM). Besides its role in cargo transport, membrane trafficking is a well-recognized driver of changes in cell shape and PM amount during morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lecuit and Pilot, 2003</xref>). Examples of morphogenetic traffic in <italic>Drosophila</italic> include contraction of the amnioserosa during dorsal closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mateus et al., 2011</xref>) and widening of the lumen of tracheae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tsarouhas et al., 2007</xref>). The best studied example of traffic-driven morphogenesis is perhaps blastoderm cellularization in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. During blastoderm cellularization, fast directed PM growth results from membrane contributions from the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>), endocytic membrane recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pelissier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sokac and Wieschaus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabrowski et al., 2013</xref>) and microvillar PM elaborations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figard et al., 2013</xref>). While these examples highlight the potential of membrane traffic to elicit drastic changes in cell shape in the context of morphogenetic events, a role of in maintaining stable cortical morphology has not been addressed in detail and little is known on how cells normally regulate PM amount. Furthermore, the consequences for cell physiology of changes in this fundamental property are also unknown.</p><p>Handling of Collagen entails several challenges to secreting cells. Because of its large size, secretory transport of Collagen molecules requires carriers larger than regular COPII vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saito et al., 2009</xref>). Also, Collagen molecules undergo postranslational modification along the secretory pathway by numerous Collagen-modifying enzymes such as glycosidases, and lysyl- and prolyl-hydroxylases, required for trimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2004</xref>). Prolyl-hydroxylation in particular is essential for trimer formation, mediated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by the prolyl-4-hydroxylase PH4αEFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>). Unlike fibrilar Collagen I, which flies lack, Collagen IV is secreted in functional form and does not require extracellular cleavage of the N- and C-terminal propeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khoshnoodi et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, and given its ability to form supramolecular assemblies, it is not known how Collagen IV avoids aggregation inside secreting cells or at their PM. Finally, because Collagen is resistant to most proteases, disposing of aggregates when they occur is highly problematic. Such is the case of fibrotic diseases, characterized by aberrant and excessive deposition of ECM due to persistent immune stimulation following diverse types of injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wynn and Ramalingam, 2012</xref>). In a variety of tissues such as the liver, skin, kidney or fat tissue, fibrosis disrupts tissue organization and increases matrix stiffness, affecting normal cell and tissue physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we conducted a screening for genes involved in Collagen IV secretion by the fat body adipocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We found that loss of <italic>shibire</italic> and other endocytic genes leads to excess PM growth, which traps Collagen IV in the pericellular space. Pericellular Collagen IV trapping also results upon loss of loss of negative immune regulator <italic>cactus</italic>, which causes PM overgrowth through a Toll-dependent secretory burst. The accumulation of Collagen IV in the secreting adipocytes has two main consequences: Collagen IV deficit in the BMs of destination tissues and an immune response against adipocytes due to the abnormal ECM accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endocytic defects cause Collagen IV accumulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipocytes</title><p>To gain new insights into Collagen biogenesis, we conducted a screening for genes affecting production of Collagen IV by fat body adipocytes, its main source in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used <italic>BM-40-SPARC-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Venken et al., 2011</xref>) to drive expression in adipocytes of the RNAi transgenes in the TRiP collection (8459 lines targeting 6200 genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ni et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2011</xref>) and analyzed the localization of Vkg-GFP, a functional GFP-trap fusion to the Collagen IV chain Vkg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morin et al., 2001</xref>). While a majority of hits produced intracellular Collagen IV accumulation (full results to be published later), a distinct phenotypical category consisted of 60 genes causing accumulation at or near the PM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among the strongest hits in this category were two different RNAi transgenes targeting <italic>shibire</italic> (<italic>shi</italic>), encoding fly Dynamin, a GTPase involved in excision of endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>). <italic>shibire</italic> knock-down (<italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup>), as well as expression of dominant negative Dynamin (Shi<sup>K44A</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moline et al., 1999</xref>), caused Vkg accumulation in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In validation of the phenotype, antibody staining confirmed reduced Dynamin expression in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> cells, whereas the staining increased after Shi.K44A overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), attesting to the sensitivity of the antibody. Since Collagen IV is a heterotrimer combining the α2 chain Vkg with Cg25C α1 chains, we performed a staining with an anti-Cg25C antibody we generated for this study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This staining revealed that Cg25C, same as Vkg, accumulates in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), thus confirming Collagen IV accumulation in these cells. The accumulation of Collagen IV occurs at the cell periphery, under a basement membrane surrounding the tissue in the wild type and which still forms in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; see also Figure 3B later).

These results demonstrate that not all proteins secreted by the fat body are pericellularly trapped as a result of PM overgrowth. On the contrary, our data support the notion that the aggregates consist of ECM proteins like trimeric Collagen IV, Perlecan and Nidogen, and thus are fibrotic deposits. Furthermore, our results suggest that Collagen IV is the main protein in this deposits, as accumulation of Perlecan and Nidogen depended on the presence of Collagen IV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Fibrotic deposits and PM overgrowth upon Toll activation</title><p>Having established that extracellular deposits caused by PM overgrowth were not general protein aggregates but rather fibrotic ECM aggregates, we decided to investigate their wider biological effects.

Through a genetic screening, we discovered that reducing endocytosis caused unexpected Collagen IV accumulation in secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In investigating the cause for such a paradoxical phenotype, our experiments revealed that Collagen IV was effectively secreted and reached the extracellular space, but it was then trapped in fibrotic deposits at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further experiments led us to conclude that endocytic membrane removal and recycling are critical to maintain normal PM amount and that excess of PM when endocytic membrane removal was prevented resulted in a hyperconvoluted cell cortex where Collagen IV became entrapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This hyperconvoluted cell cortex is reminiscent of the basal labyrinth found in highly secretory cells, such as enterocytes and renal tubule epithelium. Fibrotic deposits in the absence of negative Toll regulator Cactus were similarly caused by PM overgrowth as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this instance, however, PM overgrowth resulted from increased membrane input from the secretory pathway, consistent with the ability of Toll to induce massive secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Supporting this, knock down of Rab1, required for ER-to-Golgi transport, was able to suppress Toll-induced PM overgrowth. Therefore, both recycling endosome-derived and ER-derived membrane inputs may contribute to total PM amount while constant endocytic membrane removal prevents PM overgrowth.</p><p>Sudden surges or shifts in membrane traffic are well known drivers of cell shape changes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lecuit and Pilot, 2003</xref>). However, the extent to which maintenance of a stable cell shape is affected by the balance of membrane outputs and inputs to the PM has been less explored. Our experiments show that endocytosis is critical for preserving cortex morphology in <italic>Drosophila</italic> adipocytes and that preventing endocytosis can cause dramatic PM overgrowth. A factor that might determine high PM turnover in these cells, and thus a tendency to imbalances, is their elevated secretory activity. Apart from Collagen IV, fat body adipocytes secrete most other proteins present in the hemolymph, including the very abundant larval serum proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guedes Sde et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vierstraete et al., 2003</xref>), which imposes a constant input of ER membrane to the PM. A need for control of PM amount, however, does not seem exclusive to adipocytes or highly secretory cells based on reported effects in other cell types. For instance, in Garland cells, a filtering cell type with high endocytic activity, <italic>shibire</italic> loss causes deep PM tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983</xref>), whereas loss of <italic>Rab11</italic> flattens the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Satoh et al., 2005</xref>). In neurons, accumulation of membrane cisternae in synaptic boutons was observed upon Clathrin and Dynamin photoinactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heerssen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kasprowicz et al., 2014</xref>), similar to the PM excess we found in adipocytes. Finally, <italic>Rab5</italic> and other endocytic genes are required to maintain epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu and Bilder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zeigerer et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that constant endocytosis actively keeps apical and baso-lateral PMs segregated. These examples, together with our findings, point to a requirement for endocytosis and recycling in maintaining stable cell shape wider than currently appreciated.</p><p>In addition to the finding that membrane traffic controls adipocyte PM amount, our results have implications for the understanding of fibrotic deposits. We arrived at the study of membrane traffic in adipocytes through a Collagen IV accumulation phenotype. Collagen IV, however is not the only protein in these deposits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Also Perlecan, which we show originates in adipocytes as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), accumulates pericellularly. Except for Nidogen, a third basement membrane component, no other protein we tested accumulated, including Ferritin and Catalase, two of the most abundant proteins in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Handke et al., 2013</xref>). Even though a more complete view of the aggregates must await a proteomic analysis, our data suggest that Collagen IV, while not the only protein present in these deposits, it is the most important one, as knock down of Collagen IV suppressed accumulation of Perlecan and Nidogen in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> cells. Because of its abundance and ability to self-interact, Collagen IV seems particularly prone in principle to nucleate aggregates in the conditions of limited diffusion provided by a hyperconvoluted PM. That Collagen IV self–interaction is critical in triggering pericellular aggregation is indeed supported by the fact that knock-down of <italic>PH4α-EFB</italic>, required for trimer formation, suppresses aggregate formation. In contrast, our data showing that PM surrounding aggregates can be stained equally well with both low (3000) and high (70,000) molecular weight fixable dextrans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests that the size of the accumulated protein does not play a major role in the formation of the deposits. This is also supported by the finding that Perlecan, a large 400 kDa protein, does not accumulate by itself, but as a result of Collagen IV accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Besides endocytic genes and <italic>cactus</italic>, our screening has found additional hits causing Collagen IV accumulation at the PM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Loss of <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic>, one of these hits, was previously known to cause Collagen IV deposits on adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, similar to the fibrotic deposits in our study, other basement membrane components accumulate upon loss of <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shahab et al., 2015</xref>). However, the PM is not overgrown in <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the way in which aggregates form in <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes is different from the way they arise in endocytosis-defective and Toll-activated adipocytes. We have also tested Toll pathway activation by examining expression of Toll target Drosomycin (Drs-GFP) in <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> and all other PM accumulation hits, but found no Drosomycin-GFP induction in any of them. This suggests that, <italic>cactus</italic> aside, none of the hits causes Collagen IV deposits through ectopic Toll activation. Further characterization work, therefore, is needed to ascertain the particular mechanisms by which PM accumulation of Collagen IV occurs upon loss of these genes. Such work might offer additional insights for a better understanding of fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Adipocyte fibrosis</title><p>Pericellular trapping of Collagen IV, apart from preventing its incorporation to destination tissues, induces a potent response in adipocytes. Aspects of this response include melanization and activation of the JAK/STAT and JNK pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In the case of adipocyte fibrosis, however, our data indicate that it is the fibrotic deposits that cause the response rather than absence of a basement membrane, since Collagen IV knock down in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> cells suppressed the response instead of enhancing it. Also in Toll<sup>10B</sup> adipocytes, Collagen IV reduction partially suppressed melanization, showing that, even though Toll targets include melanization enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>), Collagen deposits contribute to Toll-induced melanization. An interesting question deserving of further investigation is how the fly immune system can react to these fibrotic deposits. One possibility is that fibrotic deposits are directly detected as altered self by the immune system, for instance through recognition of some specific molecular trait in them. A second possibility is that deposits somehow cause damage in adipocytes and this damage activates the response. In this latter case, the nature of the fibrosis-induced cell damage and the way that damage might be sensed are also worth deeper investigation.</p><p>Adipocyte fibrosis in humans and mouse models is correlated with obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Same as human adipocytes, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval adipocytes are surrounded by a basement membrane containing Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chun, 2012</xref>); also similar, human adipocytes display complex PM topology, with abundant caveolae forming higher-level rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan et al., 1983</xref>). Our study, importantly, provides a model to study fibrosis in this tissue. Fibrosis, affecting adipocytes or otherwise, is thought to result in all cases from inflammatory stimulation of excess ECM deposition. Our results show that accumulation of trimeric Collagen IV can be triggered by Toll immune activation and that deposits in turn further stimulate other arms of the fly immune system different from the Toll-mediated immune response. This raises the possibility that fibrotic accumulations, once initiated, could be self-sustained, with inflammation and fibrosis feeding each other. Interestingly, the response to fibrosis includes induction of Collagen-degrading enzyme Matrix metalloprotease 1, suggesting that the response is aimed in part at clearing the aggregates. Further research into how innate immunity is activated by these deposits may uncover therapeutically relevant mechanisms by which adipocytes and other tissues react to, and deal with, excessive matrix deposition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and culture</title><p>Standard fly husbandry techniques and genetic methodologies, including balancers and dominant genetic markers, were used to assess segregation of mutations and transgenes in the progeny of crosses, construct intermediate fly lines and obtain flies of the required genotypes for each experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roote and Prokop, 2013</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>1) The authors argue that collagen deposition underlies fibrosis. To support this claim, they show that knocking down PH4αEFB rescues the dynamin mutant phenotype. It is important to perform the same experiment in the context of Toll pathway activation to demonstrate that the same process is at work.</p><p>2) Additional experiments are required to clarify whether collagen is extracellular or intracellular. This is a source of confusion in the paper. More specifically: Is there a way to show that their plasma membrane inclusions that they see surrounding adipocytes are actually open to the extracellular space? The FM dye was not really convincing and the paper really hinges on the idea that these inclusions are not internal vesicles. Could the authors whole mount stain the fat body for Collagen IV without permeabilizing? If the antibody can still get access to the Collagen then it would be good evidence that it is really extracellular. It may be that the authors actually performed this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as they do show antibody staining of fat body for Collagen IV. However, they do not tell us if these were sections or whole mounts, or whether there was any permeabilization.</p><p>Related to the comment above, is the Collagen IV inclusions related to the size of the collagen? If the authors bathe the fat body in different size dextrans would they be able to highlight these plasma membrane inclusions and show that there is a threshold size that is incapable of getting into these pockets? This may be an additional way to show that they really are extracellular. To ensure that the dextran is not being taken up by endocytosis they may need to do this experiment on fixed tissue.</p><p>3) Confirm that the secretion of other proteins is not affected in the condition tested by looking to the presence of secreted proteins in the hemolymph. More specifically, it would be good for the authors to show that in their various perturbations, they get reduced levels of Collagen IV in the hemolymph (or are capable of rescuing Collagen IV levels in the hemolymph). Presumably most of the Collagen IV is trapped around the adipocytes at the expense of soluble Collagen when they disturb trafficking? The authors also show some negative controls regarding proteins that are not trapped in the PM inclusions (secr-GFP) in the dissected fat body. But they don't show that this secr-GFP is actually secreted in their system (it would be good to see a positive control that this is actually expressed). Could the authors do this in vivo and image the hemolymph within larvae and look at GFP levels? Or, similar to the comment above, look for GFP levels in the hemolymph by western blot? The same should be said for the other control proteins that they examine (Ferritin, 26-29p and catalase).</p><p>4) The authors artificially decrease PM amount by depleting lipids. This is a surprising result that should be substantiated. They show that this rescues PM defects by looking at plasma membrane depth by confocal. It was unclear why they didn't also perform EM and also use their other measures of PM surface area as in their other perturbations. This should be performed for consistency.</p><p>5) The Methods section needs to be expanded to make it more understandable to readers not familiar with the genetic crosses.</p><p>6) About the other hits of the screen: they should be briefly discussed or eliminated from the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07187.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors argue that collagen deposition underlies fibrosis.

This may be an additional way to show that they really are extracellular. To ensure that the dextran is not being taken up by endocytosis they may need to do this experiment on fixed tissue</italic>.</p><p>We have performed additional experiments to demonstrate that Collagen IV accumulating in endocytosis-defective and Toll-activated adipocytes is in fact extracellular. We have done this in the two ways suggested by the referees.</p><p>First, with antibody stainings performed in absence of permeabilization, to detect extracellular Vkg-GFP (anti-GFP) and extracellular Cg25C (anti-Cg25C). Without permeabilization (no Triton X detergent treatment at any step), both Vkg and Cg25C are still detected at their pericellular location. As a control, we use intracellular retention of Collagen IV in <italic>Tango1</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes to show that intracellular Collagen cannot be detected when permeabilization is omitted. The new data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> for <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> for <italic>cact</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> and Toll<sup>10B</sup>. It must be noted that previous stainings were done as whole mounts with permeabilization, which we now indicate in the Results section:</p><p>“To confirm that the Collagen IV accumulations in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes were extracellular, we performed antibody stainings […] indicating that the accumulations were indeed extracellular.”</p><p>The second way, also as suggested, is using fluorescently-labeled dextran in fixed tissue. We now show results using low MW (4000) and high MW (70,000) fixable dextrans in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. In both cases membranes surrounding aggregates are stained by the dextran particles after incubation for 2 min. These results further support that Collagen IV aggregates are surrounded by PM and thus extracellular (please see the Results section):</p><p>“Labeling of membrane around the accumulations was similarly observed when <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> adipocytes were fixed and stained with fluorescently-labeled fixable dextrans of molecular weights 70,000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and 3000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>Our experiments with dextrans also suggest that the size of the particles is not determinant for the accumulation. This is also supported by the fact that Perlecan, a 400,000 MW protein, is definitely not trapped by virtue of its size, but as a result of Collagen IV retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We therefore give now more weight in the Discussion to the idea that the ability of Collagen to self-interact is the key factor determining aggregation and discourage the interpretation that Collagen IV protein size might play a major role:</p><p>“That Collagen IV self–interaction is critical in triggering pericellular aggregation […] but as a result of Collagen IV retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).”</p><p>We also tried using non-fixable fluorescein-coupled dextrans, for which a wider range of particle sizes is available, to try to define better a size threshold for accumulation but could not get any conclusive results, as those dextrans did not associate with membranes, neither in live nor in fixed tissues.</p><p>A third, additional way in which we are now supporting that Collagen IV is extracellular in endocytosis-defective and Toll-activated cells is by pointing out examples in electron micrographs where a connection to the extracellular space of the cavity where the aggregate(s) are located can be clearly discerned. For <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> this is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>. For <italic>cact</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> and Toll<sup>10B</sup> we now point out clear connections to the extracellular space in the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Confirm that the secretion of other proteins is not affected in the condition tested by looking to the presence of secreted proteins in the hemolymph. More specifically, it would be good for the authors to show that in their various perturbations, they get reduced levels of Collagen IV in the hemolymph (or are capable of rescuing Collagen IV levels in the hemolymph). Presumably most of the Collagen IV is trapped around the adipocytes at the expense of soluble Collagen when they disturb trafficking</italic>?</p><p>That the amount of soluble Collagen IV is reduced as a result of pericellular retention is supported by data showing reduced deposition in basement membranes and VNC organ deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To further support this, we have performed, as suggested, Western blot analysis of hemolymph in wild type, <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup>, <italic>cact</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> and Toll<sup>10B</sup> larvae, which confirms reduced presence of Collagen in the hemolymph, especially in <italic>shi</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup>. These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors also show some negative controls regarding proteins that are not trapped in the PM inclusions (secr-GFP) in the dissected fat body. But they don't show that this secr-GFP is actually secreted in their system (it would be good to see a positive control that this is actually expressed). Could the authors do this</italic> in vivo <italic>and image the hemolymph within larvae and look at GFP levels? Or, similar to the comment above, look for GFP levels in the hemolymph by western blot</italic>?</p><p>To confirm that secr-GFP (a signal peptide coupled to GFP) is actually secreted to the hemolymph when expressed in the fat body we have performed Western blot analysis of hemolymph with anti-GFP. A clear band of the expected size can be detected indeed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, as further proof that GFP is secreted when secr-GFP is expressed in the fat body, we now show that GFP can be detected in pericardial cells lining the larval heart, known to act as hemolymph-filtering nephrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). These new data, together with the intracellular retention of secr-GFP upon <italic>Rab1</italic> knock-down shown before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), confirm that secr-GFP is secreted to the hemolymph. Although we cannot rule out the presence of other non-ECM proteins in the aggregates, we believe our results unmistakably show that not all secreted proteins will be trapped in the aggregates.</p><p><italic>The same should be said for the other control proteins that they examine (Ferritin, 26-29p and catalase)</italic>.</p><p>We have also conducted Western blot analysis of hemolymph with anti-GFP for Fer1HCH-GFP and Drs-GFP, also obtaining clear bands of the expected size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>). We can confirm as well presence of 26-29-protease-GFP in the hemolymph, the band pattern suggesting the full length protein is processed to some extent. As for Catalase, we could not reliably detect presence of Catalase-YFP in the hemolymph with anti-GFP (not shown) and so have taken this protein from our list of controls as a precaution.</p><p><italic>4) The authors artificially decrease PM amount by depleting lipids. This is a surprising result that should be substantiated. They show that this rescues PM defects by looking at plasma membrane depth by confocal. It was unclear why they didn't also perform EM and also use their other measures of PM surface area as in their other perturbations. This should be performed for consistency</italic>.</p><p>For the purpose of consistency, and to further support PM flattening in lipid-depleted adipocytes, we have documented their PM topology with electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1D</xref>) and the corresponding quantitative analysis, included in the graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The Methods section needs to be expanded to make it more understandable to readers not familiar with the genetic crosses</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded this section to try to explain to the non-Drosophilists the logic of the genetic methods we employed. In particular, since most experiments involve GAL4-driven transgene expression, we now explain the basics of the GAL4-UAS system and give more details of the GAL4 drivers we have used:</p><p>“Standard fly husbandry techniques and genetic methodologies, including balancers and dominant genetic markers, were used to assess segregation of mutations […] Genotypes of animals in all experiments are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.”</p><p><italic>6) About the other hits of the screen: they should be briefly discussed or eliminated from the text</italic>.</p><p>Since some of the later questions by the referees deal with the content of that list (e.g. <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic>, chromatin hits), we feel inclined to keep these data in the manuscript. We now devote a paragraph in the Discussion (“Besides endocytic genes and <italic>cactus</italic>, our screening has found additional hits causing […] additional insights for a better understanding of fibrosis”) to point out that:</p><p>A) <italic>BM-40-SPARC</italic><sup><italic>i</italic></sup> causes PM retention of Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shahab et al., 2015</xref>), but no PM overgrowth (data now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>B) No other hit in the screening apart from <italic>cactus</italic> seems to activate Toll signaling, assayed by Drosomycin-GFP induction.</p><p>C) Genes potentially related to fibrosis may be contained in that list.</p></body></sub-article></article>
