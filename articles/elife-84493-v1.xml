However, the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation are limited by the low survival and differentiation rates of NSCs due to the harsh environment in the brain after ischemic stroke. Here, we employed NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells together with exosomes extracted from NSCs to treat cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion in mice. The results showed that NSC-derived exosomes significantly reduced the inflammatory response, alleviated oxidative stress after NSC transplantation, and facilitated NSCs differentiation in vivo. The combination of NSCs with exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarction, neuronal death, and glial scarring, and promoted the recovery of motor function. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of NSC-derived exosomes and the potential downstream genes. Our study provided the rationale for the clinical application of NSC-derived exosomes as a supportive adjuvant for NSC transplantation after stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>combination treatment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Project of Research and Development of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022BCE049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Zhiqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Zhiqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871481</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Zhiqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2662022JC002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Zhiqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The combination of NSCs with NSC-derived exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarction, neuronal death, and glial scarring, and promoted the recovery of motor function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide, which usually causes motor and cognitive impairments that require long-term rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">GBD 2019 Stroke Collaborators, 2021</xref>). The commonly used treatments of stroke in clinic include tissue plasminogen activator thrombolytic therapy and thrombus clearance surgery, but both are limited by inability to repair damaged neural circuits, and only 10% of stroke patients meet the treatment standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fugate and Rabinstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagaraja et al., 2020</xref>). Stem cell-based therapy is a progressing and promising method to treat ischemic stroke. Many stem cell types including neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sakata et al., 2012</xref>), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meamar et al., 2013</xref>), mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toyoshima et al., 2017</xref>), bone marrow mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), and iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Duan et al., 2021</xref>) have been tested in preclinical and clinical research, which showed encouraging therapeutic effects. Both endogenous and exogenous NSCs have remarkable capacity to maintain self-renewal while differentiating into various cell types including neurons and glial cells in nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2012</xref>). iPSCs can be an ideal resource to acquire NSCs, which voids both ethical problems and immune rejection, and has a potential to provide genetically identical âpatient-specificâ cells for stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the low survival rate of transplanted NSCs, largely due to chronic inflammation and oxidative stress of the microenvironment after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koutsaliaris et al., 2022</xref>), and the poor differentiation of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) limited its application.</p><p>NSC-derived exosomes are enriched in specific miRNAs that mediate multiple functions in physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). NSC-derived exosomes, and have been proven useful for treating multiple neurological diseases due to their anti-inflammatory, neurogenic and neurotrophic effects as well as the interaction with the microenvironment of the brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vogel et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies suggested that application of NSC-derived exosomes could promote the differentiation of NSCs through miRNAs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). However, the effect of exosomes on grafted NSCs in vivo remains elusive. We propose that the combined treatment of exosomes and NSCs can effectively ameliorate harsh lesion conditions to help the NSCs survival and differentiation, achieving optimal treatment effects.</p><p>In this study, we established ischemic stroke in mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R), and tested different treatment strategies using transplantation of iPSC-induced NSCs and NSC-derived exosomes. Our results indicated that NSC-derived exosomes could promote NSCs differentiation, reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and alleviate the formation of glial scars after ischemia and reperfusion, and as a result, could enhance the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation. We further explored the molecular mechanisms through profiling the miRNAs of the NSC-derived exosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NSC-derived exosomes facilitate post-stroke recovery after NSC transplantation in MCAO/R mice</title><p>We first characterized the NSCs derived from iPSCs by examining the expression of NSC marker genes including <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> by immunocytochemistry staining. The results showed that the cells used for subsequent transplantation expressed high level of NSC marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that NSCs were efficiently induced from iPSCs. We isolated exosomes from the same NSCs and examined the expression of exosomal markers including TSG101, CD63, and CD9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the results of transmission electron microscopy showed that the particle size of exosomes mixture was less than 200 nm, and nanoparticle tracking analysis confirmed the typical distribution of particle diameter of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the effects of different treatment strategies on the brain lesion after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in MCAO/R mice. To examine the presence and persistence of cerebral edema, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed 1 and 7 days after MCAO/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Two doses of NSC transplantation, 2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> and 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup>, were first tested. The results of survival analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>) and rotarod test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>) showed the dose-dependent effects of transplanted NSCs. Therefore, we determined to use the dose of 5 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> NSCs for the subsequent treatments to achieve a robust therapeutic effect. Mice were randomly divided into five groups (Sham, PBS, Exo, NSC, and NSC + Exo). Except Sham group, mice in all the other four groups received standard MCAO/R surgery. Lateral ventricle injections of 5 Î¼l PBS (PBS group), 10 Î¼g exosomes in 5 Î¼l PBS (Exo group), 5â¯Ãâ¯10<sup>5</sup> NSCs in 5 Î¼l PBS (NSC group), and 5â¯Ãâ¯10<sup>5</sup> NSCs + 10 Î¼g exosomes in 5 Î¼l PBS (NSC + Exo group) were performed at 7 days post-MCAO/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation were measured in focal brain tissues at 3 days post treatment; behavioral assessments were performed at 0-8 weeks post treatment; histological examinations were analyzed at 8 weeks post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure the successful establishment of cerebral ischemia, the cerebral blood flow was examined before, during, and after MCAO/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Neurological functions were evaluated by balance beam, ladder lung, rotarod test, and modified neurological severity score (mNSS) up to 8 weeks after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The results suggested that transplantation of NSCs combined with exosomes began to take effect starting at 4 weeks after treatment and significantly worked better than that solely with NSCs at 8 weeks post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The infarct area in the ipsilateral hemisphere was determined by MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) at 8 weeks post treatment. Compared to the severe damages of brain tissues in PBS group, mice treated by NSCs combine with exosomes showed significantly reduced infarct areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Meanwhile, the combination of NSCs and exosomes showed better protective effects on the brain tissue than either alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which was further confirmed by the results of brain weight analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, our results indicated that NSC-derived exosomes could significantly enhance the therapeutic effects of NSCs on motor dysfunction and brain infarction in MCAO/R mice. Furthermore, the NSC-mediated therapeutic effects were greatly accelerated by addition of exosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neural stem cell (NSC)-derived exosomes enhanced the therapeutic effects of NSCs on motor impairment and brain infarction after stroke.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of the experimental timeframes.

In the present study, we co-transplanted NSC-derived exosomes with NSCs in MCAO/R-induced cerebral ischemia in mice. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), our results confirmed that NSCs could effectively promote the recovery of motor function post-stroke in mice. Importantly, we demonstrated that exosomes could promote the repairment of the damaged brain tissue as well as the functional recovery, enhance the differentiation of the grafted NSCs in the infarct area, reduce the oxidative stress and inflammation, and alleviate the formation of glial scars in MCAO/R mice. As a proof-of-concept study on the co-delivery of NSCs together with exosomes in the classical animal model of ischemic stroke, our study provided solid rationale supporting the application of exosomes during stem cell-based therapy. On the other hand, whether exosomes from different sources have similar effects on transplanted NSCs and how exosomes regulate other types of stem cells in vivo deem further exploration.</p><p>The pathological process of ischemiaâreperfusion includes the generation of ROS, brain edema, and the increased levels of inflammation, which leads to the tough microenvironment for the transplanted stem cells to survive and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, transplanted allogeneic stem cells also exacerbate oxidative stress levels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yahata et al., 2011</xref> found that transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells triggers replication stress and induces increasing ROS levels in mice. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation has also been reported to increase oxidative stress levels in mouse muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Besides the oxidative stress, the chemokines released by macrophages and endothelial cells after stroke, such as chemokine group CXC ligand 1 (CXCL1), recruit peripheral immune cells to flood into the damaged brain, which causes immune-inflammatory damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ormstad et al., 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, transplantation of exogenous stem cells could aggravate the inflammatory response around infract area due to the immune rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2014</xref>). Xia et al. reported that ESC-derived exosomes decrease the inflammatory response, alleviate neuronal death, and improve long-term recovery after MCAO/R through increasing regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). Due to the properties of regulating signaling pathways in target cells, and remodeling the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vogel et al., 2018</xref>), NSC-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to improve a variety of neurological diseases, such as Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2019</xref>), and ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). Recent evidence demonstrated that exosomes promote the maturation of both neuron and glial cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, excessive initiation of apoptosis has also been implicated in stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we showed that NSC-derived exosomes could reduce the oxidative stress and the inflammatory response, and promote the differentiation of transplanted NSCs and reduce excessive apoptosis in the brain of MCAO/R mice. Therefore, our results indicated that exosomes could promote the therapeutic effects of transplanted NSCs at multiple levels.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that stem cell-derived exosomes had neural protective effects and could promote recovery after ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Webb et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). However, we did not observe significant therapeutic effects with solely exosome treatment, which could be due to the dose of exosomes, the treatment timing and frequency. Considering the fact that cell transplantation requires a relatively stable microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nih et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), we transplanted NSCs and exosomes at 7 days after stroke without subsequent delivery of exosomes in this study. Although the delivery of exosomes alone used in this study did not show significant neural protective effects, it indeed ameliorated oxidative and inflammatory lesion conditions, promoted neuronal repairment, and potentiated the therapeutic power of transplanted NSCs, suggesting that the application of exosomes could be an effective adjuvant for NSC-based therapy. Besides, as exosomes are ideal carriers for drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), modifications of exosomes by adding drugs or other functional molecules could potentially further enhance the beneficial effects of exosome treatment.</p><p>As miRNAs were reported to be one of the major exosomal components, we profiled the miRNAs from NSC-derived exosomes to explore the molecular basis for the effects of exosomes as we observed in this study. Bioinformatic enrichment analysis in this study suggested that the predicted target genes of exosomal miRNAs were concentrated in the functions and pathways that could regulate the NSCsâ behavior and the surrounding microenvironment. Interestingly, inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes and signaling pathways were also highly enriched in the target genes, consistent with the antioxidant role of exosomes as disclosed by our study. We, therefore, provided clues and a useful resource of exosomal miRNAs and predicted target genes for understanding the mechanisms underlying the function of exosomes in the NSC-based therapy for ischemic stroke. The roles and working model of the exosomal miRNAs as well as predicted target genes demand further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iPSCs</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iPSCs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BCA assay</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biosharp</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BL521A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BSA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TTC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Solarbio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T8170</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Sox2 (Rabbit Polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GeneTex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

Fixed brains were dehydrated in 30% sucrose in PBS for 2 days at 4Â°C. Brains were embedded in the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (SAKURA, Japan). Brain sections were obtained at a thickness of 25 Î¼m using a microtome cryostat (Leica, Germany). Tissues were permeabilized, blocked, and incubated as the above-mentioned protocol for cultured cell staining. Tissues were incubated with primary antibodies, including anti-NeuN (1:300, Abcam, catalog ab177487), anti-STEM121 (1:1000, Takara, catalog Y40410), anti-GFAP (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog 3670S), anti-Î²-III-tubulin (1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog 5568S), or anti-Nestin (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog Sc-23927). For TUNEL staining, in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Germany) was used to detect the cell apoptosis according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Briefly, 3% BSA incubated sections were incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 hr at 37Â°C in the dark. Then sections were incubated with anti-NeuN primary antibody (1:300, Abcam, catalog ab177487) and corresponding secondary antibody successively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Total protein was extracted from NSCs or exosomes using RIPA lysis buffer (Biosharp, China) with protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Keqiang Ye as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Zhengang Yang (Reviewer #2); Dandan Sun (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study investigates efficacy of exosomes from human (iPSCs) in improving NSC therapy for neuroprotection in mouse stroke model. One-week post-stroke, administration of NSCs through lateral ventricle injections in combination with exosomes significantly improved post-stroke survival, neurological function recovery and brain lesion attenuation in mice at 8-week post treatment. The strengths of this study include the positive outcomes from this combinatory treatment delivered at the subacute phase and multiple assessments of neurological function impairments; Notably, it is non-invasive, unbiased assessment of brain lesion with MRI. However, the evaluation of the possible underlying mechanisms is weak, which is articulated in each individual reviewer's comment. Extensive revision is necessary for strengthening this manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Biochemical characterization of the observed IF and IHC events.</p><p>2) Additional evidence about the cell death of the transplanted cells. The immunostaining of the Caspase-3 or TUNEL staining should be used to address this issue.</p><p>3) The evaluation of the possible underlying mechanisms is weak, which included reduction of reactive astrocytes, increased NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells, and possible roles of anti-inflammatory miRNA profiles of exosomes from NSCs in the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Employing ischemic stroke in mice with MCAO/R, the authors tested different treatment strategies using transplantation of iPSC-induced NSCs and NSC-derived exosomes.

The authors further explored the molecular mechanisms through profiling the miRNAs of the NSC-derived exosomes. However, the signalings impacted by the miRNAs were not biochemically validated by immunoblotting or immunofluorescent staining. This is crucial for confirming the actual molecules are indeed influenced by the miRNA as presented in Figure 5.

These data are different from the reported general outcomes in mice using this model (&lt;25% mortality, recovery of sensorimotor functions at 4-week post-stroke, etc).

Our data suggested that the reactive astrocytes decreased at the chronic stage after exosomes treatment. We hypothysize that exosomes inhibit the activation of A1 reactive astrocytes. We have examined the activation of A1 subtype in astrocytes following OGD/R and exosomes treatment at 24 h and 48 h (Figure 4 â supplement 1B and 1C), which confirmed our hypothesis. Therefore, we further determined the subtype of reactive astrocytes that underlying the effects of NSC+Exo treatment.</p><p>We inspected the effect of exosomes on the survival of neurons by examining the expression of apoptotic marker cleaved Caspase-3 (c-Caspase-3) and pro-apoptotic gene Bax in HT22 cells after OGD/R and exosome treatment. The results showed that exosomes reduced the OGD/R induced neuronal apoptosis (Figure 2 â supplement 1C-E, Page 7, Line 128-137). Besides the neuronal apoptosis, we evaluated the recovery of neural connection by checking the expression of SYN1 in mice of different groups and confirmed that SYN1 expression was increased in NSC+Exo group compared with NSC group (Figure 2H). These new data suggest that NSC-drived exosomes might promote the therapeutic effects of NSCs transplantation through inhibiting the apoptosis of neurons and assisting the recovery of neuronal connection.</p><p>As mentioned above, we examined the effects of exosomes on the survival of transplanted cells by immunostaining of Caspase-3 and STEM121 at 7 days after transplantation (Figure 3A, Page 8, Line 156-165). Furthermore, our additional data revealed that exosomes increased the differentiation of transplanted NSCs using immunostaining of RBFOX3/NeuN, PSD95 (Figure 3B; Figure 3 â supplement 1D, Page 9, Line 175-183). Interestingly, the anti-STEM121 staining revealed a larger distribution area of STEM121<sup>+</sup> cells in NSC+Exo group compared with NSC group (Figure 3 â supplement 1C, Page 8, Line 165-168) suggesting that exosomes might help the migration of transplanted cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Employing ischemic stroke in mice with MCAO/R, the authors tested different treatment strategies using transplantation of iPSC-induced NSCs and NSC-derived exosomes.

The degree of ischemia and injury during surgery may vary, which could be the reason for different mortality rates. For example, it is reported that the mortality rate could be even higher (80%-100%) with the same thread occlusion MCAO/R method (Yuan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2018, Jiang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019).</p><p>In order to test the therapeutic effects of NSCs and exsomome treatment, we adopted settings with higher difficulty for the behavioral experiments, for example, 30 rpm for the rotarod test. Previous study also confirmed much delayed behavioral recovery with similar settings, in which the MCAO mice did not show significant recovery in the rotarod test for 7 weeks after surgery (Wang <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020).</p><p>Our results showed that the infarct core caused by thread occlusion MCAO/R is in the middle-lower region on the coronal section of cerebral cortex, which is actually consistent with previous reports (BouÃ«t et al., 2007).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our cell culture study disclosed that exosome treatment could reduce the oxidative stress of NSCs, which is consistent of our in vivo study that MDA contentÂ was significantly decreased in exosome-treated mice. With both in vivo and in vitro evidence, we have a solid foundation to hypothesize that exosome could enhance the therapeutic effects of NScs by reducing oxidative stress.</p><p>Besides the in vitro data on the candidate target genes of exosomal miRNA, We have examined the effects of exosome treatment on the protein expression of target genes <italic>STAT3</italic>, <italic>PTPN1</italic> and <italic>CHUK</italic> using western blot in MCAO/R mice.
