effectors, which safeguard homeostasis under fluctuating metabolic and stress conditions by regulating an expansive proteostatic network. We have discovered the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HPK-1) acts as a key transcriptional effector to preserve neuronal integrity, function, and proteostasis during aging. Loss of <italic>hpk-1</italic> results in drastic dysregulation in expression of neuronal genes, including genes associated with neuronal aging. During normal aging <italic>hpk-1</italic> expression increases throughout the nervous system more broadly than any other kinase. Within the aging nervous system, <italic>hpk-1</italic> induction overlaps with key longevity transcription factors<italic>,</italic> which suggests that <italic>hpk-1</italic> expression mitigates natural age-associated physiological decline. Consistently, pan-neuronal overexpression of <italic>hpk-1</italic> extends longevity, preserves proteostasis both within and outside of the nervous system, and improves stress resistance. Neuronal HPK-1 improves proteostasis through kinase activity. HPK-1 functions cell non-autonomously within serotonergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons to improve proteostasis in distal tissues by specifically regulating distinct components of the proteostatic network. Increased serotonergic HPK-1 enhances the heat shock response and survival to acute stress. In contrast, GABAergic HPK-1 induces basal autophagy and extends longevity, which requires <italic>mxl-2</italic> (MLX), <italic>hlh-30</italic> (TFEB), and <italic>daf-16</italic> (FOXO). Our work establishes <italic>hpk-1</italic> as a key neuronal transcriptional regulator critical for preservation of neuronal function during aging. Further, these data provide novel insight as to how the nervous system partitions acute and chronic adaptive response pathways to delay aging by maintaining organismal homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are essential for nearly every cellular process to sustain a healthy organism. A complex network of pathways and signalling molecules regulates the proteins so that they work correctly in a process known as proteostasis.</p><p>As the body ages, this network can become damaged, which leads to the production of faulty proteins. Many proteins end up being misfolded – in other words, they are misshapen on the molecular level, which can be toxic for the cell. A build-up of such misfolded proteins is implicated in several neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease.</p><p>Cells have various ways to detect and respond to internal stressors, such as tissue or organ damage. For example, specific proteins in the nervous system can raise a ‘central’ alert when damage is detected, which then primes and coordinates the body’s systems to respond in the peripheral cells and tissues. But exactly how this happens is still unclear.</p><p>To find out more about the central coordination of stress responses, Lazaro-Pena et al. studied one such sensor protein, called HPK-1, in the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They first overexpressed the protein in various tissues. This revealed that only when HPK-1 was overactive in nerve tissue, it protected proteins and prolonged the lifespan of the worms. An increased amount of HPK-1 improved the health span of the worms and older worms also moved better. However, genetically manipulated worms lacking HPK-1 in their nerve cells showed a faster decline in nervous system health as they aged, which could be reversed once HPK-1 was activated again.</p><p>Lazaro-Pena et al. then measured the amount of HPK-1 in worms at different stages of their life. This showed that as the worms aged, the amount of HPK-1 increased in the nerve cells. The nerve cells in which HPK-1 levels increased overlapped with an increased expression of proteins associated with longevity. Moreover, when HPK-1 was overexpressed, it stimulated the release of other cell signals, which then triggered protective responses to prevent the misfolding and aggregation of proteins and to help degrade damaged proteins.</p><p>This study shows for the first time that HPK-1 appears to play a protective role during normal ageing and that it may act as a key switch to stimulate other protective mechanisms. These findings may give rise to new insights into how the nervous system can coordinate many different stress responses, and ultimately delay ageing throughout the whole body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>neuronal cell non-autonomous control</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>homeodomain-interacting protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG062593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lazaro-Pena</surname><given-names>Maria I</given-names></name><name><surname>Samuelson</surname><given-names>Andrew V</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Zachary C</given-names></name><name><surname>Cornwell</surname><given-names>Adam B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HD105323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Balzac</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptional cofactor HPK-1 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase) functions as a key regulator of multiple proteostatic stress responses, each originating from discrete neuronal subtypes within the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nervous system to preserve neuronal health and maintain organismal proteostasis during normal aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gradual decline of function within the proteome (proteostasis) is a characteristic of aging, which precipitates the onset and progression of a growing number of age-associated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gidalevitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gidalevitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kikis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Morimoto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Sala et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>): Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases driven by genetic alterations that typically predispose a mutant protein isoform to aggregate and have toxic gain of function properties on the neuronal proteome. Outside of the nervous system, age-associated proteostatic decline also leads to disease, for example, the onset of diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jaisson and Gillery, 2014</xref>); thus, the decline in proteostasis during normal aging is not limited to the nervous system. A growing number of studies suggest that aging is not simply the result of stochastic accumulation of damage, but is determined through genetics and coordinated mechanisms across tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lazaro-Pena et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Proteostatic decline corresponds with the age-associated breakdown of a large proteostasis network (PN), which integrates stress-responsive control of protein folding, degradation, and translation in response to myriad cell intrinsic and non-autonomous signals. And yet, while major components of the proteostatic network have been identified, how multi-cellular organisms maintain systemic proteostasis within and across tissues to delay aging is still poorly understood.</p><p>The relatively simple metazoan animal <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) is a premier model system to elucidate how proteostasis is coordinated across cell and tissue types in response to myriad signals. Discoveries of cell non-autonomous signaling first made in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have evolutionarily conserved components, and revealed that the nervous system acts as a key cell non-autonomous regulator of organismal proteostasis and longevity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Miller et al., 2020</xref>). For example, a pair of thermosensory neurons systemically regulate the heat shock response (HSR) in a serotonin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Prahlad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, a second regulatory component from the GABAergic and cholinergic systems normally limits muscle cell proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Garcia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Silva et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The first discovery of a putative link between the transcriptional cofactor homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HPK-1) and longevity was from our genome-wide RNAi screen that identified 103 genes essential for decreased insulin-like signaling (ILS) to extend longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Samuelson et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans, hpk-1</italic> preserves proteostasis, stress response, and organismal longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Samuelson et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, we have previously shown that HPK-1 extends longevity through distinct genetic pathways defined by HSF-1 and the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Activation by either metabolic or genotoxic stressors has been observed from yeast to mammals, suggesting that this family of transcriptional cofactors arose early in evolution to couple metabolic and stress signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hofmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Shojima et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In general, mammalian HIPK family members regulate the activity of transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifiers, signaling molecules, and scaffolding proteins in response to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calzado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de la Vega et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Song and Lee, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Song and Lee, 2003b</xref>). For example, nutrient stress, such as glucose deprivation, can activate Hipk1 and Hipk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ecsedy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Garufi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Song and Lee, 2003b</xref>). Conversely, hyperglycemia triggers HIPK2 degradation via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldari et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We sought to identify the tissue and cell types in which the HPK-1 transcriptional circuits act to extend longevity, increase resistance to acute proteotoxic stress, and which PN components are regulated across tissues. We have discovered that HPK-1 functions as a key regulator of the proteostatic response, originating in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We find that <italic>hpk-1</italic> is the most broadly upregulated kinase during normal <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging, predominantly within the nervous system, and acts to preserve neuronal function and proteostasis within the nervous system. Further, HPK-1 kinase activity within the nervous system initiates cell non-autonomous signals that trigger protective peripheral responses to maintain organismal homeostasis. Responses can qualitatively differ depending on the neuronal type from which they arise: serotonergic HPK-1 activity increases thermotolerance and protects the proteome from acute stress by enhancing the HSR, without increasing lifespan or altering basal autophagy. In contrast, GABAergic HPK-1 activity induces autophagy and extends longevity, without altering thermotolerance. HPK-1 overexpression is sufficient to induce autophagy gene expression, and autophagosome formation requires <italic>hlh-30</italic> (TFEB), <italic>mxl-2</italic> (MLX), and <italic>daf-16</italic> (FOXO) TFs. We posit that serotonergic HPK-1 signaling responds to acute proteotoxic stress, whereas GABAergic HPK-1 responds to chronic metabolic changes mediated through TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, each of these distinct adaptive responses is sufficient to activate the PN and improve proteostasis outside of the nervous system. Our findings reveal HPK-1 as a key neuronal regulator in coordinating adaptive metabolic and stress response pathways across tissues to delay aging throughout the animal.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HPK-1 acts from neuronal tissue to promote longevity and healthspan</title><p>To precisely determine where HPK-1 functions in the regulation of longevity, we overexpressed <italic>hpk-1</italic> within neuronal (<italic>rab-3p</italic>), muscle (<italic>myo-3p</italic>), intestine (<italic>ges-1p</italic>), or hypodermal (<italic>dpy-7p</italic>) tissues to identify where activity was sufficient to increase lifespan. Increased neuronal expression of <italic>hpk-1</italic> was sufficient to increase lifespan by 17%, which is comparable to constitutive overexpression of <italic>hpk-1</italic> throughout the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, transgenic animals overexpressing <italic>hpk-1</italic> in either muscular, intestinal, or hypodermal cells had no significant change in lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). These results were somewhat unexpected, as we previously found that loss of <italic>hpk-1</italic> solely within either neuronal, intestinal, or hypodermal cells is sufficient to shorten lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>hpk-1</italic> is broadly expressed during embryogenesis and larval development, but HPK-1 protein is only expressed within the nervous system in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Raich et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>hpk-1</italic> and orthologs are known to have roles in development, differentiation, and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blaquiere and Verheyen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calzado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hattangadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Rinaldo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rinaldo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Steinmetz et al., 2018</xref>).

To determine what functions are over-represented among the upregulated neuronally expressed genes, we ran GO enrichment analysis. Representing these results as a network, and clustering terms which have overlapping gene associations, we identified some major themes: neurotransmitter and ion transport, synaptic components and signaling, axon and neuron projection components, feeding and locomotion behavior, mechanosensation and touch-responsive behavior are all upregulated in the absence of <italic>hpk-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Among all genes upregulated in the <italic>hpk-1</italic> null mutants, the largest group correspond to genes related to neuropeptide encoding, processing, and receptors. Neuropeptides are short sequences of amino acids important for neuromodulation of animal behavior, broadly expressed in sensory, motor, and interneurons.

Recently, single-cell RNA-Seq has revealed that these longevity-associated TFs increase in expression during aging in wild-type animals across multiple somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Roux et al., 2022</xref>). This comprehensive empirical dataset provides foundational support for a key theme in aging research: during aging in wild-type animals, increasing damage and dysfunction is mitigated by the activation of stress response programs. Our findings that: (1) <italic>hpk-1</italic> expression is upregulated during normal aging in more neurons and non-neuronal cells than any other kinase, and (2) that <italic>hpk-1</italic> is induced in cell clusters that overlap with longevity-associated TFs, including <italic>daf-16, hlh-30, skn-1,</italic> and <italic>hif-1</italic>, implies that HPK-1 is a key transcriptional regulator that mitigates aging. We posit this response is activated in the nervous system during normal aging in wild-type animals to mitigate increasing stress and the breakdown of homeostatic mechanisms within the nervous system.

However, our bulk RNA-Seq analysis cannot decipher changes in gene expression at the level of individual neurons after loss of <italic>hpk-1. hpk-1</italic> and orthologs are known to have roles in development, differentiation, and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blaquiere and Verheyen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calzado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hattangadi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Rinaldo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Rinaldo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Steinmetz et al., 2018</xref>), therefore we cannot preclude the possibility that HPK-1 may function to broadly limit neuronal gene expression during the course of normal development and differentiation, thereby specifying neuronal transcriptional programs. Mis-differentiation of the nervous system in the absence of <italic>hpk-1</italic> could result in both intracellular transcriptional noise and cell non-autonomous noise across cell types and tissues.</p><p>We show that HPK-1 expression in serotonergic neurons activates a cell non-autonomous signal to prime induction of molecular chaperones in muscle cells, whereas HPK-1 expression in GABAergic neurons signals induces autophagy in hypodermal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Our findings place HPK-1 within a selective cohort of transcriptional regulators within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system that are activated in response to metabolic, environmental, and intrinsic cues; thereby initiating distinct cell non-autonomous signals to regulate components of the PN in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Durieux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Frakes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Imanikia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Prahlad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Prahlad and Morimoto, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Silva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Taylor and Dillin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Morimoto, 2020</xref>). Loss of serotonin production in <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals has a minimal impact on lifespan at basal temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</xref>). However, simultaneous loss of both serotonin and DA biosynthesis shortens lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</xref>). Serotonin biosynthesis is also required for several conditions that extend longevity: animals treated with an atypical antidepressant serotonin antagonist (mianserin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Petrascheck et al., 2007</xref>), changes in food perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Entchev et al., 2015</xref>), and neuronal cell non-autonomous induction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berendzen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, loss of either of the serotonin receptors <italic>ser-1</italic> or <italic>ser-4</italic> have opposing effects on lifespan, suggesting antagonistic activity between serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Murakami and Murakami, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we find that increased HPK-1 activity in serotonergic neurons does not increase lifespan, but is sufficient to improve muscle proteostasis and amplify the expression of molecular chaperones that maintain proteostasis within the cytosol and nucleus. Interestingly, neuronal HSF-1 regulation of the HSR through thermosensory circuits is also separable from lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>). Serotonin signaling and the serotonin receptor <italic>ser-1</italic> are essential for the induction of the HSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Prahlad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>). ADF serotoninergic neurons receive upstream stress signals from the thermosensory circuit, consisting of the amphid sensory neurons (AFD) and the AIY interneurons, which regulate HSF-1 activity in the germline in a serotonin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>). However, increased serotonergic HPK-1 activity is not equivalent to altered thermosensory signals: <italic>hpk-1</italic> improves proteostasis within body wall muscles but not intestinal cells through neurotransmitters, and is independent of dense core vesicles. In contrast, loss of the guanylyl cyclase (<italic>gcy-8</italic>) in AFD thermosensory neurons or the LIM-homeobox TF (<italic>ttx-3</italic>) in AIY interneurons improves intestinal proteostasis through dense core vesicle neurosecretion (i.e., <italic>unc-31</italic>). <italic>hpk-1</italic> is expressed in AFD, but only at very low levels in AIY neurons (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>hpk-1</italic> is essential for the induction of the HSR within intestinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Whether <italic>hpk-1</italic> activity within thermosensory neurons functions within the canonical thermosensory-serotonin circuit to regulate the intestinal HSR or proteostasis is not mutually exclusive from our findings and will be interesting to pursue in future studies. Our results suggest that serotonergic HPK-1 is an important regulator of the HSR, potentially functioning in parallel to the thermosensory-serotonin circuit to restore proteostasis in response to acute thermal stress.</p><p>We posit that increased serotonergic HPK-1 activity further activates HSF-1 in response to heat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This would be consistent with known hyperphosphorylation of HSF-1 and amplification of the HSR in response to increasingly severe heat stress (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lazaro-Pena et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, HPK-1 limits SUMOylation of HSF-1, SUMO limits the HSR in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals, and severe heat shock results in HSF1 deSUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hietakangas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hietakangas et al., 2006</xref>). To our surprise, while increased neuronal <italic>hsf-1</italic> expression increases longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Douglas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Morley and Morimoto, 2004</xref>), we could find no study that has identified specific neuronal cell types in which increased HSF-1 activity is sufficient to extend longevity or enhance the HSR. Whether or not HPK-1 regulates HSF-1 within the nervous system and/or in peripheral muscle cells through cell non-autonomous signals will be interesting to determine in future studies. HPK-1 co-localizes with HSF-1 in neurons, HPK-1 protein is stabilized after heat shock, <italic>hpk-1</italic> is essential for induction of the HSR, and <italic>hsf-1</italic> and <italic>hpk-1</italic> are mutually interdependent to extend longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>Increased HPK-1 activity in GABAergic neurons induces autophagy in peripheral cells, improves proteostasis and longevity. Whether HPK-1 functions in GABAergic neurons through alteration of GABA or another neurotransmitter is unknown, but proper differentiation of GABAergic neurons is essential for neuronal HPK-1 activation of autophagy in distal tissue. We posit that HPK-1 cell non-autonomous signaling occurs via antagonism of GABA signaling. Loss of GABA increases <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). However, not all neurotransmitters regulate lifespan, as only mutants for the GABA biosynthetic enzyme, <italic>unc-25</italic>, increase lifespan. This GABAergic-mediated control in lifespan seems to be mediated by the <italic>gbb-1</italic> metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chun et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, GABA signaling inhibits autophagy and causes oxidative stress in mice, which is mitigated via Tor1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lakhani et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, we previously found that neuronal expression of HPK-1 is inhibited by TORC1 and <italic>hpk-1</italic> is required for TORC1 inactivation to extend longevity and the induction of autophagy gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Both TORC1 inactivation and <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression requires the Myc-family member <italic>mxl-2</italic> to extend longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistently, TORC1 also acts within neurons to regulate aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>); our results suggest that GABAergic neurons might be the specific neuronal cell type through which alterations in TORC1 activity regulate longevity. Collectively, our results position HPK-1 activity in GABAergic neurons as the likely integration point for cell non-autonomous regulation of autophagy via TORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>A growing number of longevity-associated TFs have been linked to autophagy, including <italic>pha-4</italic> (FOXA), <italic>mxl-2</italic> (MLX), <italic>hlh-30</italic> (TFEB), <italic>daf-16</italic> (FOXO), and <italic>hsf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hansen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kumsta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lapierre et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">O’Rourke and Ruvkun, 2013</xref>). We find that <italic>hlh-30, daf-16,</italic> and <italic>hlh-30</italic> are all required for the induction of autophagosomes when <italic>hpk-1</italic> is overexpressed in GABAergic neurons. We posit these TFs respond within the distal hypodermal seam cells in response to a neuronal signal initiated by HPK-1, as neurons are largely refractory to RNAi. However, this does not preclude cell intrinsic neuronal interactions; future refined spatial genetic analysis will be required to definitively decipher the precise tissues of action. DAF-16 and HLH-30 have previously been shown to function in combination to promote stress resistance and longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Analogously, the MML-1::MXL-2 complex and HLH-30 activate each other and are downstream effectors of longevity after TORC1 inhibition (<italic>mml-1</italic> encodes the MondoA/ChREBP ortholog, an obligate interactor with MXL-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our discovery that all three of these longevity-associated TFs are essential for GABAergic HPK-1 activity to induce autophagy, it is tempting to speculate HPK-1 acts as a key mediator of pro-longevity signaling after TORC1 inhibition through coordinated activation of MML-1::MXL-2, HLH-30, and DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>This work reveals a new level of specificity in the capacity of the nervous system to initiate adaptive responses by triggering distinct components of the proteostatic network across cell types. Results elucidating how neuronal cell types generate heterotypic signals to coordinate the maintenance of homeostasis are just beginning to emerge. For example, a previous study discovered that activating non-autonomous signaling of the ER-UPR via the XBP-1 TF can be initiated from serotonergic neurons and dopaminergic neurons; these signals are unique and converge to activate distinct branches of the ER-UPR within the same distal tissues (intestinal cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, our work demonstrates differential, yet specific, activation of cytosolic components of the PN in separate peripheral tissues through neurotransmitters. Our work suggests that the nervous system partitions neuronal cell types to coordinate the activation of complementary proteostatic mechanisms across tissues, despite utilizing the same transcriptional regulator within each neuronal cell type. One possibility is that HPK-1 regulates specific adaptive responses based on the unique epigenetic states between differentiated neuronal subtypes, which would be consistent with recent findings: during development and differentiation, transcriptional rewiring of cells sets chaperoning capacities and alters usage of mechanisms that maintain protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Nisaa and Ben-Zvi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Shemesh et al., 2021</xref>). Our work reveals HPK-1 as a novel transcriptional regulator within the nervous system of metazoans, which integrates diverse stimuli to coordinate specific adaptive responses that promote healthy aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

well-documented challenges remain with respect to consistency in cell captures and differentiating biological noise from technical artifacts such as ‘drop-outs’ from low numbers of average reads per

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Nayak and Hasija, 2021</xref>). We attempted to identify gene-gene correlations within cell clusters across individual ages based on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Aging Atlas dataset and found that inconsistency in the number of cells per cluster across time points limits our ability to identify many robust and significant associations – such variability is likely technical in nature, as it is not globally consistent across cell clusters for a given time point. In most cases, when aggregated into ‘young’ and ‘old’ sample groups, as was done for differential expression analysis in the original Aging Atlas analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Roux et al., 2022</xref>) the groups represent comparable numbers of total cells for most clusters. The trends we have observed at the level of individual time points indicate that the age-associated upregulation of <italic>hpk-1</italic> does not always occur at the same time point across cell clusters and is not necessarily tightly linked to the upregulation of longevity-associated TFs in the same cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Thus, the age-associated upregulation of pro-longevity factors in many cell clusters may not be due to a highly coordinated regulatory process, but rather a distributed response to accumulating local stress or damage. More work will be necessary to resolve if such late-life expression changes indeed contribute to maintenance of wild-type lifespan and healthspan, and the mechanism of the changes thereof (e.g., increased transcription, downregulation of miRNA targeting, epigenetic changes) and the factors that mediate these changes.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>hpk-1</italic> and longevity-associated transcription factors are upregulated in overlapping cell clusters, but timing of the age-associated changes varies between cell clusters.</title><p>Per-age expression summary for cell clusters with 4 or more differentially expressed longevity-associated transcription factors, of the 48 cell clusters in which hpk-1 is upregulated in old vs young animals.

In addition to upregulation of <italic>ins</italic> neuropeptides, 12 FMRFamide-related (flp) peptides, 19 neuropeptide-like proteins (<italic>nlp</italic>), 9 neuropeptide maturation genes (e.g., <italic>egl-3</italic> [proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2] and <italic>egl-21</italic> [carboxypeptidase E]), and 9 putative GPCR neuropeptide receptors were also significantly upregulated in <italic>hpk-1</italic> null mutants. Neurotransmitters are signaling molecules that trigger a response by binding to ionotropic or metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors in recipient neurons or tissues; we find that mainly the latter are upregulated in <italic>hpk-1</italic> null mutant animals, including acetylcholine (<italic>gar-1, gar-2,</italic> and <italic>gar-3</italic>), GABA (<italic>gbb-2</italic>), and glutamate (<italic>mgl-3</italic> and uncharacterized <italic>C30A5.10</italic>).

The process of vesicle release is highly dependent on a Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal detected by synaptotagmins proteins, which promotes vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deák, 2014</xref>).

They convincingly demonstrate that loss of hpk-1 increases neuronal dysfunction and detrimentally affects neuronal integrity, and thus hpk-1 is necessary to limit the motility-decline, stress resilience-decline and ventral and dorsal nerve cord-degeneration that normally occurs during aging; i.e. loss of hpk-1 exacerbates the decline, and rescuing hpk-1 in neurons prevents this exacerbation. They then conduct experiments to investigate how HPK-1 contributes to the maintenance of neurons during aging and show that hpk-1 overexpression in neurons (and in particular, serotonergic and GABAergic neurons) suppresses the accumulation of protein aggregates even in non-neuronal tissue, and activates protective stress responses such as autophagy and the chaperone induction. This leads them to conclude that HPK-1 activity maintains proteostasis, and thus preserves neuronal function and neuronal signaling required for the maintenance of tissue integrity during aging.</p><p>Overall, the data support a role for the role of HPK-1 in limiting the functional decline of neurons during aging. Several of the experiments support the authors conclusions. However, the manuscript has weaknesses that I believe need to be addressed, and further experimental evidence would be required to confirm the working model proposed by the authors.</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript, the authors interchangeably utilize animals overexpressing hpk-1 in the nervous system [rab-3p::hpk-1 ], and hpk-1 deleted animals where hpk-1 is rescued in the nervous system [hpk-1(pk1393); rab-3p::hpk-1], to conduct experiments where they examine the contribution of hpk-1 to phenotype. However, one concern that arises with this approach is that it is unclear whether the activities of hpk-1 when overexpressed can be used to inform on the phenotypes that result when hpk-1 levels are insufficient. This is of particular importance, since the authors hypothesize (although they need to show this directly) that hpk-1 levels increase with aging, and that HPK-1 activity in neurons appears to affect neurons and non-neuronal tissue. In addition, there are several smaller details in the experimental design that do not support the strong conclusions that the authors make.</p><p>2) Several of the analyses are diffuse and are not supported by statistics.</p><p>3) The main results from the scRNA-seq analysis pertinent to the authors conclusions should be independently verified, as possible, using qPCR etc.</p><p>Specific details:</p><p>1) Figure 1: The authors state that HPK-1 can rescue age-associated decline in movement. This is read-out as body bends/sec in day 2 animals, and wild-type motility is compared to a hpk-1 deletion [hpk-1(pk1393)], and in a hpk-1 deleted animals where HPK-1 is re-expressed in the nervous system [hpk-1(pk1393); rab-3p::hpk-1]. There are two main problems I see with this experiment and the interpretation of the results. First, the authors are not showing 'age-associated' decline but are measuring body bends/sec at one time point, and that too in a young animals. Therefore, measurements of body bends/sec over age should be measured to convincingly make this point. Second, the authors show, convincingly that hpk-1 is necessary to maintain normal motility and resilience to heat stress, using the deletion mutant and by rescuing function by re-expressing hpk-1 in the nervous system. It would be interesting to see these experiments in the rab-3p::hpk-1 animals overexpressing hpk-1 in wild-type backgrounds. This would allow us to conclude whether hpk-1 is simply necessary, or whether its expression is sufficient to preserve function.</p><p>2) Figure 2: To investigate how hpk-1 mRNA expression changes with age, the authors rely on published scRNA-seq data. While the extensive analysis is useful, independent confirmation that hpk-1 mRNA levels increase with age using qRT-PCR is necessary. In addition, some mechanism to address whether HPK-1 activity also increases, or hpk-1 levels increase while activity remains the same or declines with aging would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) Figure 2: The authors should evaluate whether the correlation of expression of hpk-1 mRNA with that of other transcription factors is significant. Correlation level, x-y plots, summary statistics of the correlation with significance are needed to make this point.</p><p>Moreover, the information in Figure 2, and later in Figure Supplement 4 are more confusing that supportive and could perhaps benefit from being presented in a more succinct and directed manner.</p><p>4) Figure Supplement 3: The experiments supporting the role of hpk-1 in the ILS pathway is confusing, and it is unclear what information can be gleaned from the epistasis studies at 20{degree sign}C versus 25{degree sign}C. In addition, in (G) the authors compare lifespans of a neuronal RNAi sensitive strain on empty vector and on daf-2 RNAi, with that of the neuronal RNAi sensitive strain systemically overexpressing hpk-1 and treated with daf-2 RNAi, to argue that neuronal HPK-1 and decreased ILS share overlapping mechanisms of longevity control. However, the lifespans of neuronal RNAi sensitive strain systemically overexpressing hpk-1 on empty vector alone needs to be included to support this conclusion. If these animals also showed that same lifespan extension as those on daf-2 RNAi, an alternative possibility is that HPK-1 and ILS extend lifespan through parallel pathways.</p><p>5) Figure 3 vs Figure 5 etc.: In addition to showing that hpk-1 is necessary to maintain neuronal integrity, using the deletion and rescued strains, the authors should evaluate the effects of the rab-3p::hpk-1 o/e strain in these experiments. In addition, the authors show that hpk-1 deletion mutants have decreased cholinergic neurotransmission as well as an increase in dopamine- and 5-HT-induced paralysis suggesting defects in neurotransmission as well as the ability to clear neurotransmitters from relevant synapses. Does overexpressing HPK-1 in neurons trigger the opposite phenotypes?</p><p>6) Line 327-33: There are no references cited for the dopamine- and 5-HT-induced paralysis treatments.</p><p>7) Figure supplement 5: The use of mutants in kinase activity is a strong positive control, but should be combined with some indication that these constructs (which are extrachromosomal, in my understanding) are expressed at the same levels as the rescuing hpk-1 overexpression construct. This is also true for the neuron specific rescue in Figure 8. The differences in the consequence of HPK-1 o/e in the different neurons would be strengthened if it was clear that the levels of expression are comparable.</p><p>8) Figure 5 and 6: the expression of HPK-1 in neurons is sufficient to decrease Q35 aggregation in muscle cells in the absence of stress, yet chaperone expression is only increased upon hsp-1 o/e after heat shock. The authors should elaborate on these results. Is HPK-1 activated under stress? Do the kinase deficient mutants not show this increase in hsp-16p::GFP?</p><p>9) Figure 6: lgg-1p::GFP::LGG-1 puncta are not an indication of autophagy unless coupled with flux measurements using brefeldin A.</p><p>10) Discussion and Figure 9: The authors should include tests for the effects of HPK-1 overexpression and deletion on 5-HT and GABA levels and activity during aging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85792.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We recorded age-associated changes in movement by imaging populations of wild-type, <italic>hpk-1</italic> null, and <italic>hpk-1</italic> null animals with neuronal <italic>hpk-1</italic> expression (<italic>hpk1(0);rab-3p::hpk-1</italic>) once every 15 minutes over the entire lifespan of the animals and converted these images into video files (spanning adult day 1 to 18). We find that restoring <italic>hpk-1</italic> within the nervous system is sufficient to rescue the age-associated accelerated decline in movement observed in the <italic>hpk-1</italic> null mutant animals. These results are provided in <italic>Video 1</italic> in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, neuronal <italic>hpk-1</italic> expression in the null background restores animals to wild-type lifespan. This further supports our conclusion that HPK-1 functions within the nervous system to maintain proteostasis, neuronal integrity and function during normal aging. We have included these findings within the revised manuscript (<italic>Figure 1F</italic>, and <italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 1</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please use both the hpk-1 deletion strain and hpk-1 neuronal overexpression strain side-by-side in at least one of your assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for this suggestion. Within the same experiment, we have previously demonstrated that loss of <italic>hpk-1</italic> impairs proteostasis and conversely <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression throughout the soma improves proteostasis, as measured both by age-associated accumulation of polyQ::YFP foci/aggregates within body wall muscle and the associated onset of paralysis occurring after collapse of the muscle proteome (<italic>See Figure 2 of Das et al., 2017 PMID: 29036198</italic>). In our current study we find analogous changes in proteostasis within both the nervous system and body wall muscle cells when <italic>hpk-1</italic> is either inactivated or overexpressed in the nervous system (<italic>Figure 5</italic> in this study). While these experiments were not conducted at exactly the same time, they were conducted in the same time frame and changes in proteostasis were compared to appropriate controls that are distinct (i.e., neuronal enhanced RNAi background for inactivation and wild-type background for overexpression).</p><p>Respectfully, we believe that we have sufficiently demonstrated that <italic>hpk-1</italic> null animals are shortlived, and <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression is sufficient to increase lifespan; repeating our lifespan analysis with multiple independent trials would require an unreasonable amount of time and effort for minimal gain to support the neuronal overexpression data in <italic>Figure 1</italic>. We and others have already demonstrated that <italic>hpk-1</italic> null mutant animals have a shortened lifespan, which is fully rescued by re-expression of <italic>hpk-1</italic> with the endogenous promoter but this rescue does not increase lifespan (<italic>PMID: 26791749, PMID: 29036198</italic>). Additionally, we previously found that loss of <italic>hpk-1</italic> within the nervous system is sufficient to shorten lifespan (<italic>PMID: 29036198</italic>). Thus HPK-1 activity within the nervous system is both necessary for a normal lifespan and overexpression is sufficient to extend longevity.</p><p>Collectively, between the current study and our findings published in <italic>PMID: 29036198</italic>, we have demonstrated:</p><p>– Lifespan: loss of <italic>hpk-1</italic> shortens, <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression increases.

We appreciate that caution should be taken when using results from one to inform upon the other. We believe our overexpression analysis is informative as to the role of homeodomain interacting protein kinases in aging, and traditionally have been more cautious in drawing conclusions from null mutant phenotypes; as HPK-1 (and orthologs) have subtle roles in normal development. As mentioned in Response #13, this is one reason we are moving towards the use of a conditional <italic>hpk-1</italic> allele. Nevertheless, our conclusions are also supported from cellular readouts of HPK-1 activity, some of which we previously published and are supported by other studies (<italic>PMID: 26791749, PMID: 29036198</italic>). Between these and our current study we consistently observe converse phenotypes in <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression and loss of function mutant animals. We highlight findings in detail in Response #6. Our model is generally consistent with modes of regulation found from yeast to mammals, and that homeodomain interacting protein kinases are activated in response to a broad range of metabolic and stress signals; activation during normal aging is consistent with a role in mitigating age-associated stress. We were surprised to discover that HPK-1 was the most broadly upregulated kinase during normal aging, which is congruent with the analogous discovery of upregulation of longevity-associated transcription factors made by the Aging Atlas study. However, we agree the latter is a working model that will be tested more rigorously in follow-up studies, both by ourselves and others in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Several of the analyses are diffuse and are not supported by statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for helping us improve rigor.

We posit that HPK-1 activity in peripheral tissues is necessary to increase lifespan beyond wild-type, which is consistent with previous findings: inactivation of <italic>hpk-1</italic> with either intestinal, hypodermal, or neuronal cells is sufficient to shorten lifespan (<italic>PMID: 29036198</italic>). Whether tissue specific inactivation in peripheral tissues compromises cell intrinsic responses to age-associated stress, reception of neuronal signals, or subtly compromises development within those tissues to limit lifespan are unresolved questions, which we will address in follow-up studies using a conditional <italic>hpk-1</italic> allele. It is worth mentioning that whole animal <italic>hpk-1</italic> inactivation (feeding based RNAi) either solely during development or immediately post-development is sufficient to shorten lifespan (<italic>PMID: 29036198</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2: To investigate how hpk-1 mRNA expression changes with age, the authors rely on published scRNA-seq data. While the extensive analysis is useful, independent confirmation that hpk-1 mRNA levels increase with age using qRT-PCR is necessary. In addition, some mechanism to address whether HPK-1 activity also increases, or hpk-1 levels increase while activity remains the same or declines with aging would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the excellent suggestion to increase reproducibility. Indeed, we independently verified that <italic>hpk-1</italic> mRNA increases during normal aging. First, we isolated agesynchronized animals at time points between days two and ten of adulthood and observed an age-associated increase in <italic>hpk-1</italic> expression. Next, we verified that age-associated changes in gene expression could be observed in two longevity-associated transcription factors identified in the Aging Atlas study. Consistent with findings from the Aging Atlas, we find significant reduction of <italic>xbp-1</italic> and increase in <italic>gei-3</italic> expression in older animals. Last, we confirmed that <italic>hpk-1</italic> is induced within the nervous system of older wild-type animals via a transcriptional <italic>hpk-1</italic> reporter (<italic>hpk-1p::mCherry</italic>). These results can be found in <italic>Figure 2</italic> and <italic>Supplementary File 4</italic> in the revised manuscript. We thank the reviewer for the additional suggestions, which will be a priority for follow up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2: The authors should evaluate whether the correlation of expression of hpk-1 mRNA with that of other transcription factors is significant. Correlation level, x-y plots, summary statistics of the correlation with significance are needed to make this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the nature of the expression association between <italic>hpk-1</italic> and the longevity-associated transcription factors was lacking in clarity. We investigated genegene correlations across time, based on re-analysis of the Aging Atlas dataset at a cell cluster level, but found that technical variability in the number of cells per cluster across timepoints limits identification of many significant associations. This variability is not globally consistent for a given time point across cell clusters, except at day 15 for which many fewer cells were captured in the original dataset. When cells are aggregated into “old” and “young” groups, which serves as the basis for the result in <italic>Figure 2</italic>, the groups represent comparable numbers of cells. As such, we recognize that these results represent genes which are similarly differentially expressed between the old and young groups, rather than strictly co-expressed, and we have revised our manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Interestingly, among the cell clusters in which <italic>hpk-1</italic> is upregulated with age and which have reasonable consistency in the cell counts across time points, we observe that the age at which upregulation of <italic>hpk-1</italic> and the longevity-associated TFs is first observed is not necessarily tightly linked. We posit that these changes are not being mediated by a single upstream regulatory process, but rather by multiple factors in response to accumulated physiological stress. We have taken a more conservative interpretation within the revised manuscript for greater precision and clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the information in Figure 2, and later in Figure Supplement 4 are more confusing that supportive and could perhaps benefit from being presented in a more succinct and directed manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and for the sake of clarity have moved <italic>Figure 2D</italic> to <italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 3</italic> in the revised manuscript. We prefer to retain <italic>Figure 2—figure supplement 4</italic> in the revised manuscript, we believe the graphic representation of significant age associated differential expression of all kinases creates a useful visual resource for future investigators. We have taken the reviewer’s advice and condensed the relevant text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure Supplement 3: The experiments supporting the role of hpk-1 in the ILS pathway is confusing, and it is unclear what information can be gleaned from the epistasis studies at 20{degree sign}C versus 25{degree sign}C. In addition, in (G) the authors compare lifespans of a neuronal RNAi sensitive strain on empty vector and on daf-2 RNAi, with that of the neuronal RNAi sensitive strain systemically overexpressing hpk-1 and treated with daf-2 RNAi, to argue that neuronal HPK-1 and decreased ILS share overlapping mechanisms of longevity control. However, the lifespans of neuronal RNAi sensitive strain systemically overexpressing hpk-1 on empty vector alone needs to be included to support this conclusion. If these animals also showed that same lifespan extension as those on daf-2 RNAi, an alternative possibility is that HPK-1 and ILS extend lifespan through parallel pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this concern. We agree the inclusion of this data is not pertinent to the rest of the study, and have removed it from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3 vs Figure 5 etc.: In addition to showing that hpk-1 is necessary to maintain neuronal integrity, using the deletion and rescued strains, the authors should evaluate the effects of the rab-3p::hpk-1 o/e strain in these experiments. In addition, the authors show that hpk-1 deletion mutants have decreased cholinergic neurotransmission as well as an increase in dopamine- and 5-HT-induced paralysis suggesting defects in neurotransmission as well as the ability to clear neurotransmitters from relevant synapses. Does overexpressing HPK-1 in neurons trigger the opposite phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting these experiments. While a straightforward idea, we believe rigorously evaluating whether overexpression of <italic>hpk-1</italic> alters or improves neurotransmission would require an extensive analysis of these phenotypes throughout <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan which would be time consuming and we note that neurotransmission is just one of many possible mechanisms. Identifying the mechanism(s) through which increased neuronal HPK-1 activity alters neuronal function to extend longevity is a high priority area for future studies, which we are pursuing through unbiased discovery-based approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 327-33: There are no references cited for the dopamine- and 5-HT-induced paralysis treatments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and have added the missing references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure supplement 5: The use of mutants in kinase activity is a strong positive control, but should be combined with some indication that these constructs (which are extrachromosomal, in my understanding) are expressed at the same levels as the rescuing hpk-1 overexpression construct. This is also true for the neuron specific rescue in Figure 8. The differences in the consequence of HPK-1 o/e in the different neurons would be strengthened if it was clear that the levels of expression are comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Both kinase mutants (<italic>hpk-1(K176A)</italic> and <italic>hpk1(D272N)</italic>) were engineered via site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type <italic>hpk-1</italic> in the same plasmid backbone, which were used in <italic>Figures 5b,d,g,I,l, 7a,c</italic>. These HPK-1 constructs do not have fluorescent nor epitope tags, and we have not been able to observe <italic>C. elegans</italic> HPK-1 via immunoblotting using antibodies to mammalian orthologs (not shown).</p><p>All transgenic animals are created via injecting the same amount of both <italic>hpk-1</italic> plasmid (either wild-type or mutant) and co-injection marker. Pharyngeal mCherry expression of the co-injection marker (<italic>myo-2p::</italic>mCherry) is similar across all strains. In the revised manuscript we updated the methods section to describe the creation, sequence validation, and cataloguing of these reagents.</p><p>We considered measuring mRNA expression. However, the transgenic animals overexpressing either mutant or wild-type <italic>hpk-1</italic> have endogenous <italic>hpk-1</italic>, and it would be difficult to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous mRNA expression. While the <italic>rab-3 promoter</italic> drives strong neuronal expression, <italic>hpk-1</italic> is broadly expressed in the nervous system of adult animals, which compounds obtaining a clear result via FISH. A further complication is that while HPK-1 protein is not detected outside of the nervous system post-development, analysis of cell-type specific expression of <italic>hpk-1</italic> (Aging Atlas dataset) and our prior analysis of transgenic animals expressing <italic>hpk-1</italic> transcriptional reporters revealed the presence of <italic>hpk-1</italic> mRNA outside the nervous system in adult animals (<italic>PMID: 29036198</italic> and unpublished observations).</p><p>Determining whether <italic>hpk-1</italic> is expressed at similar levels when expressed in different neuronal sub-types (<italic>Figure 7, Figure 7—figure supplement 1</italic>) using different promoters is even more problematic; it is always possible threshold effects exist when using exogenous promoters. However, we do not believe the data supports this possibility for <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression in serotonergic and GABAergic neurons, as these neurons elicit subtype <italic>specific</italic> responses. However, negative results with <italic>hpk-1</italic> overexpression within either dopaminergic neurons (<italic>cat2p</italic>) or glutamatergic neurons (<italic>eat-4p</italic>) could theoretically be explained via a threshold effect; we have added a statement within the results to acknowledge this possibility. Nevertheless, these promoters are well-established for neuronal subtype overexpression.</p><p>Given the aforementioned complications and limitations in resources, time, and personnel, we have made revisions within the manuscript to acknowledge the caveat of our negative results in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 5 and 6: the expression of HPK-1 in neurons is sufficient to decrease Q35 aggregation in muscle cells in the absence of stress, yet chaperone expression is only increased upon hsp-1 o/e after heat shock. The authors should elaborate on these results. Is HPK-1 activated under stress? Do the kinase deficient mutants not show this increase in hsp-16p::GFP?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking for clarification. Specifically, we previously found that HPK-1 is induced both within the nervous system and hypodermal seam cells after heat shock through post-transcriptional mechanisms and that the heat shock response is compromised in <italic>hpk-1</italic> null mutant animals (<italic>PMID: 29036198</italic>). We have rephrased these findings within the discussion of the revised manuscript and removed text that obscured the point. We have not tested whether kinase deficient mutants alter the induction of the heat shock response. In follow-up studies we intend to conduct a comprehensive mutational and structure/function analysis to identify the regions and functions that are essential to mediate HPK-1 pro-longevity modalities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6: lgg-1p::GFP::LGG-1 puncta are not an indication of autophagy unless coupled with flux measurements using brefeldin A.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.
