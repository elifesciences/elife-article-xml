Recent studies have predicted that thousands of peptides may be translated from transcripts containing small open-reading frames (smORFs). Here, we describe two peptides in <italic>Drosophila</italic> encoded by conserved smORFs, Sloth1 and Sloth2. These peptides are translated from the same bicistronic transcript and share sequence similarities, suggesting that they encode paralogs. Yet, Sloth1 and Sloth2 are not functionally redundant, and loss of either peptide causes animal lethality, reduced neuronal function, impaired mitochondrial function, and neurodegeneration. We provide evidence that Sloth1/2 are highly expressed in neurons, imported to mitochondria, and regulate mitochondrial complex III assembly. These results suggest that phenotypic analysis of smORF genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can provide a wealth of information on the biological functions of this poorly characterized class of genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>smORF</kwd><kwd>peptide</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>paralogs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Damon Runyon Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG:2258-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosch</surname><given-names>Justin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM084947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM067761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24OD019847</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perrimon</surname><given-names>Norbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHGRI HG009352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Celniker</surname><given-names>Susan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosch</surname><given-names>Justin A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sloth1 and Sloth2 are two mitochondrial peptides that are translated from one transcript and are important for neuronal function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Naturally produced peptides are regulators of metabolism, development, and physiology. Well-known examples include secreted peptides that act as hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pearson et al., 1993</xref>), signaling ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katsir et al., 2011</xref>), or neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snyder and Innis, 1979</xref>). This set of peptides are produced by cleavage of larger precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fricker, 2005</xref>), but peptides can also be directly translated from a transcript with a small open-reading frame (smORF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couso and Patraquim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plaza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsu and Benfey, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yeasmin et al., 2018</xref>). Due to their small size (&lt;100 codons), smORFs have been understudied. For example, smORFs are underrepresented in genome annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basrai et al., 1997</xref>), are theoretically a poor target for EMS mutagenesis, and are often ignored in proteomic screens. Consequently, there is growing interest in this class of protein-coding gene as a potentially rich source of novel bioactive peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mudge et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A major obstacle in identifying smORFs that encode functionally important peptides is distinguishing them from the enormous number of smORFs present in the genome by chance (e.g. 260,000 in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basrai et al., 1997</xref>). Many groups have identified and categorized smORFs with coding potential using signatures of evolutionary conservation, ribosomal profiling, and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saghatelian and Couso, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Couso and Patraquim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Plaza et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these approaches suggest there may be hundreds, possibly thousands, of unannotated smORF genes. However, these ‘omics methods do not tell us which smORFs encode peptides with important biological functions.</p><p>Functional characterization of smORF genes in cell lines and model organisms has the potential to confidently identify novel peptides. Historically, unbiased genetic screens and gene cloning led to the fortuitous identification and characterization of smORF peptides (e.g. POLARIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casson et al., 2002</xref>, RpL41 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suzuki et al., 1990</xref>, Nedd4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 1993</xref>, <italic>Drosophila</italic> pri/tal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galindo et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, candidate bioinformatically-predicted smORF-encoded peptides (aka SEPs) have been targeted for characterization (e.g. DWORF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>, Elabela/toddler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>, Myomixer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi et al., 2017</xref>, Myoregulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>, and Sarcolamban <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magny et al., 2013</xref>, and Hemotin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pueyo et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these studies have been invaluable for assigning biological functions to smORF peptides. Therefore, continued functional characterization is needed to tackle the enormous number of predicted smORF peptides.</p><p>Here, through an effort to systematically characterize human-conserved smORF genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2022</xref>), we identified two previously unstudied smORF peptides CG32736-PB and CG42308-PA that we named Sloth1 and Sloth2 based on their mutant phenotypes. Remarkably, both peptides are translated from the same transcript and share amino acid sequence similarity, suggesting that they encode paralogs. Loss-of-function analysis revealed that each peptide is essential for viability, and mutant animals exhibit defective neuronal function and photoreceptor degeneration. These phenotypes can be explained by our finding that Sloth1 and Sloth2 localize to mitochondria and play an important role in complex III assembly. Finally, we propose that both peptides bind in a shared complex. These studies uncover two new components of the mitochondria and demonstrate how functional characterization of smORFs will lead to novel biological insights.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are translated from the same transcript and are likely distantly related paralogs</title><p>Current gene annotations for <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> (aka <italic>CG32736</italic> and <italic>CG42308</italic>, respectively) indicate that they are expressed from the same transcript (Flybase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), known as a bicistronic (or dicistronic) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blumenthal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crosby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karginov et al., 2017</xref>). For example, nearby transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are predicted to only generate a single transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoskins et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, a full-length transcript containing both smORFs is present in the cDNA clone RE60462 (GenBank Acc# AY113525), which was derived from an embryonic library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stapleton et al., 2002</xref>), and we detected the full-length bicistronic transcript by RT-PCR amplification from total RNA from 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae, adult flies, and S2<italic>R</italic>+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the encoded peptides Sloth1 and Sloth2 have subtle sequence similarity (27%), are similar in size (79aa and 61aa, respectively), and each contain a predicted single transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While this type of gene structure is relatively rare in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blumenthal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karginov et al., 2017</xref>), there are known cases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of multicistronic transcripts encoding smORF paralogs – the <italic>pri</italic>/<italic>tal</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galindo et al., 2007</xref>) and the <italic>Sarcolamban</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Magny et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, it is well known that paralogs are often found adjacent to each other in the genome due to tandem duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor and Raes, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we propose that <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are paralogs translated from the same transcript.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bicistronic gene structure of the smORFs <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bicistronic gene model for <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic>.

Remarkably, only five nucleotides separate the stop codon of the upstream ORF (<italic>sloth1</italic>) and the start codon of the downstream ORF (<italic>sloth2;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, <italic>sloth1</italic> should be translated first and inhibit translation of <italic>sloth2</italic>, similar to the functions of upstream ORFs (uORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson, 2012</xref>). However, <italic>sloth1</italic> has a non-optimal Kozak sequence 5’ to the start codon (<italic><underline>ACAC</underline>ATG</italic>) and <italic>sloth2</italic> has an optimal Kozak (<italic><underline>CAAA</underline>ATG;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavener, 1987</xref>). Therefore, scanning ribosomes may occasionally fail to initiate translation on <italic>sloth1</italic>, in which case they would continue scanning and initiate translation on <italic>sloth2</italic>, known as ‘leaky scanning’ translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thompson, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To test this translation model, we constructed an expression plasmid with the <italic>Renilla Luciferase</italic> (<italic>RLuc</italic>) reporter gene downstream of <italic>sloth1</italic> (<italic>sloth1-RLuc</italic>), while retaining non-coding elements of the original transcript (5’ UTR, Kozak sequences, 5 bp intervening sequence) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By transfecting this reporter plasmid into <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2<italic>R</italic>+ cells, along with a <italic>Firefly Luciferase</italic> (<italic>FLuc</italic>) control plasmid, we could monitor changes in translation of the downstream ORF by the ratio of RLuc/FLuc luminescence. Using derivatives of the reporter plasmid with Kozak or ATG mutations, we found that translation of the downstream ORF increased when translation of <italic>sloth1</italic> was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Reciprocally, translation of the downstream ORF was decreased when <italic>sloth1</italic> translation was enhanced with an optimal Kozak. These results suggest that <italic>sloth1</italic> inhibits translation of <italic>sloth2</italic>, and that balanced translation of both smORFs from the same transcript might be achieved by suboptimal translation of <italic>sloth1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are essential in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with non-redundant function</title><p>To determine if <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> have important functions in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we used in vivo loss-of-function genetic tools.

Both <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> somatic KO flies had significantly reduced viability compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, escaper adults had short scutellar bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) and frequently appeared sluggish. Importantly, similar phenotypes were observed when targeting either <italic>sloth1</italic> or <italic>sloth2</italic>.</p><p>Next, we further confirmed our loss of function results using CRISPR/Cas9 in the germ line to generate KO lines for <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic>. These reagents are particularly important to test if <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> have redundant function by comparing the phenotypes of single and double null mutants. We generated four KO lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>): (1) a frameshift indel in <italic>sloth1</italic> (<italic>sloth1</italic>-KO), (2) a frameshift indel in <italic>sloth2</italic> (<italic>sloth2</italic>-KO), (3) a 552 bp deletion of the <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> reading frames (dKO), and (4) a knock-in of the reporter gene <italic>Gal4</italic> that removes <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> coding sequences (<italic>Gal4-KI</italic>). Since <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are on the X-chromosome, we analyzed mutant hemizygous male flies. All four mutant lines were hemizygous lethal, which were rescued by a genomic transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), ruling out off-target lethal mutations on the X-chromosome. Like RNAi and somatic KO results, rare mutant adult escaper flies had slower motor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) and short scutellar bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Furthermore, the short scutellar bristle phenotype and slower motor activity was rescued by a genomic transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>).</p><p>The phenotypic similarity of single and double mutants suggests that <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are not functionally redundant. However, since both ORFs are encoded on the same transcript, it is unclear if mutating one ORF will affect the other. For example, a premature stop codon can induce non-sense mediated decay of an entire transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nickless et al., 2017</xref>). To address this possibility, we performed additional fly lethality rescue experiments. First, transheterozygous female flies (<italic>sloth1-KO</italic>/+, <italic>sloth2-KO</italic>/<italic>+</italic>) were viable and had normal scutellar bristles. Second, we created single ORF versions of a genomic rescue transgene – <italic>{Δsloth1-sloth2}</italic> and {<italic>sloth1</italic>-Δ<italic>sloth2</italic>} (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that <italic>sloth1-KO</italic> lethality could only be rescued by {<italic>sloth1</italic>-Δ<italic>sloth2</italic>}, and vice versa, <italic>sloth2-KO</italic> lethality could only rescued by {Δ<italic>sloth1-sloth2</italic>} (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Furthermore, single ORF rescue transgenes were unable to rescue the lethality of <italic>dKO</italic> and <italic>Gal4-KI</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Third, we used the Gal4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) to rescue mutant lethality with ubiquitously expressed cDNA transgenes. These results showed that single ORF KOs could only be rescued by expression of the same ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Similar results were found by expressing cDNAs encoding the human orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). In all, these results show that both <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are essential, have similar loss of function phenotypes, are not functionally redundant with one another, and are likely to retain the same function as their human orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> leads to defective neuronal function and degeneration</title><p>Since loss of <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> caused reduced adult mobility and climbing defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and J</xref>), we speculated that the two peptides normally play an important role in the brain or muscle. To determine where <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> are expressed, we used the <italic>Gal4-KI</italic> line as an in vivo transcriptional reporter. <italic>Gal4-KI</italic> mobility defects and lethality could be rescued by expressing the entire bicistronic transcript (<italic>UAS-sloth1-sloth2;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and L</xref>)<italic>,</italic> or coexpression of both smORFs as cDNA (<italic>UAS-sloth1</italic> and <italic>UAS-sloth2</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).

However, under high frequency stimulation (10 hz), <italic>dKO</italic> NMJs could not sustain a proper response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that there is a defect in maintaining synaptic vesicle pools. Importantly, this phenotype is rescued by a genomic transgene. To test if a similar defect is present in the adults, we assessed phototransduction and synaptic transmission in photoreceptors via electroretinogram (ERG) recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu and Wong, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hardie and Raghu, 2001</xref>). ERGs recorded from young (1–3 days old) <italic>dKO</italic> photoreceptors showed an amplitude similar to that of genomic rescue animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, upon repetitive light stimulation, ERG amplitudes were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting a gradual loss of depolarization. Similar results were observed when young flies were raised in 24 hr dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, ERG traces also showed a progressive loss of ‘on’ and ‘off’ transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), which is indicative of decreased synaptic communication between the photoreceptor and the postsynaptic neurons. ERG phenotypes are rescued by a full-length genomic rescue transgene, but not by single ORF rescue transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

Similar to operons in prokaryotes, it is thought that multicistronic transcripts allow for coordinated expression of proteins in the same pathway or complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karginov et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the similarity of loss-of-function phenotypes between <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> suggest that they function together in the same pathway/complex. Interestingly, 44/196 annotated bicistronic genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> contain two ORFs with homology to each other (Flybase, DIOPT), and a recent study suggests that human bicistronic genes containing a smORF frequently encode physically interacting peptide/protein pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, related peptides encoded on the same transcript may be a prevalent phenomenon in eukaryotes. ORF translation in multicistronic transcripts can occur by different mechanisms, such as re-initiation of translation, IRES, or leaky ribosome scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van Der Kelen et al., 2009</xref>). Our data and observations support leaky scanning, and we propose a model whereby both peptides are translated because <italic>sloth1</italic> contains a non-optimal Kozak sequence.</p><p>The presence of <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> orthologs in many eukaryotic species suggest that their function is likely broadly conserved.

Interestingly, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> only have homologs with similarity to <italic>sloth2</italic>.

We were unable to identify homologs in some eukaryotes such as yeast, although their amino acid sequence may simply be too diverged for detection using bioinformatic programs such as BLAST.</p><p>The physical interactions of Sloth1-Sloth2, Sloth1-RFeSP, and Sloth1-CG10075, and complex III assembly defects in <italic>sloth1/2</italic> loss of function animals, suggest that Sloth1/2 together regulate complex III assembly. Indeed, Sloth1 is bioinformatically predicted to localize to the mitochondrial inner membrane (DeepMito), and Sloth1 and Sloth2 have predicted transmembrane domains (TMHMM 2.0), suggesting they interact with complex III at the inner membrane. This is supported by data showing SMIM4 and C12orf73 are integral membrane proteins in the mitochondrial inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dennerlein et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, our data suggests that Sloth1 and Sloth2 interact in a stoichiometric manner, explaining why single mutants have the same phenotype as double mutants. This is supported by the finding that SMIM4 protein levels are dependent on the presence of C12orf73 and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dennerlein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2022</xref>). Perhaps maintenance of the proper ratio of Sloth1/2 is an important factor for optimal complex III assembly. Future experiments could address whether Sloth1 and Sloth2 directly bind each other, or if they require complex III subunits for physical association.</p><p>Several observations and experiments suggest that Sloth1/2 peptides do not have equivalent function. The two peptides have weak homology to each other (27% identity) and Sloth1 has 18aa (30%) more than Sloth2, suggesting divergence of function. Unlike Sloth1, Sloth2 does not have a clear mitochondrial-targeting signal. Perhaps Sloth2 has a cryptic signal that is not recognized by prediction software, or Sloth2 may be co-imported with Sloth1. Furthermore, we could not detect robust immunoprecipitation of RFeSP or CG10075 using Sloth2 as bait. Perhaps Sloth2 binds complex III indirectly through Sloth1, or Sloth 2 binds a different complex III subunit. More likely is that both Sloth1 and Sloth2 need to be present for binding to complex III, and the endogenous Sloth1 present under conditions of Sloth2-FLAG overexpression is insufficient for co-IP assays. Sloth2 may also be less stable than Sloth1, which could potentially explain why were unable to detect endogenous Sloth1 using anti-Sloth1 antibodies. Interestingly, only strong overexpression of Sloth2, and not Sloth1, was lethal to flies. Future studies may elucidate the mechanism explaining these functional differences in Sloth1/2.</p><p>Neurons have a high metabolic demand and critically depend on ATP generated from mitochondria to support processes such as neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kann and Kovács, 2007</xref>).

In addition, neuronal expression of <italic>sloth1</italic> or <italic>sloth2</italic> was unable to rescue mutant lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Furthermore, we observed <italic>sloth1/2</italic> loss of function phenotypes in dissected adult thoraxes, which are composed of mostly muscle. At present, there are no reported human disease-associated mutations in <italic>SMIM4</italic> and <italic>C12orf73</italic>. Mutations in these genes might not cause disease, or they might cause lethality. It is also possible that the lack of functional information on these genes has hampered identification of disease-associated mutations.</p><p>There is great interest in identifying the complete mitochondrial proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>), so it is remarkable that Sloth1/2 have been largely missed in proteomic or genetic screens for mitochondrial components. For example, they are not present in bioinformatic and proteomic datasets of fly mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sardiello et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), nor in genetic screens of lethal mutations on the X-chromosome affecting nervous system maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that the small size of these peptides lead to this discrepancy; due to less frequent mutations in these ORFs, or fewer tryptic products for MS. It is also possible that these peptides form weak interactions with mitochondrial proteins, preventing their immunoprecipitation. Recently, human SMIM4 was identified in a proteomic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dennerlein et al., 2021</xref>), human C12orf73 was identified in two proteomics screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonicka et al., 2020</xref>) and a bioinformatic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and mouse SMIM4 was identified in a proteomics screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Busch et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our discovery of <italic>sloth1</italic> and <italic>sloth2</italic> highlights the effectiveness of loss of function genetics for identifying smORF genes with important biological functions. Recent technical advances such as genome engineering (e.g. CRISPR/Cas9) and massively parallel profiling have the potential to rapidly assign functions to many uncharacterized smORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). For example, investigation of uncharacterized smORF genes may yield additional important mitochondrial components. Indeed, there is a greater tendency for annotated human smORF peptides to localize to mitochondria (72/719, 10%) compared to the whole proteome (1228/20351, 6%) (UniProt). Interestingly, ~40 smORF peptides function at the human mitochondrial inner membrane (UniProt), such as the Complex III member UQCRQ (82aa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Usui et al., 1990</xref>) and the recently described Mitoregulin/MoxI (56aa) that regulates the electron transport chain and fatty acid β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makarewich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chugunova et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, modulation of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane may be a common function of smORF peptides. As functional annotation of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of smORF genes is becoming easier, many new biological insights are likely to emerge from their analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>Plasmid DNAs were constructed and propagated using standard protocols.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Two neuronal peptides encoded from a single transcript regulate mitochondrial function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the findings presented in your study are potentially very interesting and they appreciate the organismal analyses presented in the manuscript that lead to a clear conclusion on the importance of Sloth1/Sloth2 peptides for neuronal function in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>However, as you will see from the comments appended below they both point to more substantive opportunity for deeper analyses that would result in a better molecular understanding of Sloth1/Sloth2 function, localization and partners. Should you be able to do this and still want to consider <italic>eLife</italic>, we will be happy to consider a fresh submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors discovered two small proteins that are produced from one mRNA and bear sequence similarity to each other. These proteins localize to mitochondria forming a complex, with an important role in respiration and/or ATP production. The study uses <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and based on the sequence and complementation analyses, the peptides are likely functionally conserved. These data contribute to functional understanding of ORFs encoding small peptides or proteins as well as to broadening the knowledge on components involved in physiology of mitochondria, specific for the tissues of extreme energy demand and unique metabolic profile such as neurons.</p><p>The authors provide a nice and complete analysis of animals lacking Sloth1 and Sloth2 on organismal and physiological level. The results demonstrate that these two peptides are essential for mitochondrial function in neurons. Their absence or depletion leads to a significant decrease in performance, degeneration and death. Furthermore, they seem to perform similar function in other organisms, such as human.</p><p>Yet, there are several major concerns that lead to the conclusion that the manuscript could further explore function at the molecular level. Despite very interesting results that clearly identify important players for mitochondrial function in neurons, there is is little or no molecular and biochemical analyses of the described phenotypes. For example, there is no analysis included on how the particular respiratory complexes appear, or more broadly what is wrong with mitochondria in the animals lacking the Sloth complex. For example, the authors could have more conclusively addressed the localization of the Sloth complex as well as its interaction partners.

The endogenous proteins' localization and functions would be a valuable addition.</p><p>1. The title states that Sloth1 and Sloth2 regulate mitochondrial function, however, the provided data only show that mitochondrial respiration is compromised upon loss of the proteins and that ATP levels are decreased. This is not sufficient experimental support to state that the two proteins regulate mitochondrial functions. Unfortunately, many other statements in the text are also overreaching and not supported by experimental data, e.g. the discussion starts with the statement &quot;Here, we have assigned new functions…&quot;, but functional analyses of Sloth1 and Sloth2 are not provided.</p><p>2. Similarly, the &quot;impact statement&quot; declares that Sloth1 and Sloth2 &quot;are ancient paralogues&quot;. However, this is suggested mainly based on sequence similarities (see e.g. the abstract) and should therefore not be claimed as a main finding in the initial impact statement.</p><p>3. The authors use prediction programs to obtain information about the cellular localization of Sloth1 and Sloth2. However, several points in this analysis raise concerns: In figure 6A the results of the predictions programs are stated to be &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;. However, prediction programs compute probabilities, e.g. MitoFates and MitoProtII give a &quot;probability of presequence&quot; or &quot;probability for export to mitochondria&quot;. The authors must therefore have used cut-offs to assign which probability is a yes and no, but these thresholds are not reported in the manuscript. This is problematic as e.g. the MitoProtII prediction score for Sloth1 is only 0.4384, which is low and does not support mitochondrial localization, but the authors nevertheless assigned a &quot;yes&quot; to this program.</p><p>Furthermore, prediction programs can give a hint of a protein's localization, but experimental data to validate these predictions are required. The most reliable program is MitoFates as it was trained on authentic mitochondrial protein N-termini identified in N-proteomic MS analyses. The other programs are often trained on only a handful of model substrates or have other limitations e.g. iPSORT only analyses the first 30 N-terminal amino acids. Given the weak predictions of a mitochondrial localization of Sloth1 and Sloth2, experimental data is required. The experimental approach in the manuscript is microscopy of FLAG-tagged and overexpressed Sloth1 and Sloth2 that co-localizes with ATP5alpha. However, both – overexpression and tagging – often results in protein mislocalization, especially of mitochondrial proteins. Therefore, support for mitochondrial localization of Sloth1 and Sloth2 is missing. Actually, the most convincing data on a possible mitochondrial localization of Sloth2 is the recent publication on its human homologue BRAWNIN (Zhang et al. Nat commun 2020), in which the authentic non-tagged protein is localized to the IM. In contrast Bosch et al. do not provide any data using the non-tagged protein expressed from its endogenous promoter.</p><p>4. Based on CoIP experiments and MS analysis Tim8 and Tim13 are identified as interacting proteins. Unfortunately, the MS data is not provided in the manuscript, which is very unusual. How many other proteins, e.g. from other compartments were identified? It is stated that Tim8 and Tim13 were the only mitochondrial proteins identified in the MS data. This is somehow surprising as the inner mitochondrial membrane is a crowded compartment. e.g. the study by Zhang et al. that characterized the human Sloth2 homologue BRAWNIN (Zhang et al. Nat. commun. 2020) detected an interaction with respiratory chain complex III. The MS data are then further validated by CoIP and immunodecoration. Unfortunately, the analyses are not conclusive. Both interacting partners are tagged and therefore likely overexpressed. Input and elution fractions are not shown in the same panel, which makes assessment of efficiency not possible and control proteins are missing in the elution. The localization of Sloth1 and Sloth2 to mitochondria and the interaction with mitochondrial proteins is therefore not convincing and requires data from un-tagged proteins, exact localization studies (as performed in Zhang et al., a prediction by DeepMito is not sufficient to deduce IM localization) and well-controlled interactome studies.</p><p>5. Secretion of Sloth2 should have been controlled with brefeldin A, which inhibits bona fide secretion (overexpression of proteins is known to often result in secretion).</p><p>6. The authors imply that a stress response could be triggered and show increased protein levels of the matrix chaperone Hsp60. A mitochondrial loading controls is missing here (Figure 7d), especially as numbers of mitochondria are changing according to microscopy analysis.</p><p>7. At several passages in the text a finding is described with the addition (not shown). I think that all data should be shown, e.g. in the supplemental figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82709.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this work, the authors discovered two small proteins that are produced from one mRNA and bear sequence similarity to each other. These proteins localize to mitochondria forming a complex, with an important role in respiration and/or ATP production. The study uses <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and based on the sequence and complementation analyses, the peptides are likely functionally conserved. These data contribute to functional understanding of ORFs encoding small peptides or proteins as well as to broadening the knowledge on components involved in physiology of mitochondria, specific for the tissues of extreme energy demand and unique metabolic profile such as neurons.</p><p>The authors provide a nice and complete analysis of animals lacking Sloth1 and Sloth2 on organismal and physiological level. The results demonstrate that these two peptides are essential for mitochondrial function in neurons. Their absence or depletion leads to a significant decrease in performance, degeneration and death. Furthermore, they seem to perform similar function in other organisms, such as human.</p><p>Yet, there are several major concerns that lead to the conclusion that the manuscript could further explore function at the molecular level. Despite very interesting results that clearly identify important players for mitochondrial function in neurons, there is is little or no molecular and biochemical analyses of the described phenotypes. For example, there is no analysis included on how the particular respiratory complexes appear, or more broadly what is wrong with mitochondria in the animals lacking the Sloth complex. For example, the authors could have more conclusively addressed the localization of the Sloth complex as well as its interaction partners. In summary, despite very promissing data, the current work falls short of presenting insights to the molecular role the Sloth complex in mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors want to thank Reviewer #1 for the compliments and helpful comments. We included new data in the manuscript that specifically addresses the concerns.</p><p>1. To gain more evidence supporting Sloth1/2 localization to mitochondria, we performed cell fractionation assays in cultured S2R+ cells (Figure 6 and Sup. Figure 8), in which whole cell lysates (WCL) were separated into cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions. We showed that transfected tagged Sloth1 and Sloth2 (Sloth1-FLAG, Sloth2-FLAG, Sloth1-SBP, Sloth2-SBP) are enriched in the mitochondria fractions. Similarly, transfected untagged Sloth1 and Sloth2 are enriched in mitochondrial fractions, detected using anti-Sloth1 and anti-Sloth2 antibodies that are described in this revision. Finally, in mitochondrial fractions isolated from whole 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae or adult thorax muscle, we show that endogenous Sloth1 is detected as 10-15kDa band, based on its absence in sloth1/2 loss of function samples.</p><p>2. To test if <italic>sloth1/2</italic> loss function animals have defects in respiratory complex function, we visualized native respiratory complexes using BN-PAGE, or denatured respiratory complex subunits by SDS-PAGE, in adult thorax muscle and whole 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae (Figure 8). In both experiments, complex III assembly is disrupted by Sloth1/2 loss of function.</p><p>3. To address the issue of Sloth1/2 interaction partners, we performed new co-IP experiments (Figure 8). Sloth1 physically interacts with two complex III subunits, CG10075 (fly UQCC1) and RFeSP (fly UQCRFS1). In addition, we showed in our first submission that Sloth1 physically interacts with Sloth2. Together, these data suggest Sloth1 and Sloth2 bind to complex III, with Sloth2 perhaps binding indirectly via Sloth1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Bosch et al. describe the identification of two smORFs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Sloth1 and Sloth2, that are encoded on the same transcript.

We apologize for not reporting score cut-offs, as well as the mistake with the MitoProtII Sloth1 prediction score. To address these issues, we (1) deleted Figure panel 6A and instead report the prediction results in the main text. (2) Only give the results using MitoFates and DeepMito (no mitochondrial targeting results using TargetP, DeepLoc, PSORT, Busca, iPSORT, MitoProtII) (3) report the program scores. Now, for Sloth1, Sloth2, SMIM4, and C12orf73, only SMIM4 scores as mitochondrial using MitoFates (score.842) and only Sloth1 and SMIM4 score as mitochondrial inner membrane using DeepMito (.93 and.73). See revised text from Results section:</p><p>“SMIM4 has a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence using MitoFates (FUKASAWA et al. 2015) (0.842), but C12orf73, Sloth1, and Sloth2 do not (.0016, 0.016, 0.009, respectively). In addition, SMIM4 and Sloth1 are predicted to localize to the mitochondrial inner membrane using DeepMito (0.93 and 0.73, respectively), but C12orf73 and Sloth2 are not (0.66 and 0.49, respectively) (SAVOJARDO et al. 2020).”</p><p>To address Reviewer #2’s concern about limited experimental evidence for Sloth1 and Sloth2 mitochondrial localization, we performed additional experiments to show that overexpressed tagged and untagged forms of Sloth1 and Sloth2 in cultured S2R+ cells are enriched in mitochondrial fractions (Figure 6 and Supplemental Figure 8) (also see above response to Reviewer #1). While we were also able to detect endogenous Sloth1 in mitochondrial fractions from larvae and adult thoraxes by western blot (also see above response to Reviewer #1), we failed to obtain similar results for endogenous Sloth2. In addition, antibody staining of neuronal tissue using anti-Sloth1 and anti-Sloth2 did not yield positive results (Supplemental Figure 7). The anti-Sloth1 and anti-Sloth2 antibodies were raised in rabbits, where two different antigenic peptides for Sloth1 were used to immunize two different rabbits, and two different antigenic peptides for Sloth2 were used to immunize two different rabbits (a total of four antibodies tested). Our negative results may be due to the antibodies being poor quality or perhaps the Sloth1 and Sloth2 peptides are inherently difficult to detect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In the current revision, we have removed experiments involving MS data completely for the following reasons, (1) the large-scale pulldowns were performed on whole cell lysates as opposed to isolated mitochondria, perhaps increasing background and causing false negatives. The large-scale pulldowns were performed on whole cell lysates because this experiment was conducted before we suspected the peptides localized to mitochondria. (2) Two recent studies in human cell culture reported that SMIM4 and C12orf73 interact with complex III in mitochondria. Therefore, we directly tested for physical interaction of Sloth1 and Sloth2 with fly complex III subunits (Figure 8), which revealed that Sloth1 interacts with CG10075 (fly UQCC1) and RFeSP (fly UQCRFS1) (see also above response to Reviewer #1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Low-level ubiquitous overexpression (using da-Gal4) of either sloth1 or sloth2 had no effect on fly viability or bristle length (Figure 2L, not shown). To increase expression levels, we used the strong ubiquitous driver tub-Gal4. Whereas tub&gt;sloth1 flies were viable (Figure 8G) and had normal bristle length (not shown), tub&gt;sloth2 flies were 100% pupal lethal (Figure 8G). However, raising tub&gt;sloth2 flies at 18°C, which decreases Gal4/UAS expression, produced escaper adults that had short scutellar bristles (not shown), reminiscent of loss of function of either sloth1 or sloth2 (Figure 2K). Hence, an imbalance in complex stoichiometry caused by overexpression of one member of the complex disrupts complex function, and this can sometimes be corrected by coexpression of other members of the complex (CLARK-ADAMS et al. 1988).
