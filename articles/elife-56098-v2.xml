predominant mucosal antibody, which binds pathogens and commensal microbes. SIgA is a polymeric antibody, typically containing two copies of IgA that assemble with one joining-chain (JC) to form dimeric (d) IgA that is bound by the polymeric Ig-receptor ectodomain, called secretory component (SC). Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of murine SIgA and dIgA. Structures reveal two IgAs conjoined through four heavy-chain tailpieces and the JC that together form a β-sandwich-like fold. The two IgAs are bent and tilted with respect to each other, forming distinct concave and convex surfaces. In SIgA, SC is bound to one face, asymmetrically contacting both IgAs and JC. The bent and tilted arrangement of complex components limits the possible positions of both sets of antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) and preserves steric accessibility to receptor-binding sites, likely influencing antigen binding and effector functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>secretory immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>cryo electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005302</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar Bharathkar</surname><given-names>Sonya</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Benjamin W</given-names></name><name><surname>Stadtmueller</surname><given-names>Beth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-GM10460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haloi</surname><given-names>Nandan</given-names></name><name><surname>Tajkhorshid</surname><given-names>Emad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI041239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huey-Tubman</surname><given-names>Kathryn E</given-names></name><name><surname>Stadtmueller</surname><given-names>Beth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structures of secretory and dimeric IgA reveal pseudosymmetric assemblies of two antibody monomers, in which possible positions of antigen-binding fragments and accessibility to receptor-binding sites are limited.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate mucosa is a vast extracellular environment that mediates host interactions with a broad range of antigens including toxins, pathogens, and commensal organisms. The diversity of these antigens, some of which are beneficial to the host and some of which are harmful, has driven complex evolutionary interplay between mucosal immune system molecules and mucosal antigens, resulting in antibodies with novel structural and functional mechanisms compared to circulatory counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flajnik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaetzel, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Secretory (S) Immunoglobin (Ig) A is the predominant, mammalian mucosal antibody; it is a polymeric antibody assembled in plasma cells that link two IgA monomers and a single copy of the joining chain (JC) to form dimeric (d) IgA (and to a lesser extent, higher order polymers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woof and Russell, 2011</xref>). Following secretion in the lamina propria, dIgA is bound by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR), a transcytotic Fc receptor (FcR) expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. The pIgR uses five Ig-like domains (D1-D5) and a cytoplasmic tail to bind and transcytose JC-containing antibodies to the apical surface of epithelial cells; there, the pIgR ectodomain, called secretory component (SC), is proteolytically cleaved, releasing the SC-dIgA complex into the mucosa where it is called SIgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stadtmueller et al., 2016a</xref>). In the mucosa, SIgA functions are thought to be dominated by physical mechanisms including coating, cross-linking, agglutination, and enchained growth of mucosal antigens; outcomes are diverse and, typically, not associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woof and Russell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pabst and Slack, 2020</xref>). For example, SIgA-dependent enchained growth of Salmonella promotes its clearance from the gut, whereas SIgA-interactions with <italic>B. fragilis</italic> can promote its colonization of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donaldson et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, colostrum SIgA can provide passive immunity to newborns and has been shown to have a life-long influence on microbiome composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rogier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SIgA delivery to the mucosa.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting unliganded pIgR binding to dIgA from the lamina propria on the basolateral surface of an epithelial cell followed by transcytosis to the apical membrane and SIgA release into the mucosa.

Similar to other antibody classes, the IgA monomer is made up of two copies of the heavy chain and two copies of the light chain, each with variable and constant domains. Together, these chains form two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs), each containing variable domains with complementary determining regions (CDRs) that facilitate binding to a large repertoire of antigens. In contrast to monomeric IgA, SIgA is an antibody dimer and has four Fabs that are presumed to enhance binding avidity and antigen cross-linking potential when compared to antibodies with two Fabs; yet, a mechanistic understanding of how SIgA engages antigens remains a topic of investigation. IgA Fabs connect to the antibody Fc, which is made up of two copies of the IgA constant heavy chain domains, C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The IgA C<sub>H</sub>3 contains a C-terminal extension called the tailpiece (Tp), which along with the JC, is required for IgA dimerization and subsequent pIgR binding. The Fc regions of dIgA provide binding sites for SC as well other host and microbial FcRs; however, the conformations of the dIgA Fc and pIgR domains have remained elusive along with the structures of the Tps and JC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stadtmueller et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>To investigate SIgA structure and how it supports diverse mucosal functions, we targeted structures of SIgA from the mouse, which has been long been used as a model organism for immunological research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Masopust et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike humans, which have two IgA heavy chain isotypes, IgA1 and IgA2 (and two IgA2 allotypes IgA2m1 and IgA2m2) mice express a single IgA heavy chain that shares 79–80% sequence similarity and 66% sequence identity with human variants among the C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3 domains; the sequences of mouse SC and JC also share a high degree of sequence similarity with human counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, we co-expressed a mouse monoclonal IgA with mouse JC and SC in transiently transfected mammalian cells, which resulted in monodisperse SIgA (see Materials and methods). Using cryoelectron microscopy (CryoEM), we determined a ~ 3.3 Å resolution structure of SIgA, which revealed a pseudosymmetric arrangement of the two IgA Fcs, bound asymmetrically to JC and SC. Comparisons with a ~ 3.3 Å resolution cryoEM structure of dIgA, revealed a dominant role for JC in maintaining the conformation of the dimer interface and geometric relationship between the two IgA Fcs. Finally, we modeled plausible positions that could be adopted by SIgA Fabs. Together, results suggest that the pseudosymmetric arrangement of SIgA core components will constrain the positions of the Fabs and influence binding of host and microbial factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The structure of SIgA</title><p>We determined the CryoEM structure of mouse SIgA to a final average resolution of 3.3 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Local map resolution was variable, revealing side chain density for many residues, particularly at the interfaces between complex components and domains; however, some regions at the periphery of the complex were not well resolved, likely due to inherent flexibility. Local resolution was lowest for Fabs, which are mostly disordered and were not built. Additionally, sidechains were not well-resolved for the majority of residues in SC D2 and some residues in the C<sub>H</sub>2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The refined structure revealed a pseudosymmetric assembly of two IgA monomers conjoined at the center by the JC and bound by SC. The C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3 domains in both Fcs aligned with the published monomeric IgA Fc structure lacking the Tp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herr et al., 2003</xref>) (not shown); however, despite shared sequences, the four IgA heavy chains formed structurally unique contacts with the JC and SC. To distinguish these differences, we designated a unique ID for each heavy chain: A, B, C, or D, which we also use to describe corresponding C<sub>H</sub> domains and Fcs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The Fc<sub>AB</sub> and Fc<sub>CD</sub> are bent and tilted with respect to each other, resulting in distinct concave and convex surfaces on the complex. To describe the conformation, we defined the angle between the centroid axes of Fc<sub>AB</sub> and Fc<sub>CD</sub> (97 degrees) as ‘bend’, and the angle between the two non-intersecting centroid planes of Fc<sub>AB</sub> and Fc<sub>CD</sub> (30 degrees) as ‘tilt’. SC asymmetrically contacts the same face of both Fc<sub>AB</sub> and Fc<sub>CD</sub> along what we define as the ‘front face’ of the molecule. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) are distributed throughout the complex; the seven, PNGS located on SC, are clustered on the front face of SIgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The map revealed well-ordered carbohydrates at a subset of these sites, which were modeled in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SIgA structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representing ordered domains in the SIgA structure.

Additional stability is provided by Tp<sub>A</sub> and Tp<sub>C</sub> ultimate tyrosine residues (Try467), which in addition to binding JC<sub>core</sub> residues form contacts with C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>C</sub>, and SC D1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Tp<sub>B</sub> and Tp<sub>D</sub> form β-sheet interactions with Tp<sub>A</sub> and Tp<sub>C,</sub> respectively, but in contrast to Tp<sub>A</sub> and Tp<sub>C</sub>, form limited interactions between their C-terminal residues and other complex components. For example, although Tp<sub>D</sub> Cys466 is visible in the cryoEM map, we fail to find evidence that Tp<sub>B</sub> or Tp<sub>D</sub> Cys466 are involved in disulfide bonds and the seven C-terminal residues of Tp<sub>B</sub> are disordered. Notably, however, Tp<sub>D</sub> Tyr467 is positioned to contact two arginine residues in the JC<sub>core</sub> as well as conserved residues in SC D1, signifying another type of conserved interaction for the Tp ultimate tyrosine residues that complements those observed for Tp<sub>A</sub> and Tp<sub>C</sub> Try467 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>The two JC wings, JC<sub>W1</sub> and JC<sub>W2</sub>, represent a second set of unique interactions that help to lock the two IgA Fc monomers together. JC<sub>W1</sub> and JC<sub>W2</sub> are unique in sequence yet both form antiparallel β-sheets, enclosed on the N- and C-terminal ends by intra-JC disulfide bonds. JC<sub>W1</sub> is composed primarily of hydrophobic and acidic residues and uses hydrophobic interactions to bind the front face of C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>C</sub>, whereas acidic residues in JC<sub>W1</sub> mediate interactions with SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). JC<sub>W2</sub> is five residues longer than JC<sub>W1</sub> and shares a larger, more chemically diverse interface with the back face of C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>A</sub>, involving several electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, although residues forming the interface between each JC wing and its respective C<sub>H</sub>3 domain differ, both wings bind a similar location on C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>B</sub>, illustrating a mechanism by which a single JC can bind two identical antibodies uniquely.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Secretory component</title><p>SC, the pIgR ectodomain, has five domains, D1-D5, each having an Ig-like fold with loops structurally similar to antibody CDRs.

The D1 CDR1 appears to play a key role binding JC, primarily through a conserved Try-Pro-Asp motif located in the JC C-terminal loop following JC<sub>W2</sub>. This interaction is dominated by D1 CDR1 Arg31 and His32, which hydrogen bond to JC Asp137 thereby linking D1 to the C-terminus of JC. An additional contact, between D1 Asn30 and JC 106Arg, appears to link D1 to the loop connecting JC<sub>W1</sub> and JC<sub>W2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

D2 does not contact dIgA directly; instead, the D1-D2 linker is extended, positioning D2 at the outer edge of the front face where it shares a minimal, ~250 Å<sup>2</sup>, interface with D3. The map surrounding D2 is poorly ordered suggesting that the position of D2 is flexible to the extent allowed by the linkers between D1-D2 and D2-D3. Together with D2, D3-D4-D5 adopt a near-linear arrangement, or arm, that is bent approximately 48 degrees relative to D1, positioning D4-D5 to contact the Fc<sub>CD</sub> front face and the JC<sub>W1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This conformation is stabilized by a 324 Å<sup>2</sup> interface between D1 and D3, involving conserved hydrophobic residues from both domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The interface appears to function as a keystone in a D1-D3-D4-D5 bridge connecting Fc<sub>AB</sub> and Fc<sub>CD</sub> and contrasts with SC’s unliganded structure, in which D1 and D3 do not share an interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although D3 does not contact either of the Fcs or the JC, its position is further stabilized by a 646 Å<sup>2</sup> interface with D4 (distinct from the D3-D4 interface in the closed conformation) and several D3-D4 linker residues that are positioned to contact JC<sub>W1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). D4 and D5 share a similar interface in both unliganded SC and SIgA; however, the domains are repositioned relative to other domains such that residues in D4 and D5 that contact D1 in SC’s unliganded conformation, are solvent exposed. Together, D4-D5 engage the front face of Fc<sub>CD</sub> through a patch of residues that surround C<sub>H</sub>2<sub>C</sub> Cys306 and the tip of JC<sub>W1</sub>. The interface is dominated by residues in D5 CDR1, including Cys470, which disulfide bonds to C<sub>H</sub>2<sub>C</sub> Cys306, covalently linking SC to the antibody, as well as D5 CDR1 Lys471 and Tyr473, which form hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with C<sub>H</sub>2<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Additional stability at this interface is provided by a handful basic residues located in D5 and linkers connecting D3-D4 and D4-D5, which form electrostatic interactions with acidic residues in JC<sub>W1</sub> and effectively sandwich JC<sub>w1</sub> in-between C<sub>H</sub>2<sub>C</sub> and SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Structure of dIgA</title><p>The SIgA structure revealed a bent and tilted relationship between two IgA monomers, which was stabilized in part by a bridge of interactions between SC domains.

The dIgA structure revealed two IgA monomers arranged similar to those in SIgA; Fabs were disordered. The centroid axes of Fc<sub>AB</sub> and Fc<sub>CD</sub> were bent 98 degrees relative to each other (compared to 97 degrees in SIgA), and the centroid planes were tilted at an angle of 19 degrees (compared to 30 degrees in SIgA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These results suggest that the bend in SIgA is conferred by JC binding to heavy chains and/or interactions between the Tps from both antibodies. The 11-degree difference in tilt between the two structures suggests that SC binding can influence the conformational relationship between the two IgAs. Aligned individually, the structures of the heavy chains and JC were largely superimposable with equivalent chains in SIgA; however, differences were apparent in regions that are bound by SC in SIgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Yet, its evolutionary origin, its structure (even its fold), and how it facilitates antibody polymerization remained elusive through decades of research. Our dIgA and SIgA structures resolve some of these uncertainties by revealing the JC fold, how it is integrated with the Tps from four IgA heavy chains, and how it is stabilized by contacts between the JC wings and IgA C<sub>H</sub>3 domains. The structure does not appear to be closely related to proteins or complexes with other functions because our searches of the protein data bank have failed to identify structures with high similarity to the JC or the JC-Tp assembly; although, we cannot rule out the possibility that the unliganded JC might adopt a different conformation with similarity to determined structures. For now, this leaves the JC relationship to other proteins, and structural clues on the JC evolutionary origin, uncertain.</p><p>The molecular contacts observed in the dIgA and SIgA structures reveal, in part, how the JC facilitates antibody polymerization. Central to this mechanism appears to be the JC’s ability to bind each of the four identical heavy chain sequences uniquely, resulting in pseudosymmetric, dimeric antibody. This mechanism may represent an efficient way for the JC to link two antibodies; yet, it also appears likely to influence the function of the final product, SIgA, because our data indicate that JC plays a dominant role in inducing and/or maintaining the bent relationship between the two Fcs, which our modeling suggests can influence Fab positions. Despite these observations, many details of JC-dependent antibody polymerization remain outstanding; in particular, the order of events during which the JC binds two IgA monomers to assembly dIgA is unclear. The process appears likely to involve conformation changes in both the JC and the IgA monomers because in the absence of JC, monomeric IgA (the form typically found in serum) is functionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woof and Russell, 2011</xref>), suggesting that the interactions we observe between Tps from two IgA monomers do not form, or are not stable, without the JC. Similarly, in the absence of contacts with IgA, the conformation of JC we observe in SIgA and dIgA is not likely to be stable, suggesting that the JC’s unliganded structure is unknown. These observations point to a polymerization process that involves conformational changes in the JC and two IgA heavy chains, which promote β-sheet like interactions between Tps and/or Tps and the JC as well as disulfide bond formation between chains. Recent reports also suggest that molecular chaperons are involved in dIgA assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suzuki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>pIgR binding to dIgA</title><p>Following assembly, dIgA binding to the pIgR ectodomain, or SC, is required for SIgA delivery to the mucosa.

The SIgA structure reveals a marked rearrangement of SC domains that positions residues in the D1 CDRs in direct contact with C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>B</sub>, Tp<sub>C</sub>, Tp<sub>D</sub> and JC and positions D5 CDRs in contact with C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>C</sub>. This conformational change is consistent with published double electron-electron resonance (DEER) distance measurements showing a 70 Å separation between nitroxide spin labels attached to SC D1- residue 67 and D5 residue 491 in human SIgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stadtmueller et al., 2016a</xref>); the distance between Cα atoms of equivalent residues in the mouse SIgA structure, D1 Ile67 and D5 His493, is 61 Å. The SC crystal structure and DEER experiments led to a model, in which accessible motifs in D1 contact dIgA in a recognition binding event that triggers a conformational change allowing previously buried D1 motifs and accessible D5 motifs to bind dIgA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stadtmueller et al., 2016a</xref>). Our structure is consistent with this model, revealing that conserved D1 residues Arg31, His32, Arg34, Thr48 and Tyr 55, which bind D4 or D5 in unliganded SC, mediate interactions with C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>B</sub> and JC. It is yet unclear which residues mediate the recognition binding event; however, one possibility is that SC D1-CDR3 residues, which are exposed in unliganded SC, form the initial contacts with the tailpieces (Tp<sub>C</sub> and Tp<sub>D</sub>) and C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>B,</sub> which are exposed in dIgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

D2 is absent from this bridge, and does not appear to contact the heavy chains or JC, suggesting that despite its reported contribution to dIgA-binding kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stadtmueller et al., 2016a</xref>), its role is indirect. The distal location of D2 in the SIgA structure is also consistent with a model in which SC from birds, reptiles and amphibians, which are lacking the D2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stadtmueller et al., 2016b</xref>), would bind analogous to D1-D3-D4-D5 in our SIgA structure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The functional significance of SC</title><p>Although the pIgR plays a critical role in delivering SIgA to mucosal secretions, functionally, why its ectodomain (SC) remains attached to SIgA is less clear.

SC has been reported to protect SIgA from degradation and to play a role in binding to host and bacterial factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaetzel, 2005</xref>). Indeed, our structure reveals SC forming extensive interfaces with the heavy chains and the JC where it may protect areas especially vulnerable to proteolysis; however, roughly 16% of the SIgA core (not including Fabs) is occluded by SC, leaving the majority of the molecule exposed. Being located on one face of the molecule, SC exhibits significant accessible surface area (in excess of 25,000 Å<sup>2</sup>) leaving it well-positioned to interact with host or microbial factors. D2 is particularly accessible, being located distal from SIgA’s center and exhibiting evidence of flexibility. It also includes four of the seven PNGS which could facilitate carbohydrate-mediated binding events, although the number of PNGS on each SC domain is variable among species.

Consistent with these observations, comparison of our mouse SIgA with structures of dimeric forms of the human SIgA1 core (no Fabs), reported in the same timeframe as this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) revealed largely superimposable structures with some variability in contacts between complex components (not shown). The modeled positions of SC D2 are variable among structures, likely due to inherent flexibility in the domain’s position, however, the structures have similar angles of bend (99 degrees in human SIgA and 97 degrees in mouse SIgA) and tilt (31 degrees in human SIgA and to 30 degrees tilt in mouse SIgA). Although additional studies will be needed to determine if and how sequence variability in SIgA components might uniquely influence SIgA assembly and functions, the similarities we observe suggest that the core Fc region of SIgA variants found in mammalian mucosa adopt largely conserved structures characterized by limited conformational flexibility, which our modeling suggests will constrain the positions that Fabs can occupy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>SIgA functions</title><p>Our data provide a broad range of structural findings, addressing long-outstanding questions regarding the structure of the IgA Tps, the JC and SC, yet how the structure supports SIgA’s divergent roles in pathogen clearance and microbial homeostasis remains an open topic of investigation. In the mucosa, SIgA encounters a broad range of binding partners and antigens. Besides pIgR, a number of FcR are known to interact with IgA, including pathogen receptors such as SSL7, Arp4 or Sir22, and host receptors such as FcαR1, although FcαR1 is absent from the mouse genome. IgA FcRs typically bind a canonical site located near C<sub>H</sub>2-C<sub>H</sub>3 elbow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramsland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kazeeva and Shevelev, 2009</xref>). In the SIgA and dIgA structures, two of the four accessible sites are occluded by JC wing interactions with C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>C</sub>. This leaves two sites, on C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>B</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>3<sub>D</sub>, accessible for FcR binding. Notably, these sites are located on the convex edge of the complex, which our computational modeling predicts, is never occluded by Fabs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This arrangement would provide an unobstructed approach for FcRs to bind SIgA, which in the context of host cell receptors would promote favorable outcomes. On the other hand, it could leave SIgA especially vulnerable to pathogen FcRs, the binding of which might lead to Fab cleavage or other outcomes that would be detrimental to the host. We also anticipate that the bent and tilted relationship between the two IgAs, and predicted directionality of the two sets of Fabs, would influence how SIgA engages antigen. In the context of endogenous mammalian antibodies, unique properties of different C<sub>H</sub>2 -C<sub>H</sub>1 linkers and stabilizing interactions between the heavy chains and light chains are likely to further dictate Fab positions; however, perhaps both sets of Fabs being directed toward the concave side would stabilize binding to flexible antigens, to carbohydrates, or perhaps influence the strength of antigen crosslinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Other</td><td>IGHA_MOUSE</td><td>UniProtKB <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004426">SCR_004426</ext-link></td><td>UniProtKB: P01878</td><td>Amino acid sequence of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> IgA heavy chain constant regions</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>LAC1_MOUSE</td><td>UniProtKB <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004426">SCR_004426</ext-link></td><td>UniProtKB: P01843</td><td>Amino acid sequence of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> lambda-1 light chain constant region</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>IGJ_MOUSE</td><td>UniProtKB <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004426">SCR_004426</ext-link></td><td>UniProtKB: P01592</td><td>Amino acid sequence of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> joining chain</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>PIGR_MOUSE</td><td>UniProtKB <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004426">SCR_004426</ext-link></td><td>UniProtKB: O70570</td><td>Amino acid sequence of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> polymeric Ig Receptor</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>STA121</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moor et al., 2017</xref></td><td/><td>Variable region of human IgA2 antibody STA121</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK Expi293F</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008452">SCR_008452</ext-link></td><td>Cat#: A14635 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_D615">CVCL_D615</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pD2610-v1</td><td>ATUM</td><td>Cat#: pD2610-v1-03</td><td>Mammalian expression plasmid</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>STA121 IgA Heavy chain (HC) in pD2610v1</td><td>Materials and methods of this paper</td><td/><td>Construct encoding STA121 heavy chain (HC) variable region fused to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> IgA HC constant domains</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>STA121 IgA light chain (LC) lambda in pD2610v1</td><td>Materials and methods of this paper</td><td/><td>Construct encoding STA121 light chain (LC) variable region fused to <italic>Mus musculus</italic> lambda LC constant domain</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct <break/>(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Mouse Secretory component (SC) in pD2610v1</td><td>Materials and methods of this paper</td><td/><td>Construct encoding residues 1–567 of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> pIgR (a.k.a. secretory component;

The resulting ‘combined map’ was used for initial model building (described below); however, rebuilding and refinement utilized the cryoSparc processing pipeline, which is designated as the primary data in the EMDB.</p><p>CryoSparc Live beta was used for the initial processing of the data - movies were motion corrected, binned by 2, and CTF estimation was performed. Particles were initially picked by blob picker with minimum and maximum particle diameter of 100 Å and 120 Å, respectively. Streaming 2D classification was used to generate initial 2D references, which were then used as templates for particle picking. After completion of the collection session, images were screened by limiting total motion to 100 px or less and CTF fit estimation to 10 Å or better, resulting in 1167 selected images or 956,981 picked particles. Particles were exported into cryoSparc for further processing. They were 2D classified into 100 classes and the best classes were selected (623,071 particles). A smaller subset of only large views was also selected (123,533) and four <italic>ab-initio</italic> structures were generated. The best structure (79,904 particles) was refined against the 123,533 particle set to 3.6 Å resolution. The volume was low pass filtered to 60 and both the 3.6 Å map and the filtered volume were used in heterogeneous refinement with the all good particles from 2D classification. The two classes generated a 4.4 Å structure with 368,541 particles and a noise class at 9 Å with 254,530 particles. Good class was refined to 3.4 Å using non-uniform refinement job type. The particles were then used in heterogeneous refinement job type using the output of non-uniform refinement as two input volumes. Once again, one of the classes reached 4.2 Å resolution with 229,252 particles and the other class served as a trap for bad particles (7.22 Å with 139,289 particles). The good particle set was refined using homogeneous refinement job type to 3.5 Å and 3.2 Å with non-uniform refinement.</p><p>At the same time, all the movies were motion corrected, binned by 2, and dose-weighted in Relion v.3. CTFs were estimated with CTFFind4 (v. 4.1.13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). Images were screened for ice thickness, contamination, and CTF fits, resulting in 1266 remaining images. Particles were auto-picked with LoG picker in Relion 3 (minimum and maximum diameters of 60 and 180 Å respectively). Approximately 1.4 million particles were extracted, binned four times, and subjected to several rounds of 2D classification. At each step, good classes were selected, and remaining particles were classified again with a smaller mask diameter. Selected particles (310,626) were merged into a single file and re-extracted with 2X binning and further underwent 2D classification. Remaining 184,737 particles were used in a 3D refinement (using an initial model generated in a parallel cryoSparc processing pipeline). After the refinement, particles were re-extracted at full pixel size and refined. After this initial refinement, the particles underwent Bayesian polishing and per-particle-CTF estimation. Particles were once again refined and the map was post-processed and B-factor sharpened, resulting in the final average resolution of 3.7 Å at FSC = 0.143.</p><p>For the dIgA, 2951 movies were initially collected using beam-image shift across nine holes in a 3 × 3 pattern. All the processing steps were done in cryoSparc v.2. Movies were imported, motion corrected, and CTFs were estimated. Exposures were then curated to remove bad micrographs, resulting in 2258 remaining images. Particles were picked based on five templates generated from a 4.5 Å structure generated from an earlier, smaller dataset. Particles (1.81 million) were extracted and binned 4X for an initial round of 2D classification. All classes showing secondary structure were selected (688,183). Remaining particles were 2D classified with a smaller circular mask, to try and capture projections along the length of the particle. This round of classification was repeated twice, resulting in additional 168,530 and 59,876 particles. The initial particle subset was used to generate six <italic>ab-initio</italic> structures and then processed with heterogeneous refinement with three classes. The best class was combined with the remaining two subsets and another round of heterogeneous refinement was performed. 462,707 particles belonging to the good class were re-extracted at full pixel size and another round of heterogeneous refinement with three classes was performed. Resulting set of 288,823 particles were refined (Legacy). The particle stack was then split into nine groups based on the pattern of collection. Per-particle CTF refinement, beam tilt, trefoil, and spherical aberration corrections were performed for each group. A final round of homogeneous refinement was performed, resulting in the final overall resolution of 3.3 Å at FSC = 0.143.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Structure building, refinement, and validation</title><p>Starting models for SIgA structure determination were made using SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>).

Domain positions were refined as rigid bodies using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2018b</xref>). Inspection of the map and preliminary SIgA model fit, revealed numerous loops that fit density poorly as well as unaccounted for density at the center of the molecule (Tp and JC). Poorly fitting loops were manually re-built into density using the Coot Molecular Graphics Package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>), along with preliminary placement of a subset of JC and Tp residues.

Briefly, the unrefined starting model and combined map, including data from Relion and Cryosparc processing pipelines, were used to build 2913 Rosetta-modified structures using Rosetta 2019.35.60890, running on a 64 CPU server. All 2913 structures were scored based on geometry (determined by MolProbity score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Williams et al., 2018</xref>]) and fit, which was approximated with a Rosetta-determined Fourier-shell correlation (FSC) between the structure’s calculated map and the experimental density map. We scored each structure by dividing the FSC by the MolProbity score; the four highest-scoring structures were compared to the unrefined SIgA structure and the experimental map. Subsequent iterations of this process were used to rebuild portions of the C<sub>H</sub>2 and C<sub>H</sub>3 domains, during which the Phenix phenix.map_model_cc was used to determine model fit to density. The map surrounding SC D2 was poorly ordered and contained extra density likely representing an ensemble of D2 positions and/or partially ordered carbohydrates attached to the four PNGS on D2. We positioned the domain with the best average fit to the density using distance constraints of the linkers connecting it to D1 and D3. The resulting structure was rebuilt by hand and refined against the map from the cryoSparc processing pipeline using Coot and Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2018b</xref>).

To visualize the difference between SIgA and dIgA, structures were aligned on JC Cα atoms, which have a RMSD of 0.891. Figures were made using the Pymol Molecular Graphics System (Schrodinger LLC), UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>) and Inkscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://inkscape.org/">https://inkscape.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Computational search for potential Fab positions</title><p>The pdbs files used in Fab modeling were generated using the template mode of SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) with reference PDB file 4EOW chain A and chain B and the STA121 C<sub>H</sub>1-V<sub>H</sub>1 and C<sub>L</sub>1-V<sub>L</sub>1 sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moor et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. In order to evenly sample all the potential positions, each Fab was rotated such that the center of mass (C.O.M) of the CDR was arranged on a Fibonacci spherical lattice (FSL) of one thousand points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marques et al., 2013</xref>). During the rotation, the N-terminal residue in the C<sub>H</sub>2 domain (pivot) was set to be in the center of the FSL. Each of 1000 generated orientations was further rotated along the axis spanning from the pivot to the CDR, with an interval of γ = 45°. In total, 8000 structures were generated for each Fab. Any position in which two or more Fab amino acids had a clash was removed from the data set. Clashes were defined if more than 8 atoms of Fab (except the linker) were within 1 Å of any atom of the Fc, JC and SC domains of SIgA. A minimum of 8 atoms was chosen to define a clash because one amino acid has on average eight heavy atoms. The linker region of the Fab was not considered for the clash calculation because we assumed that the linker is flexible. The number of positions sampled by Fab CDRs were quantified by measuring ϕ, defined to be the angle between the Fab vector and the y-axis, a vector parallel to the Fc<sub>AB</sub> plane and passing through the center of mass of Fc and JC. Figure were made using VMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Pamela Bjorkman and members of the Bjorkman lab at Caltech for supporting preliminary work related to this study as well as Jost Vielmetter and the Caltech Protein Expression Center (housed and funded in part by the Caltech Beckman Institute) for guidance on IgA protein expression strategies.

Your article has been reviewed favorably by two peer reviewers, including Sjors HW Scheres as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martin F Flajnik (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, most of the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation. Note, however, that one of the points made below (7) concerns a suggestion that additional refinement be done on the structures. Hopefully this can be done quickly under the present circumstances. If not, please explain why when submitting the revised manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes structures of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) and its dimeric form. The field has waited a long time for the structure of these complexes. The senior author of this paper has examined interaction of pIgR with Igs previously, and now has the hard data to probe existing models. The paper is straightforward, providing important data on how the secretory component and the J chain modify the IgA Fc structure, which in turn answers most of the questions that have dogged the field for many years. No new experiments are suggested, but some features should be discussed better, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has always been mysterious 'where the J chain came from.' Are there indications from the structure as to homologies that might have been missed because of low sequence similarity to J chain relatives?</p><p>2) The J chain is very acidic; specialized types of gels must be run so that the J chain is separated from Ig light chains (13 kd vs. 25 kd, respectively), as the high acidic nature of the J chain is thought to repel SDS on conventional gels. Why is it so acidic-does it make many ionic bonds?</p><p>3) Bony fish have lost the J chain in evolution, but still have a pIgR transporter with D1/D5. Any ideas of how teleost IgM can interact with teleost pIgR for transport without J chain? The senior author has commented on this in one of her previous papers, but now may have better ideas.</p><p>4) Any idea how monomeric IgA could &quot;work&quot; now that we have the complete dimeric structure? Mice only have one IgA gene, so how would (could) it function without the J chain. Also in humans, one of the two IgA genes seems to preferentially associate with the J chain. Any ideas on this topic now that we know the structure of the mouse dimeric IgA?</p><p>5) Perhaps the authors could briefly comment on how this work confirms or is different from the two recent reports in Science on the same/similar topic.</p><p>6) Much of the text, but especially the Results section, is written in a very dry and descriptive manner, which makes it hard to follow. Perhaps the authors could remove some of the detailed mentions of structural features and to describe their results in a more accessible manner. For example, instead of mentioning lots of individual contacts with their detailed residue numbers, the authors could try to convey to the general reader of <italic>eLife</italic> what these interactions mean.</p><p>7) Atomic modelling has been done in a non-conventional manner. The authors claim this was done to &quot;counter challenges of hand building five chains in a moderate resolution map&quot;. However, at 3.3A and 3.7A that should have been not much of a problem. Anyway, it doesn't really matter how the initial model was generated (the authors used Rosetta), but at these resolutions the final models should be properly refined into the cryo-EM density map. The authors could choose refmac or phenix (without Ramachandran restraints if the authors wish to use these for validation) to easily do so. They should then also present FSC curves between the final model and the cryo-EM map, together with FSC<sub>free</sub> and FSC<sub>work</sub> curves, i.e. FSC model-vs.-map from a model refinement in one of the half-maps against that same half-map and of that same model against the other half-map, to assess overfitting. Also, they should make detailed zoomed-in supplementary figures that clearly illustrate the quality of the atomic model fit and of the cryo-EM fit in different regions of the complex.</p><p>8) The cryo-EM map calculation seems to have been done to an acceptable standard, but some details are missing from the manuscript:</p><p>– Please include pictures of one original micrograph for both structures.</p><p>– How were local resolution estimates in Figures 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 obtained?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56098.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It has always been mysterious 'where the J chain came from.' Are there indications from the structure as to homologies that might have been missed because of low sequence similarity to J chain relatives?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the question of where the J chain (JC) came from is an important, yet outstanding, question. To address this question, we have searched the PDB for proteins and complexes that are structurally similar to the J-chain and/or the J-chain/tailpiece assembly; however, we have not identified strong candidates. We have noted the results of this analysis in the revised Discussion section, in which the second paragraph is now devoted to the JC. We anticipate that future efforts to determine the structure of the unliganded J-chain may reveal an alternative JC conformation (not stabilized by interactions with the IgA heavy chains) and could provide additional insight on the evolution of JC and its relationship to other proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The J chain is very acidic; specialized types of gels must be run so that the J chain is separated from Ig light chains (13 kd vs. 25 kd, respectively), as the high acidic nature of the J chain is thought to repel SDS on conventional gels. Why is it so acidic-does it make many ionic bonds?</p></disp-quote><p>The mouse J chain (JC) sequence has many acidic residues; however, our analysis does not point to a single, defined structural role for the majority of JC acidic residues. We do find that the JC uses acidic residues to bind secretory component (SC) and have noted this more clearly in the revised Results section. Yet, the JC-SC interface is minimal compared to interfaces between JC and IgA heavy chains and JC acidic residues do not appear to dominate these interfaces. JC acidic residues otherwise appear to be broadly distributed on exposed surfaces. The structure of unliganded JC remains unknown and thus, it is possible that acidic residues play some role in stabilizing the unliganded structure and/or contribute to the JC-IgA binding mechanism; yet without additional data, we can only speculate on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Bony fish have lost the J chain in evolution, but still have a pIgR transporter with D1/D5. Any ideas of how teleost IgM can interact with teleost pIgR for transport without J chain? The senior author has commented on this in one of her previous papers, but now may have better ideas.</p></disp-quote><p>Our SIgA structure reveals numerous contacts between the IgA heavy chains and SC D1 and D5, raising the question of whether or not analogous interactions between teleost pIgR (SC) domains and teleost IgM or IgT (a teleost mucosal antibody), might be sufficient for binding in the absence of the JC. This is a fascinating question; however, our structural analysis has not provided a meaningful answer. Teleost pIgR has just two domains with reported homology to mammalian SC D1 and D5; however, D1 and D5 residues involved in contacts with IgA are not well conserved in teleost SC domains (Stadtmueller et al., 2016). Furthermore, in the absence of teleost IgM and/or IgT structures, our ability to predict how teleost D1/D5 might engage its antibody ligands remains limited and beyond what we can reliably discuss in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Any idea how monomeric IgA could &quot;work&quot; now that we have the complete dimeric structure? Mice only have one IgA gene, so how would (could) it function without the J chain. Also in humans, one of the two IgA genes seems to preferentially associate with the J chain. Any ideas on this topic now that we know the structure of the mouse dimeric IgA?</p></disp-quote><p>IgA can also function as a monomer, the form typically found in serum (Woof and Russell, 2011). Our mouse SIgA and dIgA structures reveal beta-sheet interactions between the tailpieces (Tps) from two IgA monomers, interactions that might be able to link two antibodies in the absence of J chain (JC). However, the existence of monomeric IgA in vivo, and our ability to express monomeric mouse IgA in transiently transfected HEK cells in the absence of the JC (data not shown), implies that interactions between Tps from two or more IgA monomers do not occur, or are not stable, in the absence of the JC. One plausible mechanism that might account for this is that the Tps adopt alternative conformations in the absence of JC and/or that JC interactions with the IgA heavy chain induce conformational change(s) that promote beta-sheet like interactions between Tps. Although additional experiments will be needed to test these hypotheses, we have revised the manuscript to include discussion on potential mechanisms of polymeric antibody assembly and how the JC and the IgA Tps may contribute to that process.</p><p>The human genome encodes two IgA isotypes, IgA1 and IgA2 (and two IgA2 allotypes IgA2m1 and IgA2m2), whereas the mouse genome encodes a single IgA. Although the majority monomeric serum IgA is IgA1, all of the human isotypes and allotypes can form polymeric antibodies with JC and the relative abundance of each type differs in each mucosal environment (e.g. nasopharynx, gut, urogenital track, etc.) (Woof and Russell, 2011). As noted in our revised Discussion, sequence conservation and structural similarities among mouse dIgA, SIgA and concurrently reported structures of the Fc region of human SIgA1 (dimeric form) suggest a conserved SIgA core structure in dimeric forms of IgA among mammals. Our analysis reveals a handful of sequence differences in residues likely to be bridging interactions between JC and the IgA heavy chains in mouse and human SIgAs; yet, it is not immediately clear from structural data alone if and how these differences might uniquely affect JC association with specific IgA heavy chains. It is possible that the limited sequence variability found among IgA heavy chains alters the dimeric IgA assembly process in some way; however other factors are likely to influence this process. For example, recent reports indicate that in transiently transfected mammalian cells, the ratio of transfected JC DNA to IgA heavy chain DNA influences the polymeric state of resulting IgAs (Lombana et al., 2019); molecular chaperones have also been recently implicated in IgA assembly (Suzuki, Vogelzang and Fagarasan, 2019, Xiong et al., 2019). Further studies will be needed to define the molecular mechanism of polymerization and to hammer out the roles that the JC and each unique IgA heavy chain sequence play in this process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Perhaps the authors could briefly comment on how this work confirms or is different from the two recent reports in Science on the same/similar topic.</p></disp-quote><p>The preprint of this manuscript (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.951780v1) was posted February 17, 2020, several days after the structures of the Fc regions of human dimeric SIgA1, tetrameric and pentameric SIgA2 were reported as an advanced online publication in Science (and subsequently appeared in the February 28<sup>th</sup> 2020 issue of Science). Given this, we have focused our manuscript on the original work we performed rather than a detailed comparison between our structures and human IgA structures, which we believe is better suited for a review. As noted below, we have included some simple comparisons between the structures for the purpose of discussing conservation of SIgA structures.</p><p>Our work differs from structures reported in Science in several ways:</p><p>1) We report mouse, rather than human SIgA structures. As described in our revised manuscript, for the purpose of discussing conservation of SIgA structure among mammals we have completed a limited comparison of the overall conformation of the mouse SIgA and human dimeric SIgA1 Fc, which reveals largely superimposable structures. We do note differences in some interface residues; however, without additional experiments it is difficult to evaluate the significance of these findings. Together, our observations suggest a conserved conformation at the core of SIgAs released into the mucosa and suggest that with respect to SIgA structure, mouse model systems are relevant to understanding human SIgA structure and functions.</p><p>2) In addition to SIgA, we report the structure of dIgA (lacking secretory component). The dIgA structure reveals that dimeric forms of IgA adopt a conformation characterized by the same angle of bend as observed for SIgA. This points toward dIgA having limited conformational flexibility and to a dominant role for the JC and tailpieces in maintaining the bent conformation of the two IgA Fcs. Furthermore, differences between tilt in dIgA and SIgA and signify that SC can influence the conformation (tilt) of SIgA.</p><p>3) We report modeling which reveals how the conformation of SIgA (bend and tilt) could influence the positions of Fabs and thus, interactions with antigen. These results are an important step toward understanding the mechanisms by which SIgAs can neutralize pathogens and interact with commensal microbes.</p><p>4) Our methods for sample preparation are different than those reported in Science. For example, in contrast to the human SIgA core structures which lacked fabs and reportedly utilized crosslinking reagents to stabilize protein on cryoEM grids, the complexes we used for studies were intact SIgAs (and dIgAs) with Fabs. These complexes were also prepared for cryoEM in the absence of crosslinking reagents. Taken together, it is clear that multiple methods can be successful for structural studies of IgA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Much of the text, but especially the Results section, is written in a very dry and descriptive manner, which makes it hard to follow.

We have re-written the Introduction and Results sections in an effort to make the information more accessible to a broad audience. These modifications include minimal changes to main text Figures 3 and 4. We have also modified Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to show a more detailed sequence alignment and report similarity and identity between human and mouse SIgA component sequences. We have also added Figure 2—figure supplement 4, showing the locations of modeled carbohydrates on the SIgA structures. As noted below, we have also updated supplementary figures to detail more of the cryoEM pipeline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Atomic modelling has been done in a non-conventional manner.

Briefly, local resolution maps were calculated using cryoSparc and were prepared in ChimeraX; the scale bar was generated in Chimera.</p><p>Modifications to our cryoEM methods also include clear description of two independent SIgA data processing pipelines that utilized cryoSparc (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and Relion 3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These two processing pipelines resulted in cryoEM maps with average resolutions of 3.7Å and 3.3Å at FSC=0.143, respectively. Initially, we merged Relion 3 and cryoSparc maps using the Phenix combine maps utility (see revised Materials and methods) resulting in a “combined map” that was used for initial Rosetta-assisted building and refinement. After initial model building and careful inspection of the combined, Relion and CryoSparc maps, we utilized the 3.3Å cryoSparc map for the final stages of model building and refinement. It should be noted that refinement of the final structure against the combined map and the cryoSparc map produced the nearly identical statistics; however, the EMDB requires a single map to be designated as primary (cryoSparc map). In sum, we felt that to maintain transparency of approach we should report both processing pipelines that contributed to structure determination.</p></body></sub-article></article>
