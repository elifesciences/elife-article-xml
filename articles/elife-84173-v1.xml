We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We found that: (i) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; (ii) ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not; and (iii) behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine.

Recently, it has also gained attention as a potential treatment for depression, particularly in cases that don’t respond to conventional therapies. However, individuals can vary in their response to ketamine. For example, the drug can alter some people’s perception, such as seeing objects as larger or small than they are, while other individuals are unaffected. Although a single dose of ketamine was shown to improve depression symptoms in approximately 65% of patients, the treatment does not work for a significant portion of patients. Understanding why ketamine does not work for everyone could help to identify which patients would benefit most from the treatment.</p><p>Previous studies investigating ketamine as a treatment for depression have typically included a group of individuals given ketamine and a group given a placebo drug. Assuming people respond similarly to ketamine, the responses in each group were averaged and compared to one another. However, this averaging of results may have masked any individual differences in response to ketamine. As a result, Moujaes et al. set out to investigate whether individuals show differences in brain activity and behavior in response to ketamine.</p><p>Moujaes et al. monitored the brain activity and behavior of 40 healthy individuals that were first given a placebo drug and then ketamine. The results showed that brain activity and behavior varied significantly between individuals after ketamine administration. Genetic analysis revealed that different gene expression patterns paired with differences in ketamine response in individuals – an effect that was hidden when the results were averaged. Ketamine also caused greater differences in brain activity and behavior between individuals than other drugs, such as psychedelics, suggesting ketamine generates a particularly complex response in people.</p><p>In the future, extending these findings in healthy individuals to those with depression will be crucial for determining whether differences in response to ketamine align with how effective ketamine treatment is for an individual.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ketamine</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>inter-individual

one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Krystal et al., 2019</xref>). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with TRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murrough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hack et al., 2021</xref>). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects (e.g. NMDA receptor occupancy) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murrough et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Honey et al., 2008</xref>). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture such effects. In this study, we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine.</p><p>Ketamine’s effects have been extensively characterised by group studies, which typically involve recruiting a sample of patients, measuring brain activity before and after ketamine infusion, and then averaging the results across the patients (i.e. relying on the power of central tendency) to ascertain ketamine’s effects. At subanesthetic doses, ketamine produces transient changes in behavior, perception, and cognition that are comparable to the positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms seen in patients with psychosis-spectrum illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Krystal et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, ketamine’s acute behavioral effects are typically captured using psychosis-related scales such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), as well as cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anticevic et al., 2012</xref>). However, the acute neural effects of subanesthetic of ketamine are less clear. The majority of studies exploring ketamine’s neural alterations have used seed-based approaches, which often result in contradictory results and are fundamentally limited by the required a-priori selection of a seed region and an inability to fully capture ketamine’s systems-level alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Scheidegger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Niesters et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dandash et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Höflich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonhomme et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kraguljac et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liebe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mueller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fleming et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hack et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fitzgerald, 2012</xref>). For instance, studies have identified both ketamine-induced increases and decreases in thalamo-cortical and hippocampal-cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Höflich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hack et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kraguljac et al., 2017</xref>). There is evidence that these inconsistencies may stem in part from a failure to account for individual differences in ketamine response. Ketamine has demonstrated dose-dependent individual variability in thalamic functional connectivity in healthy adults, with some individuals showing dose-dependent increases in functional connectivity, and others showing decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hack et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A limited number of studies have also characterised ketamine’s neural systems-level functional alterations using whole-brain approaches, demonstrating that ketamine results in robust brain-wide effects. For example, ketamine has been shown to increase global brain connectivity (GBC) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in healthy controls specifically, and normalize the reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hr post-ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anticevic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdallah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdallah et al., 2018</xref>). However, this finding failed to replicate in patients with depression 48 hr post-ketamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kraus et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine’s acute and delayed effects. In addition to GBC, graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated ketamine induces a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state, particularly the basal ganglia and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Joules et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, a nodal predictive model found ketamine resulted in reduced connectivity within the primary cortices and the executive network, but increased connectivity between the executive network and the rest of brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abdallah et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, dynamic resting-state functional connectivity showed that ketamine decreased connectivity both within the left visual network and inter-hemispherically between the visual networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Spies et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies also fail to account for individual differences in response to ketamine.</p><p>The main limitation of relying on the power of central tendency is that meaningful differences between individual subjects may be lost through the process of averaging. One method that has been used to successfully address this and uncover individual differences in psychiatric research is a principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Halai et al., 2017</xref>). A PCA is a data-driven method that is able to uncover both group-level and individual-level differences. More specifically, a PCA allows us to test the hypothesis that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional: if ketamine’s effects are uniform then we would expect a PCA to result in one principal component on which all the participants can be mapped; however if there are systemic differences between participants, we would anticipate a PCA to generate multiple principle components. A PCA is also able to capture individual-level differences through an individual’s relative positioning along the axes of the principal components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Halai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In order to assess the relative merits of characterizing ketamine’s acute effects using a uni-dimensional (i.e. mean-level) or multi-dimensional (i.e. PCA) approach, we will compare which results best relate to ketamine’s hypothesized molecular mechanisms. We will focus on the indirect hypothesis, which posits that ketamine first inhibits tonic-firing GABAergic interneurons via NMDAR blockade, leading to a burst of glutamate that drives synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gerhard et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that individual differences in ketamine’s neural systems-level effects are associated with SST and PVALB GABAergic interneurons by correlating ketamine’s neural effects with SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps derived from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). SST and PVALB genes were selected a-priori based on: (i) the large body of animal literature directly linking SST and PVALB interneurons to ketamine’s acute effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gerhard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Picard et al., 2019</xref>); (ii) studies showing SST and PVALB interneurons are particularly sensitive to ketamine as a result of their NMDA receptor subunit configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>); (iii) previous research showing that specific cortical regions express different ratios of SST and PVALB interneurons, with SST showing higher expression levels in association relative to sensory regions, while PVALB shows the reverse pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hawrylycz et al., 2012</xref>); and (iv) studies demonstrating patients with depression show reduced SST or PVALB interneurons in areas such as the hippocampus and PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zadrożna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Czeh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Czéh et al., 2015</xref>). Given that many different genes show similar spatial patterns in the brain, with the most common pattern explaining approximately 25% of the total gene expression variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burt et al., 2018</xref>), it is important to note that by relating ketamine’s neural effects to SST and PVALB cortical gene expression patterns we do not make any claims regarding gene specificity. Instead, we use the established relationship between ketamine and SST/PVALB interneurons to evaluate the relative merits of assessing ketamine’s acute effects using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach.</p><p>The current study aims to investigate the behavioral and neural effects of acute ketamine administration in 40 healthy controls using a whole-brain data-driven multi-dimensional (PCA) approach. We hypothesize that ketamine will result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting inter-individual variability in response to ketamine. We further hypothesize that using a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional approach to capture ketamine’s acute effects will allow us to more closely relate ketamine’s effects to its hypothesized molecular mechanisms, specifically SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps. In addition, we investigate the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by directly comparing ketamine to two other psychoactive substances that have also shown preliminary clinical efficacy for the treatment of depression, but have very different pharmacological profiles: (i) psilocybin, a preferential 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A agonist; and (ii) LSD, which stimulates a wide range of serotonin and dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gasser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pokorny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Gregorio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Halberstadt and Geyer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Passie et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, we compare the principal behavioral axes to established psychosis literature subscales (e.g. three-factor and five-factor PANSS models), and assess the extent to which the principal behavioral axes captures novel neural variation and individual differences in molecular mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">QuNex</td><td align="left" valign="top">QuNex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ji et al., 2023</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">HCP MPP</td><td align="left" valign="top">HCP MPP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glasser et al., 2013</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">N-BRIDGE</td><td align="left" valign="top">N-BRIDGE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ji et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">CAB-NP</td><td align="left" valign="top">CAB-NP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ji et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">R</td><td align="left" valign="top">R</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">FSL</td><td align="left" valign="top">FSL</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002823">SCR_002823</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ketamine study participants</title><p>Healthy participants were recruited from the New Haven area via flyers and online ads.

The use of LSD in humans was authorized by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, Bern, Switzerland. The study protocol was approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich (KEK-ZH_No: 2014_0496). The study employed a fully double-blind, randomized, within-subject cross-over design with three conditions: (1) placebo +placebo condition: placebo (179 mg Mannitol and Aerosil 1 mg po) after pretreatment with placebo (179 mg Mannitol and Aerosil 1 mg po); (2) placebo +LSD condition: LSD (100 µg po) after pretreatment with placebo (179 mg Mannitol and Aerosil 1 mg po), or (3) Ketanserin +LSD condition: LSD (100 µg po) after pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist Ketanserin (40 mg po). Data were collected for all subjects in a randomized counterbalanced order at three different sessions each two weeks apart. For all conditions, the first substance was administered 60 min before the second substance, and the first neural scan was conducted 75 min after the second administration, with a second scan conducted at 300 min post-administration. In the present study, only data from the (1) placebo +placebo and (2) placebo +LSD conditions were evaluated.

A summary of the HCP pipelines is as follows. First T1/2-weighted structural images were corrected for bias-field distortions and then warped to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute-152 (MNI-152) brain template in a single step, through a combination of linear and non-linear transformations via the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) linear image registration tool (FLIRT) and non-linear image registration tool (FNIRT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). Next, FreeSurfer’s recon-all pipeline was used to segment brain-wide gray and white matter to produce individual cortical and subcortical anatomical segmentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reuter et al., 2012</xref>). Cortical surface models were generated for pial and white matter boundaries as well as segmentation masks for each subcortical gray matter voxel. Using the pial and white matter surface boundaries, a ‘cortical ribbon’ was defined along with corresponding subcortical voxels, which were combined to generate the neural file in the Connectivity Informatics Technology Initiative (CIFTI) volume/surface ‘grayordinate’ space for each individual subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>). BOLD data were motion-corrected by aligning to the middle frame of every run via FLIRT in the initial NIFTI volume space. In turn, a brain-mask was applied to exclude signal from non-brain tissue. Next, cortical BOLD data were converted to the CIFTI gray matter matrix by sampling from the anatomically-defined gray matter cortical ribbon and subsequently aligned to the HCP atlas using surface-based nonlinear deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>). Subcortical voxels were aligned to the MNI-152 atlas using whole-brain non-linear registration and then the Freesurfer-defined subcortical segmentation applied to isolate the subcortical grayordinate portion of the CIFTI space.</p><p>After the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines, movement scrubbing was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Power et al., 2013</xref>). Bad frames with possible movement-induced artifactual fluctuations in intensity were identified if they met at least one of the following two criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anticevic et al., 2012</xref>). First, framewise displacement (FD) was computed by summing the displacement across all six rigid body movement correction parameters. Frames in which FD exceeded 0.5 mm were flagged. Secondly, normalized root mean square (RMS) was calculated by taking the root mean square of differences in intensity between the current and preceding frame across all voxels and dividing it by the mean intensity. Frames in which RMS exceeded 1.6 x the median across the scans (calculated separately for each participant) were also flagged. The flagged frames, as well as the the frame immediately preceding and immediately following any flagged frames, were discarded from further analyses. Subjects with more than 50% flagged frames were excluded completely.</p><p>Next, a high-pass filter (threshold 0.008 Hz) was applied to the BOLD data to remove low frequency signals due to scanner drift. QuNex was used to calculate the average variation in BOLD signal in the ventricles, deep white matter, and across the whole gray matter (‘global signal’), as well as movement parameters. These signals, as well as their first derivatives to account for delayed effects, were then regressed out of the gray matter BOLD time series as nuisance variables (as any change in the BOLD signal due to these variables are not likely to reflect neural activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Power et al., 2018</xref>). It should be noted that using global signal regression (GSR) to remove spatially persistent artifact is controversial in neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Power et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), but it remains a current field-wide standard (although see other recent and emerging approaches at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Glasser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aquino et al., 2020</xref>). In order to address this controversy, we also include the mean effect and neural PCA results without GSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, when we compared the results of the neural PCA performed with and without GSR, we found that PC1 Δ GBC with GSR was significantly positively correlated with the PC2 Δ GBC without GSR (<italic>r</italic>=0.54, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). In contrast, PC1 Δ (ketamine - placebo) GBC with GSR was not significantly correlated with the PC1 Δ GBC without GSR (<italic>r</italic>=–0.04, p=0.28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). This indicates that when a PCA is computed on results without GSR, the first PC captures a substantial amount of the global signal that is removed when regressing out GSR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Neural data reduction via functional brain-wide parcellation</title><p>All neural data analysed in this study is resting-state data. We examined the neural effects of ketamine at multiple levels of analysis: dense (91,281 grayordinates); parcel (718 parcels); network (12 networks); and subcortex (5 subcortical structures). Psilocybin and LSD were analysed at the parcel-level only. Both the parcel-level and network-level data were acquired using a functionally derived whole-brain parcellation via the recently validated Cole-Anticevic Brain Network Parcellation (CAB-NP) atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>).

All data was parcellated prior to running GBC, as this was shown to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While we report the mean effect of ketamine at grayordinate and parcel-level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), further analysis was conducted at the parcel-level as this gave the best trade-off between the sample size needed to resolve multivariate neurobehavioral solutions and the size of the feature space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ji et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Global brain connectivity</title><p>GBC was calculated on the ketamine, psilocybin, and LSD datasets. Following preprocessing, the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) matrix was calculated for each participant by computing the Pearson’s correlation between every grayordinate in the brain with all other grayordinates. A Fisher’s r-to-Z transform was then applied. GBC was calculate by computing every grayordinate’s mean FC strength with all other grayordinates (i.e. the mean, per row, across all columns of the FC matrix). Thus, this calculation yielded a GBC map for each subject where each grayordinates value represents the mean connectivity of that grayordinate with all other grayordinates in the brain. GBC is a data-driven summary measure of connectedness that is unbiased with regards to the location of a possible alteration in connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cole et al., 2016</xref>) and is therefore a principled way for reducing the number of neural functional connectivity features while assessing neural variation across the entire brain.

As sample size is relevant when calculating effective dimensionality, we first re-sampled the data ensuring sample size in each of the pharmacological conditions was always 22. We used either re-sampling or jackknifing to build a distribution of effective dimensionality values for each pharmacological condition. For LSD (N=24), we selected all 276 possible combinations of 22 participants and calculated effective dimensionality on each of the 276 subsamples to build a distribution. For psilocybin (N=23), we used jackknifing to produce 22 subsamples of 22 participants and calculated effective dimensionality on each of the 22 subsamples to build a distribution.

We then correlated the gene expression maps for each of the selected genes with our target map. As the gene expression maps are restricted to the cortex, the correlations were run on cortex only.

The resulting maps of regression coefficients reflects the strength of the relationship between participants’ behavioral score and Δ GBC at every neural location (718 parcels), across all 40 participants. The greater the magnitude of the coefficient for a given location, the stronger the statistical relationship between Δ GBC and the behavioral variation across participants. Significance of the maps was assessed via nonparametric permutation testing, 5000 random shuffles with TFCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smith and Nichols, 2009</xref>) type-I error-protection computed via the Permutation Analysis of Linear Models program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Multidimensional neural effect of acute ketamine administration</title><p>To explore whether the neural effects of acute ketamine are multidimensional (i.e. there is inter-individual variability in response to ketamine) or uni-dimensional (i.e. ketamine effects individuals in a similar manner), we ran a PCA.

However, inter-individual variability in behavioral and neural responses to acute ketamine administration has been largely ignored. This study addresses this knowledge gap by showing that: (i) both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability; (ii) the use of a multi-dimensional vs. uni-dimensional neural approach is more closely associated with ketamine’s molecular mechanisms; and (iii) ketamine’s data-driven principal behavioral gradient provides an anchor point for ketamine’s neural effects and molecular mechanisms at the single subject level.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ketamine’s neural effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting inter-individual variability</title><p>We show that the neural geometry of ketamine is multi-dimensional, as ketamine results in five significant neural axes of variation, each of which is bi-directional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The bi-directional nature of the PCs helps explain the contradictory results in the ketamine resting-state literature as the direction of effects is often inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Höflich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hack et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Khalili-Mahani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kraguljac et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interpreting this finding is of particular interest given that ketamine is a molecule that acts at the same target in every human brain, antagonising the NMDA receptor, which should intuitively result in a single uni-directional principal component (PC). A number of possible interpretations exist for why ketamine results in multiple bi-directional neural PCs. For example, one PC may reflect ketamine’s effects in excitatory-excitatory synapses, while the another may reflect ketamine’s effects in excitatory-inhibitory synapses. Another possibility is that, given we know ketamine’s affinity for certain cells is based on their NMDA receptor subunit configuration, one PC may reflect ketamine’s ‘high affinity’ actions on GluN2C and GluN2D containing receptors, while another PC may reflect ketamine’s ‘lower affinity’ actions on GluN2A and GluN2B containing receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kotermanski and Johnson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kuner and Schoepfer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Khlestova et al., 2016</xref>). A third possibility is that the multiple bi-directional PCs may be driven by ketamine’s numerous microcircuit level targets, as ketamine effects: (i) SST interneurons, which in turn disinhibit glutamatergic pyramidal distal dendrites and PVALB interneurons; (ii) PVALB interneurons, which disinhibit the soma of glutamatergic pyramidal neurons; (iii) VIP neurons, which may reduce distal dendrite inhibition but disinhibit SST activity; and (iv) chandelier cells, which permit the back-propagation of action potentials from the axon to the soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2020</xref>. Meanwhile, the bi-drectional nature of the principal components may relate to individual differences in a number of factors including use-dependent excitation of NMDA networks, genetic variation in NMDA receptor subunits, and sleep profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">MacDonald et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu and Lipsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Vry and Jentzsch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duncan et al., 2013</xref>.</p><p>Ketamine’s numerous microcircuit level targets may also explain why ketamine shows increased dimensionality compared to psilocybin and LSD: psilocybin and LSD’s behavioral effects are predominantly linked to 5HT2A agonism, and 5HT2A receptors are located on fewer cellular elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Winter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benneyworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Preller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vollenweider et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, ketamine’s multi-dimensional neural effects may be due to complementary inhibitory and excitatory dimensions which are not present to the same extent with psilocybin and LSD: both psilocybin and LSD are excitatory while ketamine results in increased excitation indirectly as a consequence of the inhibition of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nichols and Nichols, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gerhard et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient captures is associated with its hypothesized molecular mechanisms while the mean effect is not</title><p>We found ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient is associated with SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps, as are PC3-5 Δ GBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This demonstrates that there is also inter-individual variation in the behavioral response to ketamine that is not fully captured by the mean. For example, while behavioral PC1 is closely related to the mean effect, behavioral PC2 tracks changes in measures such as ‘uncooperativeness’ and ‘impulse control’ that are not captured by the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This finding is also of interest in relation to the wider literature, as most data-reduction PANSS studies have identified a five-factor rather than a two-factor solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">van der Gaag et al., 2006</xref>). However, previous PANSS data-reduction studies focused on psychosis populations rather than acute ketamine administration.</p><p>The two data-driven principal behavioral gradients capture novel neural variation when regressed onto the Δ GBC data, resulting in two neuro-behavioral PCs. The novel neural variation captured by the neuro-behavioral PCs is evidenced by the fact that neuro-behavioral PC2 and PC2 Δ GBC were only weakly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, in contrast to PC1-5 Δ GBC, the neuro-behavioral PCs are interpretable in relation to behavior. Such an understanding is crucial for informing predictions about how a specific individual will respond to ketamine in a clinical setting. Importantly, this prediction may ultimately be done using only their symptom profile, without the need for more costly neural scans.</p><p>Finally, when we directly compared ketamine’s data-driven principal behavioral gradient to the existing PANSS subscales, we found that regressing the two behavioral PCs, the three-factor PANSS subscales, and the five-factor PANSS subscales onto the Δ GBC data produced comparable results ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

When we tested our neuro-behavioral model by comparing the order in which individual participants load onto behavioral PC1 and neuro-behavioral PC1, we found the order was largely preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Thus, this framework enables us to take an individual’s behavioral response to ketamine, and then meaningfully infer where that individual falls in relation to their ketamine-induced neural effects. Given this framework operates at the whole-brain level, this indicates that the neural effect of ketamine is not ROI-based but a distributed system-wide effect.</p><p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that neuro-behavioral PC1 captured individual variation in how SST and PVALB interneurons may be differentially impacted by ketamine: we found an association between participants’ neuro-behavioral PC1 scores and whether their Δ GBC maps positively correlated with SST cortical gene expression maps and negatively correlated with PVALB cortical gene expression maps (seen in 58% of participants), or whether they showed the reverse pattern (seen in 12% of participants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). A potential interpretation is that the expression of SST and PVALB cortical genes varies among individuals due to a range of factors, including stress, sleep patterns, medications, and psychiatric diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lin and Sibille, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perez et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, this is an important intuition, as the identification of the targets responsible for the different behavioral effects of ketamine seen in specific individuals is critical for the development of novel pharmaco-therapies that may lack the side effects of ketamine or reduce the abuse potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>As with most psychoactive pharmacological neuroimaging studies, despite the single-blind design participants were able to correctly identify whether they received ketamine or saline 100% of the time. Future studies may mitigate this by using an active placebo control. In addition, as the ketamine and saline scans took place on the same day, ketamine’s residual effects ruled out the counterbalancing of the order. Furthermore, neural measures were only collected during ketamine’s peak effects. Given ketamine’s antidepressant effects are shown to peak 24–72 hr post-infusion, future studies may wish to collect additional follow-up scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Krystal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berman et al., 2000</xref>). While behavioral measures were collected during both peak effects and offset, the use of repetitive questionnaires and tasks introduces potential psychometric confounds such as familiarity and practice effects. In addition, we did not regress out physiological measures. There is a large body of evidence to suggest that heart rate and blood pressure impact resting-state functional connectivity, and sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and moderate doses of psilocybin and LSD have all been shown to increase heart rate and blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nikolaou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de la Cruz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Riva-Posse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bennett et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Isbell, 1959</xref>). While to date no studies have directly compared the physiological effects of all three drugs, there is evidence that LSD and psilocybin have distinct effects on blood pressure and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holze et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The present study used GBC: a dimension-reduced summary measure of neural resting-state fMRI. While this remains a principled method of reducing the feature space, it is possible that some of the behaviorally relevant neural information may be lost by first summarizing neural features in this manner. Thus, future studies may wish to explore the multi-dimensional effects of ketamine using the full neural functional connectivity matrix. In this analysis, we largely focused on PC1-2 Δ GBC when exploring ketamine’s neural effects as they explained the bulk of the neural variance. To unpack the variation in PC3-5 Δ GBC a larger sample size is needed, especially given each PC represents a bidirectional axis of variation. A larger sample size would also allow us to investigate alternative models for ketamine’s molecular mechanisms in addition to the indirect hypothesis, such as how ketamine’s effects may differ based on NMAR subtypes or excitatory vs. inhibitory synapses. It would also enable us to explore whether any demographic characterises such as sex relate to specific PCs. Furthermore, given the differences in effective dimensionality we see across different drugs, an important future direction will be an expansion of the primary analysis to LSD and psilocybin in order to more thoroughly compare their effects. Finally, it will be important for future studies to assess the importance of intra-individual variation in addition to inter-individual variation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A key goal in psychiatric research is to predict treatment response. One of the main barriers to the development of predictive biomarkers for treatment response to ketamine is our limited understanding of inter-individual variability in ketamine response. We address this knowledge gap by: (i) showing there is robust inter-individual variability in both the behavioral and neural response to ketamine that requires a multi-dimensional analytic approach; and (ii) providing a multi-dimensional framework with which to connect across ketamine’s behavioral, neural and molecular effects that is resolvable at the single subject level. This multi-dimensional framework has the potential to generate predictions about how an individual will respond to ketamine, and as such the crucial next step will be to test this framework in patients using actual treatment response data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>J.L.J. is an employee of Manifest Technologies and has previously worked for Neumora (formerly BlackThorn Therapeutics) and is a co-inventor on the following patent: Anticevic A, Murray JD, Ji JL: Systems and Methods for Neuro-Behavioral Relationships in Dimensional Geometric Embedding (N-BRIDGE), PCT International Application No. PCT/US2119/022110, filed March 13, 2019</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Currently an employee of Neumora Therapeutics and consulted for BlackThorn Therapeutics in 2019</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>Consults for Manifest Technologies and previously consulted for Neumora (formerly BlackThorn Therapeutics)</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf5"><p>Consults for and holds equity with RBNC (formerly BlackThorn Therapeutics)</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf6"><p>Sarah K.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Roiser as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christoph Kraus (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>– The δ GBC PC maps look identical to the PC maps obtained in each condition (ketamine, placebo) separately (Figure S1), and for LSD and PSB (Figure S6). This essentially implies that none of the findings are specific to the difference between ketamine and placebo, but instead reflect a general feature of the methodology used here. Please report correlations between these maps or provide some other demonstration that the reported findings are indeed specific to the ketamine-placebo contrast.</p><p>– LSD and PSB are only used for evaluating dimensionality. A more convincing analysis would compare the primary effects across all drugs to identify the specific effects of ketamine.</p><p>– There is no assessment of the specificity of the gene expression correlations. Many different genes show similar spatial patterns. In fact, the PC maps are patterns along the classical sensory fugal hierarchy, which some of these authors have shown to be the dominant PC of gene expression (Burt, Nat Neuro), meaning that many different genes will have similar expression profiles. Please provide stronger evidence supporting the specificity of the effects on the selected genes with respect to appropriate null models (e.g., Wei et al., Hum Brain Mapp, 2022). This is critical to support the main claims associated with this analysis. This analysis should be accompanied by a more detailed explanation of why the specific genes were chosen, as many other choices are possible.</p><p>– The discrepancy between mean and PC approaches is expected if a significant variance is explained by &gt;1 PC, so this is not particularly surprising. The rationale for the emphasis on this result is unclear</p><p>– The analysis of high and low loaders, which occupies significant volumes of text, is highly qualitative. Please provide full distributions of relevant metrics across all participants and statistical analysis of the entire sample.</p><p>– Many different analyses are presented and the figure captions are dense. The readability of the paper could be improved if the results were more streamlined, particularly since it is based on a small number of participants. Some suggestions:</p><p>– Remove comparisons with mean GBC and focus on the PCs;</p><p>– Focus on the neuro-behavioral results and genetic mapping.</p><p>– It would be helpful to see the distribution of the ketamine response on the behavioral variables, frequently the range of this response is small in healthy volunteers and makes analyses difficult. Are there participants who don't have a significant response or outliers?</p><p>– Were the physiological measures recorded during or after the infusions? Typically heart rate and blood pressure increase during acute ketamine administration and the same is likely true for acute LSD or psilocybin.

This essentially implies that none of the findings are specific to the difference between ketamine and placebo, but instead reflect a general feature of the methodology used here. Please report correlations between these maps or provide some other demonstration that the reported findings are indeed specific to the ketamine-placebo contrast.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important issue. To address this, we first z scored the PC1 maps for placebo, ketamine, ∆ ketamine, ∆ psilocybin, ∆ LSD and presented them on the same scale and direction (given the direction of a principal component is inherently arbitrary) in order to be able to directly qualitatively compare the maps (Figure 1—figure supplement 7A-E). We then calculated the correlations between PC1-5 for the placebo, ketamine, ∆ ketamine, ∆ psilocybin, and ∆ LSD data (Figure 1—figure supplement 7F). For PC1, we see that as expected the highest correlations (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.8) are between ∆ ketamine PC1 and placebo PC1, and ∆ ketamine PC1 and ketamine PC1 as these involve the same sample of participants (Figure 1—figure supplement 7F). In contrast, the PC1 correlations between ∆ ketamine PC1 and ∆ psilocybin PC1 /∆ LSD PC1 are lower (<italic>r</italic> ≈ 0.5), indicating the maps are not identical. Furthermore, the moderate correlations between ∆ ketamine PC1 and ∆ psilocybin PC1/∆ LSD PC1 are not entirely surprising given that there is overlap in the subjective effects of these highly psychoactive substances. In contrast, ∆ ketamine PC2-5 are more dissimilar to ∆ psilocybin/LSD PC2-5: PC2 <italic>r</italic> = 0.26/0.22, PC3 <italic>r</italic> = 0.18/0.05, PC4 <italic>r</italic> = 0.1/0.02, and PC5 <italic>r</italic> = -0.11/-0.02 (Figure 1—figure supplement 7F). While these results do not rule out the possibility that PC1 does to some extent capture a general feature of the methodology, we believe that in particular the moderate correlations between ∆ ketamine PC1 and ∆ psilocybin PC1 /∆ LSD PC1 demonstrate that the findings do show specificity to the ketamine-placebo contrast. Although a thorough comparison of the PCA results for ∆ ketamine, ∆ psilocybin, and ∆ LSD is beyond the scope of this manuscript (see reply to comment 2 for more details on how this will be investigated in the future), to address this issue in the manuscript we have now: (1) z-scored all psilocybin and LSD ∆ GBC maps to enable a reader to directly compare them with the ketamine ∆ GBC maps (see Figure 1—figure supplement 7); and (2) included the PC2 maps for ∆ psilocybin and ∆ LSD (see Figure 1—figure supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– LSD and PSB are only used for evaluating dimensionality. A more convincing analysis would compare the primary effects across all drugs to identify the specific effects of ketamine.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this feedback and are working on a collaborative analysis with another team (Prof. Robin Carhart-Harris) where we have pooled all our effects into one mega-analysis to evaluate precisely this question with sufficient power, after the observation in the present manuscript. We agree that a full analysis of the ketamine effects to other pharmacological manipulations is necessary and would be convincing. We now discuss this point more extensively in the Discussion section to highlight the importance of testing this hypothesis. That said, we hope the Reviewer and the Editor can appreciate that a full analytic expansion to independent pharmacological datasets would be beyond the scope of the present manuscript. The present manuscript, even in its current form, is quite extensive; therefore, while we completely embrace the thesis that generalizing the analytic approach and evaluating the neuro-behavioral effects in each pharmacological intervention is vital, it is our strong preference to focus on ketamine in this paper because of its specific mechanism of action, which motivated some of the strong a-priori cortical gene expression analyses. Collectively, we sincerely hope that a discussion of this analytic direction (which is actively in progress) addresses the core notion that applying these methods in other pharmacological manipulations would be impactful. We have now added this point as an additional future direction to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Given the differences in effective dimensionality we see across different drugs, an important direction for future research will be an expansion of the primary analysis to LSD and psilocybin in order to more thoroughly compare their effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There is no assessment of the specificity of the gene expression correlations. Many different genes show similar spatial patterns. In fact, the PC maps are patterns along the classical sensory fugal hierarchy, which some of these authors have shown to be the dominant PC of gene expression (Burt, Nat Neuro), meaning that many different genes will have similar expression profiles. Please provide stronger evidence supporting the specificity of the effects on the selected genes with respect to appropriate null models (e.g., Wei et al., Hum Brain Mapp, 2022). This is critical to support the main claims associated with this analysis. This analysis should be accompanied by a more detailed explanation of why the specific genes were chosen, as many other choices are possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree that as many different genes show similar spatial patterns our analysis does not provide an assessment of specificity; however, for this reason we specifically picked two genes that are associated with interneuron classes that have been shown in the animal literature to play a mechanistic role in ketamine’s effects. Precisely to the Reviewer’s point, because a vast majority of genes will express along the sensoryfugal axes, we picked two genes that are a priori mechanistically implicated in ketamine’s effects on the brain. Specifically, PVALB (which encodes parvalbumin interneurons), and SST (which encodes somatostatin interneurons), may both may be preferentially antagonized by ketamine. The point of the analysis is not to overstate that it is specifically PVALB and SST, as opposed to any other gene that follows a similar expression pattern, that are related to ketamine’s effects, but rather to test the hypothesis that the low rank solution of the pharmacological effects, which produces a dominant axis of variation, is more strongly associated with the SST/PVALB cortical gene expression maps compared to the mean-effect of ketamine. We now provide a more nuanced interpretation of the results in the Discussion section, and have updated the introduction outlining more clearly why we chose PVALB and SST, as well as explicitly stating the limitations of the conclusions that can be drawn from this analysis, and directly referencing the Burt, Nat Neuro paper highlighted by the reviewer:</p><p>“In order to assess the relative merits of characterizing ketamine’s acute effects using using a uni-dimensional (i.e. mean-level) or multi-dimensional (i.e. PCA) approach, will compare which results best relate to ketamine’s hypothesized molecular mechanisms. We will focus on the indirect hypothesis, which posits that ketamine first inhibits tonic-firing GABAergic interneurons via NMDAR blockade, which in turn leads to a burst of glutamate that drives synaptic plasticity ((11)). Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that individual differences in ketamine’s neural systems-level effects are associated with SST and PVALB GABAergic interneurons by correlating ketamine’s neural effects with SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps derived from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). SST and PVALB genes were selected a-priori based on: (i) the large body of animal literature directly linking SST and PVALB interneurons to ketamine’s acute effects ((11, 22, 26)); (ii) studies showing SST and PVALB interneurons are particularly sensitive to ketamine as a result of their NMDA receptor subunit configuration ((25)); (iii) previous research showing that specific cortical regions express different ratios of SST and PVALB interneurons, with SST showing higher expression levels in association relative to sensory regions, while PVALB shows the reverse pattern ((1, 14)); and (iv) studies of patients with depression have reported reduction in both SST or PVALB interneurons in areas such as the hippocampus and PFC ((7, 8, 24, 32)). Given that many different genes show similar spatial patterns in the brain, with the most common pattern explaining approximately 25% of the total gene expression variance ((4)), it is important to note that by relating ketamine’s neural effects to SST and PVALB cortical gene expression patterns we do not make any claims regarding gene specificity. Instead, we use the established relationship between ketamine and SST/PVALB interneurons evaluate the relative merits of assessing ketamine’s acute effects using a multi-dimensional vs. a uni-dimensional approach.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discrepancy between mean and PC approaches is expected if a significant variance is explained by &gt;1 PC, so this is not particularly surprising. The rationale for the emphasis on this result is unclear</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point which is of central importance to the paper. Although the discrepancy between the mean and PC approach is certainly expected when a significant variance is explained by &gt;1 PC, the use of a principal component approach is still not very common when analysing ketamine’s effects. Most studies still use a mean difference approach, which obscures the possibility that there are multiple axes of ketmaine response. To make this more clear in the manuscript, we have now rewritten the introduction with a greater focus on the motivation of the paper and how the PCA fits into this. Of particular relevance are the first and fourth paragraphs, also included below:</p><p>Paragraph 1: “Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) ((19)). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) (12, 21). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects (e.g. NMDA receptor occupancy) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms ((16, 21, 29)). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture these effects. In this study we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine.”</p><p>Paragraph 4: “The main limitation of relying on the power of central tendency is that meaningful differences between individual subjects may be lost through the process of averaging. One method that has been used to successfully address this and uncover individual differences in psychiatric research is a principal component analysis (PCA) ((13, 18)). A PCA is a data-driven method that is able to uncover both group-level and individual-level differences. More specifically, a PCA allows us to test the hypothesis that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional: if ketamine’s effects are uniform then we would expect a PCA to result in one principal component on which all the participants can be mapped, however if there are systemic differences between participants we would anticipate a PCA to generate multiple principle components. A PCA is also able to capture individual-level differences through an individual’s relative positioning along the axes of the principal components ((13)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The analysis of high and low loaders, which occupies significant volumes of text, is highly qualitative. Please provide full distributions of relevant metrics across all participants and statistical analysis of the entire sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this analysis should be taken further as we make a qualitative claim when it is possible to determine the relationship quantitatively. To address this, we have now removed Figure S8 in the original manuscript and updated the analysis in Figure 5 by removing the reference to high and low loaders and replacing it with a new analysis that allows us to explore individual variation in relation to the neural-behavioral mapping in a quantitative manner. As suggested by the reviewer, instead of examining the relationship between ∆ GBC and SST/PVALB cortical gene expression maps only for the highest and lowest loaders, we now do so for the entire sample and make inferences only on the statistical analysis of the combined results of the entire sample. As a brief overview, we now: (i) compute the relationship between each individual subject’s ∆ GBC and SST/PVALB cortical gene expression maps (see four additional supplemental figures Figure 5—figure supplement 1-4); (ii) order participants in terms of their neuro-behavioral PC1 score (calculated by correlating their ∆ GBC map with their neural-behavioral PC1 map) and plot each participant’s observed r-values to provide an overview of the results in a single summary figure (Figure 5G); and (iii) quantitatively establish if there is relationship between distinct SST and PVALB gene expression map associations and the neuro-behavioral PC1 scores across the entire sample (Figure 5H). This is outlined fully in the updated results subsection ‘Neuro-behavioral mapping captures individual variation in how SST and PVALB interneurons may be differentially impacted by ketamine’. We are extremely grateful to the reviewer for this suggestion and believe the new analysis greatly strengthens the paper. Finally, we also updated the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Furthermore, we demonstrated that neuro-behavioral PC1 captured individual variation in how SST and PVALB interneurons may be differentially impacted by ketamine: we found an association between participants’ neuro-behavioral PC1 scores and whether their ∆ GBC maps positively correlated with SST gene expression maps and negatively correlated with PVALB gene expression maps (seen in 58% of participants), or whether they showed the reverse pattern (seen in 12% of participants) (Figure 5H).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Many different analyses are presented and the figure captions are dense. The readability of the paper could be improved if the results were more streamlined, particularly since it is based on a small number of participants. Some suggestions:</p><p>– Remove comparisons with mean GBC and focus on the PCs;</p><p>– Focus on the neuro-behavioral results and genetic mapping.</p></disp-quote><p>While we certainly appreciate the Reviewer’s direct suggestions, we hope that we can articulate why keeping the comparison between the mean GBC and PCs is essential. First, the mean effect is showing what prior literature has produced, and is vital to anchor the reader’s perspective to what the result would be under the null hypothesis that there is a single dimension under ketamine response (in which case the mean would be a valid measure). As a direct corollary, removing the neural PCA would fundamentally change the scope of the paper and remove what we believe is the core finding of the paper, namely that ketamine induces a neural response pattern that varies across individuals in a multi dimensional manner. Again, we want to underscore this point, because the current framework in the vast majority of pharmacological imaging studies (including our own prior work) has made the assumption that if a pharmacological agent is administered to a sample of healthy adults, the response will be along a uniform neural circuit that exhibits variation along an axis of response. The alternative hypothesis is that there are quantifiable functional differences between individuals in the pattern of their neural response to a given pharmacological agent. Testing this hypothesis, both neurally and behaviorally, is the essence of the study, because it rejects the hypothesis that the mean is the best measure of ketamine’s acute effects. We hope that this response removes any concerns regarding the (in our mind) vital findings. Finally, while we appreciate the reviewer’s concerns that N=40 may be small,</p><p>to our knowledge this is the largest single-site study of ketamine’s neural and behavioral patterns while in scanner. In addition, we have now re-written the introduction to more clearly outline the motivation for the paper, and hope that it is now also clear in the manuscript from the outset why the comparison between the mean GBC and PCs is crucial to the paper. For example, see the updated first paragraph of the introduction:</p><p>“Over the last two decades, ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) ((19)). Robust individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed in both healthy controls and patients with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) ((12, 21)). For example, a single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD, while individual differences in baseline molecular effects (e.g. NMDA receptor occupancy) and brain function predict the degree to which an individual experiences specific acute ketamine-induced symptoms ((16, 21, 29)). Despite these findings, an assumption persists within the fMRI pharmacology literature that the behavioral and neural effects of substances like ketamine are uniform across individuals, and that the central tendency can effectively capture these effects. In this study we challenge this assumption and instead posit that ketamine’s effects are multi-dimensional, and that these dimensions will capture individual differences in response to ketamine.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be helpful to see the distribution of the ketamine response on the behavioral variables, frequently the range of this response is small in healthy volunteers and makes analyses difficult. Are there participants who don't have a significant response or outliers?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and agree it is important to show that the ketamine response as measured via the behavioral variables has sufficient range. To address this we now include two supplementary tables showing: (i) only 5/40 participants do not show a significant PANSS response; (ii) outliers are limited with 10 behavioral items containing one outlier, 1 behavioral item showing 2 outliers, and 2 behavioral items showing 3 outliers (Table S4, Table S5). We have also included this additional sentence in the methods outlining this:</p><p>“Behavioral response to ketamine assessed via PANSS showed sufficient range to justify further analysis, as 35/40 participants showed a significant difference in PANSS following ketamine, while outliers were limited (with the exception of items in which the interquartile range was 0) (Table S4, Table S5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Were the physiological measures recorded during or after the infusions? Typically heart rate and blood pressure increase during acute ketamine administration and the same is likely true for acute LSD or psilocybin. Please provide an indication of how these changes affect the GBC</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and something we will certainly consider in future studies. While physiological measures were collected in the ketamine study to ensure participants remained within a certain safe range, the data was not analysed. However, as the reviewer suggested there is evidence that at these doses all three drugs increase blood pressure and/or heart rate. In addition, one study directly comparing LSD and psilocybin indicated that they have differential effects on blood pressure and heart rate, with psilocybin having greater impact on blood pressure and LSD on heart rate. We have now added this as a discussion point:</p><p>“Another limitation is that we did not regress out physiological measures. There is a large body of evidence to suggest that heart rate and blood pressure impact resting-state functional connectivity, and sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and moderate doses of psilocybin and LSD have all been shown to increase heart rate and blood pressure ((3, 5, 6, 17, 23, 28)). Furthermore, while to date no studies have directly compared the physiological effects of all three drugs, there is evidence that LSD and psilocybin have distinct effects on blood pressure and heart rate ((15)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please clarify how double-blinding was implemented precisely.</p></disp-quote><p>We are extremely grateful to the reviewer for catching this mistake: the ketamine study was single-blinded, with participants blinded to their treatment condition, while the LSD and psilocybin studies were doubleblinded. We have now corrected this mistake in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There might be other sources for inter-individual variation of ketamine's response such as use-dependent excitation of NMDA networks, sleep profiles or genetic variation of NMDA receptor subunits. The authors may want to incorporate these into their explanation of inter-individual variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We extremely grateful to the reviewer for these invaluable suggestions regarding additional sources for the inter-individual variation in response to ketamine and have incorporated them in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Meanwhile, the bi-directional nature of the principal components may relate to individual differences in a number of factors including use-dependent excitation of NMDA networks, genetic variation in NMDA receptor subunits, and sleep profiles (9, 10, 20, 31).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please explain in more detail why the PANSS or δ-PANSS (Post-Pre) was used for the PCA. Why not CADSS, which seemed to have stronger effects than the PANSS (Table S1)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need for clarity regarding this point. We focused on PANSS and cognition rather than CADSS and cognition in order to create a more parsimonious model that we can relate to prior work that has been conducted in the field of psychosis using the same analysis approach (i.e. running a PCA on PANSS and cognition data and regressing it onto parcellated neural GBC data – see Ji et al. 2020) ((18)). We also wanted to be able to compare our findings more generally to the schizophrenia literature, and PANSS is a typical measure in the psychopathology literature that has been used as a FDA regulated endpoint for psychosis treatments. We chose not to include both PANSS and CADSS as this solution resulted in the amount of total variance explained going down from 41.1% to 29.9% (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer that capturing the full spectrum of pharmacologically induced behavioral effects is vital, and that focusing on CADSS and cognition may be an equally valid approach given the PCA run on CADSS and cognition results in a total variance explained of 51.5% (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Furthermore, the CADSS and cognition PCA solution is very different to the PANSS and cognition PCA solution: four vs. two principal components are identified, and when we regress the principal components onto the parcellated neural GBC data we see very little overlap in the PANSS and cognition vs. CADSS and cognition neuro-behavioral PC maps (max r = 0.38) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Overall, this indicates that a comparison of the relative merits of CADSS vs. PANSS in relation to this analysis strategy may be an interesting avenue for future research, although it is beyond the scope of this paper. However, to highlight this point to the reader we now include three additional figures showing: (i) PCA results for PANSS, CADSS and cognition; (ii) PCA results for CADSS and cognition; (iii) a comparison of the neuro-behavioral maps from the three PCA solutions (PANSS and cognition; PANSS, CADSS and cognition; CADSS and cognition) (Figure 3—figure supplement 2-3, Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We also added this sentence to the methods section:</p><p>“We did not include CADSS in the model as doing so resulted in the total amount of variance explained by the PCA going down from 41.1% to 29.9% (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For comparison we ran a PCA on (i) PANSS, CADSS, and cognition (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and (ii) CADSS, and cognition (Figure 3—figure supplement 3), and directly compared the different PCA versions by correlating the resulting neuro-behavioral maps (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please discuss the downsides of using repetitive rating scales in such an endeavor. To this end, I would be interested in the author's view on what explains more variance in neuropsychological effects of repetitive ketamine/lsd/psilocybin experiments: visual analog scales, questionnaires, or tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important broader limitation and agree that the use of repetitive rating scales when assessing the neuropsychological effects of ketamine, LSD, and psilocybin is not without its downsides. For example, the frequency and timing of repetitive rating scales may introduce order effects and participant fatigue, affecting the quality of the data. In addition, the repetitive rating scale used in this study, PANSS, relies of self-report data, making it subject to biases that may reflect the validity of the results. For example, Likert-type scales are often associated with a response bias where participants tend to select responses in a pattern (30). However, the use of repetitive self-report and clinician-rated scales to capture how a pharmacological manipulation alters neuropsychological symptoms is standard practice in psycho-pharmacological experimental as well as FDA regulated clinical trials, and we are not currently aware of another option with which to evaluate whether a drug has an effect on symptoms without measuring those symptoms before and after the administration of a drug.</p><p>While other measures such as tasks and visual analog scales do mitigate some of these limitations, as tasks provide a more objective measure while visual analog scales may capture more subtle differences in the subjective experience and reduce the influence of response bias associated with Likert-type scales, they would still need to be assessed at multiple timepoints. Therefore many of the same limitations would apply e.g. a task would be subject to practise effects. Ultimately, an approach that combines multiple assessment tools, integrating both objective and subjective measures, is preferable to provide a comprehensive overview of a substance’s neuropsychological effects. In this study we do combine a task (Spatial Working Memory Task), that objectively captures a specific cognitive effect, and a subjective measure (PANSS), that aims to capture the broader psychological state and experience. However, the addition of other measures such as visual analog scales could certainly be advantageous for future studies depending on the specific research question.</p><p>Finally, in terms of what explains more variance in the neuropsychological effects of repetitive ketamine, LSD, and psilocybin experiments, to date we are unaware of any previous research that has conducted a systemic investigation directly comparing the predictive power of visual analog scales, questionnaires, and cognitive tasks within the same experiment. However, in this ketamine dataset, we certainly see that both the task and questionnaire measures contribute to the behavioral PCs.</p><p>In summary, we appreciate the importance of the reviewer’s suggestion that practice and familiarity effects are an important potential psychometric confound and have added an additional sentence in the limitation section outlining this:</p><p>While behavioral measures were collected during both peak effects and offset, the use of repetitive question-naires and tasks introduces potential psychometric confounds such as familiarity and practice effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How were sex and age effects addressed in the main results?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this excellent point and have now added an additional supplemental figure showing there is no correlation between ∆ PC1-5 scores or behavioral PC1-2 scores and age (Figure 6—figure supplement 5C,F,I,L,O,R,U). In addition, we found no significant difference in ∆ PC1-2,4-5 scores or behavioral PC1-2 scores between men and women (Figure 6—figure supplement 5B,E,K,N,Q,T). While we do find a significant difference between ∆ PC3 scores (<italic>p-uncorrected</italic> = 0.03), further exploration of PC3 is beyond the scope of this manuscript (Figure 6—figure supplement 5H). However, the possibility that one PC may be related to differences in sex would certainly be an extremely interesting avenue for future research, especially if we are able to replicate this finding with a larger sample and we have now added this point to the Discussion section:</p><p>“To unpack the variation in PC3-5 ∆ GBC a larger sample size is needed, especially given each PC represents a bidirectional axis of variation. A larger sample size would also allow us to investigate alternative models for ketamine’s molecular mechanisms in addition to the indirect hypothesis, such as how ketamine’s effects differ based on NMAR subtypes, or excitatory vs. inhibitory synapses. It would also enable us to explore whether any demographic characterises such as sex relate to specific PCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Effective dimensionality was calculated using the participation ratio and dataset re-sampling was used to control for sample size in this calculation, but dimensionality is also affected by motion within the sample among other noise sources, which are not well discussed. In particular, each drug may affect physiological noise in different ways and this may in turn affect their dimensionality measurement. A more detailed comparison across conditions of the effects of motion and the global signal is required. For instance, the authors could compare FD statistics and properties of the global signal (e.g., variance) and physiological recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that dimensionality may also be affected by motion within the sample, and that a more detailed comparison across the different studies (ketamine, psilocybin, and LSD) is warranted. We have now included an additional supplemental figure examining the relationship between motion and global signal variance across the three studies. Specifically, we show that there is no relationship between mean FD and mean GBC variance across all participants for the placebo or substance scan sessions in the ketamine study or the psilocybin study (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A-B). While we do find a significant correlation between mean FD and mean GBC variance for the substance scan session in the LSD study (r=0.52, p=0.01), this correlation is driven by a single outlier which when removed results in a non-significant correlation (r=-0.05, p=0.83) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5C). Furthermore, when we compared the correlations between mean FD and mean GBC across all three studies using Fisher-Z-Transformation, we found no difference in correlations between any of the studies (even with the LSD outlier left in). Finally, when we directly compared FD in each of the three studies, we found that while FD in both the placebo and substance sessions was significantly higher in the ketamine study compared to the LSD and psilocybin study, we found no difference in ∆ (substance – placebo) FD between the three studies (and it is ∆ (substance – placebo) that is the input for all the analyses included in the manuscript) Figure 1—figure supplement 5E.</p><p>Given we see ketamine shows higher effective dimensionality compared to LSD and psilocybin, and ketamine shows increased FD compared to LSD and psilocybin in the placebo and substance scan sessions, we wanted to investigate whether ketamine’s higher FD could be related to its higher effective dimensionality score. To explore this, we separated the ketamine study participants into those with the higher FD values (i.e. the ’high motion’ group) and those with the lower FD values (i.e. the ’low motion’ group). We then calculated effective dimensionality for the high and low motion groups, and found that effective dimensionality was significantly higher in the low motion group compared to the high motion group for the placebo, substance, and ∆ scan sessions Figure 1—figure supplement 5F. This indicates that the higher motion seen in the ketamine study is not what is driving its higher effective dimensionality score as here we see the opposite pattern: effective dimensionality is higher in the low motion group. Overall, while we cannot rule out that motion may have some influence on effective dimensionality scores, we do not find any evidence to indicate that motion is driving the differences in effective dimensionality between the studies as: (i) we do not find any relationships between mean FD and GBC variance; (ii) there is no difference in ∆ (substance – placebo) FD between the three studies; and (iii) when we compare high motion and low motion participants in the ketamine group we do not find that higher motion is related to higher dimensionality (Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– On a related point, the description of the FD cutoff for scrubbing frames requires more detail. Is the median taken across all scans and all participants? Or all scans within each participant separately? What was the final cutoff determined by this procedure?</p></disp-quote><p>After the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines, movement scrubbing was performed ((27)). Bad frames with possible movement-induced artifactual fluctuations in intensity were identified if they met at least one of the following two criteria ((2)). First, framewise displacement (FD) was computed by summing the displacement across all six rigid body movement correction parameters. Frames in which FD exceeded 0.5mm were flagged. Secondly, normalized root mean square (RMS) was calculated by taking the root mean square of differences in intensity between the current and preceding frame across all voxels and dividing it by the mean intensity. Frames in which RMS exceeded 1.6x the median across the scans (calculated separately for each participant) were also flagged. The flagged frames, as well as the frame immediately preceding and immediately following any flagged frames, were discarded from further analyses. Subjects with more than 50% flagged frames were excluded completely.</p></body></sub-article></article>
