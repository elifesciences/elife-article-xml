strict specificity for their substrates. In the Apicomplexa, convergent evolution of an unusual LDH from MDH produced a difference in specificity exceeding 12 orders of magnitude. The mechanisms responsible for this extraordinary functional shift are currently unknown. Using ancestral protein resurrection, we find that specificity evolved in apicomplexan LDHs by classic neofunctionalization characterized by long-range epistasis, a promiscuous intermediate, and few gain-of-function mutations of large effect. In canonical MDHs and LDHs, a single residue in the active-site loop governs substrate specificity: Arg102 in MDHs and Gln102 in LDHs. During the evolution of the apicomplexan LDH, however, specificity switched via an insertion that shifted the position and identity of this ‘specificity residue’ to Trp107f. Residues far from the active site also determine specificity, as shown by the crystal structures of three ancestral proteins bracketing the key duplication event. This work provides an unprecedented atomic-resolution view of evolutionary trajectories creating a nascent enzymatic function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02304.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02304.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02304.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>How are new genes created? Most of the mutations in the genome of an organism place the organism at some sort of disadvantage, but a small number confer an advantage. The beneficial changes are usually retained by subsequent generations and can ultimately lead to the creation of new genes.</p><p>An example is the gene that encodes an enzyme called lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This enzyme is involved in anaerobic respiration, the process that allows organisms to produce energy without using oxygen. The LDH enzyme is found in many species of animals and parasites, including those that spread malaria and other diseases. However, there are important differences in the structures of the LDH enzyme in animals and some parasites, like the malarial <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, because the genes for the enzymes in these two groups evolved separately.</p><p>The parasite version of the LDH enzyme evolved hundreds of millions of years ago from an enzyme with a similar structure called malate dehydrogenase, which was inherited from bacteria. To work out how the LDH enzyme developed, Boucher et al. predicted and built the ancestral proteins that would have formed as the bacterial enzyme evolved into LDH.</p><p>Studying these structures revealed that two mutations were mainly responsible for this evolution: six amino acids were added to the active site of the enzyme, and one amino acid (at position 102) was replaced by a different amino acid. However, introducing the same mutations into a modern version of the bacterial enzyme did not produce a working form of the LDH enzyme. This suggests that other amino acids, further away from the active site, also influenced how LDH evolved.</p><p>The structures found by Boucher et al. reveal that the enzymes evolved as a result of a gene duplicating, followed by one of the copies evolving a new function. However, some of the mutations responsible for the novel function occurred far from the active site, and it is still unknown how they exert their functional effects. Untangling the important mutations from the mundane will be necessary to fully understand how protein functions are created and how to control them—both of which will aid in developing effective drugs that target essential parasite proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02304.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02304.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ancestral sequence reconstruction</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>specificity</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd><kwd>promiscuity</kwd><kwd>dehydrogenase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM096053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theobald</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM094468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theobald</surname><given-names>Douglas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM105404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Classen</surname><given-names>Scott</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The convergent evolution of unusually strict substrate specificity in apicomplexan LDHs arose by classic neofunctionalization of a duplicated MDH gene via few mutations of large effect.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The common ancestor of the eukaryotic Apicomplexa evolved nearly 1 billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Douzery et al., 2004</xref>), and its modern descendants comprise a large phylum of intracellular parasites that are currently responsible for numerous devastating metazoan diseases, including malaria (<italic>Plasmodium</italic>), toxoplasmosis (<italic>Toxoplasma</italic>), cryptosporidiosis (<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>), cyclosporiasis (<italic>Cyclospora</italic>), and babesiosis (<italic>Babesia</italic>). A key event in the early evolution of the Apicomplexa was the acquisition of a malate dehydrogenase (MDH) via lateral gene transfer from α-proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Golding and Dean, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Madern, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu and Keithly, 2002</xref>). Following a gene duplication event roughly 700–900 Mya, one copy of this MDH evolved a novel substrate specificity to become a highly specific lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) that is now essential to the life cycle of many modern apicomplexans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Royer et al., 1986</xref>). As a core metabolic enzyme that evolved independently of metazoan LDH, the unique apicomplexan LDH has attracted significant attention as a potential drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gomez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Read et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conners et al., 2005</xref>). However, the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that drove this switch in substrate specificity are currently unknown.</p><p>LDH and MDH are homologous, 2-ketoacid oxidoreductases that share both a protein fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rossmann et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a common catalytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birktoft and Banaszak, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clarke et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hart et al., 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clarke et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waldman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Both enzymes are found in central metabolism: MDH catalyzes the interconversion of oxaloacetate and malate in the citric acid cycle, and LDH converts pyruvate to lactate in the final step of anaerobic glycolysis. Despite their structural and catalytic similarities, modern apicomplexan LDHs and MDHs have extraordinarily strict substrate specificity. For example, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>) MDH and LDH each prefer their respective substrates by over six orders of magnitude. The biophysical basis for this extraordinary substrate preference is presently an unresolved question.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02304.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of M/LDH superfamily active site and catalytic mechanism.</title><p>MDH reduces oxaloacetate to malate, in which the R-group is a methylene carboxylate group.

In the LDH/MDH superfamily, closure of this loop over the active site is rate-limiting during catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waldman et al., 1988</xref>), and mutations within this loop have large effects on activity and substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>). For example, simply mutating Gln102 to Arg in the specificity loop of <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> (<italic>Bs</italic>) LDH converts the enzyme into an MDH, shifting specificity from a 10<sup>3</sup>-fold preference for pyruvate to a 10<sup>4</sup>-fold preference for oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, residue numbering is based on the dogfish LDH convention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Eventoff et al., 1977</xref>]). In fact, all known MDHs have an Arg at position 102, while canonical LDHs have a Gln, and consequently residue 102 has been called the 'specificity residue' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapman et al., 1999</xref>). Residue 102 is thought to contribute to substrate discrimination by balancing the substrate charge within the active site: the positively charged Arg in MDHs forms a salt bridge with the C4 carboxylate of oxaloacetate, whereas the neutral Gln in canonical LDHs packs with the C3 methyl of pyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Yet, attempts to convert an MDH into an LDH by mutating Arg102 to Gln have met with limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicholls et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cendrin et al., 1993</xref>). In the apicomplexan LDHs, residue 102 is not a Gln but a Lys, a relatively conservative substitution compared to the MDH Arg.

Gene duplication is widely considered the major force that has driven the evolutionary diversity of protein functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>). There are three general ways duplicated genes can be fixed in a population by selection: (1) ‘dosage selection’, beneficial increase in dosage due to multiple copies, (2) ‘subfunctionalization’, specialization of previously existing functions, or (3) ‘neofunctionalization’, creation of a novel function through the accumulation of beneficial, gain-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohno, 1970</xref>). Most mutations, however, are either neutral or detrimental. A new duplicated gene typically degrades to a crippled pseudogene before it can acquire the rare beneficial mutations needed to confer a selectable function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Walsh, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>). Hence, classical neofunctionalization has fallen out of favor in preference for models that begin with the duplication of a multifunctional protein, such as ‘specialization’ and ‘subfunctionalization’ models. Currently the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that create novel functions in gene duplicates are fiercely debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conant and Wolfe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soskine and Tawfik, 2010</xref>), and there are few clear examples of classic neofunctionalization or gain-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Rosenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bridgham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The apicomplexan LDH and MDH enzyme family provides an exceptional model system for investigating several long-standing questions in molecular evolution, including the mechanisms available to convergent evolution, the number of mutations required to produce a nascent function, the role of promiscuous intermediates during evolution of function, and the effects of epistasis on evolutionary irreversibility. In order to identify the biophysical and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for pyruvate specificity in apicomplexan LDHs, we have reconstructed ancestral proteins along the evolutionary trajectories leading to modern apicomplexan MDHs and LDHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We kinetically and structurally characterized the ancestral proteins together with multiple evolutionary intermediates. This work provides a clear example of neofunctionalization in protein evolution and the first crystal structures documenting the evolution of a new enzyme.

Despite these alterations within the catalytic loop, all other catalytic residues (Arg109, Asp168, Arg171, and His195) are conserved. Only one taxon within the HicDH clade has been functionally characterized, DHL2_LACCO, which is a specific hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feil et al., 1994</xref>).

The ‘LDH-like’ MDH clade additionally contains archaeal dehydrogenases, which are basal and group to the exclusion of the bacterial MDHs.</p><p>Intriguingly, three different groups of LDH proteins cluster with high confidence outside of the canonical LDH clade. A set of trichomonad LDHs found in the cytosolic-like MDH clade are thought to have evolved from a recent gene duplication of an MDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu and Fiser, 1999</xref>). The Trichomonads appear to lack a canonical LDH. A prominent eukaryotic group of LDH and MDH proteins from the Apicomplexa nests deep within the bacterial ‘LDH-like’ MDHs, sister to many Rickettsiales sequences, signifying a horizontal gene transfer event from α-proteobacteria to the eukaryotic Apicomplexa. We find no evidence that the Apicomplexa have canonical LDH or conventional eukaryotic-type MDH (either cytosolic- or mitochondrial-like MDHs), despite searching in many available complete apicomplexan genomes (multiple Eimeria, Neospora, Toxoplasma, Plasmodium, and Cryptosporidium species) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heiges et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gajria et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aurrecoechea et al., 2009</xref>).

The ML root position apparently splits the tree into two large groups: one which contains the cytosolic- and mitochondrial-like MDHs, which are largely dimeric, and another which contains the canonical LDHs, ‘LDH-like’ MDHs, and HicDHs, which are primarily tetrameric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the ML root position is robust to variation in taxon coverage, the exact location is poorly supported. Nevertheless, there is strong support for a root position within the central MDH section of the tree and outside of the five identified clades, including the canonical LDH clade (confidence level &gt;0.99985 according to the aLRT), indicating that the canonical LDHs evolved from an ancestral MDH. The global rooting and the location of the three separate LDH groups, deep within MDH clades, indicate that LDH enzymes have evolved convergently from MDHs at least four times in the superfamily.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An insertion in the catalytic loop of apicomplexan LDHs</title><p>In the present work, our focus is on the convergent evolution of the unusual apicomplexan LDHs. With the α-proteobacterial ‘LDH-like’ MDHs as the closest outgroup, the apicomplexan enzymes are split into two main groups: LDHs belonging to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> and related protists, and MDHs belonging to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>. Apart from their atypical phylogenetic position, the apicomplexan MDHs appear as typical α-proteobacterial ‘LDH-like’ MDHs, containing all the key catalytic residues including Arg102. The <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> LDHs are an exception, being nested within the apicomplexan MDH clade partitioned from the rest of the apicomplexan LDHs. <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> LDHs have a Gly at position 102 and are thought to be a product of an independent, convergent duplication event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madern et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the large apicomplexan LDH clade is demarcated by a unique, conserved five-residue insertion in the active site loop. While the apicomplexan LDH and MDH proteins are moderately divergent, with about 45% sequence identity, the differences are largely confined to exterior residues removed from the active sites. One important difference is that the apicomplexan LDHs have Lys102 for the ‘specificity residue’, rather than a Gln as found in the canonical LDHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Apicomplexan proteins frequently contain numerous insertions relative to proteins from other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Feng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kissinger and DeBarry, 2011</xref>), a characteristic thought to result from various factors, including high AT genome content, DNA strand slippage, double strand break repair, high recombination rates, and selection pressure for parasite antigenic variation. Except for Met106, the amino acid and coding sequence immediately flanking the apicomplexan LDH loop insertion is largely conserved with α-proteobacterial MDHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is therefore likely that a mutation ‘expanded’ the Met106 codon to code for six residues, resulting in the observed five-residue insertion and the Met106Lys mutation. Henceforth we will refer to this expansion mutation as the ‘six-residue loop insertion’.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trp107f is the modern apicomplexan LDH specificity residue</title><p>In the modern apicomplexan enzymes, the six-residue insertion in the LDH specificity loop (positions 99–112) induces two significant structural changes relative to MDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). First, LDH residue Lys102 is excluded from of the active site, unlike the corresponding Arg102 in MDH, which is enclosed within the active site and participates in functionally important interactions with the substrate. Second, LDH Trp107f, which is part of the novel insertion, occupies the same space as Arg102 in MDH (by convention, residues in the insertion are labeled using numbers and letters to maintain consistency with homologous positions in the dogfish LDH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The only prominent structural difference between the active sites of the LDH and MDH proteins is the replacement of MDH Arg102 with LDH Trp107f. Trp107f is positioned where it could presumably interact with the distinguishing C3 methyl of the pyruvate substrate, while MDH Arg102 interacts with the C4 carboxylate of oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapman et al., 1999</xref>). As a bulky, hydrophobic residue, Trp107f could recognize pyruvate in preference to oxaloacetate by two mechanisms: a hydrophobic interaction with the pyruvate C3 methyl vs the negatively charged oxaloacetate methylene carboxylate and steric occlusion of the methylene carboxylate of oxaloacetate. Furthermore, Trp107f is conserved in all apicomplexan LDHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting negative selection and functional importance. We therefore hypothesized that Trp107f plays an important role in pyruvate recognition.</p><p>We tested the functional importance of residues in the specificity loop in <italic>Pf</italic>LDH with an ‘alanine scan’ by individually mutating each residue in positions 101–108 to an alanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, note Ala103 was mutated to a serine). We assessed the activity of the mutants using k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>, a measure of enzymatic specificity and catalytic efficiency, as determined from steady state kinetic assays. Mutating Trp107f to Ala reduced pyruvate activity by five orders of magnitude, whereas mutations at all other positions had effects less than a single order of magnitude, including the canonical specificity residue at position 102. The Trp107fAla mutation affects both k<sub>cat</sub> (1500-fold decrease) and K<sub>m</sub> (50-fold increase).</p><p>To assess the effects of Trp107fAla mutation on the specificity loop conformation, we solved the crystal structure of <italic>Pf</italic>LDH-W107fA (1.1 Å ) in the presence of oxamate and NADH. The protein crystallizes in the same space group as the wild-type <italic>Pf</italic>LDH, with nearly identical cell dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In the W107fA mutant, the specificity loop is disordered between residues Thr101 and Arg109, as is often seen in structures in which the loop is in the open conformation. In the mutant, residues 112–115 are in a linear α-helical conformation, in contrast to the wild-type <italic>Pf</italic>LDH closed state which has a very prominent 60° kink in the α-helix at Pro114. Thus, the only significant difference between the wild-type and mutant structures is that the <italic>Pf</italic>LDH-W107fA specificity loop is found in the open conformation, consistent with weaker binding of substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results indicate that Trp107f is necessary for pyruvate activity in apicomplexan LDHs, and that it has become the new ‘specificity residue’ despite the fact that Trp107f does not align in sequence with the canonical specificity residue at position 102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The loop insert fails to swap specificity in modern LDH and MDH</title><p>During evolution, the six-residue insertion displaced the canonical specificity residue at position 102 and apparently switched substrate preference in apicomplexan LDHs. If this insertion is sufficient for pyruvate recognition, then adding the insertion to a modern apicomplexan MDH should convert the enzyme to an LDH. To test this hypothesis, we incorporated the six-residue insertion from <italic>Pf</italic>LDH into the catalytic loop of <italic>Pf</italic>MDH (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH-INS) and the <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> (<italic>Cp</italic>) MDH (<italic>Cp</italic>MDH-INS).

Like other MDHs, the apicomplexan MDHs have an Arg at position 102 that is important for oxaloacetate recognition; in the modern apicomplexan LDHs position 102 is a Lys. The Arg102Lys mutation may be necessary to eliminate oxaloacetate activity and increase pyruvate activity. Therefore, we also mutated Arg102 to Lys in the <italic>Pf</italic>MDH chimera (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH-R102K-INS).

In the modern enzymes, substrate specificity cannot be switched with mutations involving the loop insert and position 102, indicating that additional residues govern substrate preference.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The ancestral MDH and LDH enzymes are specific and highly active</title><p>The apicomplexan LDH and MDH phylogeny strongly suggests that after (or coincident with) the crucial gene duplication event, the nascent LDH branch gained pyruvate activity due to the six-residue insertion in the specificity loop. This presents a conundrum, as our mutation trials in the modern enzymes failed to recapitulate the historical swap in specificity. However, the modern apicomplexan LDH and MDH enzymes differ by over 200 residues in addition to the loop insert and Arg102Lys, differences that have accumulated in the descendants of the ancestral MDH and LDH. Any of these differences may detrimentally affect the ability to switch substrate specificity with the insertion in the modern enzymes. We therefore reasoned that the ancestral background may be necessary for swapping specificity with the loop insertion. To test this, we reconstructed and characterized four key ancestral enzymes: AncMDH1, the ancestral protein that was transferred from α-proteobacteria to the archaic Apicomplexa, AncMDH2, the last common ancestor of all apicomplexan MDHs and LDHs, found at the critical duplication event, AncMDH3, the last common ancestor of all modern apicomplexan MDHs, and AncLDH, the last common ancestor of modern apicomplexan LDHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>All four ancestral proteins are highly active in steady state kinetic assays, with substrate preferences and catalytic efficiencies that are similar to their modern apicomplexan descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), despite sharing only 49–71% sequence identity with the modern apicomplexan proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Position 102 in fact differs in the four convergent LDH families: Gln in canonical LDHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>), Lys in the apicomplexan LDHs, Gly in <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> LDHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madern et al., 2004</xref>), and Leu in trichomonad LDHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu and Fiser, 1999</xref>). Could the ancestral apicomplexan MDH have evolved pyruvate specificity by any of these alternative routes? To answer this question, we evaluated the potential of these different amino acids at the 102 position to confer pyruvate specificity in the AncMDH2 background. Each mutation increases pyruvate activity, but none result in a highly specific LDH. The canonical mutation (Arg102Gln) results in the largest gain in pyruvate activity (2800-fold) and the smallest loss of oxaloacetate activity (2500-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

All known MDHs have Arg at position 102, while canonical LDHs have Gln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chapman et al., 1999</xref>). In the classic explanation of the molecular mechanism of substrate specificity, residue 102 discriminates between pyruvate and oxaloacetate primarily via charge conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>). In MDHs, the positively charged Arg interacts with and balances the negatively charged carboxylate of oxaloacetate. If pyruvate were to bind in the active site, loop closure would result in a buried and unbalanced positive charge, which is unfavorable. In canonical LDHs, the neutral Gln interacts with the neutral pyruvate methyl group. Oxaloacetate binding would similarly result in the unfavorable burial of an unbalanced negative charge.</p><p>In the apicomplexan LDHs, evolution has converged on pyruvate specificity using an alternative molecular mechanism. Residue 102 is not a Gln but a positively charged Lys, similar to Arg102 of MDHs, leading many researchers to wonder why apicomplexan LDHs lack activity towards oxaloacetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gomez et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dando et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kavanagh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shoemark et al., 2007</xref>). However, during the evolution of the apicomplexan LDH from the ancestral MDH, the six-residue insertion in the active site loop shifted both the position and identity of the ‘specificity residue’ from Arg102 to Trp107f. Due to the insertion, residue 102 no longer interacts with the substrate and is extruded from the active site. In contrast, the hydrophobic Trp107f packs against the C3 methyl of the pyruvate substrate. Similar to the canonical LDH, oxaloacetate binding would result in an unbalanced and buried negative charge. As a large bulky residue, Trp107f can also occlude binding of the larger oxaloacetate, in which a methylene carboxylate replaces the pyruvate methyl.</p><p>However, as discussed in detail below, this simplistic explanation is complicated by long-range epistatic interactions. When the six-residue insertion is introduced into the modern apicomplexan MDH, specificity is not switched; both specificity and activity are lost. Similarly, removal of the insertion from the modern apicomplexan LDHs fails to swap specificity and kills the enzymes. Therefore, while Trp107f is necessary for substrate specificity in the apicomplexan enzymes (as indicated by the alanine scan mutations), it is insufficient to confer specificity.</p><p>The bifunctionality of AncMDH2-INS and AncMDH2-INS-59Mut also presents a conundrum. Why do these constructs have high activity towards both pyruvate and oxaloacetate substrates? The crystal structure of AncMDH2-INS offers few clues, since the loop insertion, including Trp107f, adopts the same conformation as seen in AncLDH and the modern apicomplexan enzymes. Both the AncMDH2-INS and AncMDH2-INS-59Mut constructs have an Arg at position 102, like the MDHs. In fact, the bifunctional AncMDH2-INS-59Mut enzyme differs from the strict AncLDH by only a R102K mutation, suggesting that Arg102 is responsible for the oxaloacetate activity of AncMDH2-INS and AncMDH2-INS-59Mut. We speculate that perhaps the enzymes change conformation depending upon the substrate. When using pyruvate, these bifunctional enzymes may adopt an LDH-like conformation in which Trp107f interacts with the substrate (as seen in the crystal structure). On the other hand, when presented with oxaloacetate, perhaps Trp107f flips out of the active site, and Arg102 flips in to interact with substrate in a manner similar to the canonical MDHs. We are currently testing this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Apicomplexan LDH evolved by classical neofunctionalization</title><p>Our data show that apicomplexan LDHs evolved from a horizontally transferred proteobacterial MDH by a classic neofunctionalization mechanism of gene duplication.

AncMDH2's k<sub>cat</sub> for pyruvate is 0.07 s<sup>−1</sup>, with a K<sub>m</sub> of 20 mM, while the physiological concentration of pyruvate is estimated to be about three orders-of-magnitude lower (e.g., ∼50 μM in human erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garrett and Grisham, 2005</xref>], the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> host during its blood stage). Based on these kinetic parameters, each AncMDH2 reduces one pyruvate molecule per hour. While the enzyme can be forced to reduce pyruvate in vitro, this negligible activity is unlikely to have been subjected to selection in vivo. Therefore, the various specialization hypotheses, which require a promiscuous ancestor, are poor models for apicomplexan LDH evolution. Activity towards pyruvate increased by over seven orders of magnitude on the evolutionary lineage between AncMDH2 and AncLDH, indicating neofunctionalization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A highly active, promiscuous intermediate</title><p>One of the most favored specialization models is ‘escape from adaptive conflict’ (EAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</xref>). EAC holds that functional specialization is driven by an inability to simultaneously optimize multiple functions on a single protein scaffold. Gene duplication relieves this constraint and allows for the independent optimization of conflicting functions. Although the apicomplexan AncMDH2 is highly specific, promiscuous intermediates did play a role in the functional transition between AncMDH2 and AncLDH. AncMDH2-INS and AncMDH2-INS-59Mut have high levels of MDH and LDH activity in a single protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Both the presence of bifunctional intermediates and the high specificity of AncMDH2 conflict with fundamental predictions of the EAC specialization model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Convergent evolution of apicomplexan LDH involved long-range epistasis</title><p>The evolution of apicomplexan LDHs involved strong epistasis that has profoundly influenced the convergent evolution of pyruvate activity. Epistasis refers to interactions between residues that potentiate the effects of a mutation depending on the presence or absence of other residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harms and Thornton, 2010</xref>). Epistasis can constrain the order of mutations and the pathways accessible to evolution, and hence it is of great importance in understanding the evolution of novel functions. In the apicomplexan dehydrogenases, the evolutionary mutations that switched specificity from oxaloacetate to pyruvate (the six-residue insertion and Arg102Lys) are insufficient to confer pyruvate activity in modern apicomplexan MDHs (<italic>Pf</italic>MDH-R102K, <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-INS, <italic>Cp</italic>MDH-INS, <italic>Pf</italic>MDH-R102K-INS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, these mutations are sufficient to confer pyruvate function and specificity in the AncMDH2 background (AncMDH2-INS, AncMDH2-INS-R102K, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, removal of the insert from the modern LDHs (<italic>Pf</italic>LDH-DEL and <italic>Tg</italic>LDH2-DEL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) kills the enzymes, while removal of the insert from the ancestral LDH (AncMDH2-R102K-59Mut, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) results in a weak MDH. The different effects of these mutations, depending upon the sequence of the rest of the protein, provide direct evidence of epistatic interactions.</p><p>Why do these historical mutations ‘work’ in the ancestral enzymes, but not in the modern ones? Epistatic interactions are often mediated by direct physical contact. For example, the active site of the ancestral MDH could have certain residues that the modern MDH lacks, residues that interact with the insertion and allow it to preferentially bind pyruvate. However, the active sites of the ancestral and modern MDHs are identical in sequence and virtually indistinguishable in structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), as are the active sites of the ancestral and modern LDHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and the AncMDH2-INS intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In fact, the active sites of the MDHs and the LDHs are also identical in sequence except for the 102 position, and they are otherwise highly structurally similar. Therefore, residues remote from the active sites necessarily affect the substrate specificity of the enzymes.</p><p>In principle, these long-range epistatic residue interactions could differentially modify the structure of the active site. Certain residues found in the ancestral MDH, but not in the modern MDH, could position the active site residues so that they allowed the insertion to confer pyruvate activity. In this scenario the active site residues of the ancestral and modern MDHs would be identical, but their conformations would differ due to interactions with residues in other parts of the protein. However, the crystal structures reveal ancestral, intermediate, and modern active sites that are nearly indistinguishable, suggesting that epistasis has modified the protein dynamics or shifted the energy landscape, effects that are largely invisible to static crystal structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Epistasis prevents mechanistic convergence in the LDH/MDH superfamily</title><p>Interestingly, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<italic>Bs</italic>) LDH reverts to an MDH with only a single mutation, Gln102Arg, indicating a lack of complicating epistatic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>). The kinetics of wild-type <italic>Bs</italic>LDH with pyruvate are comparable to those for the Gln102Arg mutant with oxaloacetate (e.g., <italic>Bs</italic>LDH has a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for pyruvate of 4.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and the <italic>Bs</italic>LDH-Q102R mutant has the same k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for oxaloacetate). However, <italic>Bs</italic>LDH likely is an exception in the LDH/MDH superfamily, since the reverse mutation (Arg102Gln) fails to switch specificity in MDHs from two other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicholls et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cendrin et al., 1993</xref>). In <italic>Haloarcula marismortui</italic> (<italic>Hm</italic>) MDH, the Arg102Gln mutation switches specificity, but the mutant's k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for pyruvate is 200-fold less than the wild-type's k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> for oxaloacetate. The Arg102Gln mutation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>Ec</italic>) MDH is even less effective, as it converts a highly active MDH to an enzyme with low activity on both substrates (10,000-fold lower k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>). Hence, the strong epistasis observed in apicomplexan LDH and MDHs is likely a general phenomenon within the superfamily.</p><p>LDH evolved convergently from MDH four separate times in the superfamily, but did the activity evolve by the same mechanism each time? Each event has resulted in a different change at the specificity residue (position 102) within the catalytic loop. However, the epistatic effects seen in the apicomplexan, <italic>H. marismortui,</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> dehydrogenases indicate that in general position 102 is not solely responsible for the transition from MDH to LDH. In order for the historical LDH mutations to confer pyruvate specificity, additional residues must be present to provide a permissive background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Due to the presence of different sets of permissive mutations, LDH activity has evolved from an MDH under epistatic constraints by a different mechanism four separate times.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Large effect, gain-of-function mutation</title><p>The evolution of AncLDH from AncMDH2 involves a shift in substrate specificity by 12 orders-of-magnitude. Through the characterization of possible evolutionary intermediates, we have found that just two mutations are responsible for the great majority of this switch: the six-residue insertion and the Arg102Lys point mutation. Mutagenesis within the insertion indicates that only a single position, Trp107f, contributes strongly to pyruvate activity and specificity. Both the insertion and Arg102Lys have a large effect on preference for pyruvate vs oxaloacetate, although by differentially affecting activity towards each substrate. Incorporating the six-residue insertion into AncMDH2's substrate loop results in a 12,000-fold gain in pyruvate activity with little effect on oxaloacetate activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Conversely, mutating Arg102 to Lys reduces oxaloacetate activity by more than 2500-fold, with minimal effect on pyruvate activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The apicomplexan LDH six-residue insertion is an exceptionally large gain-of-function mutation: it enhances pyruvate activity by more than four orders of magnitude while barely affecting oxaloacetate activity. In contrast, other well-studied mutations of large effect are often predominantly deleterious towards one function while modestly enhancing another. The textbook example of a gain-of-function mutation is Gln102Arg in <italic>Bs</italic>LDH, which causes a 10<sup>7</sup>-fold change in the enzyme's specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>). The Gln102Arg mutation reduces pyruvate activity by more than 8000-fold, while enhancing activity towards oxaloacetate by only 1000-fold. Another example is given by <italic>E. coli</italic> isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), where seven mutations are necessary to switch the cofactor specificity from a 7000-fold preference for NADP to a 200-fold preference for NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 1995</xref>). Within this set of mutations, two reduce specificity for NADP by 6000-fold, whereas the rest enhance NAD usage 200-fold. Thus, while mutations can have both deleterious and beneficial effects on different functions, the deleterious effects typically appear greater than enhancement.</p><p>In previous ancestral sequence reconstruction studies, mutations of large effect are in fact usually loss-of-function rather than gain-of-function (e.g., RNaseA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jermann et al., 1995</xref>], chymase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wouters et al., 2003</xref>], and glucocorticoid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridgham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ortlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2011</xref>]). In these studies, the modern proteins are generally specific for one substrate, whereas the ancestral proteins are promiscuous. Furthermore, the activity of the ancestral protein is comparable to the modern descendants. Therefore, these proteins specialized by accumulating deleterious mutations, with the modern, specialized activity being the ‘last function standing’. For example, the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor binds three steroid hormones tightly (EC<sub>50</sub> &lt;10 nM for aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone, and cortisol), while the modern receptors bind only cortisol (EC<sub>50</sub> ∼ 100 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ortlund et al., 2007</xref>). Seven historical mutations produced the modern cortisol preference by completely eliminating aldosterone and deoxycorticosterone sensitivity yet reducing cortisol sensitivity only 50-fold. In other ancestral reconstruction studies, function-enhancing mutations have relatively minor effects, all less than a 50-fold gain in k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Rosenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Risso et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>During the evolution of the malate and lactate dehydrogenase superfamily, pyruvate activity has converged multiple times despite strong constraints due to epistasis. While epistasis may constrain evolutionary options locally, there are nevertheless multiple ways to ‘skin the cat’ in more distant regions of protein sequence space. The apicomplexan enzymes provide a clear example of neofunctionalization in protein evolution and thereby validate the plausibility of this particular mechanism of gene duplication. Specialization mechanisms may be more common, but the evolution of novel function does not require a promiscuous genesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>The PDB accession codes for the coordinates and structure factor files reported in this paper are 4PLC, 4PLF, 4PLG, 4PLH, 4PLT, 4PLV, 4PLW, 4PLY, and 4PLZ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Modern sequences</title><p>Protein sequences used in the phylogenetic analyses were identified through searches of the non-redundant database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pruitt et al., 2009</xref>) with the BLASTP algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) using selected query sequences.

As a result, oxaloacetate preparations contain appreciable pyruvate contamination (approximately 1–3% from Sigma-Aldrich, depending on batch) and must be handled with care. All oxaloacetate stock solutions were made fresh before each assay and kept on ice to keep decarboxylation to a minimum. For enzymes with low pyruvate activity, the oxaloacetate decarboxylation has a negligible affect on measured rates. However, enzymes with appreciable pyruvate activity can display an apparent, artifactual oxaloacetate activity that is due to pyruvate contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parker and Holbrook, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilks et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shoemark et al., 2007</xref>).

All datasets were indexed, integrated, and scaled with XDS/XSCALE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xds, 2010</xref>). Datasets included all reflections that were significant according to the CC(1/2) criterion (flagged as ‘*’ in the XDS output), which typically extended to much weaker data than the conventional 2 sigma cutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karplus and Diederichs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diederichs and Karplus, 2013</xref>). The resolution of the data is defined as the resolution bin where CC(1/2) = 0.5. Structures were solved by molecular replacement using AutoMR in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Homology models for the AncMDH2 and AncLDH* datasets were generated by the Phyre2 server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</xref>). The AncMDH2 homology model was based on the structure for <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> MDH (2hjr, 62% sequence identity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vedadi et al., 2007</xref>), while the model for AncLDH* was based on the <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> LDH1 structure (1pzf, 65% sequence identity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kavanagh et al., 2004</xref>). AncMDH2-INS datasets were solved using the AncMDH2 structure as the model. <italic>Pf</italic> LDH_W107fA dataset was solved using the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> LDH structure (1t2d) structure as a model. All models were improved by rounds of manual building in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and refinement by phenix.refine in PHENIX. Model quality of all structures was validated with MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) in PHENIX. All structural alignments were generated using THESEUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Theobald and Wuttke, 2008</xref>). Structure images were rendered with PyMOL.</p><p>In all structure models, the enzyme is generally found in either of two states, the loop-open state or the loop-closed state, and often both states are observed in different monomers (chains) in the asymmetric unit. Loop-open states are generally more disordered (with higher B-factors) and sometimes the chain could not be traced for the loop. In loop-open states the substrate typically also has weak electron density and cannot be fit reliably. In loop-closed states the substrate generally has strong electron density, but complications arose for proteins co-crystallized with lactate and malate.</p><p>NADH will eventually oxidize to NAD+ spontaneously in the crystals and during data collection due to oxidative radiation damage. Malate can also oxidize to oxaloacetate in the crystals, and oxaloacetate is expected to spontaneously decarboxylate to pyruvate relatively quickly (over the multi-week time frame of crystallization). Additionally, pyruvate spontaneously reacts with NAD+ to form a covalent pyruvate-NAD adduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">White et al., 1976</xref>). Although we added NADH to the crystallization mixture, we cannot reliably determine whether NADH, NAD+, or a mixture of the two is found in the crystals, and we have variable evidence for the pyruvate-NAD adduct. In both of the structures crystallized with malate (4plc and 4ply), the substrate electron density and loop conformation indicated that the malate had converted to pyruvate and/or lactate. Therefore, for the enzymes crystallized with lactate and malate, the fine details of substrate conformation and identity in the models should be viewed with skepticism, as we are fairly confident we have an unresolvable mixture of pyruvate, lactate, and pyruvate-NAD adduct in the active site, all of which will produce similar electron density. These concerns with substrate do not apply to the oxamate models (although the uncertainty in cofactor state still remains). Finally, in the 4plw model (AncMDH2 crystallized with lactate), clear phosphates were seen in the active site instead of lactate, presumably carried through from the initial purification step.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, NIH grants R01GM096053 and R01GM094468.

If you have any questions about prioritizing changes in response to these comments, please do not hesitate to contact us for advice.</p><p>Please examine these comments with great care. They come from two preeminent experts and both reviewers will need to be satisfied with your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Boucher et al explore the genesis and evolution of apicomplexan lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by gene duplication of a malate dehydrogenase (MDH) followed by a shift in substrate specificity. They combine phylogeny, sequence analysis and ancestral reconstruction with protein crystallography and enzymatic assays to determine sequences underlying substrate specificity and possible evolutionary paths for the shift in function. This multi-functional approach provides new insights into the shift of enzyme function in this case, and may be relevant to the evolution of other enzymes.</p><p>The omission of the underlying data for the sequence analysis – protein sequences, alignments, trees, and ancestral sequences – severely detract from the paper, both as an overall advance in understanding of this enzyme evolution and for the general method, as well as for my ability to review it. I strongly urge that these data be provided in a useful manner (i.e. machine-readable text files, not pdfs).</p><p>The paper is well written from an English language and grammatical point of view, but I found the flow of the arguments to be difficult to follow, frequently overstated, and not always cohesive.</p><p><italic>MDH/LDH Phylogeny Analysis:</italic></p><p>The breadth of the phylogenetic analysis is not clear. The use of several starting proteins for Blast analysis, and a tight cutoff rather than psi-blast or HMMs, cast some doubt on how comprehensive the survey of MDH/LDH homologs is.</p><p>The phylogenetic analysis would greatly benefit from an explicit discussion of the species distributions. Are the mitochondrial and cytosolic MDHs unique to and universal across free-living eukaryotes? Where do bacterial and archaeal MDHs fall? Are the LDHs also found in all free-living eukaryotes? Why was LDH re-invented in apicomplexans and Trichomonas - do they also have a canonical LDH, or as obligate parasites, did their ancestors lose it? Can glycolysis still proceed and lactate be excreted in the absence of LDH? The answers to these questions are important in providing an evolutionary and functional context for the evolution of these new LDH genes and the possible functionality of ancestral enzymes of relaxed specificity.</p><p>The text states that “α/β- glucosidases and aspartate dehydrogenases as outgroups”, but only a single α-glucosidase is shown in the figure.

A more complete analysis of the substantial changes between Apicomplexan MDH and LDH proteins at the beginning would be far more helpful, informative, and clear. This should include mention of position 103, which is within the loop region and is substantially different in LDH (small hydrophobic) from MDH (basic). It is not surprising that an alanine scan would have little effect on this position; a mutation to the 'ancestral' lysine would be more informative.

Cited previous examples include RNaseA, an antifreeze protein in Antarctic zoarcid fish (PMID: 21115821), and retinoic acid receptors (PMID: 16839186). It could also be argued that since the MDH/LDH system simply involves changing substrate specificity, that the change is not particularly 'neo' but rather a tuning of an existing function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this interesting manuscript, the authors describe a well-supported case of neofunctionalization after gene duplication. The authors chose a unique enzyme that is a malaria drug target and convincingly demonstrate that it gained a new function after originating by gene duplication of an enzyme horizontally transferred from bacteria. Interestingly, this new function is not only essential for these protist parasites, but also has an analogous (independently evolved, convergent) counterpart in other organisms.</p><p>I think this might become a textbook example of neofunctionalization, because it is so thoroughly supported by ample evidence, from computation to biochemistry and crystallography. As such, I think it would make the paper more attractive, if some of the material is summarized better. E.g., a summary “graphical abstract” figure that shows the logic of the project, and tells the whole story at a glance might be great to have. Currently, the key important points drown in the minutiae of rationalizations and experimental details. Not that the manuscript is poorly written. I think it is very good, and the subsection title lines are particularly well-crafted. However, some further thinking might be in order to increase the impact of the paper and make it more accessible to a wider audience. Also, it would be great to articulate and summarize explicitly the mechanisms that confer specificity in 3 enzymes: MDH and two convergent LDHs. E.g., “characterized by long-range epistasis, a promiscuous intermediate, and relatively few gain-of-function mutations of large effect” is an excellent summary, but it does not help much in terms of mechanistic understanding. I would love to see (not necessarily in the Abstract) equally crisp mechanistic summary. The beauty of this work is in gaining so many insights into the mechanism, and I think it should be highlighted better.</p><p>On a technical side, I am impressed with the crystallography and the role of structures in the project. It should be noted, however, that ancestral reconstruction from highly divergent present-day sequences is a very difficult problem and is prone to many types of errors. The authors should be commended on exploring alternative reconstructions. Also, along the lines that final results justify the means, the authors show that “resurrected” proteins are very specific to their expected substrates. However, I would like to see more discussion and thought devoted to uncertainty with reconstruction, and zooming in the regions and substitutions that confer specificity. I am not suggesting any additional experiments – what the authors did looks sufficient – but simply giving a reader better appreciation that ancestral reconstruction is always highly hypothetical and is never truly reliable might be useful. Is it at all conceivable that the ancestral enzyme had broader specificity, but reconstruction methods were overwhelmed by the number of bacterial MDHs or what not?

They combine phylogeny, sequence analysis and ancestral reconstruction with protein crystallography and enzymatic assays to determine sequences underlying substrate specificity and possible evolutionary paths for the shift in function. This multi-functional approach provides new insights into the shift of enzyme function in this case, and may be relevant to the evolution of other enzymes</italic>.</p><p><italic>The omission of the underlying data for the sequence analysis -protein sequences, alignments, trees, and ancestral sequences – severely detract from the paper, both as an overall advance in understanding of this enzyme evolution and for the general method, as well as for my ability to review it. I strongly urge that these data be provided in a useful manner (i.e. machine-readable text files, not pdfs)</italic>.</p><p>We agree, apologize for the oversight, and now provide this important additional data and information, including all sequences, alignments, and trees in plain text.</p><p>MDH/LDH Phylogeny Analysis:</p><p><italic>The breadth of the phylogenetic analysis is not clear. The use of several starting proteins for Blast analysis, and a tight cutoff rather than psi-blast or HMMs, cast some doubt on how comprehensive the survey of MDH/LDH homologs is</italic>.</p><p>We want to emphasize that the purpose of our paper is not to provide a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of all MDH/LDH homologs, as this has been done previously by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Madern 2002</xref>, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Golding and Dean 1998</xref>; Zhou and Keithly 2002). Our analysis, though much broader than these studies, largely supports the major conclusions from the earlier work. Rather, we focus on the Apicomplexan homologs, esp. the convergent LDHs, which have received less phylogenetic attention.</p><p><italic>The phylogenetic analysis would greatly benefit from an explicit discussion of the species distributions. Are the mitochondrial and cytosolic MDHs unique to and universal across free-living eukaryotes? Where do bacterial and archaeal MDHs fall? Are the LDHs also found in all free-living eukaryotes? Why was LDH re-invented in apicomplexans and Trichomonas – do they also have a canonical LDH, or as obligate parasites, did their ancestors lose it? Can glycolysis still proceed and lactate be excreted in the absence of LDH? The answers to these questions are important in providing an evolutionary and functional context for the evolution of these new LDH genes and the possible functionality of ancestral enzymes of relaxed specificity</italic>.</p><p>We have now added a few sentences addressing each of these questions in the main text (“Results: LDH enzymes have evolved independently at least four times”), including a new supplemental figure highlighting the bacterial, eukaryotic, and archaeal distribution on the global tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>The text states that “α/β- glucosidases and aspartate dehydrogenases as outgroups”, but only a single α-glucosidase is shown in the figure.

These discrepancies should be resolved</italic>.</p><p>As explained in the Methods, the closest Rossmann folds were used to root the tree, as determined from a profile-based phylogenetic analysis.

Briefly, the aLRT is an approximate log-likelihood ratio statistic, where raw values &gt; 8 are roughly “statistically significant”, representing an e^8=3000-fold better fit of the tree to the data when the clade is present (in terms of the likelihood). The aLRT can also be used in a traditional significance test to provide a confidence level (between 0 and 1, similar to a probability) for a clade. While the exact ML position of the root is poorly supported, there is very high support for a root position within the MDH portion of the tree, somewhere near the center.</p><p>Sequence Analysis and Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction:</p><p><italic>The authors oversimplify the initial comparison of apicomplexan LDH and MDH proteins, focusing on the 5-AA insert (confusingly referred to as a “6-residue loop insertion”), resulting in an awkward backtrack in later sections, where they are forced to consider additional changes between sequences.

Our reasoning was based on the following structural evidence. In the crystal structures, the MDH Lys103 points in the opposite direction of Arg102, away from the active site, not contacting the substrate; (the positively charged nitrogens in the two sidechains are over 11 angstroms distant). Similarly, the beta carbon of the LDH 103 residue (Ala,Val,Leu, or Ile) points away from the active site into solution, in the opposite direction of Lys102, at the tip of the insertion in the loop, relatively far from active site and substrate. Nevertheless, data always trumps words, so at the reviewer’s suggestion we made the A103K mutation in both the modern <italic>Pf</italic>LDH and in the ancestor. Both mutants are kinetically indistinguishable from WT for both pyruvate and oxaloacetate, confirming our original inclination.</p><p><italic>The claim that Trp107f is the “modern apicomplexan specificity residue” is a bit overblown.

Clearly Trp107f is not the only residue important for specificity – a major point of our paper – but the same is true of the “traditional” specificity residue at position 102, which is at best necessary but insufficient for determining substrate specificity.</p><p>The molecular mechanism by which apicomplexan Trp107f contributes to pyruvate recognition likely involves the hydrophobic Trp sidechain interacting with the hydrophobic pyruvate methyl and the bulky Trp sidechain sterically occluding the methylene carboxylate of oxaloacetate. We have now added a sentence to this effect in the text.</p><p><italic>Supplemental</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>lacks any legend and I find it difficult to interpret</italic>.</p><p>We now provide a legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

Rather, epistasis is defined as a mutation having different effects depending on the identity of residues at other sites. Our data provide clear evidence of this; both the R102K mutation and the loop insertion have differing kinetic effects when introduced in the modern vs ancestral proteins. The residues that comprise the active sites of the modern and ancestral proteins are identical; the residue differences are found only at sites removed from the active site. Hence, the epistasis we observe is necessarily long-range. Elucidating the precise mechanism of this long-range epistasis will not be trivial, but it is currently one of our major ongoing projects. We suspect that the mechanism will come down to shifting energy landscapes (a type of protein dynamics).</p><p><italic>Similarly, the conclusion that epistatic interactions are common simply because residue 102 mutations do not always result in strong substrate switching is not warranted; for epistasis to be shown, an interaction between two mutations must be directly shown</italic>.</p><p>Residue 102 mutations frequently result in different levels of substrate specificity, depending on which protein they are made in.
