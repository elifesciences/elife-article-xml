threat-related signals and contribute to multiple phases of adaptive threat responses in mice, with their inactivation attenuating both unconditioned behavioral responses to somatic pain and fear-memory formation. Because CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons respond broadly to multi-modal threats, it remains unknown how these distinct adaptive processes are individually engaged. We show that while three partially separable subsets of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons broadly collateralize to their respective downstream partners, individual projections accomplish distinct functions: hypothalamic and extended amygdalar projections elicit assorted unconditioned threat responses including autonomic arousal, anxiety, and freezing behavior, while thalamic and basal forebrain projections generate freezing behavior and, unexpectedly, contribute to associative fear learning. Moreover, the unconditioned responses generated by individual projections are complementary, with simultaneous activation of multiple sites driving profound freezing behavior and bradycardia that are not elicited by any individual projection. This semi-parallel, scalable connectivity schema likely contributes to flexible control of threat responses in unpredictable environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>affect</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>parabrachial</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS099578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowen</surname><given-names>Anna J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-DA24908</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palmiter</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parabrachial neurons expressing CGRP relay affective components of ascending pain information via distinct thalamic and amygdalar pathways, which together contribute to complementary aspects of adaptive threat responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Imminent threats such as somatic pain rapidly shape ongoing behavior and alter physiology to prioritize immediate threat remediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). This cascade of activity, which in rodents can include bouts of active escape or freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roelofs, 2017</xref>) and autonomic changes, including both enhanced sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fitzgerald and Teyler, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwata and LeDoux, 1988</xref>), comprise the unconditioned response. A later phase of threat response includes enhanced arousal, wariness and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In tandem to these innate adaptive responses, the aversive threat signal is transmitted to forebrain nuclei that receive convergent information about ongoing environmental stimuli, and associations are formed allowing prediction of future threats based on environmental information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Upon re-exposure to pain-predictive cues (e.g. an auditory conditioning stimulus (CS)), nuclei storing the associative memory are reactivated and through downstream partners trigger responses previously hallmarks of the unconditioned response (e.g. freezing behavior and autonomic arousal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goosens and Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwata and LeDoux, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, while the systems controlling unconditioned responses and associative learning have dissociable processes, they have highly convergent behavioral and physiological readouts. Due in part to this inherently entangled arrangement, dissection of these affective processes prior to the level of the amygdala has remained elusive.</p><p>The parabrachial nucleus (PBN), located at the junction of the midbrain and pons, is implicated in relaying aversive threat information to the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernard and Besson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gauriau and Bernard, 2002</xref>). A recently identified population of neurons expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP, encoded by the <italic>Calca</italic> gene) resides in the external lateral PBN and is robustly activated by threats of diverse origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), including somatic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to contributing to affective and behavioral responses to pain, CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons are necessary for associative fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>). While neurons across the entire population appear to broadly respond to multi-modal threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campos et al., 2018</xref>), it remains possible that subpopulations are preferentially activated by distinct stimuli and project to designated partners to drive appropriate responses. The alternative extreme is that CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons are a homogeneous population with broadly distributed projections, whose distinct phenotypes are elaborated entirely by downstream partners with activity shaped by additional sensory inputs.</p><p>We sought to disentangle the organization of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> to forebrain circuitry by delineating their distribution of projections and then determining whether they originate from distinct CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron subgroups or arise by collateralization. To interrogate the underlying logic by which unconditioned responses and associative learning are simultaneously driven from this single population, we selectively activated individual terminal fields in downstream targets and measured their individual capacity to elicit behavioral and physiological changes and/or contribute to associative fear learning. We found that many distinct phenotypes were produced by discrete projections, while a selected few contribute to associative fear learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons generate learned and innate defensive responses and connect to diverse forebrain targets</title><p>To determine whether activation of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons is sufficient to induce both the behavioral and physiological correlates of the unconditioned response in addition to fostering associative fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>), we bilaterally injected an adeno-associated virus carrying Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin (AAV1-DIO-ChR2:YFP) and implanted fiber-optic cannulae over the PBN of <italic>Calca<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice, while control mice received AAV1-DIO-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Repeated high-frequency (30 Hz) activation of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons induced profound freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>), as indicated by rigid, uninterrupted immobility. In addition to eliciting robust freezing behavior, we confirmed that pairing photostimulation with an auditory CS rapidly induced conditioned freezing responses to the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons can recapitulate physiological aspects of the unconditioned response, we photostimulated the neurons while monitoring heart rate with a pulse oximeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, while modest activation (15 Hz, subthreshold for eliciting freezing behavior) resulted in moderate tachycardia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), high-frequency activation (30 Hz) led to profound bradycardia and decreased respiration followed by dramatic post-stimulation rebound tachycardia and mild hyperventilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, respiration measured in plethysmography chamber); it also produced vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vianna and Carrive, 2005</xref>). Hence, CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons are capable of exerting opposing effects on autonomic physiology depending on their activation frequency. Comparing the latencies of somatic vs autonomic responses to 30 Hz photostimulation, we found that freezing behavior is rapidly initiated (median 0.42 s), while bradycardia takes longer to develop (median 22.15 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), suggesting that freezing behavior does not emerge simply as a consequence of adverse autonomic effects. To test whether CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons can also elicit behavioral alterations associated with late-phase responses to threat exposure, we subjected mice to an elevated-plus-maze test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pellow et al., 1985</xref>) while activating CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons; this treatment attenuated open-arm exploration consistent with an anxiogenic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons potentiate fear behavior, drive associative learning and robustly activate forebrain targets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bilateral injections of AAV1-DIO-ChR2:YFP or AAV1-DIO-YFP and fiberoptic cannula implants above the PBN of Calca<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice. (<bold>B</bold>) Photostimulation (30 Hz) of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons generated robust freezing behavior (n = 8,6 (n = ChR2, YFP); significant group x time interaction in a two-way ANOVA, <italic>F<sub>10,120</sub></italic> = 83.53, p&lt;0.0001; subsequent Sidak pairwise comparisons, ****p&lt;0.0001).

Comparing individual targets to cumulative projection intensity, we found major projections to the central amygdala (CeA,~40%, primarily targeting the capsular sub-nucleus), substantia innominata (SI,~20%), and oval sub-nucleus of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (ovBNST,~15%), with weaker projections to the parasubthalamic nucleus, thalamus and visceral insular cortex; PSTN and VPMpc,~10% each, IC,~5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, for abbreviations see figure supplement 2). With the exception of the IC, CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons also target the contralateral hemisphere for all of their downstream partners, markedly to the contralateral PSTN and VPMpc, with ~75% and 50% of the ipsilateral projection intensity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>). To confirm that downstream neurons receive monosynaptic excitation from CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons and also to compare synaptic strength across targets, we expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons and photostimulated terminals in downstream regions while recording from putative postsynaptic neurons in a slice preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Interestingly, we found that while all the major downstream targets were recipients of reliable excitatory input from CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, IC not tested), the VPMpc, while not receiving the strongest input based on fiber density, exhibited significantly greater excitation from terminal activation than any other recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).</p><p>The heterogeneity of behavioral and physiological outcomes elicited by activation of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons raises questions about the underlying circuit organization responsible for their generation. We envisioned several potential circuit structures underlying CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron connectivity to the forebrain: while distributed, one-to-all connectivity involving extensive collateralization from each CGRP neuron to every target structure would be well suited for simultaneous, parallel activation of diverse regions, a one-to-one, segregated organization would better support separable generation of distinct functions via activation of designated partners. To reveal the structure underlying CGRP<sup>PBN</sup>-neuron connectivity to the forebrain, we devised a method to selectively isolate subsets of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons as defined by their target-projecting behavior. By injecting AAV expressing retrogradely transported Flp-recombinase (rAAV2-retro-Flp) into a downstream site and a fluorescent tracer requiring both Cre and Flp for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>) (AAV-Cre<sub>on</sub>-Flp<sub>on</sub>-YFP; Target +), or that is turned on by Cre but off by Flp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>) (AAV-Cre<sub>on</sub>-Flp<sub>off</sub>-YFP; Target –) into the PBN of <italic>Calca<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we were able to isolate fluorescent expression to neuronal subpopulations defined by whether or not they targeted a region of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Normalizing the resulting projection intensity in each downstream region under each condition to the maximal signal given by transducing all CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons, we determined the proportion of terminal density in each downstream partner supplied by target-projecting CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons for the VPMpc, PSTN, CeA, and ovBNST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This analysis revealed that CeA-projectors contributed substantially to PSTN, SI, VPMpc and ovBNST projections, but not IC. VPMpc-projectors, interestingly, while also projecting to the CeA, contributed more substantially to the SI and IC, while PSTN-projectors had limited secondary output to the CeA and SI, and ovBNST-projectors had only a weak secondary projection to the CeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. Quantifying the number and location of the different projecting subpopulations within the PBN revealed that neurons projecting to the CeA made up the largest proportion of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons residing within the external lateral PBN, while neurons projecting to VPMpc accounted for most of the CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons residing in the medial and waist regions; neurons projecting to ovBNST, the smallest group, were restricted to the external lateral PBN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–F</xref>). Comparing projection distributions for the Target + or Target - expression conditions, we found that regardless of the downstream target used to drive expression, the CeA was the primary downstream partner in terms of projection intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Excluding CeA-projecting CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons flattened the distribution, with the ovBNST narrowly making up the largest projection contribution. As a summary statistic to directly compare the collateralization tendencies across subpopulations, we calculated a collateralization coefficient defined as the difference between projection strength for each downstream partner in the Target + and Target - conditions, for each target, where a value of 50% corresponds to half of the signal in the area of interest being supplied by target-site projectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Looking at the distribution of these coefficients across secondary downstream partners for each target site, we found that VPMpc projectors had the greatest tendency to collateralize, while ovBNST projectors collateralized primarily to the CeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In summary, there is extensive collateralization by CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons with no one-to-one projections; rather, CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons tend to distribute their projections among large groups of downstream targets, composing a one-to-many distributed projection arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons broadly collateralize to forebrain targets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Injections of rAAV2-retro-Flp into projection targets and INTRSECT viruses into the PBN of Calca<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice to isolate target-projecting (Target +, Cre-on Flp-on) or non-projecting (Target -, Cre-on Flp-off) populations. (<bold>B</bold>) Fluorescent images of projection targets in mice expressing tracer in either all CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons, CeA-projectors (CeA-on), or non-CeA-projectors (CeA-off).

Because of the high degree of collateralization, it is possible that stimulating one region will result in antidromic activation and neurotransmitter release in all areas with shared innervation. If that occurred, then stimulating in one area that shares strong co-innervation with another should yield similar phenotypic outcomes. Surprisingly, given the broad collateralization of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons, that was not the case. Only photostimulating terminals in the VPMpc or PSTN led to reliable initiation of freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>,~40% time-spent freezing), while photostimulating the caudal CeA (cCeA), SI, or ovBNST had more subtle effects (~25% time-spent freezing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>), and stimulating the rostral CeA (rCeA) actually led to a non-significant increase in locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>; for cross-area mean freezing response comparisons see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, activating no individual projection was able to match CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> cell-body activation in generating robust freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>). Importantly, while freezing behavior is an unconditioned response to predator incursion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roelofs, 2017</xref>), when elicited by noxious stimulation it is instead a learned response to contextual cues because adaptive responses to ongoing noxious stimulation are always to flee or withdraw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landeira-Fernandez et al., 2006</xref>). To examine whether the freezing behavior we observed was directly elicited by photostimulation or was instead driven by processes secondary to contextual conditioning, we looked at the temporal structure of the freezing responses to light onset and offset. We found that photostimulation led to short-latency freezing bout initiation (&lt;5 s after stimulation onset) for most terminal stimulation groups except the rCeA, which instead elicited short-latency freezing bouts after stimulation offset (~2.4 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). Freezing-bout initiation occurred with lower latencies than control animals during the 20 s post-stimulation epoch in all stimulation groups except the VPMpc and cCeA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). When taken together with the observation that freezing behavior occurs with greater frequency during the stimulation epoch than post-stimulation epoch for all fiber-placement groups except those in the CeA and ovBNST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>), these findings suggest that stimulation of most CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron projections simultaneously elicits a direct effect on freezing behavior while also generating aversive properties that promote transient contextual freezing.

We found that photostimulation of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons, in addition to driving profound freezing behavior, can also generate either tachycardia or parasympathetic responses depending on stimulation frequency, and elicit anxiety-like behavior. These findings collectively suggest that activation of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons during somatic pain has the potential to contribute to many aspects of the unconditioned response cascade, from shock-induced locomotion to post-shock freezing behavior, autonomic responses including simultaneous enhancement of parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow, and post-insult anxiogenesis. A complication of this arrangement is that neither freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969</xref>), parasympathetic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwata and LeDoux, 1988</xref>), nor anxiety occur during the shock. Hence, the role played by CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons in these phenotypes would necessarily result from recurrent reactivation, rather than a direct ascending signal.</p><p>By selectively activating CGRP<sup>PBN</sup>-neuron terminals in their various downstream targets, we distinguished the potential of individual downstream partners to contribute to distinct components of the behavioral and physiological alterations that comprise the unconditioned- response cascade. We found that with the exception of the rCeA, all projections generated some amount of freezing behavior, with the most robust responses elicited by the PSTN and VPMpc, two projections that were overlooked in previous work. We also found a marked disparity in function across the CeA, with activation of terminals in the cCeA eliciting only mild freezing behavior, while activating the rCeA had no effect on freezing behavior during photostimulation but did produce robust sympathetic responses, brief contextual freezing following stimulation offset, avoidance, and nocifensive behaviors on a hot plate, all phenotypes reminiscent of responses to noxious stimulation. In general, our results suggest that CGRP<sup>PBN</sup>-neuron connections to extended amygdalar structures (i.e. the CeA, SI, and ovBNST) influence freezing behavior, affective processing including negative valence and anxiety state, and physiological responses, while thalamic and hypothalamic connections transmit a negative-valence signal and elicit freezing behavior. These results are supported by the fact that, in rats, extended amygdalar structures are richly interconnected with hindbrain nuclei controlling autonomic outflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong and Swanson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizvi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veening et al., 1984</xref>), while the VPMpc is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cechetto and Saper, 1987</xref>). Our findings complement recent work that distinguished between PBN populations that target the extended amygdala and hypothalamus/periaqueductal grey and differentially drive affective and nocifensive responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>). However, by distinguishing between conditioned freezing responses and avoidance behavior, we were able to specifically implicate two novel targets, the VPMpc and SI, in generating associative fear learning, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2020</xref> studies were limited to learned valence and only tested the CeA and ovBNST. We found that the PSTN, SI, and VPMpc also relay a negative valence signal. Hence, populations contributing to the negative valence of noxious or aversive stimuli may not necessarily contribute to associative fear learning, which has important implications for understanding the neural underpinnings of affective disorders such as PTSD.</p><p>Our collateral-tracing experiments revealed that, in contrast to the distinct phenotypes generated by terminal photostimulation, CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons form a broadly distributed network with their downstream partners in which no forebrain target receives solitary innervation. There was some bias in the connectivity groupings, with neurons projecting to the CeA tending to also strongly innervate the PSTN, neurons projecting to the VPMpc also innervating the SI and IC and avoiding the ovBNST, and neurons projecting to the ovBNST also targeting the CeA. Our findings are broadly in agreement with previous experiments that delineated sub-region-specific output and collateralization in rats (Sarhan et al.) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2020</xref>), neither of which, however, reported connections or collateralization with the VPMpc, suggesting that cell-type specific expression more efficiently reveals this connection. Of interest, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarhan et al., 2005</xref> beautifully outlined rostral and caudal capsular CeA branching patterns across all extended amygdalar structures using single-axonal reconstructions of PBN neurons, finding collateralization between the rCeA and lateral hypothalamus (PSTN), and cCeA and ventral BNST. Taken as a whole, the distributed, collateralization organization of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons may be important for generating highly coordinated actions and associations by simultaneously driving activity in downstream sites that have related or complementary functions. An example in support of this arrangement is that stimulation of terminals in the SI and VPMpc generated disparate effects on physiology, but collaboratively supported associative fear learning.</p><p>While activating some individual terminal fields from CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons in different downstream sites recapitulated – in a scaled-down fashion – most of the phenotypes driven by photostimulating the cell bodies, we found that profound freezing behavior and bradycardia were not produced by stimulation of any individual projection, suggesting they instead arise from additive interactions between downstream structures and their respective circuits. We tested this hypothesis by simultaneously activating terminals in the VPMpc and cCeA, two targets that generated reliable freezing behavior, and observed not only a robust potentiation of the freezing behavior but also profound bradycardia. Interestingly, neither of these populations generated autonomic responses when activated individually. One possible arrangement that explains this phenotype is that their concurrent activation gates activity in secondary structures that drive parasympathetic responses.</p><p>An important consideration in implicating individual downstream partners in generating distinct aspects of behavioral and physiological response is the inherent limitation of terminal photostimulation. It is difficult, if not impossible, to ensure that antidromic activity does not activate secondary targets, an especially important possibility given the broad collateralization of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons. However, secondary techniques aimed at accounting for this situation also have their shortcomings: axons may bifurcate near the sites of interest rather than at the cell body, hence silencing cell bodies may not prevent antidromic activation. Moreover, since many of the forebrain structures contributing to threat processing are interconnected, silencing other portions of the downstream circuit to attempt to isolate the effect of the target of interest on the measured phenotype may affect phenotype generation if the populations are interconnected. We argue that the very fact that terminal stimulation in different downstream targets generates distinct phenotypes supports the fact that at minimum, preferential activation of the site of interest is occurring. If photostimulation of terminals was efficiently activating cell bodies within the PBN then the same phenotypes should be observed regardless of fiber location. Perhaps, most compelling is that CeA-projecting CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons make up the bulk of the population yet photostimulation of terminals in the CeA does not efficiently produce either freezing behavior or anxiety, two of the distinct phenotypes produced by activating other downstream targets that receive collateral innervation with the CeA.</p><p>Another necessary caveat of using artificial stimulation to probe the intrinsic functionality of different projection partners is that variation in transport rate and axon length across downstream partners could profoundly influence ChR2 levels at terminals and thus terminal stimulation efficacy, which would in turn confound the observed differences in function and connection strength across the circuit. We attempted to account for this by allowing 4 weeks after virus injection for ChR2 expression and transport before beginning experiments, having observed that 2–3 weeks was sufficient to observe robust labeling in the most distant terminal fields. While our electrophysiological measures revealed the greatest synaptic strength in CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron connections to one of their more proximal downstream partners, the VPMpc, the fact that the PSTN, which is equally close to the PBN but has a connection strength that is similar to what we observed with all other targets suggests that ChR2 transport cannot be the primary reason for the strength of the connection to the VPMpc. Moreover, we did not see a declination of synaptic strength across the proximal-distal axis – synapses in the ovBNST, the most distal target, exhibited similar synaptic strength to those 2 mm more proximal, in the PSTN. What then underlies the large differences in synaptic strength we observed across downstream targets that was independent of projection strength as measured by terminal labeling density? Differences in release probability, convergence (the VPMpc is a much smaller structure than the CeA, for example, hence each neuron might receive more contacts), postsynaptic receptor number or dendrite structure could all contribute to the observed differences in synaptic strength. One particularly interesting possibility is that the VPMpc, which does not express receptors for CGRP, may primarily rely on glutamatergic input from the PBN and hence exhibit large-amplitude EPSCs in response to CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron terminal photostimulation, while extended amygdala targets may rely more on CGRP release for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinohara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okutsu et al., 2017</xref>), which our experiment would not have been able to reveal. A more detailed analysis of the electrophysiological properties of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron to forebrain connections is necessary to understand the temporal and chemical underpinnings that help give rise to the different functions of each downstream connection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Associative fear learning</title><p>Associative learning is a highly tractable and informative process because it reliably depends on the salience of the CS and US, and the innate associability of these stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sigmundi et al., 1980</xref>). The interplay of these factors on the association is indicated by the learning rate and asymptote – the maximal conditioned response for a particular CS-US pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rescorla, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sigmundi et al., 1980</xref>). Here, we maintained a constant CS and varied the US by activating specific projections from CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons to condition predictive freezing to an auditory CS, or by silencing either CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons or individual projections during foot-shock delivery. Activation of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons elicited the most robust association, followed by stimulation of terminals in the VPMpc or SI. No individual projection was sufficient to recapitulate the learning asymptote generated by stimulating all CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons; hence, some combination of projections relays salient aspects of the US, generating complementary signals that eventually reach the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to potentiate synapses receiving coincident CS information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Romanski et al., 1993</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, inhibiting CGRP<sup>PBN</sup>-neuron terminals in either the VPMpc or SI during the US attenuated the association strength to the same degree as inhibiting the entire population, suggesting that preventing activation of either downstream partner impairs associative learning. We also observed that a substantial degree (~50%) of the conditioned response was maintained when inhibiting CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons, indicating that they are part of a distributed network that collectively relays the affective, motivational signal to forebrain neurons that form and store the associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanuza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lanuza et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi and Davis, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, work examining the ability of the CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron projection to the VPMpc to generate an associative memory using taste as a CS indicated no conditioned taste aversion formation when paired with brief photostimulation, while projections to the CeA and ovBNST did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that either the relayed signal is the wrong modality for combining with CS taste information, or that a specific temporal activation pattern different from that tested is required to form an association (e.g. longer term activation that better mimics visceral illness). Hence, it is surprising that associative learning to a tone generated conditioned freezing behavior, while association with a taste did not alter preference, even though the VPMpc is an integral part of the ascending taste network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Fontanini, 2015</xref>). More work assessing the response patterns of individual VPMpc neurons to diverse sensory modalities and their contribution to conditioned taste aversion is required to resolve these paradoxes.</p><p>Previous work in rats indicates that PBN projections to the CeA are capable of eliciting both escape behaviors and fear learning in addition to driving place avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sato et al., 2015</xref>), while in mice it has been demonstrated that activation of CGRP-receptor neurons in the CeA is sufficient to act as a US to drive associative fear learning, and that silencing these neurons prior to conditioning attenuates conditioned-fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>). We activated both the rostral and caudal CeA terminal fields of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons and were surprised that neither manipulation was individually capable of generating a fear memory, suggesting a number of possibilities that may give rise to these findings: (1) It is possible that CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons are only one component of the PBN projection to CeA and other PBN cell types are important for aversive learning, (2) CGRP-receptor neurons in the CeA may make up a larger population than those activated by CGRP<sup>PBN</sup>-neuron terminal stimulation and receive input from secondary sources that are important for aversive learning; (3) direct activation of neurons in the CeA may be more efficient than terminal stimulation and may thus be able to drive associative learning; and (4) since the mice used in our study are heterozygous for CGRP, wholly intact neuropeptide signaling may be required for association formation derived from PBN to CeA stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinohara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okutsu et al., 2017</xref>). In support of the first two possibilities, we observed that inhibiting CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron terminals in the CeA during foot-shock delivery had no effect on associative fear learning, suggesting that the relayed activity from CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons to the CeA during the foot shock is not necessary for the CS-US association. This is in apparent contrast to previous work demonstrating that silencing CGRP-receptor neurons in the CeA prior to conditioning attenuates conditioned responses to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>). However, that manipulation was permanent and failed to distinguish between association formation and recall, which our US-only inhibition did, suggesting that reactivation of CGRP-receptor neurons in the CeA after conditioning may underlie the observed reductions in conditioned responding. Based on these observations and our data implicating CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron projections to the CeA in generating robust unconditioned-responses, we propose an alternate model, wherein CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron connections to the CeA, PSTN, SI, and ovBNST drive unconditioned responses to the US, post-conditioning activation of BLA neurons by the CS reactivates the CeA to generate conditioned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), and CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron connections to the SI and VPMpc primarily mediate the role of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons in associative-fear learning, a compelling arrangement given that in rats, these two downstream partners are the most directly invested in cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cechetto and Saper, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wenk, 1997</xref>). Our data establish partially separable ascending routes from CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons for generating unconditioned responses and forming associative memories to aversive stimuli.</p></sec></sec><sec

Mice were excluded from all analysis if post-hoc histological examination revealed that viral expression was weak or unilateral, or that fiber-optic cannulae were not appropriately targeted over the projection-site of interest. Locations of fiber tips for all animals that passed the expression and placement criteria are summarized in Figure S3.

All replicates were biological (test repetition in biologically distinct samples), not technical (test repetition in same biological sample). Not all cohorts of mice were exposed to all experimental tests – there were biological replicates of mice for PBN photostimulation, and cCeA, SI, and ovBNST terminal photostimulation. The second groups were added for auditory fear conditioning (n = 3.1 (ChR2, YFP) SI only), unconditioned freezing (n = 3.1 ovBNST and SI), and EPM behavioral data (ovBNST and SI), and for the PBN only, plethysmography measurements of respiratory rate (n = 6). Some early groups of PBN stimulation were only tested for unconditioned freezing responses (n = 3). Other variances in group numbers are due to exclusion from individual tests due to adverse events during the test or drop-out due to damaged fiber-optic cannulae (see exclusion criteria, above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Auditory fear conditioning</title><p>The fear-conditioning chamber was a square arena (25 × 25 cm) with metal walls, two speakers attached on opposite walls, and a metal grid floor that consisted of a circuit board that delivers electrical shock (Coulbourn Instruments). A USB camera was connected to the personal computer and video tracking software (EthoVision XT 10, Noldus Technology) controlled the circuit and recorded the data. Day 1: Mice were attached to fiberoptic patch cords and allowed to habituate for 5 min in their home cage prior to introduction to conditioning context. After free exploration of the context for 1 min, 6 CS tones (tone: 10 kHz 20 s, 60 dB) were played at random intervals, with an average inter-trial interval (ITI) of 2 min. Day 2: Mice were attached and allowed to explore for 1 min; then 6 CS presentations (20 s, 60 dB, 10 kHz) were played at random intervals, with an average ITI of 2 min and each co-terminated with a 2 s light train (30 Hz, 15 mW). Following the sixth CS-US pairing, mice remained in the context for 1 min before being returned to their home cage. Day 3: Mice were attached to fiberoptic patch cords and habituated as before, but then they were placed in a novel context (25 × 25 cm, semitransparent plexiglass). After 2 min of free exploration, one tone CS was played. All the trials were recorded by a USB camera attached to the personal computer and the time spent freezing (during the tone), defined as immobility up until any movement of the head or body, was manually scored with a stopwatch (experimenter was blind to treatments). <italic>With photoinhibition –</italic> same as above, except 2 s light train was replaced with a 2 s 0.5-mA footshock with red light delivery for photoinhibition (8 mW, 3.5 s on, 1 s ramp off, turned on 0.5 s before the shock and ending 2.5 s later).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Elevated-plus maze (EPM)</title><p>The custom-made EPM consisted of two sets of crossed arms (two arms enclosed by 30 cm tall transparent plexiglass, two arms open), each 50 cm long and 8 cm wide, set 65 cm above floor.

Mice were attached to fiber-optic patch cords and allowed to habituate for 10 min in their home cage prior to introduction to the test box. Mice were then introduced to the start chamber and allowed to explore freely during the 15 min trial. One chamber of the box was assigned as the light-paired side. Each time the mouse crossed into the stimulation chamber it received 15 Hz photostimulation or 2 s on 1 s ramp 1 s off trains of photoinhibition until it left the light-paired side.

Following habituation, mice received photostimulation (30 Hz, 8 s on/5 s off, 15 mW) for 7 min prior to exposure to the hot plate. After terminating photostimulation to prevent freezing interfering with responses to heat, mice were placed on the pre-heated aluminum plate (15 × 15 cm, set to 52°C) of the Hot/Cold Plate Analgesia Meter (Coulbourn Instruments). The transparent Plexiglas chamber (15 × 15×20 cm) prevented the mouse from escaping. The latency of the responses to the heat (paw lick, or jump) was measured manually by the experimenter with a stopwatch during the 60 s trials. Trials were recorded with a USB camera attached to a personal computer, and later jump number (jump counted when all four limbs left floor) and the latency to the first jump were manually scored with a stopwatch. <italic>Photoinhibition –</italic> same as above, except the hot plate was set to 57°C, and photoinhibition (2 s on 1 s ramp 1 s off throughout trial) began immediately prior to placing the subject on the plate.

After a full day of habituation, hair was removed from the sensor areas (circumference of neck) to allow trans-dermal infrared penetration, and mice were switched to dummy collar sensors overnight. The next morning, collar sensors and attached cables were placed on the mice, which habituated for at least 30 min prior to patch-cord attachment. Mice were then attached to fiber-optic patch cords and returned to their home cage and allowed to habituate for 1–2 hr, until heart rate and respiration became stable. The collar sensors were attached to a pulse oximeter (MouseOx Plus, Starr Life Sciences) via 3 m cables, and the pulse oximeter was attached to a personal computer via USB. Eventually 5 min of baseline was recorded using the software (Conscious Software Module, Starr Life Sciences), after which the mouse received 3 min of photostimulation (15 or 30 Hz) followed by 1 min of post-stimulation measurements.

Animals were briefly anesthetized, attached to a bilateral fiber optic patch cord with a rotary joint, and placed in a barometric chamber supplied with room air (21% O2, 200 ml/min). The chamber was sealed for each recording session, which consisted of five recording blocks, 30 s each, centered around 10 s of stimulation (30 Hz) during which the pressure difference was measured between the experimental and reference chamber with a differential pressure transducer.

Across subjects, on average 6 PBN images, 3 VPMpc images, 5 PSTN images, 6 CeA images, 5 SI images, four ovBNST images, and 8 IC images were collected from each brain. Area-specific, pixel-intensity measures for each image/projection target were analyzed in Image-J. Background was subtracted for each image using the average fluorescence from a region of the image outside the projection target analyzed. Pixel-intensity values were summed across individual sections to give the total for each projection target. This value was normalized to either (1) the total pixel intensity values for all areas within subject for % total projection strength, a measure of the contribution of the individual projection to the total projection distribution for the subject or (2) the area-specific pixel intensity in control mice expressing tracer in all CGRP neurons for % maximal pixel intensity, a measure of the projection strength relative to the control condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Collateralization coefficient</title><p>To calculate the relative importance of a target structure for contributing the signal in other projection regions we calculated the difference between the normalized Flp<sub>on</sub> and Flp<sub>off</sub> fluorescent signal conditions within each downstream region.

We set this 0 value to equal 50% by making 50% the y-intercept, then scaled by 50% so that when values are at their maximal (at either +1 or −1), the value reaches either 0 or 100%.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mi>%</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, the target structure of interest is <italic>b</italic>, and the collateralization coefficient is being calculated for its relationship with area <italic>a</italic>.

(CGRP) expressing neurons in the brainstem parabrachial nucleus provide an aversive signal to the brain, inducing a variety of fear related behavioral and autonomic responses. How these cells orchestrate these many functions was not known. This paper directly addresses this important question and reveals unique contributions of distinct efferent projections of CGRP neurons to different aspects of threat processing.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dissociable control of unconditioned responses and associative fear learning by parabrachial CGRP neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Joshua Johansen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors studied the efferent anatomical organization and functional role of projections from CGRP cells in the parabrachial (PBN) nucleus which are important in aversive learning and defensive behaviors. The authors used intersectional viral-genetic strategies to systematically dissect the axonal collateralizations of parabrachial CGRP neurons, and examined the consequences of stimulating their projections to individual brain regions as well as to combinations of targets. Both behavioral and autonomic responses (heart rate, respiration, skin temperatures) were carefully examined, and the behavioral tests included fear and anxiety-like behaviors, conditioned learning, and real time place preference/avoidance. This study moves us beyond looking at a behavioral circuit as a simple set of serial connections from one region or set of identified cells to another, to an understanding of the varied and interacting roles that projection collaterals of a single set of cells to many brain regions serve. The PBN is an ideal brain region to disentangle the distinct functional roles of projections to different brain regions which execute the various aspects of this &quot;alarm&quot; system. Through comprehensive studies, the authors discovered that discrete projections from CGRP-PBN neurons produce distinct phenotypes (arousal, freezing or aversive learning), and that combinatorial activation of multiple projection pathways results in emergent phenotypes not seen with individual projections. These findings are novel and will be of broad interest for people studying pain and aversive learning and memory. However, there are some concerns regarding the analyses and interpretation of the data which should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Optogenetic terminal stimulation is artificial and the effects of this stimulation could vary depending on a number of factors. For example, in some cases, the ability of optogenetic stimulation to elicit postsynaptic responses is TTX resistant, suggesting action potentials are not necessary and light-activated opening of ChR2s is enough to activate voltage-dependent Ca channels or to trigger exocytosis by direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through ChR2s. In other cases, it is TTX-sensitive, i.e., requires action potential generation at the axons. As this situation might depend critically on the quantity of ChR2 molecules transported from the soma to the terminals, this may depend on the length of axon fibers from the soma, axonal transport rate and incubation period after viral vector infection. As the axon length and transport rate should differ between the axons targeting distinct regions, the synaptic efficacy should be crucially different between different target regions, particularly when light-stimulated at the level of terminals.

We considered this possibility when designing our studies, and purposefully waited for virus to express over 4 weeks before beginning behavioral experiments and at least 3 weeks before conducting electrophysiological measurements, in the hopes that since viral expression had become stably and visibly robust at the most distal projection sites that differences in ChR2 transportation would not be the primary driver of cross-area stimulation differences. In support of this being the case, synaptic strength as measured by EPSC amplitude is equal between projection targets that are the most distal and caudal from the PBN – the PSTN and ovBNST, which are approximately 2-mm apart AP. Moreover, differences in ChR2 expression in terminals would likely lead to a difference in activation robustness and hence would drive variation in response amplitude rather than type: for instance, we observed robust freezing behavior from VPMpc stimulation and robust physiological responses with ovBNST stimulation (the most distal projection); it is unlikely that slightly higher levels of ChR2 at terminals in the ovBNST would entirely change the type of response observed, and so cross-areal differences in response types should still be preserved across different ChR2 expression levels. What is more worrisome would be an entire lack of response elicited by stimulation in distal regions. However, nothing except repeated recordings from downstream neurons at different stages of viral expression until EPSC amplitude plateaus at each target-location can truly reveal the time-courses of ChR2 transportation to terminals. We have included a discussion of this limitation in the revised manuscript (subsection “Generation of unconditioned behavioral and physiological responses”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the first point, it would be interesting to know why the light-evoked EPSC amplitude differs so much between the target regions in a manner independent of the &quot;projection intensity&quot;.

We initially thought there must be something affecting viral expression, but found the differences were consistent across expression time and animals. We were able to look at PPR across regions, but with the low number of cells the results were highly variable and did not give rise to anything conclusive. If necessary, we can add new experiments at a later date to examine differences in release probability, failure rate, and PPR across target regions. We suspect that differences in receptor expression or synapse number probably give rise to the differences in EPSC amplitude – especially interesting, the CGRP-receptor, Calcrl, is not expressed in the VPMpc, but is in most other projection targets (Allen brain gene-expression atlas). Our best guess is that the PBN-thalamic projection relies primarily on fast glutamatergic transmission and so may express more AMPA-type receptors, while extended amygdala structures have been shown to richly express Calcrl and other neuropeptide receptors (so-called CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons express many different neuropeptides in addition to CGRP including Neurotensin, PACAP and Substance-P) and so may rely less prominently on AMPA for excitation (Okutsu et al., 2017). It is also important to clarify that ‘projection intensity’ refers to the total fluorescence, across multiple sections – the CeA, a much longer structure than the VPMpc necessarily has a greater ‘projection intensity’ due to the measure’s cumulative nature. The difference does not necessarily imply that there are more individual cell-to-cell contacts. To clarify this point we changed ‘fiber density’ to ‘cumulative projection strength’, and added discussion about what may potentially give rise to the differences in EPSC amplitude across target regions (subsection “Generation of unconditioned behavioral and physiological responses”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Palmiter lab's work and many other studies have revealed the importance of the PB in pain processing and behavior.

First, it is important to consider that CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons have previously been shown to be activated following auditory fear conditioning by CS delivery (Campos et al., 2018) and inactivation of this signal accelerates fear-memory extinction, suggesting that these neurons contribute to the affective signal associated with both US and post-conditioning CS delivery. In this context, it becomes apparent that ascending output from these neurons can both promote escape and freezing behaviors. Clearly, however, the freezing behavior observed following conditioning is still part of a conditioned response that CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neuron activity appears to amplify. As yet unpublished work in the Palmiter lab has shown that inactivating CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons attenuates unconditioned freezing in response to several aversive stimuli, including 20-kHZ USVs and looming stimuli. We believe that CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons do contribute to freezing behavior as a motor response to potentially dangerous environmental stimuli, a situation which motivated our attempts to discover which downstream populations were best able to recapitulate the robust freezing phenotype generated by directly activating CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons. To address the important point that transient contextual conditioning could potentially be the primary driver of the observed freezing responses generated by terminal stimulation, we analyzed the latency of freezing responses after beginning and ending stimulation, and compared the relative amount of freezing that occurred during vs. immediately after photostimulation ended. If freezing behavior was generated by transient contextual conditioning, then freezing levels at the beginning and end should, at least at first, be comparable. We found several new interesting results: first, stimulation of terminals in the target regions that best-elicited auditory fear learning and generated freezing behavior (the VPMpc, PSTN, and SI) had the largest differences between freezing behavior across the stimulation and post-stimulation epochs, suggesting that the freezing behavior generated by these structures is not secondary to contextual learning, and that these two associative processes are partially separable at the level of the PBN, although direct analysis of contextual versus auditory fear learning is necessary to confirm this. Moreover, we found that stimulating terminals in the rCeA, part of the nociceptive amygdala, did not promote freezing during stimulation, but caused short-latency freezing bouts following stimulation cessation, reminiscent of UR to contextual freezing response progression caused by noxious stimulus presentation. Another potential explanation for the ‘residual’ freezing behavior we observed is that neuropeptides are released during the stimulation period and could continue to bind receptors downstream following stimulation-cessation, leading to residual activity in downstream sites causing continued, though less robust, generation of freezing behavior. To address these concerns we added a supplement to Figure 3 with new analysis, and included an explicit reference to the issue in the text (subsections “Individual downstream targets of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons exert diverse effects on physiology and behavior” and “CGRP<sup>PBN</sup>-neuron downstream targets differentially influence associative learning and affect”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the hot-plate and tail-flick latency assays, the authors carried out the behavioral tests after having light-stimulated distinct targets for 7 min.

Third, how did the authors confirm that this setting was optimal to observe the stimulation effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to stimulate for 7 min because we knew we would have to rely on post-synaptic effects of repetitive stimulation to observe alterations in nociceptive processing and we wanted to wait as long as was practicable to lead to the greatest possible effect. This is because activating CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons leads to such rigid freezing behavior that the tail flick reflex (and obviously paw lick/jumping behavior) is prevented (as mentioned in the Materials and methods), so we knew we had to test without ongoing stimulation. Our experiment was inspired by those examining stress-induced analgesia, where foot shocks are delivered continuously or intermittently for 3 to 30 min to generate profound analgesia (Lewis et al., 1980). We did not confirm that 7 min was optimal. We chose a relatively long stimulation window, tested it, and saw a relatively robust effect and stuck with it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Given the authors previous work suggesting the importance of the PB-CeA pathway for aversive learning (3), one surprising finding is that the CGRP-PB projection to the CeA is not important for fear learning (as the authors discuss).

We agree that it is highly likely that there are other populations within the PBN that receive nociceptive input and may contribute to fear learning via connections to the CeA. A clear example of this possibility is neurons in the dorsal lateral PBN which are now suggested to be the primary receivers of spinoparabrachial input (Chiang et al., 2020), a subset of which projects to the external lateral PBN, where CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons reside. Indeed, it is possible that CGRP-receptor neurons rely on input from the dlPBN rather than CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons for their contribution to aversive learning (Han et al., 2015). We have discussed these possibilities (subsection “Associative fear learning”), and are grateful to the reviewer for their helpful suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References:</p><p>1) Fanselow, 1982</p><p>2) Landeira-Fernandez et al., 2006</p><p>3) Han et al., 2015</p><p>4) Sato et al., 2015</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
