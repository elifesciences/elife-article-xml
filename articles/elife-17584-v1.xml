the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link>, we published a Registered Report (Kandela et al., 2015) that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper “Coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide enhances the efficacy of cancer drugs“ (Sugahara et al., 2010). Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that coadministration with iRGD peptide did not have an impact on permeability of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in a xenograft model of prostate cancer, whereas the original study reported that it increased the penetrance of this cancer drug (Figure 2B; Sugahara et al., 2010). Further, in mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors, we did not find a statistically significant difference in tumor weight for mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, whereas the original study reported a decrease in tumor weight when DOX was coadministered with iRGD (Figure 2C; Sugahara et al., 2010). In addition, we did not find a statistically significant difference in TUNEL staining in tumor tissue between mice treated with DOX and iRGD compared to DOX alone, while the original study reported an increase in TUNEL positive staining with iRGD coadministration (Figure 2D; Sugahara et al., 2010). Similar to the original study (Supplemental Figure 9A; Sugahara et al., 2010), we did not observe an impact on mouse body weight with DOX and iRGD treatment. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17584.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17584.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>tumor penetrating peptide</kwd><kwd>doxorubicin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009827</institution-id><institution>Laura and John Arnold Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><institution>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</institution></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB) is a collaboration between the Center for Open Science and Science Exchange that seeks to address concerns about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Errington et al., 2014</xref>). For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>) for a 2010 paper by Sugahara et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>In 2010, Sugahara et al. reported that a novel cyclized form of a RGD motif containing peptide (iRGD) increased penetrance simply through co-administration with other therapies, including peptide-based therapeutics, small molecule drug compounds, and nanoparticle-based therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sugahara et al., 2010</xref>). This followed-up on a previous study that reported iRGD coupled to a motif that binds to the Neuropilin-1 receptor, increased tissue penetrance of cancer drugs beyond the vasculature when it was directly conjugated to those chemotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Feron, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sugahara et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The Registered Report for the 2010 paper by Sugahara et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 9A), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). Since that publication there have been additional studies that have utilized the iRGD peptide with the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in cancer biology research. Follow-up studies by Peng et al. reported that in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of prostate cancer iRGD improved the penetrance of DOX into tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Peng and Kopeček, 2015</xref>). However, this improvement was only observed in a DOX/iRGD conjugated form. Further, in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of mammary adenocarcinoma, Ni et al. reported that iRGD-grafted nanocrystallites can target cancer stem cells, which are typically inside the tumor core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ni et al., 2015</xref>). In a hepatocarcinoma xenograft model, utilizing the same mouse strain as Sugahara et al., Schmithals et al. reported that co-administration of iRGD enhanced the penetration of DOX into tumor tissue as well as reduced tumor size as compared to DOX alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Schmithals et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sugahara et al., 2010</xref>). Utilizing a different chemotherapeutic, Zhang et al. reported that in an A549 xenograft model of non-small cell lung cancer, co-administration of iRGD along with gemcitabine lead to increased penetrance of drug to the tumor and decreased tumor volume over the treatment period of 30 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, Lao et al. reported that a thymosin alpha 1-iRGD conjugated form increased apoptosis of MCF-7 cells and decreased tumor volume over an 11 day treatment period when compared to thymosin alpha 1 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying the amount of DOX present in tumor tissue and major organs in mice treated with DOX with or without iRGD</title><p>We sought to independently replicate the impact iRGD has on the penetrance of DOX, in an unconjugated form, in tumor and organ tissues of mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors.

This experiment utilized a 10 mg/kg dose of DOX and analyzed DOX accumulation after a brief exposure (1 hr). Mice harboring tumors were injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 10 mg/kg DOX and PBS, or a combination of 10 mg/kg DOX and 4 µmol/kg iRGD.

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 2C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sugahara et al. (2010)</xref>. While the original study included two doses of DOX (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg), this replication attempt was restricted to the lower dose (1 mg/kg), which in the original study showed the largest effect when DOX + PBS and DOX + iRGD were compared. The tumors were harvested and weighed 24 days after the start of treatment.

An additional exploratory analysis, as described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>), was performed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of body weight for each mouse over the entire treatment period.

Tumors, to evaluate efficacy, and heart tissues, to evaluate cardiotoxicity a known effect of DOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arola et al., 2000</xref>), were excised after the mice received intravenous injections of PBS, DOX + PBS, or DOX + iRGD every other day over a 24 day period. Negative and positive controls for TUNEL staining were performed in parallel to the study tissues confirming the specificity of the staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). While TUNEL staining was detectable in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>), no detectable TUNEL staining in heart tissues was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). This is in contrast to the original study, which reported TUNEL positive scores in heart tissue for these conditions, albeit much smaller than the reported scores in heart tissues from the 3 mg/kg DOX conditions. Scoring of TUNEL positive cells in tumors from mice treated with DOX + PBS were 0.79 times [n=6, <italic>SD</italic>=0.35] the amount of DOX in tumors from mice treated with PBS alone [n=6, <italic>M</italic>=1.0, <italic>SD</italic>=0.37] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, tumors from mice treated with DOX + iRGD were 0.71 times [n=6, <italic>SD</italic>=0.20] the amount of DOX in tumors from PBS treated mice. This is in comparison to the original study, which reported ~1.4 times increase for DOX + PBS treated mice and an ~2.6 times increase in TUNEL positive cells for DOX + iRGD relative to untreated mice. To evaluate if there were any differences in TUNEL staining in tumors among the conditions, we performed an ANOVA, which was not statistically significant (One-way ANOVA <italic>F</italic>(2, 15) = 1.378, <italic>p</italic>=0.282). The planned pairwise comparison of TUNEL staining in tumors from mice treated with DOX + PBS compared to DOX + iRGD was also not statistically significant (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 0.435, <italic>p</italic>=0.670, <italic>a priori</italic> significance threshold = 0.05). Other studies that utilized a similarly low dose of doxorubicin to reduce side effects, also reported small reductions in tumor weight compared to vehicle control with minimal and not statistically significant changes in TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hossain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sugahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17584.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>TUNEL staining of mouse tissues.</title><p>Mice bearing orthotopic 22Rv1 human prostate tumors were intravenously injected with PBS alone (PBS), 1 mg/kg DOX and PBS (DOX + PBS), or 1 mg/kg DOX and 4 µmol/kg of iRGD (DOX + iRGD).

The peptide chains were synthesized from the carboxyl terminus to the Cys amino terminus onto H-Cys(Trt)-2Cl resin. This H-Cys(Trt)-2Cl resin was incubated with dichloromethane (DCM) for 30 min and then washed with dimethylformamide (DMF) three times.

After each coupling, the peptide was ninhydrin tested and the coupling and washing steps repeated until the crude peptide was fully synthesized. The full synthesized crude peptide was cleaved from the resin and cleaned with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The crude peptides were diethyl ether precipitated, drained and washed.

Percent apoptotic index was calculated with the following formulation: (i/500) X100%. i = cell undergoing apoptosis. An average was taken of the apoptotic index from all five fields of all five slices (25 fields total) which is considered one biological replicate. Negative and positive control sections were stained in parallel to the tumor and heart samples and are available at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gmcyt/">https://osf.io/gmcyt/</ext-link>).

All data csv files and analysis scripts are available at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/xu1g2/">https://osf.io/xu1g2/</ext-link>). Confirmatory statistical analysis was pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/9hr2d/">https://osf.io/9hr2d/</ext-link>) before the experimental work began as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>). Additional exploratory analysis (area under the curve) was performed using the weights of the mice over the treatment period. Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met. A meta-analysis of a common original and replication effect size was performed using a random effects model and the <italic>metafor</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Viechtbauer, 2010</xref>). (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/ymxaz/">https://osf.io/ymxaz/</ext-link>). The original study data were extracted <italic>a priori</italic> from the published figures by determining the mean and upper/lower error values for each data point. The extracted data were published in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kandela et al., 2015</xref>) and were used in the power calculations to determine the sample sizes for this study. In the meta-analyses where Glass' Δ was used, because of unequal variance between the two conditions being compared, the standard deviation of DOX + PBS was used in the calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Deviations from registered report</title><p>The source of the TUNEL kit is different than what is listed in the Registered Report, with the used source and catalog number listed above.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Replication Study: Coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide enhances the efficacy of cancer drugs&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper attempts to replicate the work of Sugahara et al. 2010. The authors performed a well designed analysis of the co-administration approach and conclude that there is no statistical difference between groups of animals treated with doxorubicin with or without the iRGD tumor penetrating peptide. Studies of this nature are extremely important to clarify the potential for errors in the scientific literature and to understand how often this actually happens vs. poorly designed/attempts at repeating the study vs. unsubstantiated innuendo/rumor. Overall, this is a well performed study. The reviewers made a few suggestions for improvement before acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper is not written clearly. Given that the main objective is to replicate the work of Sugahara et al. 2010, this paper does not even cite the correct Sugahara paper. There are 2 other Sugahara citations (2009 and 2015), but not the 2010 paper.</p><p>The section on TUNEL staining results is very poorly written. This section refers to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. But no such figure relevant to TUNEL is in this paper. Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> of this paper (Cohen's d for meta analysis) may be relevant to TUNEL, it does not appear to be the case from what the authors write. The entire section on TUNEL staining, therefore, needs to be rewritten more clearly to the reader.</p><p>The statistical analyses are, in general, fine. However, the authors need to explain their meta analysis more clearly under the statistical analysis section of the methods. First, for the sake of completeness, it will be good to spell out clearly the sample sizes of each analysis undertaken. Second, explain how data from the Sugahara et al. 2010 paper was extracted for meta analysis. Third, please provide some insights into the meaning of Glass' Δ, r and Cohen's d. For example, it appears that Glass' δ is used because the standard deviation of the Sugahara et al. 2010 paper could not be obtained from that paper. Giving such explanations to motivate the use of each measure presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> will be helpful for the reader.</p><p>The authors ought to be appreciated for their efforts in making the data and computer programs available in this replication effort. However, some additional details will be helpful. For example, the computer program does not seem to have details about anova or meta analyses. Further, it is not clear whether the% weights reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were used as outcomes in anova or whether any transformation of these values were done.</p><p>Finally, a minor stylistic comment. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the dark shaded boxes are DOX+iRGD and the light shades are for DOX+PBS. However in the later figures (see, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the dark shaded boxes are for PBS and the white shaded box is for DOX+iRGD and the light shade is for DOX. I suggest the authors to use consistent shading across figures. For example, use white shaded box for DOX+iRGS in all box plots etc.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17584.012</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>This paper is not written clearly.
