Here, we demonstrate both distractor effects coexist in human decision making but in different parts of a decision space defined by the choice values. We show disruption of the medial intraparietal area (MIP) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) increases positive distractor effects at the expense of negative distractor effects. Furthermore, individuals with larger MIP volumes are also less susceptible to the disruption induced by TMS. These findings also demonstrate a causal link between MIP and the impact of distractors on decision-making via divisive normalisation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>divisive normalization</kwd><kwd>distractor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hong Kong Research Grants Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15603517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>Bolton KH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Science, The University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>Bolton KH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>221794/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rushworth</surname><given-names>Matthew FS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

While binary choices have been studied extensively, there has been growing interest in complex decisions with more response alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albantakis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Churchland and Ditterich, 2012</xref>). It has been claimed that introducing seemingly irrelevant ‘distractor’ alternatives influences decisions between the options of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spektor et al., 2018</xref>). However, while most evidence suggests that relative preferences between two options crucially depend on the value of added distractor options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louie et al., 2011</xref>), there is little consensus regarding the most fundamental feature of the nature of the distractor’s influence – whether it makes decision-making worse or better – and the underlying neural mechanisms affecting these preferences.</p><p>One potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon is divisive normalisation. Based on the principles of normalisation observed in sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carandini and Heeger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heeger, 1992</xref>), Louie and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louie et al., 2011</xref>) proposed that the encoded value of a given stimulus corresponds to the stimulus’ absolute value divided by the weighted sum of the absolute values of co-occurring stimuli. Despite differences in how exactly divisive normalisation is formalized (e.g. noise and weight assumptions), in general the hypothesis suggests that neural responses during decision-making or accuracy in decision-making are increased as the value of the best option increases and as the values of the remaining alternatives decrease. This hypothesis receives empirical support in a number of studies in humans and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khaw et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Louie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pastor-Bernier and Cisek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rorie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Webb et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, there has been support for this view from experiments showing that divisive normalisation can be applicable to multi-attribute choices, as normalisation can occur at the level of individual attributes before they are combined into an overall option value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Landry and Webb, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumbalska et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A seemingly opposing effect has been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>. They reported that human participants, who were asked to choose between two alternatives, displayed lower accuracy scores when a third low-value, rather than a third high-value option, was presented. Chau and colleagues modelled their behavioural findings using a biophysically plausible mutual inhibition model, in which different choice alternatives are represented by competing neural populations. Recurrent excitation within, and inhibition between populations create attractor dynamics, with one population displaying the highest firing rates, thereby indicating the choice of the associated response alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang, 2002</xref>). When a third option of high value, as opposed to low value, is added, however, inhibition between the populations is greater. This slows down the choice of the network such that it is less susceptible to noise and more capable of distinguishing between values, particularly when the value difference between the two available options is small. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref> reported just such a change in behaviour and further explored the mechanisms mediating the effect using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Blood oxygen-level dependent signals associated with a key decision variable, the value difference between the two available options, in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) were weaker when the distractor values were lower, further supporting the model predictions. Despite the fact that these findings appeared to stand in contrast to divisive normalisation, Chau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>), also noted that neural activity in the medial intraparietal area (MIP) of the parietal cortex showed patterns consistent with divisive normalisation.</p><p>Recently, however, it has been argued that neither the negative distractor effects predicted by divisive normalisation models nor the positive distractor effects predicted by mutual inhibition models are robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gluth et al., 2020</xref>). One way of reconciling these disparate points of view (positive distractor effects; negative distractor effects; no distractor effects), however, is the notion that, in fact, both positive and negative distractor effects occur but predominate to different degrees in different circumstances. This can be achieved by having a dual-route model that contains both a ‘divisive normalisation’ component and a ‘mutual inhibition’ component that run in parallel for making a decision in a race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>For example, careful consideration of the dual-route model suggests that the negative influence of the distractor should be most prominent in certain parts of a ‘decision space’ defined by two dimensions –the total sum and the difference in values of the options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). Firstly, in the divisive normalisation component, the negative impact caused by variance in distractor value should be greatest when the total sum of option values is low. In accordance with this prediction, distractors reliably exert a significant and negative effect on decision-making, when the sum of the values of the choosable options is small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). Secondly, positive distractor effects should predominate in the parts of the decision space in which the values of both choosable options are close and decisions are difficult but the opposite should happen when decisions are easy to make because the choice option values are far apart. Both positive and negative distractor effects are apparent even in data sets in which they have been claimed to be absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Another prediction of this composite model is that if both types of distractor effect exist, then one might be promoted at the expense of the other by a manipulation that made decision-making relatively more dependent on different parts of the distributed neural circuit mediating decision-making. For example, if the negative distractor effects linked to divisive normalisation are associated with intraparietal cortical areas such as MIP, then disrupting MIP should decrease their prevalence at the expense of the positive distractor effects associated with other decision-making areas such as vmPFC.</p><p>In the current study, we, therefore, used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over MIP while human participants performed a value-based decision-making task. First, we predicted that, in the absence of any TMS, we would observe both significant positive and significant negative distractor effects but they would predominate in different parts of decision space. Second, based on previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louie et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesised that disrupting MIP using TMS would decrease the effect of divisive normalisation in the decision-making process. This would reduce the negative distractor effect and increase the expression of the opposing positive distractor effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioural data: Increased positive distractor effect under contralateral MIP stimulation</title><p>A value-based decision-making task was used, in which participants were presented with two choosable options (high-value option HV or low-value option LV) and one distractor (D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As explained in the Methods, we looked at the impact of TMS to either MIP or a nearby control site (in the vicinity of area V5 or MT). However, both experiments also included an additional type of control condition: trials in which no TMS was applied.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Decision-making task and TMS.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Participants completed a value-based decision-making task. Three rectangular stimuli representing three options were presented. After a brief period (0.1 s; <italic>Stimulus Onset</italic>), two of the stimuli were marked as choosable (labelled by orange boxes) while the third stimulus was marked as a distractor (labelled by a purple box). Participants had 1.5 s to indicate their decision (<italic>Decision Phase</italic>). The option that was chosen was highlighted with a red box (<italic>Interval Phase</italic>, 0.5 s). Subsequently, a gold/grey margin around the stimulus indicated whether or not they received the reward associated with their response (<italic>Outcome Phase</italic>; 1 s). (<bold>b</bold>) Each stimulus was defined by its colour and orientation, which indicated the associated reward magnitude and the probability of receiving the reward, respectively. Stimuli ranged in reward magnitude from $25 to $150, and in reward probability from 1/8 to 7/8. An example of the colour-magnitude and orientation-probability mappings is shown in <bold>b</bold>. The mappings were randomised across participants. (<bold>c</bold>) In each experimental session, repetitive TMS (5 pulses, 10 Hz) was applied over either the MIP or MT region in 1/3 of the trials.

To do this we combined data from Non-TMS trials of both MIP and MT sessions. All participants displayed above chance performance in both the main decision-making task, and the “matching” trials (additional trials that aimed to prevent participants from ignoring the identity of the distractor; see Methods), with an average accuracy of 72.84% (SD = 6.71; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), and 70.14% (SD = 8.75) respectively, indicating that all participants followed task instructions. The average RT of the main task was 887.71ms (SD = 102.17ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

(<bold>a</bold>) To test whether this was the case in our data, we applied a GLM (which is identical to GLM5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>) in which accuracy in all Non-TMS trials was predicted using the terms, HV-LV, HV +LV, and D, as well as all two-way and three-way interactions: β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> + β<sub>3</sub> z<sub>(D)</sub> + β<sub>4</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> z<sub>(D)</sub> + β<sub>5</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> z<sub>(D)</sub> + β<sub>6</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> + β<sub>7</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> z<sub>(D)</sub> + ε. We found a positive effect of (HV +LV)D on accuracy (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 5.07, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=0.91, CI = [0.09, 0.2]), which was broadly consistent with the divisive normalisation prediction. In addition, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, this analysis showed a significant (HV-LV)D effect, suggesting that the distractor effect reversed as a function of choice difficulty. (<bold>b</bold>) In the task, some trials involved distractors with values that were greater than that of the LV, or sometimes even the HV, options. One may argue that a distractor may be most irrelevant to the decision process when its value is the lowest of the three options’ values. Hence, we repeated the above analysis by only including trials where the D value was smaller than both those of the HV and LV options. Again, we found a negative (HV-LV)D effect (<italic>t</italic>(26) = −2.68, p&lt;0.05, <italic>d</italic> = −0.52, CI = [−0.91,–0.12]) and a positive (HV +LV)D effect (<italic>t</italic>(26) = 3.46, p&lt;0.01, <italic>d</italic>=0.67, CI = [0.32, 1.27]). Overall, these results are consistent with previous work (cf. Appendix 3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref> and Supplementary Information 7, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). *p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.

Specifically, a multinomial logistic regression was applied to test the effects on the choice ratios (<bold>a</bold>) between HV/LV and (<bold>b</bold>) between HV/D. It involves the following GLM: β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> z<sub>(HV-D)</sub> + β<sub>3</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)(D-HV)</sub> + ε. Participants with at least three trials of distractor choice were included in this analysis. The first panel (<bold>a</bold>) illustrates distractor effects on HV/LV choice ratio and so it can therefore be interpreted in a similar way to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>. Critically, the second panel (<bold>b</bold>) not only provides a way to test the attentional capture by salient distractors, but in addition it also provides a further way of testing an interesting class of distractor effects – whether the rate at which participants opt for HV or D is affected by the LV option (which should be irrelevant to the rate at which choices are made between HV and D). This analysis generated two key findings. First, as predicted by the attentional capture model, a positive HV-D effect in (<bold>b</bold>) suggested that when the value of D became larger, D was also chosen more often, <italic>t</italic>(27) = 7.30, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=1.38, CI = [0.73, 1.30]. Second, the (HV-LV)(<bold>D–HV</bold>) effect in (<bold>a</bold>), as is also the case in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, and the (HV-D)(LV-HV) effect in (<bold>b</bold>) are all consistently negative, suggesting that the distractor effects varied as a function of choice difficulty. We note that although the (HV-D)(LV-HV) effect in (<bold>b</bold>) was marginally significant, the effect became significantly negative (<italic>t</italic>(22) = –2.56, p=0.018, <italic>d</italic>=–0.53, CI = [-0.54,–0.06]) when the analysis included participants with at least five, instead of three, trials of distractor choice.

In other words, there should be a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect. We tested whether this was the case in the current experiment by applying the same GLM (GLM1) as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>. In particular, it involved the following terms: the difference in value between the two available options (HV-LV), their sum (HV +LV), the difference between the distractor value and the high-value option (D-HV), and the interaction term (HV-LV)(D-HV). On Non-TMS trials, there was a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 17.09, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=3.07, CI = [0.69, 0.88]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and a negative HV +LV effect (<italic>t</italic>(30) = –4.35, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=–0.78, CI = [-0.38,–0.14]), suggesting that more accurate choices were made on trials that were easier and consisted of options with poorer values. There was no D-HV effect (<italic>t</italic>(30) = –0.95, p=0.350, <italic>d</italic>=–0.17, CI = [–0.17, 0.06]) but critically there was a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect (<italic>t</italic>(30) = –3.52, p=0.001, <italic>d</italic>=–0.63, CI = [-0.16,–0.04]). To further examine the pattern of the negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect, we median split the data according to HV-LV levels and applied GLM2 to test the critical D-HV effect. On hard trials with small HV-LV, there was a positive D-HV effect (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 2.62, p=0.014, <italic>d</italic>=0.47, CI = [0, 0.02]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), whereas on easy trials with large HV-LV, there was a negative D-HV effect (<italic>t</italic>(30) = –3.15, p=0.004, <italic>d</italic>=–0.57, CI = [–0.01, 0]).</p><p>In addition, divisive normalisation models also predict that the size of the <italic>negative</italic> distractor effect should be <italic>smaller</italic> when the total HV +LV is <italic>large</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). This is because the variance in D then makes a smaller contribution to the overall normalisation effect that depends on HV +LV + D. If present, such an effect can be demonstrated by a positive (HV +LV)D interaction effect. This was indeed the case in the data of the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). One may argue that the distractor was only irrelevant to choices when its value is smallest. An additional analysis that excluded trials where the D exceeded the value of LV or HV confirmed that the distractor effect remained comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In summary, these results are broadly consistent with recent demonstrations that both positive and negative distractor effects are reliable and statistically significant but that they predominate in different parts of the decision space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we note that, in addition to the positive and negative distractor effects on choices between HV and LV, there is a third route by which the distractor can affect decision making – salient distractors can capture attention and eventually be chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gluth et al., 2020</xref>). In an additional analysis reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, we showed that an attentional capture effect was also present in our data.</p><p>Next, we examined whether MIP has any role in generating distractor effects by comparing TMS and Non-TMS trials. In addition, neurons in the intraparietal sulcus mostly have response fields in the contralateral side of space, for example, enhancing the posterior parietal cortex that includes the MIP using transcranial direct current stimulation can bias selection of choices that are presented on the contralateral side of space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woo et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, we took care to consider whether any impact of TMS might be particularly robust when the distractor was presented contralateral to the MIP region that was targeted with TMS. We therefore split the trials according to whether the distractor was located on the contralateral side of space to the TMS. In other words, each analysis involved approximately one-fourth of the data that was split according to <italic>Stimulation</italic> (TMS/Non-TMS) and <italic>Distractor Location</italic> (ipsilateral/ contralateral side). Ideally, the trials should be split further according to difficulty, as indexed by the HV-LV difference, in order to isolate the negative distractor effect on easy trials that may be linked to MIP. However, that would mean that the analyses would rely on approximately one-eighth of the data and run the risk of becoming under-powered due to the small number of trials. Hence, we adapted GLM1 by removing the (HV-LV)(D-HV) term and keeping the remaining terms – HV-LV, HV +LV, D-HV (GLM3). We should now expect the absence of a D-HV main effect in the control Non-TMS data because the positive and negative distractor effects cancel out one another when they are no longer captured by a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction term. However, if TMS disrupts the negative distractor effect specifically and spares the positive distractor effect, then a positive D-HV effect should be revealed in the TMS data.</p><p>The results of GLM3 confirmed once again that in the control data, on average, higher accuracy was associated with larger HV-LV differences (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 17.04, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=3.06, CI = [0.76, 0.97]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and lower HV +LV sum values (<italic>t</italic>(30) = –3.50, p=0.001, <italic>d</italic>=0.63, CI = [-0.33,–0.09]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The average impact of D-HV on accuracy was not significant (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 0.69, p=0.496, <italic>d</italic>=–0.12, CI = [–0.08, 0.16]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), which, as already explained above, is consistent with the simultaneous presence of both positive and negative distractor effects on the hard and easy trials respectively that we have previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Next, a Site (MIP/MT) x Stimulation (TMS/Non-TMS) x Distractor Location (contralateral/ipsilateral) ANOVA was applied to the beta values of each predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We focused on examining the three-way interaction relating to the distractor value, in which a significant effect would suggest a robust <italic>TMS effect</italic> when it was applied to a <italic>specific brain region</italic> and when the distractor was presented at a <italic>specific location</italic>. When examining three-way interactions of this type, we found no significant effects associated with predictors that did not incorporate the distractor value D such as the HV-LV predictor (<italic>F</italic>(1,30) = 1.50, p=0.230, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic> p20.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) or the HV +LV predictor (<italic>F</italic>(1,30) = 3.06, p=0.090, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic> p20.09; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This suggests that these interactions were unaffected by TMS. Critically, however, the D-HV predictor showed a statistically significant three-way interaction (Site x Stimulation x Distractor Location: <italic>F</italic>(1,30) = 4.44, p=0.044, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic> p20.13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). This is consistent with a relative increase in the positive distractor effect (previously associated with vmPFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>) at the expense of the divisive normalisation effect associated with intraparietal areas such as MIP. No other main or two-way interaction effects of D-HV were observed in the ANOVAs, <italic>F</italic>&lt;0.87, p&gt;0.358 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A positive distractor effect on choice accuracy was revealed after MIP was disrupted using TMS.</title><p>GLM3 with the predictors (<bold>a</bold>) HV-LV, (<bold>b</bold>) HV +LV, and (<bold>c</bold>) D-HV was used to predict decision accuracy.

The estimated coefficients of (<bold>a</bold>) the D term per condition and (<bold>b</bold>) the HV-LV and HV +LV terms per participant are shown. We observed a significant TMS effect (i.e. the distractor effect became more positive on TMS trials than non-TMS trials; <italic>F</italic>(1,16048)=8.934, p=0.0028) when the distractor was located on the contralateral side of space to the MIP stimulation. There was an absence of TMS effect when the distractor was located on the ipsilateral side of space to the MIP stimulation (<italic>F</italic>(1,16048)=0.159, p=0.690) or when TMS was applied to the control MT region (contralateral: <italic>F</italic>(1,16048)=0.381, p=0.537; ipsilateral: <italic>F</italic>(1,16048)=0.457, p=0.499). When visually inspecting the figure, we noticed that there was a drop in the effect size on the MIP non-TMS trials when the distractor was located on the contralateral side of space, as opposed to that on the ipsilateral side of space. To rule out the possibility that the MIP-TMS effect was driven by the drop in effect size of the contralateral non-TMS trials, we pooled the distractor effects from both the control contralateral and ipsilateral MIP non-TMS trials and compared all these trials with the contralateral MIP TMS trials. We continued to observe a significant difference in distractor effect between the key contralateral MIP-TMS trials and this additional set of pooled control trials (<italic>F</italic>(1,16048)=6.104, p=0.0135). No significant differences were found in the comparisons between ipsilateral MIP-TMS trials and pooled MIP non-TMS trials (<italic>F</italic>(1,16048)=0.183, p=0.669).

(<bold>a</bold>) We applied six models suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bongioanni et al., 2021</xref> to fit participants’ behaviour, namely the Prospect Theory additive model (Model 1), the Prospect Theory multiplicative model (Model 2), the Prospect Theory composite model (Model 3), the Linear additive model (Model 4), the Linear multiplicative model (Model 5), and the Linear composite model (Model 6). The fitting assumes that the distractor was absent. To compare the goodness-of-fit between the models, a group-level random-effect Bayesian model selection (BMS) was applied to test the log-model evidence of all models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Penny et al., 2010</xref>). The comparison showed that the Prospect Theory composite model provides the best account of participants’ choices (estimated frequency = 0.545; exceedance probability = 0.956). In particular, this model first applies the classical Prospect Theory to transform the reward magnitudes and probabilities non-linearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahneman and Tversky, 1979</xref>), and then combines these two attributes using both additive and multiplicative methods.

We then re-ran a similar ANOVA to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> (including the factors Stimulation x Site x Distractor Location) to examine accuracy effects but added a fourth two-level factor of Behavioural Metric (Accuracy vs RT) on only the D-HV predictor and obtained the following effects. First, we found a three-way interaction between Stimulation ×Site × Distractor Location (<italic>F</italic>(1,30) = 4.96, p=0.034, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.14).

Nevertheless, in line with both our version of the diffusion model 22 and standard versions of diffusion model, both RT and accuracy indices of the response selection processes are affected.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75007-fig3-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>Another way to look at the divisive normalisation effect is to consider effects in a different GLM like that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</title><p>In the context of this other GLM, two other effects are worth noting. First, the main effect of D is clearly worth considering. If this is positive, then the positive distractor effect predominates at the expense of divisive normalisation while if it is negative then divisive normalisation predominates at the expense of the positive distractor effect. In the baseline state, the main effect of D is near zero consistent with the existence of both divisive normalisation and positive distractor effects. An ANOVA showed that the positive change in D effect was significant (Site ×Stimulation × Distractor Location: F(1,30) = 4.75, p=0.037, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.137). Second, in the same GLM the (HV +LV)D term describes how the separate divisive normalisation effects caused by HV +LV and D interact with each other. This term is of particular importance when considering the divisive normalisation effects caused by HV +LV and D. Divisive normalisation predicts poor choice accuracy as a function of the total value of HV +LV + D. Hence, when HV +LV is small (or large), the relationship between the D value and accuracy should show a steeper (or shallower) negative slope. In other words, the negative D effect should be stronger (or weaker). Similarly, when D is small (or large), the negative HV +LV effect should also be stronger (or weaker). Had both divisive normalisation effects caused by HV +LV and by D been present in our data, then this should be reflected by a positive (HV +LV)D interaction effect. This is, in fact, what is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Further, it is also important to test whether TMS disrupts both types of divisive normalisation effects; this should be apparent in a less positive (HV +LV)D effect. Note that in the current experimental task, however, it was not possible to have all three options, HV, LV, and D, presented on the side contralateral to the TMS on the same trial. Thus theoretically, each TMS train should only disrupt the divisive normalisation component caused by the contralateral option but it should spare the divisive normalisation component due to the remaining options from the ipsilateral side. Hence, we should expect only a weak TMS effect because disruption can only ever be weak. Nevertheless, the (HV +LV)D effect still became marginally less positive after MIP-TMS (F(1,30) = 3.77, p=0.062, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.112). In summary, once again, this analysis approach confirms the existence of both positive and negative (divisive normalisation) distractor effects and shows that the first effect predominates at the expense of the second effect after MIP TMS.

In each ANOVA, the terms associated with the opposite side were also entered as covariates. We found no Site x Stimulation effects in the ipsilateral data set (<italic>F</italic>&lt;1.87, p&gt;0.180). Since traditional frequentist statistics are less ideal for supporting claims of null effect, we performed Bayesian tests to compare the D-HV effect between TMS and Non-TMS trials in the ipsilateral data set (when the distractor had been presented ipsilateral to the MIP TMS). The results confirmed that there was an absence of TMS effect when it was applied over ipsilateral MIP (BF10=0.209) or MT (BF10=0.271). In the contralateral data, we found a significant Site x Stimulation interaction effect, <italic>F</italic>(1,26) = 4.99, p=0.034, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.16 (no other effects were significant, <italic>F</italic>&lt;0.73, p&gt;0.400), indicating that the Site x Stimulation x Distractor Location effect was driven by the contralateral presentation condition (when the distractor was presented contralateral to the MIP TMS). In other words, this is consistent with a relative increase in the positive distractor effect (previously associated with vmPFC) at the expense of the divisive normalisation effect associated with intraparietal areas such as MIP that occurs mainly when distractors are presented contralateral to the TMS site.</p><p>To clarify the nature of this effect, we split the contralateral data further into MT and MIP sets and repeated the ANOVA, entering only the Stimulation factor and including all other conditions as covariates, on each set. We found a significant effect of TMS on MIP conditions (<italic>F</italic>(1,24) = 4.32, p=0.049, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.15), with TMS trials showing a more positive D-HV effect than Non-TMS trials. The MIP-TMS effect became even clearer after the grey matter volume (GM) of the same region was also entered as a covariate (<italic>F</italic>(1,23) = 7.02, p=0.014, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.23; the next section explains the importance of considering the GM and explains how the GM indices were obtained). In contrast, we found no effect in MT conditions (<italic>F</italic>(1,24) = 1.24, p=0.277, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.05), and this lack of TMS effect was confirmed by an additional Bayesian test (BF10=0.225). The results remained similar even after entering the GM of MT as an additional covariate (<italic>F</italic>(1,23) = 0.19, p=0.664, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.01). These results suggest that TMS of MIP had a significant impact on promoting the positive distractor effect on accuracy at the expense of the opposing negative (divisive normalisation) distractor effect dependent on intraparietal sulcus areas such as MIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louie et al., 2011</xref>). The effect was especially clear when the distractor was presented contralaterally to the MIP TMS site. Finally, the MIP-TMS effect was even more robust when we analysed the data from all participants together in a mixed-effects model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or when we considered that participants may evaluate choice attributes in a non-linear manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>While our primary focus is on accuracy as an index of response selection, our diffusion model22, like most diffusion models, suggests that in many cases, factors that increase response selection accuracy will also increase response selection RT. This was true in the present case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, as explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the negative distractor effect should have become smaller when HV +LV was large (on such trials the distractor constitutes a smaller part of the total value of the stimuli and ultimately it is this total value that determines divisive normalisation). This was revealed as a positive (HV +LV)D interaction effect. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, we showed the (HV +LV)D effect also became marginally less positive after MIP-TMS (F(1,30) = 3.77, p=0.062, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.112).</p><p>In summary, the D-HV term indexes an important aspect of the influence of the distractor on behaviour. At baseline it is associated with two significant absolute effects; large distractor values are associated with higher accuracy when decisions are difficult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, left) and they are associated with lower accuracy when decisions are easy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, right). Thus, the balance of the distractor effect changes across the decision space defined by the choice values (such as the differences in their values). The balance of distractor effects also significantly changes with the disruption of MIP using TMS; the positive distractor effect becomes stronger at the expense of the negative distractor effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MRI data: VBM confirms link between MIP and the impact of TMS on the distractor effect</title><p>So far, we have provided evidence that MIP is causally related to the negative distractor effect because the antagonistic positive distractor effect emerged prominently and to a significantly greater extent after MIP was disrupted. To investigate the importance of MIP, and the impact of its disruption further, we sought an explanation of individual variation in effects. We might expect individual variation in MIP volume to be related to the degree of TMS modulation of the distractor effect. Recent studies suggested that those with smaller GM in the target region also demonstrate stronger behavioural changes after receiving TMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, in individuals with larger MIPs, the negative distractor effect should be less susceptible to TMS disruption and the opposing positive distractor effect should appear weaker.</p><p>To test this, we performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to examine the relationship between GM and the TMS effect on participants’ decision-making. The analysis was focused on parietal and occipital cortex in the same hemisphere to which TMS had been applied. The same GLM3 (HV-LV, HV +LV, D-HV) as described in the behavioural analysis was used. In order to extract the effects of TMS, we subtracted the beta values associated with Non-TMS trials from those associated with TMS trials (in contralateral conditions). This was conducted once for MT conditions, and once for MIP conditions. Interestingly, the effect of MIP TMS on the distractor value’s (D-HV) impact on decision accuracy showed a negative relationship with MIP GM (p=0.029, TFCE corrected, centred around MNI X(–30), Y(–52), Z(42), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This implies that in individuals with larger MIP GMs, there was less difference between TMS and Non-TMS trials (less relative increase in the positive distractor effect at the expense of the negative distractor effect), because TMS had a weaker impact on disrupting the MIP-related negative distractor effect. No significant GM differences were observed in any other parietal and occipital regions (p&gt;0.170).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Distractor effects of individuals with larger MIPs were less susceptible to TMS.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Statistical map displayed on a standard MNI brain shows a significant relationship between TMS effect (difference in distractor effect between TMS and Non-TMS trials) and MIP.

In addition, the correlation remained significant even without controlling for HV-LV and HV +LV (<italic>r</italic>(29) = –0.37, p=0.043). Since visual inspection revealed a potential outlier with small MIP GM and a large TMS effect on the D-HV predictor, we repeated the partial correlation analysis by excluding this data point. The results did not change qualitatively (<italic>r</italic>(26) = –0.55, p=0.002).</p><p>Next, we ran three additional analyses to demonstrate that the correlation was specific to the MIP GM only when TMS was applied to MIP itself (but not when TMS was applied to the control MT region). First, there was no correlation between MIP GM and TMS effect when it was estimated in the control sessions where MT was stimulated (<italic>r</italic>(27) = –0.05, p=0.816; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> right). Second, despite finding no effect in MT in the VBM analysis, we extracted the GM in the control MT region and tested whether it was related to the TMS effect in the experimental MIP session. We found no significant correlation (<italic>r</italic>(27) = –0.19, p=0.325; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> left) even though this analysis is less conservative than the VBM analysis illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>. Finally, there was also no relationship between the GM of the control MT region and TMS effect extracted from the control MT-TMS sessions (<italic>r</italic>(27) = –0.03, p=0.871; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> right). The conclusion that there was a null effect was supported by supplementary Bayesian analyses (BF10 &lt;0.275 in all three relationships illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> right and 4 c left and right).</p><p>Finally, we note that the correlation between MIP GM in each individual and the impact of MIP TMS on the D effect in behaviour was more strongly negative than the correlation between MIP GM in each individual and the impact of MT TMS on the D effect in behaviour (i.e. comparing the correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> left and right; <italic>z</italic>=–2.47, p=0.014).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Eye-tracking data: TMS affects gaze shifts between D and HV</title><p>Previous work has suggested that the positive distractor effect, which is prevalent on hard trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and which becomes more prominent when MIP is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), is linked to particular patterns of eye movement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref> showed that there is a positive correlation between distractor value and gaze shift between the D and HV options. As such, larger distractor values are associated with more D-and-HV gaze shifts and, ultimately, more accurate HV choices are made. This suggests that accumulation of evidence in favour of the HV, as opposed to the LV, option is prolonged when D captures overt attention, and this eventually leads to more accurate decision-making. Similarly, in other settings, participants who are allowed extra time to revise their initial decisions tend, ultimately, to make more accurate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Resulaj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the positive relationship between distractor value and D-to-HV gaze shift was replicable in the current study. We also tested whether the positive relationship became even stronger after the TMS disrupted the negative distractor effect and spared the positive distractor effect. Hence, we again applied GLM3 (HV-LV, HV +LV, D-HV) to predict gaze shifts between D and HV.</p><p>First, we showed that larger D-HV values were related to more gaze shifts between D and HV (<italic>t</italic>(30) = 4.75, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=0.85, CI = [0.03, 0.08]). The result is similar to that reported by Chau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). However, in the previous study the relationship between the difference in D/HV values, D-HV, and gaze shifts was apparent for D-to-HV gaze shifts whereas in the present analysis the association was with gaze shifts between HV and D in either direction. In addition, HV-LV and HV +LV had no clearly significant effect on the bidirectional gaze shifts (t(30) &lt; 1.55, p&gt;0.131). We then performed a critical test that examined whether large distractor values were more strongly related to more gaze shifts between D and HV after MIP was disrupted using TMS. This was done by comparing the effect of D-HV on gaze shifts between HV and D using a Site (MIP/MT) by Side (contralateral/ipsilateral) by Stimulation (TMS/Non-TMS) ANOVA. This was analogous to the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> that examined how TMS modulated the distractor’s influence on choice behaviour. Note that five participants were excluded in this analysis due to the absence of gaze shifts between HV and D in some conditions of this ANOVA. The results showed a significant Site ×Stimulation interaction effect, <italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 8.85, p=0.006, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.26. Follow-up ANOVAs with factors of Side and Stimulation revealed in MIP sessions the effect of distractor value on gaze shifts was significantly higher in TMS compared to Non-TMS trials (<italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 5.30, p=0.030, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.18), while in MT sessions there was no significant difference between TMS and Non-TMS trials (<italic>F</italic>(1,25) = 1.62, p=0.214, <italic>η<sub>p</sub>2</italic>p20.06).</p><p>To avoid excluding data from five participants due to splitting the data multiple times into small sets, we ran a similar analysis by collapsing the conditions of Side (contralateral/ipsilateral).

These results show that distractors with higher values lead to increased numbers of gaze shifts from the distractor to the high-value option, and importantly, that this effect is increased by applying TMS over MIP.</p><p>In the analyses above, we used the predictors HV-LV, HV +LV, and D-HV to predict gaze shifts in order to be consistent with the previous analyses of the choices participants took (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, in order to predict gaze shifts, it might be argued that the effects of individual option values, instead of differences in, or sums of, values of options are more easily interpretable. We therefore repeated the same analyses, but using the predictors HV, LV, and D, instead of HV-LV, HV +LV, and D-HV. The results did not change qualitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to explore the effects these gaze shifts had on decision-making, we used gaze shifts in all possible directions (HV to LV, LV to HV, LV to D, D to LV, HV to D, and D to HV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) to predict decision accuracy. We found that increased numbers of gaze shifts towards the low-value option were associated with lower accuracy (HV to LV: <italic>t</italic>(26) = –4.6, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=–0.88, CI = [-0.21,–0.08]; D to LV: <italic>t</italic>(26) = –4.74, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=–0.91, CI = [-0.19,–0.07]). Importantly, we found increased accuracy to be associated with increased gaze shifts from the distractor to the high-value option (D to HV: <italic>t</italic>(26) = 5.77, p&lt;0.001, <italic>d</italic>=1.11, CI = [0.13, 0.27]). No other gaze shifts revealed significant results (p&gt;0.116). Together, these findings suggest that after TMS disrupts the negative distractor effect mediated by MIP, large distractor values are more influential in promoting D-to-HV gaze shifts which, ultimately, are associated with more accurate choices.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that decisions can be altered by adding seemingly irrelevant distractors to decision-making tasks. Two contrasting effects have been reported; the relative value of a distractor has been associated with both improved (positive distractor effect) and impaired (negative distractor effect) decision accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louie et al., 2013</xref>). At first glance, these effects appear mutually exclusive and it has recently been argued that neither effect is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gluth et al., 2020</xref>). However, it has been demonstrated that both effects co-exist and vary across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Webb et al., 2020</xref>). Data obtained from humans and monkeys also suggest the possibility that the two distractor effects are associated with the operation of different brain regions. The negative distractor effect predicted by divisive normalisation models is associated with intraparietal sulcal regions, such as MIP and LIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louie et al., 2011</xref>), while the positive distractor effect has been linked with vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it has been suggested not only that both distractor effects co-exist, but also that each effect prevails in different parts of decision space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Specifically, the negative distractor effect is most prominent in decisions that are easy or with options that are generally poor; whereas the positive distractor effect is most prominent in decisions that are difficult or with options that are generally valuable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These variations in the distractor effect are captured by a dual-route model that incorporates both a divisive normalisation mechanism and a mutual inhibition mechanism in separate decision routes that compete in a parallel race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). It is clear that multiple brain mechanisms are concerned with choice selection and that these span not just parietal cortex and vmPFC but also include orbitofrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and cingulate cortex as well as subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rushworth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chau et al., 2018</xref>). What determines which mechanism predominates in a given setting is likely to be related to the speed with which it operates in a given situation and with a given input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>) and the certainty of the evaluations that it makes. The current results again suggest an association between these different routes and different brain regions.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Positive and negative distractor effects co-exist and are causally related to frontal and parietal regions respectively.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) People’s choices are influenced by the presence of seemingly irrelevant distractors and the precise effects vary across the decision space. Choices are improved by large distractor values when they are difficult (positive distractor effect; green arrow). In contrast, choices are impaired by large distractor values when they are easy (negative distractor effect; blue arrow). Previous studies showed that positive and negative distractor effects are related to vmPFC and MIP respectively. (<bold>b</bold>) When MIP is disrupted using TMS, the negative distractor effect is reduced, sparing the opposing positive distractor effect. (<bold>c</bold>) In contrast, in patients with vmPFC lesions, the positive distractor effect is reduced, sparing the opposing negative distractor effect.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75007-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the current study, we demonstrated that after disrupting the parietal cortex using TMS, the negative distractor effect was reduced and so the remaining positive distractor effect emerged more robustly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6b</xref>). Additionally, an analysis of structural differences in parietal regions provided further evidence for the role of MIP. Individuals with larger MIPs were less susceptible to the TMS disruption and showed less impairment in their negative distractor effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results obtained using TMS and structural scans are in line with results of functional scans showing that MIP signals were weakened by large distractor values presented on the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, we found that the MIP region in which grey matter variance predicted variance in the size of MIP TMS effects was slightly anterior to the MIP region targeted with TMS. This may reflect the fact that the impact of individual variance in MIP is most apparent at its edges rather than at its centre. No similar relationship was apparent between the grey matter in any other parietal, occipital, or temporal area in the stimulated hemisphere. A whole brain analysis found only one other region in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While we initially sought evidence of any positive relationship (i.e. larger MIP GM associated with stronger negative distractor effects, the disruption of which would have a stronger effect overall), we found no evidence for any such pattern. This may be consistent with a recent report that relationships between individual variation in brain structure and individual variation in behaviour are not strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kharabian Masouleh et al., 2019</xref>). It might, however, be reasoned that it ought to be difficult to relate variation in behaviour per se to variation in brain structure because a behaviour reflects an aggregate, net output of multiple processes distributed across numerous brain areas. It should, however, be easier to relate variation in TMS effects on behaviour to variation in brain structure because the variation in TMS effects on behaviour are mediated by one specific brain region. The negative relationship that was found is most simply interpreted as suggesting that lower MIP GM makes MIP more easily and reliably disrupted by TMS. Although this result does not speak to the relationship between MIP GM and the negative distractor effect per se, it nevertheless informs us of the locus of the TMS effect and confirms that MIP plays a crucial role in the expression of the negative distractor effect. We note, however, that even if individual variation in MIP structure does not predict individual variation in susceptibility to divisive normalisation, individual variation in MIP activity patterns do predict individual variation in similar behavioural effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, a causal relation between the vmPFC and a positive distractor effect has been observed in both humans and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>). In both species, individuals with vmPFC lesions, unlike control or pre-operative individuals, were less accurate in their decisions when high-value distractors were presented. In vmPFC lesion individuals, the manifestation of a negative distractor effect is possibly due to the reduction of the opposing positive distractor effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that positive and negative distractor effects are causally related to the neural processes in vmPFC and parietal cortex respectively.</p><p>It has been argued that the positive distractor effect, which is linked to vmPFC, is mediated by overt attention. According to the mutual inhibition model, the presence of an appealing distractor can boost the overall inhibition in a neural network and avoid stochastic choices. Indeed, similar predictions are apparent in other sequential sampling models that explain changes of mind in decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Resulaj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>). These models suggest that the evidence accumulation process, which guides decision-making, continues even after an initial decision is made. When people are allowed to revise their choice after a brief delay, they tend to make more accurate decisions afterwards. All these models share the prediction that a distractor is able to delay the decision-making process, causing more accurate decisions. Indeed, eye movement data support this notion. In essence, large value distractors should attract more gazes and delay the choices between the two alternative options. Interestingly, when the distractor is perceived as unavailable, attention is quickly shifted from it to the high-value option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). In the current study, we found that these gaze shifts from the distractor to the high-value option were indeed associated with increased accuracy, and crucially, that these gaze shifts were promoted when the positive distractor effect became more prominent after MIP TMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that a positive distractor effect can be induced in some regions of distractor space in divisive normalisation-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Webb et al., 2021</xref>). This occurs because, as a noisy representation of the distractor increases in value, it is disproportionately more likely to be chosen than the LV option as opposed to the HV option. Whether this effect exerts a large influence in the current study is unclear given that participants are instructed never to choose the distractor. It is, nevertheless, the case that the distractor is, albeit infrequently, chosen by participants. Despite their differences, it is notable across a range of models that it is the operation of a choice comparison process in the context of noise that makes it possible to account for positive distractor effects. This is true whether it is a recurrent neural network model emphasizing mutual inhibition between pools of neurons representing each choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>), diffusion models of evidence accumulation for choice selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>), or even in certain parts of decision space in divisive normalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Webb et al., 2021</xref>). While some models place greater emphasis on the presence of noise in the comparison process, other emphasize noise in the representation of the choices themselves. It is possible to envisage models in which the asymmetric impact of a noisy distractor representation on rejection of the LV option is greatest when HV and LV options are far apart in value. The empirical findings reported here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>), however, suggest that the greatest impact occurs when HV and LV are close in value and it is difficult to choose between them. The high value distractor augments and protracts the comparison process during these difficult choices so that HV is more likely to be chosen.</p><p>A third account of how the distractor affects decision making is by attentional capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gluth et al., 2020</xref>). It suggests that overt attention is attracted by the presence of a salient distractor such that inaccurate choices will be made by choosing the distractor itself. It is noticeable that these three accounts (positive distractor effect, negative distractor effect, and attentional capture) are not mutually exclusive, but instead they can all co-exist and each account describes one aspect of how the distractor influences decision making (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>There are two limitations in the current study. First, we did not directly test whether the positive distractor effect is generated in the vmPFC. Second, an alternative explanation for the presence of a positive distractor effect after MIP-TMS is that it is due to a direct change in the divisive normalisation computation in the MIP itself. We argue, however, that another interpretation is that by perturbing the MIP and reducing its associated negative distractor effect then this allows for stronger expression of the positive distractor effect associated with the vmPFC. This link is based on findings of previous studies that suggest a relationship between the positive distractor effect and vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>) and the greater prominence of negative distractor effects after vmPFC is damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>). A future study which includes stimulation of the vmPFC could examine this interpretation further. Note however, that TMS over frontal regions can cause discomfort in participants and would require an adjustment of the stimulation protocol. Perhaps most critically, it may not even be possible for TMS effects to be induced at the depth below the scalp at which vmPFC lies. Additionally, it is important to note that the effects in the VBM analysis that we do report are relatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we argue that several independent effects can be identified – changes in behavioural performance, changes in eye-movement patterns, and grey matter differences – and they all provide converging evidence for the occurrence of positive and negative distractor effect as well as the role of MIP in decision-making.</p><p>The current study focused on the interactions that occurred between available options and the distractor as a function of their overall value and the involvement of the MIP in mediating the impact of the distractor. Recent model developments have suggested that in multi-attribute choices, the interactions between options could occur at the level of the representations of their individual, component attributes, prior to integration into an overall value. These models include the use of divisive normalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Landry and Webb, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumbalska et al., 2020</xref>) or leaky-competing-accumulator model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Usher and McClelland, 2004</xref>). Although the current study makes no specific claim about whether MIP is causally related to the divisive normalisation mechanism at the level of overall value or individual attribute, it will be important to test these two alternative hypotheses in future studies.</p><p>In summary, we show that TMS-induced disruption of MIP increases the positive distractor effect, i.e. the relationship between increased distractor values and improved accuracy. We argue that, in the current study, positive and negative distractor effects co-occur, and that the disruption of one gives way to an increased expression of the other.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 31 neurotypical, right-handed participants (17 female) with a mean age of 21.90 (SD = 3.08) were recruited.

Prior to the experiment, each participant received information about the procedures and completed a screening questionnaire to ensure the safe use of TMS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each participant was paid between HKD 400 and HKD 500, depending on task performance (see <italic>Decision-Making Task</italic>).

In Session 2, participants’ structural brain scans were obtained using MRI (see <italic>MRI data acquisition</italic>). Sessions 3 and 4 were experimental sessions in which they completed the decision-making task while their eye-movements were tracked (see <italic>Eye movement recording and preprocessing</italic>) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied. In Sessions 3 and 4, the rTMS was applied over either their MIP or a closely adjacent control brain region – the MT region. The order of MIP/MT sessions was randomised across participants. Each experimental session took approximately 60 min. Sessions 3 and 4 were scheduled to be a minimum of seven days apart.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Decision-making task</title><p>Participants completed a multi-alternative value-based decision-making task that was similar to that of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In each trial, three coloured rectangles were presented and participants were asked to choose the best option. The rectangles’ value was defined by their colour and orientation, indicating the associated reward magnitude and probability respectively. Specifically, each stimulus was associated with one of six reward magnitudes ($25, $50, $75, $100, $125, $150), indicated by colour, ranging from blue to green and one of seven probabilities (1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, 6/8, 7/8) indicated by orientation, ranging from 0° to 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The direction of the mapping between visual (colour, orientation) and decision (magnitude, probability) properties were randomised across participants.</p><p>At the beginning of each trial, participants were presented with a fixation cross at the centre of the screen (2.5 s), followed by the stimulus onset, during which three options represented by rectangular bars were shown in randomly selected screen quadrants. On 33% of the trials, after 50ms five TMS pulses were applied at a frequency of 10 Hz. After another 50ms, coloured boxes were presented around each stimulus, indicating which two options were available for choice (orange boxes), and which option was the unchooseable distractor (purple box). Participants were instructed to indicate their choice within 1.5 s from the onset of this decision phase. To indicate their decision, participants pressed one of four keys (‘f’, ‘v’, ‘n’, ‘j’) on a keyboard, associated with the four screen quadrants (top left, bottom left, bottom right, top right respectively). After a stimulus was chosen, the box surrounding it turned red (0.5 s). Then the edge of each stimulus was coloured either gold or grey to indicate which stimuli were rewarded (1 s). If the distractor or the empty quadrant were chosen, or no response was provided before the 1.5 s deadline, feedback (‘Error!’ or ’Too slow!’ respectively) was provided.</p><p>In order to ensure that all stimuli were attended to, a matching task was added to 1/6 of trials. In these trials, participants were presented with the word ‘MATCH’ (1 s), followed by a rectangular stimulus (2 s) in the centre of the screen after they indicated their decision. The participants were asked to identify in which screen quadrant of the current trial this stimulus was presented and indicate their choice in the same way as described above. If the stimulus did not match any of the three stimuli of the current trial, the participant was asked to select the blank quadrant.

Each participant’s head and their individual MRI were coregistered (during the threshold detection prior to the acquisition of the MRI scan), by marking a number of anatomical landmarks on both the participant’s head and on their structural MRI scans (nasion, inion, left/right preauricular point, left/right exocanthion) using a digitising pen.

To identify this intensity, single-pulse TMS was applied to the right primary motor cortex via a coil positioned tangentially to the scalp with the handle pointing backward. MEPs were measured using surface electromyography electrodes placed over the left first dorsal interosseous in a belly-tendon montage. The exact position of the coil was determined individually based on where the largest MEPs could be reliably evoked.

We aimed to stimulate the left medial intraparietal area (MIP) in experimental sessions and the left middle temporal visual area (MT) in active control sessions. MIP was chosen based on the literature suggesting its role in hand movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mars et al., 2011</xref>) and divisive normalisation effects in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). MT, which is implicated in visual motion perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Born and Bradley, 2005</xref>), was chosen as a control site as it was unlikely to be critical for any aspect of the performance of the current decision-making task but it is relatively close to the brain area of interest. The stimulation sites MIP and MT were located at the standard MNI coordinates X=-30, Y=-58, Z=62 and X=-51, Y=-80, Z=6 respectively, which were individualized by transforming the standard coordinates back to individual MRI scans using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL). Adjustment of the stimulation sites was applied in some participants due to minor inaccuracies of the automated transformation using FSL or due to discomfort but the resulting distributions of stimulation sites were tightly clustered over MIP and MT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MRI data acquisition and preprocessing</title><p>T1-weighted structural images were collected using a Philips Achieva 3.0T scanner, using an MPRAGE sequence (1x1 x 1 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel resolution, 240x240 x 200 grid, TR = 7 \ms, TE = 3.2ms, flip angle = 8°). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to explore associations between differences in local grey matter volume (GM) and the impact of TMS on the distractor effect.

The resulting images were averaged to create a study specific grey matter template. Native grey matter images were then nonlinearly registered to this template and modulated to correct for local expansion/contraction due to the non-linear component of the spatial transformation. The modulated images were then smoothed with an isotropic Gaussian kernel (sigma = 3 mm), and a voxelwise GLM was applied using permutation-based nonparametric testing (5000 permutations).

We applied three generalised linear models (GLMs) with a binomial data model (applied using the Matlab function ‘glmfit’) to predict each participants’ accuracy:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>GLM1: β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> + β<sub>3</sub> z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> + β<sub>4</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> + ε</p></list-item><list-item><p>GLM2: Step 1, β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> + ε<sub>1</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 2, β<sub>3</sub> + β<sub>4</sub> z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> + ε<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>GLM3: β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> + β<sub>3</sub> z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> + ε</p></list-item></list><p>There are multiple ways to index the distractor value in the GLMs, such as D-HV, D-LV and D. Each of which should provide similar results because they are strongly correlated to each other (<italic>r</italic>&gt;0.47). However, the D-HV term was selected for easier comparison with the HV-LV effect and also with the distractor effects reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). In each GLM, z(<italic>x</italic>) refers to <italic>z</italic>-scoring of term <italic>x</italic>. GLM1 is identical to GLM1b of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>. The variances of the HV and LV options are accounted by the z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> and z<sub>(HV+LV)</sub> terms and the critical distractor effect was tested by the z<sub>(D-HV)</sub>. In addition, the z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> interaction term tested whether the distractor effect varied as a function of difficulty level (i.e. HV-LV). For cases with significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect, the data were median split by the HV-LV term and analysed using GLM2 to test the distractor effect on each half of the data. GLM2 involved a stepwise procedure to partial out the effects of HV and LV from the choice accuracy data. Then the distractor effects were tested on the residual ε<sub>1</sub> using the z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> term. GLM3 was applied to assay the impact of TMS on the distractor effect. It is a simplified version of GLM1 in which the z<sub>(HV-LV)</sub> z<sub>(D-HV)</sub> interaction term was excluded. It was applied on the TMS and Non-TMS trials separately.</p><p>Each GLM was applied separately to each participant and each of the following conditions: TMS trials/Non-TMS trials in sessions in which the MIP/MT was targeted. Since the parietal neurons, including those from MIP, often have a response field that is selective to a small part of a contralateral space, the trials were further broken down into whether the distractor was displayed contralaterally/ipsilaterally to the stimulation, resulting in, at most, a total of eight conditions. The resulting beta values obtained from a GLM were then entered into a Site (MIP/MT) x Stimulation (TMS/Non-TMS) x Distractor Location (contralateral/ipsilateral) ANOVA, to test the impact of the different stimulation conditions on the relationship between stimulus values and accuracy. We hypothesised that MIP stimulation disrupts the negative distractor effect, while sparing the MIP-unrelated positive distractor effect, when the distractor was presented on the contralateral side. Therefore, MIP stimulation should result in a more positive relationship between distractor value and accuracy than control trials from the same session when the distractor was presented on the contralateral side. In addition, a more positive relationship between distractor value and accuracy should be apparent when contralateral distractor trials with MIP TMS are compared with any conditions in the control MT sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>VBM Data Analysis</title><p>We set out to explore the relationship between local GM and the effect of TMS on decision-making. To this end, we used beta weights estimated by GLM3 used in the behavioural analysis, and subtracted the beta weights associated with the Non-TMS condition from the beta weights associated with the TMS condition (specifically: [MIP/TMS/Contralateral] – [MIP/Non-TMS/Contralateral]) for each predictor. The resulting differences were normalised and entered as explanatory variables in the VBM. This allowed us to test the relationship between local GM and the TMS effect on each predictor’s impact on decision accuracy. We hypothesised that the difference in beta weights associated with the D-HV predictor (i.e. the impact of TMS on the distractor effect) is positively related to the size of parietal regions (i.e. the disruptive effect of TMS applied to MIP will be smaller in participants with larger MIPs because less of the volume of MIP will have been affected by the TMS). We repeated the same analysis in relation to the TMS effect associated with control MT stimulation (specifically: [MT/TMS/Contralateral] – [MT/Non-TMS/Contralateral]), but expected no effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Eye-tracking Data Analysis</title><p>Apart from the MIP-related negative distractor effect, the MIP-unrelated positive distractor effect is associated with overt attention that is reflected by eye-movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chau et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we hypothesise that this effect is increased when TMS is applied over MIP, disrupting the positive distractor effect’s antagonist. We therefore tested the impact of the presented stimuli on gaze shifts between the distractor stimulus (D) and the high-value (HV) option. We first tested all gaze shifts, that is all instances in which two immediately adjacent fixations included D and HV. To test directionality, we also repeated the analysis on gaze shifts from D to HV, and from HV to D separately.</p><p>The analysis of the eye-tracking data followed a similar process as the analysis of the behavioural data. GLM3 (predictors: HV-LV, HV +LV, D-HV; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), here using a normal distribution, was applied to predict gaze shifts. As in the behavioural analysis, the GLM was applied for each person and each condition separately, and a repeated-measures ANOVA (Site x Stimulation) was conducted on the resulting beta values (note that a Site x Simulation analysis was chosen for simplicity, but that a Site x Stimulation x Distractor Location analysis revealed qualitatively identical results).</p><p>Additionally, we explored the effect of gaze shifts between all possible options (HV to LV, HV to D, LV to HV, LV to D, D to LV, and D to HV) on accuracy using GLM4:</p><p>GLM4: β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub> z<sub>(HV to LV shift)</sub> + β<sub>2</sub> z<sub>(HV to D shift)</sub> + β<sub>3</sub> z<sub>(LV to HV shift)</sub> + β<sub>4</sub> z<sub>(LV to D shift)</sub> + β<sub>5</sub> z<sub>(D to LV shift)</sub> + β<sub>6</sub> z<sub>(D to HV shift)</sub> + ε.</p><p>Since we did not have sufficient data to test these predictors on each condition, we tested their effect on accuracy across all Non-TMS trials. We were unable to identify sufficient gaze shifts in five participants and excluded these from the analysis. The resulting beta values of the remaining participants were then analysed using two-tailed one-sample t-tests.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The experiment was approved by the Human Subjects Ethics Committee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and informed consent was obtained from all participants (HSEAR20151208001).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-75007-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The behavioural data, eye-tracking data, anonymized MRI grey matter volume data collected and analysed during the current study are available on Dryad: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ngf1vhhzn">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.ngf1vhhzn</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kohl</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>MXM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rushworth</surname><given-names>MFS</given-names></name><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>BKH</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Intraparietal stimulation disrupts negative distractor effects in human multi-alternative decision-making</data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.ngf1vhhzn</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (15603517), the State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, and the Wellcome Trust grant (221794/Z/20/Z).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Albantakis</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Branzi</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Deco</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2012">2012</year><article-title>A multiple-choice task with changes of mind</article-title><source>PLOS ONE</source><volume>7</volume><elocation-id>e43131</elocation-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043131</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22916216</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenkinson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2007">2007</year><article-title>Non-linear registration, aka spatial normalisation FMRIB technial report TR07JA2</article-title><source>Imaging Brain, Dep.Clin.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Joshua Gold as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was some concern about the lack of robustness of the TMS results and running an ANOVA on the betas from subject specific GLMs given that this ignores the estimated variance of the betas. In the follow up ANOVAs the standard errors from the individual GLMs are discarded, potentially impacting the results. In consultation the reviewers suggested potentially running a giant regression (all the data) with subject-specific effects for HV+LV and HV-LV and then a group level interaction on D-HV (including the site*location*TMS interactions). This would allow a simple t-test on the 3-way coefficient. This would essentially be a group-level GLM without subject-specific coefficients (this essentially averages over all subjects) and cluster standard errors at the subject level.</p><p>2) There is a strong assumption in the analyses that subjects make choices with perfect calculations of expected value (linear utility). However, it is well-known that people vary quite a bit from optimal EV calculations and have different risk preferences and biases that drive decisions. The authors need to show that their results hold with non-linear utility functions and/or individualized utility functions for each subject if possible.</p><p>3) There were several concerns about the interpretation of the results, justification of analysis choices, and potential limitations of the study given the design that need to be addressed (see reviews below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper from Kohl and colleagues examines the biological basis of context-dependent decision-making, in which the preference for given options depends on factors beyond their intrinsic values. They authors target a specific form of context effect in trinary choice where unchosen options nevertheless shift the relative preference between the remaining two alternatives, a violation of traditional, normative theories of choice behavior. The existence and nature of these effects have been a recent topic of debate: some studies report negative effects (where distractors decrease choice accuracy in a value-dependent manner), some report positive effects (distractors increase accuracy), and some report no effect at all. Recent work from this same group showed that these disparate results can be reconciled if choosers exhibit both forms of context-dependence (in different regions of decision space defined by choice difficulty), proposing a composite model where prefrontal and parietal cortices mediated positive and negative effects, respectively.</p><p>Here, the authors present data replicating the coexistence of positive and negative distractor effects and, furthermore, show causal evidence for the role of intraparietal cortex – disrupting the medial intraparietal cortex (MIP) with transcranial magnetic stimulation selectively reduces negative distractor effects, with the degree of disruption correlating (negatively) with the size of MIP. The paper is clearly written and the results together support both the idea of a composite model, providing one of the only causal manipulations of such context effects. Overall the experimental approach is well reasoned and the results important, though there are some subtleties of analysis the authors should address, including the definition of regressors, the potential impact of nonlinear subjective values, and the interpretability/relevance of phantom decoy effects.</p><p>1) Definition and justification for regressors. The choice of regressor terms to test context-dependence could be better explained here, even if they follow past publications. Why is distracter value formalized as D-HV rather than D (e.g. in the interaction term (HV-LV)(D-HV))? Is there a particular reason to use D-HV instead of D, D-LV, or some other construct? And given this formalization, why do the authors use D in the interaction (HV+LV)D when testing the prediction of normalization (pg. 10).</p><p>2) Assumption of expected value choosers (linear utility). Given the crucial role of choice accuracy in the analyses, it is a bit concerning that correct choices are defined only by expected value calculations given the common finding of empirical risk preferences. The main question is whether any of the results would change if the choosers were in fact not expected value (risk neutral) choosers and choice performance was misspecified. The authors could reasonably argue that subjects are likely close to risk neutral given the small stakes, but given the central role of accuracy in the analyses, it is an important point to quantitatively establish. For example, the authors could either: (A) quantify a nonlinear utility function for individual subjects (either using effective binary trials where D=0, if they exist; or aggregating across all choices at all D values), or (B) show that the main results still hold assuming a reasonable range of nonlinear utility functions and redefined accuracy values.</p><p>3) Practical relevance. The task design using the ultimately unchoosable distractor is clever, allowing the examination of distractor effects in otherwise untestable scenarios (when D is high value and would be chosen over both HV and LV options). One issue is that the nature of the task – involving a mid-trial shift in choosable options – may elicit different internal dynamics and choices than a simple choice. In this regard, a more natural way to elicit distractor effects is a rank ordering approach (as in Dumbalska et al., 2020, PNAS); I certainly don't expect the authors to revise their task, but a discussion of the possible limitations would help. Aside from the unnatural dynamics, the use of the phantom decoy means that distractor effects are examined in many cases when they would not naturally occur (i.e. when the distractor would be selected). Do the main effects (dual distractor effects, MIP role in negative effects, morphometry results) still hold if the authors only include trials where D is lower than the LV and HV?</p><p>4) Support for Figure 3D (accuracy as function of D-HV in MIP TMS condition). The figure legend states that this panel supports an increase in accuracy with increasing distractor value, but the support for this statement isn't clear. From the graph, the trend in the MIP Contra condition is only mildly more evident that the other conditions, visually; more importantly, the main text does not present a quantitative analysis of a dependence on D-HV (e.g. regression) – it only presents the results of ANOVAs. Is there additional analysis that the authors meant to present?</p><p>5) Robustness of TMS effects. One statistical concern for the paper is that the primary TMS results are supported by effects with relatively marginal significance: three way interaction for D-HV p = 0.044, contralateral site x stimulation ANOVA p = 0.034, contralateral MIP stimulation ANOVA p = 0.049. This limitation is evident to the authors, as they avoid the additional splitting of data by difficulty and acknowledge the power issues. One finding in the authors' favor is that the effect is stronger with the inclusion of MIP size as a covariate. There is not much that we as reviewers can reasonably ask at this point, but perhaps a acknowledgement of this issue and a discussion of potential reasons and future plans to address it would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper addresses a current debate on whether (and how) value-based choice behaviour is influenced by seemingly irrelevant options (distractors). Previous work has proposed an influence of distractor value on accuracy arising from a divisive normalization computation, which acts as a form of gain normalization on neural activity. There is evidence for such a computation in the lateral intra-parietal region of non-human primates.</p><p>The view being advanced by the paper is two-fold. First, that the effects of DN (a reduction in choice accuracy) should be most prominent when the magnitudes (sum) of options are low and decisions are difficult. And second, that this DN process takes place in parietal regions, and is competitive with some other process (perhaps in vmPFC) which induces positive distractor effect (increased accuracy).</p><p>The paper reports results from new experiments (of a previously studied-design) that assess the causal role of the medial intra-parietal area (MIP) on choice via TMS. The authors report that disruption of MIP increases choice accuracy. This effect is interpreted as disruption of the DN effect on choice. The experimental design is appropriate and the experiment and analysis are well-executed.</p><p>My main concerns with the paper are on the interpretation of the results and how they relate to the underlying theory being proposed. These concerns are essentially expositional. I would suggest a revision to address them.</p><p>1) The paper ascribes a negative distractor effect to DN, and a positive distractor effect to some other process (perhaps mutual inhibition). It is important to clarify what DN model the paper is considering, and what its predictions are. The theoretical statements on pg 6 lines 97-107 seem to be describing the model presented by Louie et al. in which the normalization term contains the non-weighted sum, but is not clear on the noise assumption. It is important to note a few issues here.</p><p>– The form of DN considered in Louie et al., 2013 is highly simplified. The perception literature suggests a number of more complicated functional forms with parameters (or perhaps even computations) that are tuned to the task. It would be VERY surprising if a choice process in cortex used a DN computation in which all weights and rectification parameters were set to 1. This is important, because statements about the role of the distractor in altering choice accuracy depend on this.</p><p>– DN can induce a positive distractor effect in some regions of decoy space. This is reported in the original Louie et al. paper, and is due to the Gaussian noise assumption (see Webb et al., 2020a, Figure 5 and Proposition 3).</p><p>– More broadly, where DN effects are strongest (as a function of option differences and magnitudes) also depends on the form of DN considered and the noise assumption. The paper is not very precise on the conditions required for the statements on pg 6 to be true. They can be verified analytically for a general form of DN and the Gumbel error. But a more general statement is difficult. Have the authors demonstrated this theoretical statement previously?</p><p>pg 6 lines 104-107. Whether positive distractor effects should dominate (depending on decision difficulty) also depends on a few factors. What is verifiable is that, under some assumptions, the influence of DN on choice ratios is smallest when the choice is easy (see above). Whether this leads to a positive distractor effect depends on the other unspecified process (like a MI model) and its relative influence. But this is not a prediction of DN, as implied in line 97, rather it is a prediction of the dual-route theory.</p><p>pg11 lines 201-202. It is not clear to me why the effect “reverses” since the main effect is not significant. Perhaps it is “pronounced” or “apparent” on difficult trials?</p><p>Figure 3D is a bit hard to interpret. Why is the data binned in to 4 bins? And not just a continuous regression reported? I suspect the figure is trying to demonstrate a positive trend as a function of D, but no statistical tests are run on these bins (and none seem significant). Perhaps the fitted values from the GLM could be generated as a function of D instead?</p><p>lines 394-395: What is the increase in gaze shifts between D and HV relative to? gaze shifts between D and LV? HV and LV?</p><p>pg 30 lines 540: It is not clear how these results are evidence for a causal relationship between mPFC and a positive distractor effect. Couldn’t the lesion of vmPFC just be creating substantial noise in the valuations, regardless of whether a negative distractor effect is operating. It seems odd to call this a “reduced positive distractor effect”. This matters for the discussion of the causal effect of vmPFC TMS below on pg 31. Assigning this effect to a relatively &quot;stronger influence of DN&quot; wouldn't be accurate, as it could simply reflect an increase in noise.</p><p>There is a limitation when using choice data alone to argue that TMS reduces normalization at the expense of some other process which has a positive distractor effect. Perhaps TMS alters the DN computation (i.e. its weights) in a way that induces a positive effect?</p><p>More broadly, the paper is not clear on how the dual-route theory operates. Is it an either/or process, so that when intra-parietal regions are TMS’d they are essentially “deactivated” and the decision is guided solely by vmPFC? If so, what process determines which “route” yields the decision in the control conditions? It would seem strange for this switching process to use value (i.e. difficulty) as the switching condition given that value is seemingly what is being constructed/determined. Or is the value process sequential, so that output from vmPFC feeds into parietal regions? If so, wouldn’t the TMS just be adding noise to the valuation process, reducing accuracy?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Intraparietal stimulation disrupts negative distractor effects in human multi-alternative decision-making&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is non-standard when reporting structural model fits of choice behaviour and problematic because including RT in this regression where choice is the outcome variable is subject to a (likely high) endogeneity problem (it is correlated with the error term in the regression) therefore the other coefficients are likely biased (see discussion in Webb (2019) and Chiong et al., (forthcoming)). Without seeing the model results that don't include RT, it is impossible to assess which direction the bias goes. Please report all coefficients in these regressions, as well as the results for the model without RT as a regressor. If the authors want to include RT in the empirical analysis, they need to address the endogeneity problem by either estimating a dynamic model (like they propose with their race model, or finding a valid instrument using a control function approach).</p><p>Webb, R.

We noticed that the effects become most robust when we (1) follow the editor’s suggestion of collapsing all participants’ data using a logistic mixed-effects analysis, (2) replace the D-HV term by a D term, and (3) include reaction time as covariate. Specifically, the analysis included the terms of HV-LV, HV+LV, and RT that are grouped by subject along with the D term that is grouped by Site, Stimulation, and Location. Here, we observed a significant TMS effect (i.e. the distractor effect became more positive after TMS; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=13.87, <italic>p</italic>=0.000197) when the distractor was located on the contralateral side of space to the MIP stimulation. In addition, there was an absence of TMS effect when the distractor was located on the ipsilateral side of space to the MIP stimulation (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=0.0206, <italic>p</italic>=0.886) or when TMS was applied to the control MT region (contralateral: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=1.377, <italic>p</italic>=0.241; ipsilateral: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=1.468, <italic>p</italic>=0.226).

As suggested, we have now supplemented the analyses of decision making using a non-linear, individualized function to transform the “optimal” EVs. The key results remain significant. In particular, we first compared six utility functions and identified that the non-linear Prospect theory composite model provides the best account of participants’ choices. In particular, this model first applies the classical Prospect Theory to transform the reward magnitudes and probabilities in a non-linear manner (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). These two attributes are then combined using both additive and multiplicative methods. Next, we applied the non-linearly-transformed values, repeated the analyses, and found that all the key results reported in Figure 3 remain significant (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>In our revised manuscript we have continued to report the objective value results first in order to pre-empt any concerns that readers unfamiliar with subjective values might have. We have then followed up with a report of analyses based on subjective value estimates. The revised text now reads as follows:</p><p>“Finally, the MIP-TMS effect was even more robust when we analysed the data from all participants together in a mix-effect model (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) or when we considered that participants may evaluate choice attributes contributing to value in a non-linear manner (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).” (Lines 266-269)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There were several concerns about the interpretation of the results, justification of analysis choices, and potential limitations of the study given the design that need to be addressed (see reviews below).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the collating the comments.

And given this formalization, why do the authors use D in the interaction (HV+LV)D when testing the prediction of normalization (pg. 10).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. In GLM1-3, we indexed the distractor value as D-HV and tested the effect of distractor in a hypothesis free approach – we allowed the models to freely fit a positive weight (that supports the mutual inhibition account) or a negative weight (that supports the divisive normalisation account) to the D-HV term. In the GLM included in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, we tested a number of distractor effects, including (HV+LV)D term that allowed us to test specific predictions made by the divisive normalisation account. Below, we explain why we employed the D-HV term and (HV+LV)D term in these analyses.</p><p>One important reason why the distractor value was indexed as D-HV is because it allows easy comparison with previous studies. In addition, it is important to consider other terms in the GLMs. Let’s consider GLM1 that includes the terms HV-LV, HV+LV, D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) for predicting choice accuracy. The HV-LV term that describes how much the LV option is <italic>relatively</italic> poorer than the HV option; it should predict much of the variance in how like the participant is to choose HV rather than LV and, therefore, should be the most robust parameter. To describe distractor value in a similar format to the HV-LV term, we consider that either the <italic>relative</italic> term HV-D (as in Chau et al., <italic>Nat Neurosci</italic> 2014) or D-HV (as in Chau et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020) should be a better choice than the <italic>absolute</italic> term D. However, once that is done, it is not possible to include both D-HV and D-LV, in addition to HV-LV, in the same GLM because that will result in rank deficiency. In other words, if distractor value is included as a relative term it can only be included as one relative term, either D-HV or D-LV. We consider that D-HV is a better choice than D-LV because the HV term is supposedly more choice-relevant than the LV term. Despite these subtleties, the effects of the distractor should remain similar whether it is defined as D-HV, the mirror term HV-D, D-LV, or just D (see Chau et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2020 Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). These reasons for the use of the D-HV term in GLM1 should also be applicable to GLM2 and GLM3.

However, the D-HV term was selected for easier comparison with the HV-LV effect and also with the distractor effects reported in previous studies<sup>6,22</sup>.”</p><p>We describe an additional analysis that employed the (HV+LV)D term on Page 10 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to test further the predictions of the divisive normalisation account. Before that, we have shown in Figure 2d that a negative distractor effect predicted by divisive normalisation existed in our data. However, we notice that divisive normalisation should also predict that the distractor’s negative impact should be stronger if the total value of the HV and LV alternatives is smaller. This is because divisive normalisation depends on the total value HV+LV+D and the distractor’s absolute value D should have greater contribution to the degree of normalisation when HV+LV is smaller. Thus, the distractor value should be indexed as the absolute value D in this analysis. We have now revised the legend of Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to explain this:</p><p>“Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Participants showed smaller negative distractor effect when HV+LV was large. Divisive normalisation models predict that the size of the negative distractor effect is smaller when HV+LV is large, since the absolute distractor value D contributes less to the overall value of HV+LV+D. (a) To test whether this was the case in our data,…” (Lines 957960)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Assumption of expected value choosers (linear utility). Given the crucial role of choice accuracy in the analyses, it is a bit concerning that correct choices are defined only by expected value calculations given the common finding of empirical risk preferences. The main question is whether any of the results would change if the choosers were in fact not expected value (risk neutral) choosers and choice performance was misspecified. The authors could reasonably argue that subjects are likely close to risk neutral given the small stakes, but given the central role of accuracy in the analyses, it is an important point to quantitatively establish. For example, the authors could either: (A) quantify a nonlinear utility function for individual subjects (either using effective binary trials where D=0, if they exist; or aggregating across all choices at all D values), or (B) show that the main results still hold assuming a reasonable range of nonlinear utility functions and redefined accuracy values.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that non-linear utility functions are commonly used in this field to capture choices that are highly subjective. As suggested, we have now supplemented the analyses of decision making using a non-linear, individualized function to transform the “optimal” EVs. The key results remain significant. In particular, we first compared six utility functions and identified that the non-linear Prospect theory composite model provides the best account of participants’ choices. In particular, this model first applies the classical Prospect Theory to transform the reward magnitudes and probabilities in a non-linear manner (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). These two attributes are then combined using both additive and multiplicative methods. Next, we applied the non-linearly-transformed values, repeated the analyses, and found that all the key results reported in Figure 3 remain significant (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>In our revised manuscript we have continued to report the objective value results first in order to pre-empt any concerns that readers unfamiliar with subjective values might have. We have then followed up with a report of analyses based on subjective value estimates. The revised text now reads as follows:</p><p>“Finally, the MIP-TMS effect was even more robust when we analysed the data from all participants together in a mix-effect model (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) or when we considered that participants may evaluate choice attributes contributing to value in a non-linear manner (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).” (Lines 266-269)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Practical relevance. The task design using the ultimately unchoosable distractor is clever, allowing the examination of distractor effects in otherwise untestable scenarios (when D is high value and would be chosen over both HV and LV options). One issue is that the nature of the task – involving a mid-trial shift in choosable options – may elicit different internal dynamics and choices than a simple choice. In this regard, a more natural way to elicit distractor effects is a rank ordering approach (as in Dumbalska et al., 2020, PNAS); I certainly don't expect the authors to revise their task, but a discussion of the possible limitations would help. Aside from the unnatural dynamics, the use of the phantom decoy means that distractor effects are examined in many cases when they would not naturally occur (i.e. when the distractor would be selected). Do the main effects (dual distractor effects, MIP role in negative effects, morphometry results) still hold if the authors only include trials where D is lower than the LV and HV?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that having an unchoosable distractor has the disadvantage of potentially inducing a “mid-trial shift”, even though it has the important advantage that it allowed us to examine the distractor effect in a parametric range that is beyond the HV and LV options. Note that, because of this concern, we revealed the identity of the distractor soon (in 0.1 second) after the options were presented in the current study and also in two preceding studies (Chau et al., <italic>Nat Neurosci,</italic> 2014 and <italic>eLife</italic>, 2020). In addition, in Chau et al., <italic>Nat Neurosci,</italic> 2014, we ran an extra experiment that involved three choosable options and defined the distractor as the worst option. In Supplementary Information 7, we reported that the results were similar – there was a negative (HV-LV)D interaction effect.</p><p>We followed the reviewer’s constructive suggestion of analyzing trials where the D was lowest in value compared to the HV and LV options. The results were broadly consistent with our original claims. However, before describing these results, we noticed that it is not feasible to run such an analysis using the key GLM1 (with HV-LV, HV+LV, D-HV, and (HV-LV)(D-HV) as regressors) and GLM3 (with HV-LV, HV+LV, and D-HV as regressors). By design, we optimized the study efficiency by decorrelating these key parameters. The collinearity between the regressors will become serious if we analyze only those trials where the distractor value was poorest (e.g. the correlation between HV-LV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) changed from <italic>r</italic>=-0.032 to <italic>r</italic>=-0.920; the correlation between HV-LV and D-HV changed from <italic>r</italic>=-0.240 to <italic>r</italic>=-0.431). We addressed this in the 2014 study mentioned in the previous paragraph by carefully redistributing the option values in an additional experiment so as to avoid collinearity when the distractor assumed lower values. Nevertheless, we notice that this can be resolved by running the GLM described in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which involves the terms HV-LV, HV+LV, and D, as well as all twoway and three-way interactions. We performed the analysis and found that the distractor effects remained similar. These results are reported in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>“One may argue that the distractor was only irrelevant to choices when its value is smallest. An additional analysis that excluded trials where the D exceeded the value of LV or HV confirmed that the distractor effect remained comparable (Figure 2—figure supplement 1b).” (Lines 176-179).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Support for Figure 3D (accuracy as function of D-HV in MIP TMS condition). The figure legend states that this panel supports an increase in accuracy with increasing distractor value, but the support for this statement isn't clear. From the graph, the trend in the MIP Contra condition is only mildly more evident that the other conditions, visually; more importantly, the main text does not present a quantitative analysis of a dependence on D-HV (e.g. regression) – it only presents the results of ANOVAs. Is there additional analysis that the authors meant to present?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by another reviewer, we have now shown Figure 3D using the fitted results.</p><p>Hopefully the trend should look clearer now:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Robustness of TMS effects. One statistical concern for the paper is that the primary TMS results are supported by effects with relatively marginal significance: three way interaction for D-HV p = 0.044, contralateral site x stimulation ANOVA p = 0.034, contralateral MIP stimulation ANOVA p = 0.049. This limitation is evident to the authors, as they avoid the additional splitting of data by difficulty and acknowledge the power issues. One finding in the authors' favor is that the effect is stronger with the inclusion of MIP size as a covariate. There is not much that we as reviewers can reasonably ask at this point, but perhaps a acknowledgement of this issue and a discussion of potential reasons and future plans to address it would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer, as well as the editor for pointing out the issue of the significance level of the TMS effect. We noticed that the effects become most robust when we (1) follow the editor’s suggestion of collapsing all participants’ data using a logistic mixed-effects analysis, (2) replace the D-HV term by a D term, and (3) include reaction time as covariate. Specifically, the analysis included the terms of HV-LV, HV+LV, and RT that are grouped by subject along with the D term that is grouped by Site, Stimulation, and Location. Here, we observed a significant TMS effect (i.e. the distractor effect became more positive after TMS; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=13.87, <italic>p</italic>=0.000197) when the distractor was located on the contralateral side of space to the MIP stimulation. In addition, there was an absence of TMS effect when the distractor was located on the ipsilateral side of space to the MIP stimulation (<italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=0.0206, <italic>p</italic>=0.886) or when TMS was applied to the control MT region (contralateral: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=1.377, <italic>p</italic>=0.241; ipsilateral: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,16048</sub>=1.468, <italic>p</italic>=0.226). We have now reported these results that show the TMS effect at a much better significance level:</p><p>“Finally, the MIP-TMS effect was even more robust when we analysed the data from all participants together in a mix-effect model (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) …” (Lines 266-269)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This paper addresses a current debate on whether (and how) value-based choice behaviour is influenced by seemingly irrelevant options (distractors). Previous work has proposed an influence of distractor value on accuracy arising from a divisive normalization computation, which acts as a form of gain normalization on neural activity. There is evidence for such a computation in the lateral intra-parietal region of non-human primates.</p><p>The view being advanced by the paper is two-fold. First, that the effects of DN (a reduction in choice accuracy) should be most prominent when the magnitudes (sum) of options are low and decisions are difficult. And second, that this DN process takes place in parietal regions, and is competitive with some other process (perhaps in vmPFC) which induces positive distractor effect (increased accuracy).</p><p>The paper reports results from new experiments (of a previously studied-design) that assess the causal role of the medial intra-parietal area (MIP) on choice via TMS. The authors report that disruption of MIP increases choice accuracy. This effect is interpreted as disruption of the DN effect on choice. The experimental design is appropriate and the experiment and analysis are well-executed.</p><p>My main concerns with the paper are on the interpretation of the results and how they relate to the underlying theory being proposed. These concerns are essentially expositional. I would suggest a revision to address them.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that the reviewer found something of interest in our report. We understand the reviewer’s concerns and we have attempted to address them as we explain point-by-point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The paper ascribes a negative distractor effect to DN, and a positive distractor effect to some other process (perhaps mutual inhibition). It is important to clarify what DN model the paper is considering, and what its predictions are. The theoretical statements on pg 6 lines 97-107 seem to be describing the model presented by Louie et al. in which the</p><p>normalization term contains the non-weighted sum, but is not clear on the noise assumption. It is important to note a few issues here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that sometimes specifying the precise model is important to some debates. For example, Gluth and colleagues (<italic>Nat Human Behav</italic>, 2020) tried to argue that the divisive normalisation effect reported by Louie and colleagues (<italic>PNAS</italic>, 2013) was not replicable.</p><p>In a reply by Webb and colleagues (<italic>Nat Human Behav,</italic> 2020), it was demonstrated clearly that a more robust prediction could have been made had the divisive normalisation model included the right assumption about the noise distribution (i.e. a Gumbel distribution). We have attempted to make this clearer in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In one sense, the reviewer’s comments highlight the fact that DN models include two important elements. First, there is the divisive normalisation process itself. Despite the existence of variants of DN models, a general prediction is that neural responses and the resulting behavioural accuracy should decrease as the values of the alternatives are larger. A second important element, however, concerns the way in which noise is assumed to operate. An important consequence of different noise assumptions is, as the reviewer notes in their subsequent points below, on how the process of option comparison unfolds.</p><p>In this study, we do not intend to argue what should be the right specification of the divisive normalisation model, which is why we used more assumption-free terms (e.g. D-HV) to test for its impact. Our first main point is that divisive normalisation is clearly observable in our data and our second is that it can be disrupted by stimulating the parietal cortex. Nevertheless, we agree that we should remind readers that there are variants in how exactly the divisive normalisation model is specified. We have therefore made changes to the Introduction as shown below.</p><p>“One potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon is divisive normalisation. Based on the principles of normalisation observed in sensory systems<sup>10,11</sup>, Louie and colleagues<sup>9</sup> proposed that the encoded value of a given stimulus corresponds to the stimulus’ absolute value divided by the weighted sum of the absolute values of co-occurring stimuli.. Despite differences in how exactly divisive normalisation is formalized (e.g. noise and weight assumptions), in general the hypothesis suggests that neural responses during decision-making or accuracy in decisionmaking are increased as the value of the best option increases and as the values of the remaining alternatives decrease. This hypothesis receives empirical support in a number of studies in humans and monkeys<sup>8,12–16</sup>. Recently, there has been support for this view from experiments showing that divisive normalisation can be applicable to multi-attribute choices, as normalisation can occur at the level of individual attributes before they are combined into an overall option value16,17.”</p><p>In addition, however, in the Discussion, we emphasize that the process of option comparison is commonly assumed to operate in the context of noise. Despite their differences, this is true in models that emphasize mutual inhibition between pools of neurons representing each choice (Chau et al., <italic>Nature Neuroscience,</italic> 2014), drift diffusion models of evidence accumulation (Chau et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2020), and in DN models (Webb, <italic>Management Science</italic>, 2020). In all cases, it is consideration of the operation of this comparison process in the context of noise that makes it possible to account for positive distractor effects. We have made changes to the Discussion along the lines shown below (Lines 501-521).</p><p>“It is important to note that a positive distractor effect can be induced in some regions of distractor space in divisive normalisation-based models<sup>8,16</sup>. This occurs because, as a noisy representation of the distractor increases in value, it is disproportionately more likely to be chosen than the LV option as opposed to the HV option. Whether this effect exerts a large influence in the current study is unclear given that participants are instructed never to choose the distractor. It is, nevertheless, the case that the distractor is, albeit infrequently, chosen by participants. Despite their differences, it is notable across a range of models that it is the operation of a choice comparison process in the context of noise that makes it possible to account for positive distractor effects. This is true whether it is a recurrent neural network model emphasizing mutual inhibition between pools of neurons representing each choice<sup>6</sup>, diffusion models of evidence accumulation for choice selection<sup>22</sup>, or even in certain parts of decision space in divisive normalisation<sup>16</sup>. While some models place greater emphasis on the presence of noise in the comparison process, other emphasize noise in the representation of the choices themselves. It is possible to envisage models in which the asymmetric impact of a noisy distractor representation on rejection of the LV option is greatest when HV and LV options are far apart in value. The empirical findings reported here and elsewhere<sup>6,22</sup>, however, suggest that the greatest impact occurs when HV and LV are close in value and it is difficult to choose between them. The high value distractor augments and protracts the comparison process during these difficult choices so that HV is more likely to be chosen.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The form of DN considered in Louie et al., 2013 is highly simplified. The perception literature suggests a number of more complicated functional forms with parameters (or perhaps even computations) that are tuned to the task. It would be VERY surprising if a choice process in cortex used a DN computation in which all weights and rectification parameters were set to 1. This is important, because statements about the role of the distractor in altering choice accuracy depend on this.</p><p>– DN can induce a positive distractor effect in some regions of decoy space. This is reported in the original Louie et al. paper, and is due to the Gaussian noise assumption (see Webb et al., 2020a, Figure 5 and Proposition 3).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have noted positive distractor effects can be present even in DN models. in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript as follows (Lines 501-521):</p><p>“It is important to note that a positive distractor effect can be induced in some regions of distractor space in divisive normalisation-based models<sup>8,16</sup>.

But a more general statement is difficult. Have the authors demonstrated this theoretical statement previously?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point being made by the reviewer.

Whether positive distractor effects should dominate (depending on decision difficulty) also depends on a few factors. What is verifiable is that, under some assumptions, the influence of DN on choice ratios is smallest when the choice is easy (see above). Whether this leads to a positive distractor effect depends on the other unspecified process (like a MI model) and its relative influence. But this is not a prediction of DN, as implied in line 97, rather it is a prediction of the dual-route theory.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that some of the predictions previously described in the aforementioned paragraph are pertinent to the dual-route model, instead of divisive normalisation <italic>per se</italic>. We have now revised the corresponding section (Lines 93-113) to make this point clearer.</p><p>“Recently, however, it has been argued that neither the negative distractor effects predicted by divisive normalisation models nor the positive distractor effects predicted by mutual inhibition models are robust <sup>19,20</sup>. One way of reconciling these disparate points of view (positive distractor effects; negative distractor effects; no distractor effects), however, is the notion that, in fact, both positive and negative distractor effects occur but predominate to different degrees in different circumstances. This can be achieved by having a dual-route model that contains both a “divisive normalisation” component and a “mutual inhibition” component that run in parallel for making a decision in a race<sup>6</sup>.</p><p>For example, careful consideration of the dual-route model suggests that the negative influence of the distractor should be most prominent in certain parts of a “decision space” defined by two dimensions –the total sum and the difference in values of the options <sup>21</sup>. Firstly, in the divisive normalisation component, the negative impact caused by variance in distractor value should be greatest when the total sum of option values is low. In accordance with this prediction, distractors reliably exert a significant and negative effect on decision-making, when the sum of the values of the choosable options is small <sup>21</sup>. Secondly, positive distractor effects should predominate in the parts of the decision space in which the values of both choosable options are close and decisions are difficult but the opposite should happen when decisions are easy to make because the choice option values are far apart. Both positive and negative distractor effects are apparent even in data sets in which they have been claimed to be absent <sup>6,21</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>pg11 lines 201-202. It is not clear to me why the effect “reverses” since the main effect is not significant. Perhaps it is “pronounced” or “apparent” on difficult trials?</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is related to Figure 2. The combination of the absence of a D-HV main effect and the presence of a (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect can be interpreted as indicating that the DHV effect is reversed as a function of the HV-LV term. In other words, the D-HV effect changes from positive to negative (or in the opposite direction) in different portions of the data such that they cancel out each other in the main effect. This is the case when we estimated the D-HV effects on hard (small HV-LV) trials and easy (large HV-LV) trials separately in Figure 2d. We have now revised these lines, such that it may be easier to follow:</p><p>“(c) GLM1 revealed that there was a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect on accuracy, suggesting that the distractor effect (i.e. D-HV) varied as a function of difficulty (i.e. HV-LV).

We have revised these lines and hopefully the clarity is now improved:</p><p>“Chau et al. (2020) showed that there is a positive correlation between distractor value and gaze shift between the D and HV options.

Couldn’t the lesion of vmPFC just be creating substantial noise in the valuations, regardless of whether a negative distractor effect is operating. It seems odd to call this a “reduced positive distractor effect”. This matters for the discussion of the causal effect of vmPFC TMS below on pg 31. Assigning this effect to a relatively &quot;stronger influence of DN&quot; wouldn't be accurate, as it could simply reflect an increase in noise.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. Although we would first like to first point out that this comment most directly relates to the discussion of a hypothetical case of perturbing the vmPFC and that it is arguably less directly related to the current empirical findings that concerns the parietal cortex, we understand that this issue is of some general interest. We have therefore tried to make changes to the manuscript. Arguably, the issues related to this comment are three-fold in nature. First, what is the consequence for choice behaviour of a vmPFC lesion? Second, what are the predicted effects of TMS were it possible to apply it to disrupt the vmPFC? Third, can the distractor effect observed in individuals with vmPFC lesion be explained by any changes in noise level?</p><p>First, to explain the effects associated with vmPFC lesion, on Page 30, we described evidence from two studies by Noonan and colleagues that involved testing the distractor effect in humans or monkeys. Both studies showed that a negative distractor effect was only present in individuals with vmPFC lesions. There was an absence of an overall distractor effect in control individuals, including those with a lesion in other areas of the prefrontal cortex. The findings of the current manuscript and Chau et al. (2020) demonstrate that positive and negative distractor effects co-exist in different parts of the decision space suggesting that the two effects can, in some circumstances, cancel out each other if the decision space is not considered in the analysis. We have revised Lines 477 to 484 to make this clearer.</p><p>“In contrast, a causal relation between the vmPFC and a positive distractor effect has been observed in both humans and monkeys <sup>28,29</sup>. In both species, individuals with vmPFC lesions, unlike control or pre-operative individuals, were less accurate in their decisions when high-value distractors were presented. In vmPFC lesion individuals, the manifestation of a negative distractor effect is possibly due to the reduction of the opposing positive distractor effect (Figure 6c). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that positive and negative distractor effects are causally related to the neural processes in vmPFC and parietal cortex respectively.”</p><p>Second, in the Discussion section, we predict the behavioural effect of vmPFC-TMS based on the lesion studies by Noonan and colleagues, although it is technically difficult to apply TMS to the vmPFC because of its distance from the scalp. Often, TMS is considered as a virtual lesion as it disrupts brain activity. Hence, we expect that vmPFC-TMS will result in behavioural effects that are similar to those observed in vmPFC lesion patients. We do not expect that vmPFC-TMS would cause any changes in the negative distractor effect nor to any changes in the parietal cortex, but because the counteracting positive distractor effect is disrupted, then the overall behavioural impact should be that the distractor effect should become more negative (i.e. less positive). Nevertheless, it is possible that this argument was not explained clearly in the first draft of our manuscript. We have now revised Lines 529-542:</p><p>“There are two limitations in the current study. First, we did not directly test whether the positive distractor effect is generated in the vmPFC. Second, an alternative explanation for the presence of a positive distractor effect after MIP-TMS is that it is due to a direct change in the divisive normalisation computation in the MIP itself. We argue, however, that another interpretation is that by perturbing the MIP and reducing its associated negative distractor effect then this allows for stronger expression of the positive distractor effect associated with the vmPFC. This link is based on findings of previous studies that suggest a relationship between the positive distractor effect and vmPFC <sup>6</sup> and the greater prominence of negative distractor effects after vmPFC is damaged <sup>28,29</sup>. A future study which includes stimulation of the vmPFC could examine this interpretation further. Note however, that TMS over frontal regions can cause discomfort in participants and would require an adjustment of the stimulation protocol. Perhaps most critically, it may not even be possible for TMS effects to be induced at the depth below the scalp at which vmPFC lies.”</p><p>Third, the reviewer questioned whether the negative distractor effect observed in individuals with vmPFC lesions could be explained simply by a greater noise level. To the best of our knowledge, it is not possible to explain the findings reported by Noonan and colleagues just by a noise model without considering additional mechanisms such as mutual inhibition. In a noise model (Gaussian or Gumbel), as the reviewer pointed out in Comment 1, the distractor “steals” density from the second best option and produces a “positive distractor effect”. If it is assumed that vmPFC lesion simply amplifies the noise, then potentially an even greater positive distractor effect (and smaller negative distractor effect) might be expected in the choices of humans or monkeys with vmPFC lesions. However, the empirical findings reported by Noonan and colleagues are the other way round; after vmPFC lesions, negative distractor effects are especially prominent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a limitation when using choice data alone to argue that TMS reduces normalization at the expense of some other process which has a positive distractor effect. Perhaps TMS alters the DN computation (i.e. its weights) in a way that induces a positive effect?</p><p>More broadly, the paper is not clear on how the dual-route theory operates. Is it an either/or process, so that when intra-parietal regions are TMS’d they are essentially “deactivated” and the decision is guided solely by vmPFC? If so, what process determines which “route” yields the decision in the control conditions? It would seem strange for this switching process to use value (i.e. difficulty) as the switching condition given that value is seemingly what is being constructed/determined. Or is the value process sequential, so that output from vmPFC feeds into parietal regions? If so, wouldn’t the TMS just be adding noise to the valuation process, reducing accuracy?</p></disp-quote><p>The current manuscript argues parietal cortex generates the negative distractor effect. To identify the effect clearly, however, it is essential to notice that both positive and negative distractor effects co-exist, for example, as in the form suggested by the dual-route model. Both effects potentially counteract each other so that additional care is required to isolate the negative distractor effect and then to test its link with the parietal cortex. We are reluctant to claim that, after parietal TMS, a decision is guided only by the vmPFC. However, at least the empirical findings are consistent with the idea that two distractor effects are present in decision making and applying TMS to the parietal cortex disrupts one effect and spares the other.</p><p>More generally, we note that the reviewer’s point about how the brain “manages” the presence of multiple selection processes in multiple brain regions is an important one, but it is an important problem for the whole field in which it is clear that there are multiple selection processes spanning parietal, premotor, cingulate, and ventromedial prefrontal cortical areas, as well as subcortical areas. Although it is a question that goes beyond what can be addressed with the current data set, we are generally attracted by the idea that multiple selection processes co-occur at the same time in the absence of an overall top-down controller. Instead, we imagine that what determines the likelihood that a particular selection mechanism will guide a given choice is the speed with which it operates in a given situation (Chau et al., 2014) and the certainty of the evaluations that it makes (Lines 434-443).</p><p>“These variations in the distractor effect are captured by a dual-route model that incorporates both a divisive normalisation mechanism and a mutual inhibition mechanism in separate decision routes that compete in a parallel race<sup>22</sup>. It is clear that multiple brain mechanisms are concerned with choice selection and that these span not just parietal cortex and vmPFC but also include orbitofrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and cingulate cortex as well as subcortical regions<sup>28–31</sup>. What determines which mechanism predominates in a given setting is likely to be related to the speed with which it operates in a given situation and with a given input<sup>6</sup> and the certainty of the evaluations that it makes. The current results again suggest an association between these different routes and different brain regions.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Please address the outstanding concerns of Reviewer 2 (see below).</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall the authors have responded sufficiently to previous comments, however, there is one issue that remains. I am not convinced by the new mixed-effects analysis in Figure 3-supplemental 1 that is intended to bolster the original ANOVA analysis of the TMS results because it is impossible to assess the new results.</p><p>The authors don't report the estimated coefficients in a table (only the coefficients and p-values for the variables of interest in Figure 3) and allude to a better fitting model when they include specific (un-reported) co-variates but don't appear to report this metric. This is non-standard when reporting structural model fits of choice behaviour and problematic because including RT in this regression where choice is the outcome variable is subject to a (likely high) endogeneity problem (it is correlated with the error term in the regression) therefore the other coefficients are likely biased (see discussion in Webb (2019) and Chiong et al., (forthcoming)). Without seeing the model results that don't include RT, it is impossible to assess which direction the bias goes. Please report all coefficients in these regressions, as well as the results for the model without RT as a regressor. If the authors want to include RT in the empirical analysis, they need to address the endogeneity problem by either estimating a dynamic model (like they propose with their race model, or finding a valid instrument using a control function approach).</p><p>Webb, R.

We agree that for transparent reporting, we should have shown all coefficients of the model. Those coefficients that were previously not shown were related to the HV-LV and HV+LV of all the 31 participants. We realize that it would be a very long list of coefficients if they are tabulated and therefore, we think that it would be more intuitive to show them in a figure (now shown in panel b). In addition, we also agree including an RT term in the model could be controversial. Perhaps the most straightforward approach is to include both versions of the mixed-effects model – both with and without the RT term. Now we show the results of the model without the RT term, as suggested by the reviewer, in Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b. We show those of the model with the RT term in Figure 3—figure supplement 1c and d. Critically, the results of both models were similar – showing that the TMS effect was robust when the distractor was located on the contralateral side of space to the MIP stimulation.</p><p>Once again, we would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
