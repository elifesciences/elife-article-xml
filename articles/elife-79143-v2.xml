Obesity exacerbates tumor growth, while diet-induced weight loss impairs progression. It remains unknown how bariatric surgery-induced weight loss impacts cancer progression or alters response to therapy. Using a pre-clinical model of obesity followed by VSG or diet-induced weight loss, breast cancer progression and immune checkpoint blockade therapy were investigated. Weight loss by VSG or weight-matched dietary intervention before tumor engraftment protected against obesity-exacerbated tumor progression. However, VSG was not as effective as diet in reducing tumor burden despite achieving similar weight and adiposity loss. Leptin did not associate with changes in tumor burden; however, circulating IL-6 was elevated in VSG mice. Uniquely, VSG tumors displayed elevated inflammation and immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1+ myeloid and non-immune cells. VSG tumors also had reduced T lymphocytes and markers of cytolysis, suggesting an ineffective anti-tumor microenvironment which prompted investigation of immune checkpoint blockade. While obese mice were resistant to immune checkpoint blockade, anti-PD-L1 potently impaired tumor progression after VSG through improved anti-tumor immunity. Thus, in formerly obese mice, surgical weight loss followed by immunotherapy reduced breast cancer burden. Finally, we compared transcriptomic changes in adipose tissue after bariatric surgery from patients and mouse models. A conserved <italic>b</italic>ariatric <italic>s</italic>urgery-<italic>a</italic>ssociated weight loss <italic>s</italic>ignature (BSAS) was identified which significantly associated with decreased tumor volume. Findings demonstrate conserved impacts of obesity and bariatric surgery-induced weight loss pathways associated with breast cancer progression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As the number of people classified as obese rises globally, so do obesity-related health risks. Studies show that people diagnosed with obesity have inflammation that contributes to tumor growth and their immune system is worse at detecting cancer cells. But weight loss is not currently used as a strategy for preventing or treating cancer.</p><p>Surgical procedures for weight loss, also known as ‘bariatric surgeries’, are becoming increasingly popular. Recent studies have shown that individuals who lose weight after these treatments have a reduced risk of developing tumors. But how bariatric surgery directly impacts cancer progression has not been well studied: does it slow tumor growth or boost the anti-tumor immune response?</p><p>To answer these questions, Sipe et al. compared breast tumor growth in groups of laboratory mice that were obese due to being fed a high fat diet. The first group of mice lost weight after undergoing a bariatric surgery in which part of their stomach was removed. The second lost the same amount of weight but after receiving a restricted diet, and the third underwent a fake surgery and did not lose any weight. The experiments found that surgical weight loss cuts breast cancer tumor growth in half compared with obese mice. But mice who lost the same amount of weight through dietary restrictions had even less tumor growth than surgically treated mice.</p><p>The surgically treated mice who lost weight had more inflammation than mice in the two other groups, and had increased amounts of proteins and cells that block the immune response to tumors. Giving the surgically treated mice a drug that enhances the immune system’s ability to detect and destroy cancer cells reduced inflammation and helped shrink the mice’s tumors. Finally, Sipe et al. identified 54 genes which were turned on or off after bariatric surgery in both mice and humans, 11 of which were linked with tumor size.</p><p>These findings provide crucial new information about how bariatric surgery can impact cancer progression. Future studies could potentially use the conserved genes identified by Sipe et al. to develop new ways to stimulate the anti-cancer benefits of weight loss without surgery.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Thus, intentional weight loss prior to tumor onset is a potential intervention to reduce negative cancer outcomes.</p><p>Bariatric surgery, also known as metabolic surgery, is an effective intervention for obese patients that leads to stable and sustained weight loss. Bariatric surgery primarily encompasses gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohm et al., 2022</xref>). VSG is currently the least invasive and most common bariatric procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alalwan et al., 2021</xref>). Patients who receive a VSG have a reduction of 57% excess weight after 2 years, which remains relatively stable out to 10 years post-surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Brien et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, patients who undergo surgically induced weight loss have a reduction in all-cause mortality up to 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Syn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doumouras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aminian et al., 2022</xref>). Despite promising benefits of weight loss, weight loss regimens are not yet widely adopted in cancer prevention, survivorship, or therapy. Our <italic>premise</italic> is that obese subjects are exposed to chronic inflammation that leads to increased risk of cancer yet induces compensatory immunosuppressive mechanisms or does not achieve a sufficient inflammatory threshold to protect from cancer initiation in a failure of protective immunity. Importantly, bariatric surgery is protective against subsequent risk of developing any cancer by 10–33% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aminian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feigelson et al., 2020</xref> described the greatest benefit in pre-menopausal estrogen receptor negative cancer in patients after bariatric surgery. A meta-analysis of 11 studies with over 1 million bariatric surgery patients demonstrated a significant 54% reduction in breast cancer incidence compared to BMI-matched controls, regardless of patient age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruno and Berger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lovrics et al., 2021</xref>). While there are no specific recommendations for weight loss nor bariatric surgery in patients as a routine cancer prevention approach, the reduction in breast cancer risk associated with weight loss should be further examined using a controlled model system to better understand mechanisms impacting cancer progression and therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>Here, to investigate the impacts of obesity and bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on breast cancer progression and response to therapy, we utilized female C57BL/6J mice, which are obesogenic and immune competent. Once obese, mice were subjected to weight loss interventions including bariatric surgery by VSG or dietary intervention as a weight-matched control. Mice not subjected to VSG received a control sham surgery. Mice remaining obese or formerly obese mice that lost weight by surgery or diet were subsequently implanted orthotopically with syngeneic breast cancer cells to determine impacts on tumor progression, burden, and anti-tumor immunity. We found that mice that received the VSG displayed reduced obesity-accelerated breast cancer compared to obese sham-treated controls. However, the most effective blunting of tumor progression was detected in weight-matched sham (WM-Sham) controls. Thus, bariatric surgery was effective at reducing tumor burden but not to the same extent as weight-matched controls despite similar weight and adiposity loss between the two groups. A potential mediator limiting the impacts of weight loss on tumor progression after VSG was elevated IL-6, which upregulates the checkpoint ligand, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on myeloid and non-immune cells, and reduced CD8+T cell content in tumors uniquely in VSG-treated mice. Thus, we next determined if immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) after VSG could improve tumor outcomes. We report that in mice after VSG, anti-PD-L1 was efficacious to reduce breast cancer progression comparable to burdens detected in lean controls, while obese mice were resistant to anti-PD-L1. Finally, using transcriptomic analysis of adipose tissue after bariatric surgery from both patients and mouse models, we identified a conserved <italic>b</italic>ariatric <italic>s</italic>urgery-<italic>a</italic>ssociated weight loss <italic>s</italic>ignature (BSAS) that significantly associated with decreased tumor volume. In sum, our study contributes critical observations regarding the impacts of obesity and bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on breast cancer progression and response to immunotherapy that are relevant to this rapidly emerging area of research and medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Surgical and dietary weight loss interventions reduced weight to the same extent</title><p>To quantify impacts of bariatric surgery on cancer progression, weight loss was induced prior to tumor implantation (study design, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Female C57BL/6J mice were weaned onto low fat diet (LFD) to remain lean or onto high fat diet (HFD) to become obese. After 16 weeks on diet, HFD-fed mice displayed marked diet-induced obesity (DIO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A subset of DIO mice then underwent surgical or dietary weight loss interventions. Surgically treated DIO mice received the VSG bariatric procedure, wherein the lateral 80% of the stomach was removed, and the remaining stomach was sutured creating a tubular gastric sleeve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). VSG induced a significant and sustained weight loss of 20% of the starting body weight, despite being continuously maintained on HFD (HFD-VSG, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, detailed statistical comparisons within <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). HFD-VSG mice lost weight to within a few grams of lean LFD-sham treated control mice. Importantly, mice did not regain weight after the VSG.

To control for the effects of surgery, all other groups that did not undergo a VSG received a sham surgery including perioperative procedures, abdominal laparotomy, anesthesia, and analgesics with minimal impacts on weight maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). To compare the impact of VSG on breast cancer outcomes to weight loss <italic>per se</italic>, we employed a dietary weight loss intervention initiated after sham surgery wherein mice were fed calorically restricted amounts of HFD to match the weight loss and diet exposure of HFD-VSG treated mice, termed WM-Sham. As designed, WM-Sham body weight loss was not significantly different from HFD-VSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

In mice that had lost weight, reduced tumor progression was observed compared to HFD-Sham from 1.5 weeks after implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

HFD-VSG tumors were significantly smaller than HFD-Sham by volume and weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). However, tumors in the WM-Sham group were significantly smaller than HFD-VSG, despite identical body weights between the two weight loss approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>).

Thus, dietary intervention in formerly obese mice was most impactful to restore a lean-like tumor phenotype with minimal tumor progression evident and the smallest tumor burden, while weight loss by VSG proved to be less impactful to blunt tumor progression compared to weight-matched controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adiposity and leptin were reduced in formerly obese mice</title><p>Increased adiposity is associated with obesity-worsened breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Houghton et al., 2021</xref>).

Breast cancer cell implantation and progression from weeks 2 to 5 did not impact adiposity in any group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

HFD-VSG and WM-Sham groups lost significant adipose mass compared to HFD-Sham obese controls but not to the extent quantified in lean LFD-Sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Enlarged adipocyte size in the mammary fat pad is a mediator of obesity-associated inflammation and impacts breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laforest et al., 2021</xref>).

Thus, we investigated if inflammatory changes in the mammary fat pad reflect pathways that could impact tumor burden using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, database for annotation, visualization, and integrated discovery (DAVID) pathway analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Compared to WM-Sham controls, HFD-VSG mammary fat pads reflected 5–10-fold elevation of immune pathways, such as leukocyte migration, chemotaxis, and inflammatory response, among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Examining key genes common to the inflammatory response pathways, compared to LFD-Sham lean controls, HFD-Sham obese mice displayed elevated expression of many inflammatory genes such as chemokine receptor <italic>Ccr2</italic> and growth factor receptor <italic>Csf1</italic>r, among others, as expected with DIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Despite significant reductions in adiposity and adipocyte size after VSG, mammary fat pads from HFD-VSG mice displayed evidence of persistent or exacerbated inflammation compared to all groups including HFD-Sham obese controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Therefore, we next queried immune checkpoint expression in the tumor microenvironment to determine if elevated pathways and genes in the VSG-treated group could lead to increased immune checkpoint ligand expression. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis revealed that the frequency of PD-L1+ cells was significantly and uniquely elevated in tumors after VSG intervention compared to all other groups in the CD45− fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The CD45− fraction contains tumor cells as well as other stromal cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, adipose stromal cells, etc. Furthermore, expression of PD-L1 quantified by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was also significantly elevated in the CD45− fraction from HFD-VSG tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, WM-Sham intervention significantly reduced frequency of PD-L1+ non-immune cells and PD-L1 MFI relative to tumors from HFD-VSG treated mice by 60 and 30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with elevated PD-L1 through increased protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lim et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we examined circulating IL-6 using Luminex. Compared to HFD-Sham, circulating IL-6 was significantly elevated in HFD-VSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In contrast, WM-Sham mice displayed a 3.3-fold significantly reduced concentration of IL-6 compared to mice in the HFD-VSG group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In E0771 breast cancer cells, treatment with IL-6 increased PD-L1 MFI as quantified by flow cytometry.

Obesity negatively impacts many cancer outcomes and is thus a potential modifiable factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohm et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhardwaj and Brown, 2021</xref>). Murine models examining weight loss through diet switch, caloric restriction, or time-restricted feeding (fasting) support that weight loss impairs tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Das et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lv et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hursting et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). However, dietary weight loss alone is minimally effective for patients and difficult to maintain. The use of bariatric surgical approaches to induce durable weight loss is increasing in prevalence. In this study, to investigate the impacts of weight loss by bariatric surgery on subsequent tumor burden, we first established a murine model wherein once weight loss is stabilized, cancer cells were orthotopically implanted to examine progression and burden. We show that tumor growth in formerly obese mice that lost weight through either bariatric surgical intervention with VSG or weight-matched controls were effective at blunting breast cancer progression and reducing tumor burden. Thus, in mice from the VSG group and weight-matched control groups, results suggest that tumor responses aligned with adiposity not diet exposure. Both groups were fed the same HFD as obese mice which presented with the greatest adiposity and largest tumors, suggesting that diet <italic>per se</italic> is not as important as adiposity in driving tumor progression. However, bariatric surgery only partially reduced obesity accelerated breast cancer progression while weight-matched controls effectively blunted growth to a lean-like phenotype.</p><p>Some mechanisms linking obesity-driven breast cancer include elevated adipokines, chronic inflammation, and dampened anti-tumor immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lengyel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Naik et al., 2019</xref>). We examined multiple factors associated with obesity and metabolic dysfunction, including extent of weight loss, adiposity, mammary fat pad adipocyte size, and local or circulating leptin levels; none were associated with changes in tumor burden in formerly obese mice. However, RNA-seq analysis of the tumor and mammary fat pad demonstrated critical inflammatory pathways regulated by obesity and weight loss. Despite a significant reduction in tumor burden compared to obese HFD-Sham mice, VSG-treated mice demonstrated upregulated mammary fat pad inflammation to levels greater than those of obese mice. Our finding of elevated inflammation in the mammary fat pad after VSG is consistent with several studies reporting inflammation in adipose depots following bariatric surgery in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frikke-Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poitou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris et al., 2020</xref>). The persistent inflammation identified after bariatric surgery in adipose tissue could be due to adipose remodeling following rapid weight loss or wound repair signaling from the surgical injury itself. However, these inflammatory changes to the mammary fat pad were uniquely induced by the VSG bariatric surgery, not likely due to surgery itself, since all other groups received a sham surgery as controls. In addition to the mammary fat pad, we report activation of inflammatory and hypoxic pathways in the tumors of mice after VSG but not in other interventions. Therefore, future studies to determine the extent and timing of bariatric surgery associated remodeling in both murine models and humans are warranted. While the murine model presented herein demonstrated successfully stabilized weight loss, most other reports demonstrate weight rebound within a few weeks post-surgery, which should be optimized in future cancer studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arble et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We posited that inflammation, including circulating and the surrounding adipose and tumor, led to dramatic elevations in PD-L1 expression on non-immune and myeloid cells detected uniquely after VSG. The CD45− fraction contains tumor cells as well as other stromal cells such as adipocytes, adipose stromal cells, mesenchymal stem cells, mast cells, etc. which have been reported to express PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirano et al., 2021</xref>). It is likely that several cell types display elevated PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment. PD-L1 is stabilized by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chan et al., 2019</xref>). Depressed CD3+ and CD8+ T cell content and dampened expression of T cell cytolytic markers detected in tumors after VSG intervention could have hindered effective anti-tumor immunity after bariatric surgery-associated weight loss. These changes in PD-L1 on non-immune and myeloid cells, and T cell content and signaling, or cytolytic pathway were not present in the weight-matched controls despite this group losing the same amount of weight as VSG intervention. In fact, weight-matched controls had significantly elevated cytotoxic T cell tumor content and evidence of cytolytic function and reduced PD-L1+ immunosuppressive M-MDSCs and macrophages which associate with reduced tumor burden. Taken together, it is likely that the elevated PD-L1+ CD45− cells after VSG, as well as PD-L1+ macrophages and M-MDSCs led to reduced T cell signaling and activation, which would reduce CD3+ and CD8+ T cell content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crespo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Tumor inflammation and hypoxia increase expression of PD-L1 within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yi et al., 2021</xref>).

Here, we report for the first time that anti-PD-L1 was most effective in reducing tumor burden in the mice that received VSG to induce weight loss, with restored expression of cytolytic genes. Taken together, we have identified unique anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 in mice after VSG.</p><p>Finally, we determined genes associated with weight loss after bariatric surgery conserved across species. We took advantage of published transcriptomes of subcutaneous adipose tissue from female patients before and after bariatric surgery in comparison with mammary fat pad expression from obese and formerly obese mice after VSG bariatric surgery. We identified a novel weight loss signature specific to bariatric surgery conserved between mice and humans, termed BSAS. Pathways associated with metabolism, remodeling, and immune cells were identified from conserved genes. Because our study consisted of surgical versus dietary interventions and cancer progression, we are in the unique position to compare BSAS transcriptomic changes to tumor outcomes, which we termed T-BSAS. We demonstrate that a subset of 11 key genes in the T-BSAS signature was associated with tumor outcomes in our mouse models. For example, <italic>Ido1</italic>, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase, is part of the rate limiting enzyme that metabolizes L-tryptophan to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-formylkynurenine">N-formylkynurenine</ext-link>. The conserved BSAS gene list demonstrated that compared to obese state, <italic>Ido1</italic> was increased by bariatric surgery in both mouse and human. Of note, <italic>Ido1</italic> was not elevated by WM-induced weight loss in our study (data not shown), which suggests that changes in <italic>Ido1</italic> expression could be a specific response to surgically induced weight loss. Over-expression of IDO depletes tryptophan, leading to accumulation of tryptophan metabolites which can induce immunosuppression. Thus, IDO plays a central role in immune escape through reduced CD8+ T cell activation and increased T cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhai et al., 2020</xref>) with multiple IDO inhibitors under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). We previously reported that <italic>Ido1</italic> expression in the tumor adjacent mammary fat pad was decreased after anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pingili et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the aberrant upregulation of IDO after bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is one potential mechanism limiting anti-tumor immunity in our VSG model that remains under investigation. One limitation of our study is that this study examines just a single syngeneic orthotopically transplanted model wherein we have examined impact of obesity and weight loss on tumor progression and response to immunotherapy. Future work will investigate other cancer models; however, few models exist to study both highly obesogenic strains and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohm et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, variables such as duration of obesity, extent of surgery, and time post-recovery will likely impact immune parameters and should be investigated in pre-clinical and patient settings. It is also possible that different dosing or timing of ICB or combination therapy would demonstrate a greater inhibition of tumor progression.</p><p>In patients, weight loss has been shown to improve prognosis after breast cancer has already been diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Seiler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chlebowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Patterson et al., 2018</xref>). In practice, preventing obesity or promoting weight loss has been a difficult and complex public health challenge. Important retrospective work has shown that patients who underwent bariatric surgery had reduced risk of both pre-menopausal and post-menopausal breast cancer with a 64% reduced risk in pre-menopausal ER-tumors, typically the most aggressive tumors with the worst outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feigelson et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, reduced recurrence and mortality from cancer have been observed in bariatric surgery patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aminian et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruno and Berger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>) although underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A major question remains regarding whether reductions in cancer risk and outcomes are associated with weight loss <italic>per se</italic> or are due to bariatric surgery-specific benefits, which are inherently challenging to delineate in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, additional prospective studies are necessary to determine if intentional weight loss through surgery offers significant promise as an approach that could be highly impactful for reducing cancer burden and potentially improving therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Courcoulas, 2022</xref>).</p><p>In sum, despite successful and sustained weight loss, tumors in formerly obese mice that received VSG bariatric surgery failed to display sufficiently improved anti-tumor immunity like controls that lost similar amounts of weight. Elevated inflammation in the mammary fat pad and tumor reduced cytotoxic T cells suggested an ineffective anti-tumor milieu after VSG. Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy was able to improve tumor outcomes in surgical weight loss mice. Ultimately bariatric surgery is the most effective long-term weight loss solution and could be considered in cancer prevention for high-risk obese patients to reduce cancer risk or recurrence. Clinical trials are underway in some severely obese patients with studies examining changes in breast density and breast cancer risk after bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">ClinicalTrials, 2021</xref>), reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohm et al., 2022</xref>. Understanding how obesity impacts breast cancer anti-tumor immunity and determining effective weight loss strategies to maximize response to therapies will be valuable. In this study, we queried response to ICB in obese and weight loss models, but response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy and combined therapies are also important areas of investigation to advance the field. Because one-third of Americans are considered obese and 9.2% currently severely obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hales, 2020</xref>), this study is an important first step in understanding bariatric surgery impacts on cancer progression and immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The protocol was approved under the protocol identifier 21.0224. All animals were housed in a temperature-controlled facility with a 12 hr light/dark cycle and ad libitium access to food and water, except where indicated. Three-week-old female C57BL/6J (Jackson stock number: 000664) mice were shipped to UTHSC and acclimated 1 week. Four-week-old mice were randomized to either obesogenic HFD (D12492i – 60% kcal derived from fat) or LFD (D12450Ji- 10% kcal derived from fat) from Research Diets Inc (New Brunswick, NJ) for 16 weeks (age 4 weeks to 20 weeks old, study design <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mice resistant to DIO, as defined by less than 28 g after 16 weeks of HFD, were excluded from the study. DIO mice received either a bariatric surgery or sham control surgery and dietary intervention as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Body weight and composition</title><p>Body weight was measured 2×/week. Body composition including lean mass, fat mass, free water content, and total water content of non-anesthetized mice was measured weekly using EchoMRI-100 quantitative magnetic resonance whole body composition analyzer (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy</title><p>To reduce bariatric surgery-associated weight loss, perioperative measures included providing liquid diet (Ensure Original Milk Chocolate Nutrition Shake, Abbott, Chicago, IL) and DietGel recovery (Clear H<sub>2</sub>O, Portland, ME, ID# 72-06-5022) 1 day before surgery to all mice. At 4 hr before surgery, solid food was removed to reduce stomach contents. For 4 hr pre-surgery, mice were maintained half on half off a heat pad in clean new cages. Surgery was performed under isoflurane anesthesia. VSG was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yin et al., 2012</xref>) with additional control dietary intervention for comparison of weight loss approaches. The stomach was clamped, and the lateral 80% of the stomach was removed with scissors. The remaining stomach was sutured with 8–0 to create a tubular gastric sleeve. All treatment groups not receiving VSG had a sham surgery performed. For sham, an abdominal laparotomy was performed with exteriorization of the stomach. Light pressure with forceps was applied to the exteriorized stomach. For both VSG and sham surgeries, the abdominal wall was closed with 6–0 sutures and skin closed with staples. Mice received carprofen (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous, once daily) as an analgesic immediately prior to and once daily for 3 days following surgery. Mice were given 1 mL saline at time of surgery. Perioperative procedures were performed in accordance with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doerning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stevenson et al., 2019</xref>).

Mice were provided Ensure liquid diet (as above), DietGel recovery, and solid food pellets ad libitium for 48 hr post-surgery. HFD-fed DIO mice receiving VSG (‘HFD-VSG’) were maintained on the same HFD for 5 weeks following surgery until euthanasia at study endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Control groups that were lean (‘LFD-Sham’) or DIO (‘HFD-Sham’) were maintained on respective LFD or HFD diets following sham surgery. For dietary intervention weight loss, DIO mice received sham surgery and were subjected to weight loss intervention following sham surgery for 5 weeks until endpoint. ‘Weight-matched’ (WM) mice were controls to the HFD-VSG mice by weight matching through restricting intake of HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sipe et al., 2017</xref>). On average, mice consumed 1.7 g (ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 g or 8.84 kcal [5.2–13.0 kcal]) per day of HFD.

Briefly, cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a humidified chamber at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. E0771 cells were injected in the left fourth mammary fat pad of 22-week-old C57BL/6J females at 250,000 cells in 100 μL of 75% RPMI/25% Matrigel. When tumors became palpable (typically 1 week after implantation), tumor growth was monitored 2×/week by measuring the length and width of the tumor using digital calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: volume = (width)<sup>2</sup> × (length)/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pingili et al., 2021</xref>). No tumors failed to take, and tumor regression was not detected.

In brief, excised tumors (200 mg) were dissociated in RPMI media containing enzyme cocktail mix from the mouse tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and placed into gentleMACS dissociators per manufacturer’s instructions. Spleen single cell suspensions were obtained by grinding spleens against 70 μm filter using a syringe plunger. Following red blood cell lysis (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO), viability was determined by staining with Ghost dye (Tonbo Biosciences Inc) followed by FcR-blocking (Tonbo). Antibodies were titrated, and separation index was calculated using FlowJo v. 10 software. Cells were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies and fixed in Perm/fix buffer (Tonbo). Stained cells were analyzed using Bio-Rad ZE5 flow cytometer. Fluorescence minus one (FMO) stained cells and single color Ultracomp Beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Data was analyzed using FlowJo v. 10 software (Treestar, Woodburn, OR). Total immune cells from tumor and tumor adjacent mammary fat pad (including TdLN) were gated by plotting forward scatter area versus side scatter area, single cells by plotting side scatter height versus side scatter area, live cells by plotting side scatter area versus Ghost viability dye, and immune cells by plotting CD45 versus Ghost viability dye. T cells were gated as follows in tumor CD3+ T cells (CD3+) and CD8+ T cells (CD3+ and CD8+). Macrophages are gated as CD11b+ and F480+. M-MDSC are gated as CD11b+ Ly6C<sup>high</sup>, Ly6G−. Non-immune cells were gated as CD45− and MFI for PD-L1. Gates were defined by FMO stained controls and verified by back-gating of cell populations.

RNA-seq statistical differences between experimental groups were determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pingili et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to control false discovery rate (FDR) for adjusted p value . RNA-seq data has been uploaded as GEO GSE174760, GSE174761, and GSE174762. Transcript-level abundance was imported into gene-level abundance with the R package tximport. Genes with low expression were identified and filtered out from further analysis using filterByExpr function of the edgeR package in R software. Voom transformation function was applied to normalize log2-cpm values using mean-variance trend in the limma software package.

This needs to be emphasized in Discussion and Abstract.</p><p>Examining the potentiation of ICB by weight loss through diet caloric restriction (WM-Sham group) is an important final piece of data making the story complete. Could it be speculated why HFD-VSG tumors upon ICB still grew as large as in untreated LFD-sham and WM-sham groups in Fig 5?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The lack of use of a spontaneous model of breast cancer for these studies, such as the widely used MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen) is a major concern. These mice develop spontaneous mammary tumors that closely resemble the different stages of tumor progression of human breast cancers.</p><p>2. The authors should investigate and discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the increased expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells post-VSG.</p><p>3. For the proof of concept, the authors should use a PD-L1 knockout E0771 cell line for these studies.</p><p>4. To specifically distinguish the source of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment, the authors should have used the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, CD326), which is expressed by the cancer cells.</p><p>5. Did the authors analyze the expression of PD-L1 on other immune cells especially macrophages as increased PD-L1 in macrophages has been shown to correlate with high levels of PD-L1 in tumors (PMID: 31615933).</p><p>6. Did the authors analyze the influence of bariatric surgery on distant metastasis? Why T cell infiltration is low in tumors post-VSG.</p><p>7. The experiments are very briefly described in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79143.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are a few essential experiments that need to be performed as described below.</p><p>1) This study needs to use more than one syngeneic model to solidify the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this below in response to reviewer 3 question 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The detailed molecular mechanism of T cell signaling or Cytolysis in HFS VSG mice vs WM sham mice needs to be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this below in response to reviewer 1 question 2 and reviewer 3 question 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This study needs detailed characterization of which inflammatory response factors may mediate the phenotype of HFS VSG mice when compared to WM Sham mice.

We did not examine the CD45- fraction in further detail but intend to do so in the future, which is beyond the scope of this study. However, we have added additional supportive flow cytometric analysis in response to reviewer 1 demonstrating that in addition to the CD45- fraction demonstrating elevated PD-L1 in the HFD-VSG tumors, PD-L1 was also elevated on tumor associated macrophages as well as PD-L1 M-MDSCs in tumors which are now included as a new figures 4G-H. We have included details in the methods, results, and added citations and discussion about PD-L1 positivity on M-MDSCs and macrophages in the discussion which we believe strengthens the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors attempted to investigate if it is the diet or the amount of adipose tissue that matters by comparing LFD-sham and WM-sham groups.

This needs to be emphasized in Discussion and Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have addressed this in our edits by adding to the discussion that “Thus, in mice from the VSG group and WM control groups, results suggest that tumor responses aligned with adiposity not diet exposure. Both groups were fed the same high fat diet as obese mice which presented with the greatest adiposity and largest tumors suggesting that diet per se is not as important as adiposity.”</p><p>However, the answer to this question is not so clear cut for the response between the VSG and the weight matched sham control. The gonadal and tumor adjacent adipose fat pad weights were the same in both the primary and the ICB study. Adiposity typically associates with adipose size and circulating leptin, but we reported in Fig 2D-F that these factors were different between HFD-VSG and WM-sham.</p><p>Furthermore, the ICB study shows greater efficacy after VSG while the mice in the WM Sham group showed moderate and not significantly improved efficacy (perhaps because as noted tumors were already small). Both groups had similar adiposity, and both were on high fat diet. Thus, we believe that underlying immune related responses such as those presented herein (new findings on IL-6 and PD-L1 after VSG) or those to be discovered contribute to response to ICB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Examining the potentiation of ICB by weight loss through diet caloric restriction (WM-Sham group) is an important final piece of data making the story complete. Could it be speculated why HFD-VSG tumors upon ICB still grew as large as in untreated LFD-sham and WM-sham groups in Fig 5?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Tumors in the VSG- treated group developed tumors that matched lean IgG-treated controls as reviewer 2 points out. The failure of anti-PD-L1 ICB after HFD-VSG to reduce progression even further compared to lean controls might be due to perhaps dosing or timing of experimental intervention. In addition, it is possible that a combination of a chemotherapy + ICB could entirely blunt tumor progression. We have added these comments to our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The lack of use of a spontaneous model of breast cancer for these studies, such as the widely used MMTV-PyMT (mouse mammary tumor virus-polyoma middle tumor-antigen) is a major concern. These mice develop spontaneous mammary tumors that closely resemble the different stages of tumor progression of human breast cancers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. Your question is important and throughout our studies, we have thought about how to address this concern using a complementary female model for breast cancer. There are many limitations and hurdles to examine obesity, breast cancer, and weight loss in female mice which makes the model and our results presented herein important.</p><p>First, the cancer model MMTV-PyMT suggested by reviewer 3 is unfortunately not likely to yield interpretable results. In the C57Bl/6J E0771 model we used, female mice were on a high fat diet for 16 weeks in order to generate diet induced obesity. In the BL6 background, the MMTV-PyMT latency is 12 weeks of age. This time course is too short to have HFD-induced obesity and subsequent surgically-induced weight loss before tumor growth.</p><p>Second, commonly used models for breast cancer such as 4T1 or EMT6 are derived from BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity, hence cannot be used for studies on obesity and weight loss.</p><p>Third, is a consideration on the extensive burden and cost to repeat such a study. We chose the C57Bl/6J model to study obesity and bariatric surgery in breast cancer because this strain is the most obesogenic and is widely accepted in the obesity field. To study obesity in females, it takes 4 months of high fat diet exposure to generate mice considered obese. An approach to accelerate obesity in females is to conduct an ovariectomy, subjecting the mice to two separate surgeries (first ovariectomy then VSG), which was not feasible. Therefore, each study takes many months for female mice to develop diet induced obesity and then recover from bariatric surgery or sham surgical controls well before the tumor studies begin.</p><p>Last, these experiments take specialized training. Since our goal was to examine obesity, mice could not lose weight from the stress of surgery. Hence great care of each mouse must be maintained and was extensively optimized to have a highly successful surgery and survival. Because pre- and post-care as well as the surgeries are very labor intensive, cohorts are randomized and staggered, making these highly coordinated and laborious experiments for staff (including vets) and postdoctoral and student trainees.</p><p>In sum, to date, there are no publications on bariatric surgery and breast cancer nor on bariatric surgery and breast cancer with immunotherapy using pre-clinical models. To address your valid concern, we have noted in the discussion that few models exist to study both highly obesogenic strains and genetic or syngeneic breast cancer. Overall, we hope the reviewer will agree with the novelty of the observations and relevance to the field of breast cancer immunotherapy of this large effort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should investigate and discuss the potential mechanisms underlying the increased expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells post-VSG.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a new figure demonstrating elevated plasma IL-6 as a potential mechanism to impact PD-L1. IL-6 is established to increase PD-L1 stability and further show IL-6 increases extracellular PD-L1 levels new figures 3 E and F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. For the proof of concept, the authors should use a PD-L1 knockout E0771 cell line for these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question because PD-L1 is expressed on adipocytes, myeloid cells, and cancer cells, etc. We do not know if the elevated PD-L1 is on the cancer cells per se or other cells of the CD45- fraction. We have now clarified in our discussion that we do not posit that the increase in PD-L1 after VSG is specific to cancer cells, but instead on many cell types throughout the tumor microenvironment. In this manuscript, we opted to use anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy as a loss of function approach to block PD-L1 on as many cells as possible to best mimic clinical approaches. We have also provided new data in response to reviewer 1 question 2 and your question #5 below demonstrating elevated PD-L1 on M-MDSCs and macrophages in tumors from the HFD-VSG group as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To specifically distinguish the source of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment, the authors should have used the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, CD326), which is expressed by the cancer cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great idea and exploration of the cancer cells via EpCAM/CD236 was a missed opportunity in our flow panel. PD-L1 is expressed on many cells throughout the tumor environment including adipocytes, myeloid cells (see response to your question 5), and cancer cells, etc. We surmise that the increase in PD-L1 after VSG is detected on many cell types throughout the tumor microenvironment. We addressed your concern below by adding additional information after examining macrophages as noted in reviewer 1 question 1 response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Did the authors analyze the expression of PD-L1 on other immune cells especially macrophages as increased PD-L1 in macrophages has been shown to correlate with high levels of PD-L1 in tumors (PMID: 31615933).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we have now included as new figure in the manuscript (Figure 4G-H – see figures in response to reviewer 1 question 2 as well). Indeed, macrophages in tumors after VSG display a significantly greater frequency of PD-L1+ Macrophages in the HFD-VSG group. We also examined monocytic-MDSC (M-MDSC) PD-L1+ frequency and demonstrated significantly elevated PD-L1+ M-MDSCs in the HFD-VSG group compared to all other groups. These novel findings in addition to the CD45- PD-L1 positivity after VSG could account for greater efficacy with anti-PDL1 ICB. We have now included these new details in methods, results, and added citations and discussion about PD-L1 positivity on M-MDSCs and macrophages in the discussion. We also discussed and cited the manuscript that you mentioned [PMID: 31615933 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31615933/] which demonstrated that tumors with high PD-L1 is associated with longer overall survival in patients treated with ICB. Thank you for your suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Did the authors analyze the influence of bariatric surgery on distant metastasis? Why T cell infiltration is low in tumors post-VSG.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not measure metastasis in this model. To address your question about why T cell infiltration is low in tumors post-VSG, we considered published work that we had cited showing that obesity decreased CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic tumor infiltrating T cells (Wang, Aguilar et al., 2019, Pingili, Chaib et al., 2021) and wondered how bariatric surgery-induced weight loss would impact cytotoxic T cells. We regret that we were not clearer in our manuscript. In Figure 4 A-C we reported that T cell frequency in tumors was lowest after VSG compared to all other diet and surgery groups. In contrast, T cell content in tumor draining lymph node and tumor adjacent mammary fat pad CD3+ and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell content was not changed (supplemental figure 1 A-B). We showed that T cell signaling and activation was lower post-VSG compared to W-Sham (Figure 4 E-F). Therefore, to address your concern, we have added additional discussion stating that it is likely that the elevated PD-L1 after VSG (in the CD45- fraction, and newly reported findings in macrophages and M-MDSCs) led to reduced T cell signaling, activation, which would lead to reduced CD3+ and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell content.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
