innervating other organs and tissues. Whether cardiac-innervating stellate ganglionic neurons (SGNs) exhibit diversity and distinction from those innervating other tissues is not known. To identify and resolve the transcriptomic profiles of SGNs innervating the heart, we leveraged retrograde tracing techniques using adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing fluorescent proteins (GFP or Td-tomato) with single cell RNA sequencing. We investigated electrophysiologic, morphologic, and physiologic roles for subsets of cardiac-specific neurons and found that three of five adrenergic SGN subtypes innervate the heart. These three subtypes stratify into two subpopulations; high (NA1a) and low (NA1b and NA1c) neuropeptide-Y (NPY) -expressing cells, exhibit distinct morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiologic characteristics. In physiologic studies in transgenic mouse models modulating NPY signaling, we identified differential control of cardiac responses by these two subpopulations to high and low stress states. These findings provide novel insights into the unique properties of neurons responsible for cardiac sympathetic regulation, with implications for novel strategies to target specific neuronal subtypes for sympathetic blockade in cardiac disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>stellate ganglion</kwd><kwd>neuronal subtypes</kwd><kwd>scRNAseq</kwd><kwd>sympathetic neurons</kwd><kwd>neurocardiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2HL142045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajijola</surname><given-names>Olujimi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL162717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajijola</surname><given-names>Olujimi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ajijola</surname><given-names>Olujimi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cardiac-specific neurons residing in stellate ganglia comprised of three subsets of neurons based upon their transcriptomic and neurochemical properties and modulates cardiac sympathetic control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiac autonomic regulation is exerted by reflex loops consisting of afferent vagal and spinal afferent inputs to the nervous system, and descending control by efferent parasympathetic and sympathetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ardell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shivkumar et al., 2016</xref>). Postganglionic sympathetic neurons responsible for direct cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission are located within the cervico-thoracic sympathetic chain, particularly the stellate ganglia and middle cervical ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajendran et al., 2019</xref>). These stellate ganglion neurons (SGNs) release neurotransmitters that regulate all aspects of cardiac function including inotropy and chronotropy. However, following cardiac injury such as myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF), SGNs undergo profound structural, neurochemical, and electrophysiologic remodeling, contributing directly to progressive cardiac dysfunction and lethal ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajijola, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ajijola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alston et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, anti-adrenergic therapies such as beta-adrenergic receptor and neurohormonal blockers remain cornerstone treatments for MI and ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gardner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sana, 2018</xref>). Further, interventional and surgical therapies targeting the stellate ganglion (e.g. percutaneous anesthetic blockade and surgical sympathetic denervation, respectively) are increasingly applied clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajijola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite strong clinical data supporting therapies targeting SGNs to treat cardiac disease, the efficacy of available therapies remains limited, particularly by systemic side effects such as hypotension or renal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lisi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mets et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sica and Black, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tang and Maroo, 2007</xref>). Little is known about the subtypes and properties of neurons that innervate the heart, compared to neurons innervating other tissue beds, for example, skin and paw, that might facilitate the development of more specific targets for therapeutic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Dahlström, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taniguchi et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Prior work investigating SGN subpopulations focusing on nipple and piloerector neurons used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify eight subpopulations of neurons within the stellate ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furlan et al., 2016</xref>) in mice. Specifically, five noradrenergic, two cholinergic, and one glutaminergic neuronal subtype were identified, each with unique combinations of transcription factors, neuropeptides, and ion channels. It remains unknown whether a specific subtype of neurons innervates the heart, or whether various subtypes contribute to cardiac adrenergic control.</p><p>This study used retrograde viral tracing by injecting adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) into the myocardium of mice to identify and label cardiac-specific SGNs with the reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP). In contrast, the front paws were injected with AAVs encoding the tdTomato fluorescent protein. Ganglia were collected after 4 weeks and subjected to dissociation and scRNAseq, with cells containing GFP or tdTomato able to distinguish cardiac vs. paw-innervating neurons. We found that the heart vs. paws are innervated by three vs. four subtypes of noradrenergic neurons respectively, largely segregated by neuropeptide Y (NPY expression). These subtypes were also identified in porcine and human stellate ganglia. Clinical data implicate NPY signaling in MI, progression of left ventricular dysfunction, ventricular arrhythmias and HF, thus we focused on characterizing neurons based on NPY expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajijola, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ajijola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalla et al., 2020</xref>). We find that NPY +vs. NPY- neurons exhibit unique transcriptional profiles, along with unique morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiologic properties. Functional studies in NPY-expressing neurons ablated mice indicate that NPY is required for maximal cardiac sympatho-excitation. Collectively, these findings shed light on cell-specific cardiac adrenergic regulation with implications for novel therapeutic targeting of adrenergic signaling following cardiac injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three unique stellate ganglion neuronal subtypes innervate the heart</title><p>We performed scRNAseq on stellate ganglion neurons from eight retrograde-labeled C57BL/6 mice. We identified cardiac innervating neuronal subpopulations in stellate ganglia after labeling mice retrogradely from the heart using AAV-GFP and from front paws using AAV-tdTomato as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel), <italic>respectively</italic>. We observed regional specificity in stellate ganglia for cardiac vs. paw innervating neurons. Most cardiac-labeled neurons were localized in the cranio-medial region (cardiac pole) of the stellate ganglion while paw labeled neurons were distributed across the stellate ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref><italic>, right panel,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <italic>right panel</italic>). We validated the retrograde labeling of SGNs from the heart by staining AAV-GFP injected heart-sections with antibodies against the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5. In multiple cardiac cross-sections, we found nerve fibers co-labeled with GFP and PGP9.5 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref><italic>, right panel,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since this expression generally requires retrograde transport of AAV to the soma from nerve endings in the heart, GFP expression, and antegrade transport of GFP to cardiac nerve fibers, it confirmed that we successfully labeled postganglionic neurons in the stellate ganglion by cardiac injections.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of cardiac-specific neuronal sub-population in the mouse stellate ganglia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental overview, diagrammatic representation of tracing from cardiac (AAV-GFP) neurons to the stellate ganglion, followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analysis (left).

In response to depolarizing current steps, both cell types elicited an increasing number of action potentials in response to increasing magnitude of depolarization.

Taken together, these data suggest that NPY-expressing neurons (and by extension cardiac NPY-NPY1R signaling) are necessary at high sympathetic stress states (i.e. high stimulation frequencies), but not low sympathetic stress states (i.e. low stimulation frequencies). Such tiered control may explain how cardiac responses are graded in response to sympathoexcitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current work, we identified neuronal subpopulations in stellate ganglia that innervate myocardium, their transcriptomic profile, electrophysiological properties, morphometric parameters, and physiological role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

However, whether SGN subtypes are restricted to particular tissue beds is not understood. Our study identified significant overlap between subtypes that innervate the heart (NA1a, NA1b, and NA3) and the paw (NA1a, NA1b, NA1c, and NA3), although paw tissue has more neuronal subtypes than heart. These findings suggest that multiple SGN subtypes contribute to peripheral nervous system control of organs and tissues. These findings are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furlan et al., 2016</xref>, who used scRNAseq to explore SGNs innervating nipple- and pilo-erector muscles, finding that these neurons acquired cell type specification during organogenesis via the acquisition of unique combinations of growth factor receptors, and expression of ligands by nascent target tissues.</p><p>The current study identified specific subsets of cardiac-innervating neurons in stellate ganglia distinguished by NPY expression. NPY, a key co-transmitter released from sympathetic nerve endings, is implicated in a diverse array of metabolic functions including temperature regulation, hunger and satiety, and cardiac adrenergic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ajijola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engström Ruud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tatemoto et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). NPY receptors are expressed by various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marsh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pedrazzini et al., 1998</xref>), and in the heart, coupled with downstream signaling mechanisms that amplify cardiomyocyte calcium transients and increase diastolic calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant and Hart, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pellieux et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Protas et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, the importance of NPY as a cardiac neurotransmitter is underscored by the recent finding that cardiac sympathetic blockade using beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists without NPY antagonists did not significantly raise ventricular fibrillation threshold, however, concomitant antagonism of both NPY and beta-receptor signaling did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalla et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, low frequency sympathetic ganglion stimulation induced cardiac norepinephrine release, however, high frequency stimulation induced norepinephrine and NPY release into the myocardium from distal axonal projections from sympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kluge et al., 2021</xref>). These data, interpreted in light of the new findings in this study, suggest that cardiac sympathetic regulation exists as a two-tiered system, where low-level cardiac sympathoexcitation is mediated by NPY-low or NPY-negative neurons, whereas high-level sympathoexcitation requires the recruitment of NPY expressing neurons.</p><p>A few findings in the current study support this notion. First, distinct neurons are high or low in NPY, suggesting that when robust cardiac sympathetic activation is required for the fight or flight responses, subsets of neurons rich in NPY are recruited. Second, mice with NPY ablated neurons in stellate ganglia are unable to reach maximal levels of cardiac chronotropic response during escalating sympathetic stimulation frequencies, unlike wildtype littermates. Given the profound actions of NPY as a potentiator of adrenergic signaling, our findings provide a basis for the prognostic role of elevated circulating or coronary sinus levels of NPY for identifying patients with severe sympathoexcitation for whom outcomes are dismal. Although, we have focused on NPY-expressing neurons, populations of neurons expressing other markers may also represent targets in disease states.</p><p>Of note, therapies that target the stellate ganglion, rather than systemic blockade, have shown significant benefit and are increasingly used clinically. Yet, these approaches target the entire stellate ganglion with potential off-target consequences for the other tissue beds and organs innervated by stellate ganglion neurons. Hence, specific targeting of neurons that innervate the heart and have a stronger influence in driving excessive chronic sympathetic signaling characteristic of chronic cardiac injury is needed. Coupling such cell-specific targeting with localized delivery of such agents to the stellate ganglion via a minimally invasive approach (for example used in concert with stellate ganglion block) offers a novel avenue to target sympathetic excess in chronic cardiac injury.</p><p>The current study has limitations. Although we carefully optimized tissue-specific labeling, we cannot completely exclude non-specific labeling of a few cells in stellate ganglia. However, our IHC studies validated the subpopulations identified by scRNAseq.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, we have identified the distinct subtypes of SGNs that innervate the heart and shown that these subtypes exert functional control based on expression of <italic>Npy</italic>.

These findings expand our understanding of cardiac sympathetic control mechanisms and suggests that cell-specific targeting of sympathetic neurons may offer new therapies for heart failure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Animal experiments complied with institutional guidelines and ethical regulations.

This method allowed us to quantify the NPY +and NPY- neurons that innervate different regions of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F, G, H and J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Neuronal electrophysiology</title><p>For intracellular recording from intact preparations of whole right stellate ganglia using sharp microelectrodes, adult male <italic>Npy</italic>-hrGFP mice (n=11) were sacrificed under deep isoflurane (5%) anesthesia by cervical dislocation and exsanguination. The thorax was removed and placed in the ice-cold physiological salt solution (PSS) containing, in mM: 121 NaCl, 5.9 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 8 D-glucose; pH 7.4 maintained by 95% O<sub>2</sub>-5% CO<sub>2</sub> aeration. Stellate ganglia were isolated from the paravertebral chain at the origin of the first rib, and the overlying connective tissue was pinned to the SylGard (Dow Corning) floor of a glass bottom petri dish. Isolated ganglia were superfused (6–7 ml/min) continuously with PSS maintained at 32–35°C with a thermostatically controlled heater. Stellate neurons, either positive or negative for GFP expression as identified under epifluorescence, were impaled with borosilicate-glass microelectrodes filled with 2 M KCl +2% Neurobiotin (Vector Labs). Membrane voltage was recorded in a current clamp configuration using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier connected to a Digidata 1550B data acquisition system and personal computer with pCLAMP 10 software (Molecular Devices, CA) for data acquisition and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Virus administration and electrical stimulation of right stellate ganglia</title><p>The pAAV-flex-taCasp3-TEVp (AAV5) was a gift from Niroa Shah and Jim Wells (Addgene plasmids # 45580) and pAAV-Ef1α-DIO-EGFP (AAV5) was a gift from Bryan Roth (Addgene plasmids # 27056). <italic>Npy</italic>-IRES-Cre (n=8), <italic>Npy</italic> knockout (<italic>Npy</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, n=8; <italic>Npy</italic><sup>-/+</sup>, n=8), and Npy<italic>1r</italic> knockout (Npy<italic>1r</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, n=4; Npy<italic>1r</italic><sup>-/+</sup>, n=4) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction at 4%, maintenance at 2%, inhalation) (Isoflurane Vaporizer, SOMNI Scientific). Two needle electrodes were inserted subcutaneously into the right forearm and the left hindleg to obtain lead II electrocardiograms (Grass RPS 107 Regulated Power Supply, Grass Instrument Co.; Grass P511 AC Amplifier, Natus Neurology). With the use of a dissecting microscope (SZ-CTV Olympus Dissecting Microscope; KL 2500 LED Illuminator, Schott), a midline neck incision was performed to intubated, and mechanically ventilated mice at 150 bpm (SAR-830/P Ventilator, CWE, Inc). A left thoracotomy was performed at the second intercostal space to expose the right stellate ganglia located along the sympathetic chain near the first rib. Mice were injected with either DIO-EGFP or DIO-EGFP +taCasp3 TEVp (3 μl; 1e+13 vg/ml) into the right stellate ganglia using Programmable Nanoliter Injector (Nanoject III, Drummond Scientific Company). The viral load was released into the stellate ganglia with a rate of 20 nl per second. Five minutes later, the glass capillary pipette was pulled out slowly from right stellate ganglia. Mice were recovered on heating pads. AAVs were allowed to be incubated for three weeks in mice before electrical stimulation of right stellate ganglia was performed.</p><p>All electrode stimulations (Concentric Bipolar Electrode, FHC) were performed with repeating, monophasic pulses for 10 s at a constant duration of 10ms, output amplitude of 10mA, for a period of 10 s, while varying the stimulation frequencies by 1 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 15 Hz, and 20 Hz (Grass S88x Stimulator, Grass-Technologies Astro-Med, Inc; Photoelectric Stimulus Isolation Unit, Grass Instrument Co.; PowerLab/16SP, AD Instruments Ltd). A period of 10 min between the stimulations allowed the heart rate to return to baseline. Electrocardiograms were recorded using LabChart 7 and analyzed with LabChart7 and Spike2 7.11 programs. Right stellate ganglia were collected, stained, and imaged for NPY expression after the electrical stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 9.0.1 were used for data handling, analysis, and graphs.

Indeed, there are known physiologic differences between the right and left stellate ganglion (RSG &amp; LSG, respectively). The RSG innervates the SA node and anterior ventricles, while the left innervates the posterior aspect of the ventricles (PMID: 21917265, PMID: 28087519, PMID: 23893167, PMID: 22465457). While we performed scRNAseq and immunohistochemistry on both stellate ganglia we performed physiologic studies focused on heart rate by manipulating the RSG (as the LSG would not increase heart rate). For scRNAseq analysis, immunohistochemistry validation, and morphometric analysis, we performed experiments in RSG and LSG while neuronal electrophysiology and virus administration and RSG stim experiments were performed only on the right stellate ganglia. In the revised manuscript, we added text at line numbers 608, 611, 692, 699, 765, 830, 867, 879, 895, 901, and 947 about specific stellate ganglia used for specific experiments. Additionally, legends for figures 1, 4, and 6 have been revised as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Minor suggestions from reviewer 2:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>- The abbreviation PGN is not needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this.

Can the authors differentiate myocardium from subepicardium in mice? Please elucidate how many injections were performed per heart and in which locations. How was the left posterior wall targeted, where innervation is more dense?</p></disp-quote><p>The mouse heart, histologically, has three defined layers known as epicardium, midmyocardium, and endocardium. In the field, subepicardial is used interchangeably with intramyocardial. Given how thin the wall of the mouse heart is, we used the term subepicardial to simply connote that it was injected into the wall of the heart beneath the epicardium. To clarify this, we changed the term to intramyocardial in the manuscript.</p><p>We used 6mm, 30-gauge insulin syringes to inject 10ul of retrograde tracer intramyocardially. We performed only one injection per site only either at the apex or base of the heart, and each heart had 2-3 injections. These have been added to the methods section line 94 and 606.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In suppl Figure 5A, GFP seems to be located in many cardiomyocytes additionally to nerve fibers. GFP+ cardiomyocytes are also present in S5 C+D. How do the authors explain this with their technique?</p></disp-quote><p>This is likely due to the fact the virus we used rAAV-CAG-GFP was taken up by cardiomyocytes at the local injection site leading to GFP expression in cardiomyocytes. This was helpful as it confirmed that the virus was indeed injected into the heart, as well as the sites of injection. The presence of GFP in nerve fibers is due to uptake and retrograde transport by sympathetic nerve endings to the soma, transcription in the soma, and antegrade transport of GFP from the soma to sympathetic nerves in the heart. This was the expected finding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How many stellate ganglia were used for RNAseq?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used 16 total stellate ganglia including both the sides right and left from total of 8 mice for scRNAseq analysis.

I suggest using single images in grayscale for an unbiased view.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have replaced figure 2 with figure S8. However, we report the colocalization of specific markers within the same cell type and it would be difficult to distinguish subtypes using a grayscale image. The tissue sections used were from the cardiac-projecting region of the stellate ganglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What is the rationale to use heterozygous animals and not wild type as controls for NPY and Y1R mice? do these animals exhibit any relevant phenotypes?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any relevant phenotypic differences between wild-type and heterozygous animals from NPY KO and Y1R mice. Our stimulation studies included wildtype and heterozygous mice because we wanted to differentiate between having NPY (i.e. WT and NPY<sup>+/-</sup>) and completely lacking NPY (i.e. NPY<sup>-/-</sup>). We compared and did not find differences between WT and NPY<sup>+/-</sup> animals, so these groups were combined. This is explained in the methods section. Our immunostaining for NPY in the stellate ganglia from wild-type and heterozygous mice also did not show differences indicating that there was no significant difference in NPY expression. However, NPY<sup>-/-</sup> mice completely lacked NPY expression in stellate ganglia as depicted in Figure 6G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;NPY-/- mice showed merely any expression of NPY in stellate ganglia (Figure 6G)&quot; How do the authors explain that they still detect NPY? Is the antibody specific? Are any parts of the protein still being expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a typographical error, for which we apologize. NPY-/- ganglia do not show expression of NPY. We immunostained stellate ganglia from several mice and the results were consistently negative, however, for heterozygous and wild-type mice, immunostaining detects robust NPY expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Limitations</p><p>- The limitation sections start with &quot;first&quot; and do not continue.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the word “first” from the paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Minor suggestions from reviewer 3</p><p>1. Why was Neuropeptide Y focused as a potential &quot;target&quot;? Which data beyond previous publications were key for this decision? Could the authors speculate and/or present additional data on potential other promising candidates? Are there additional data available with respect to age and sex? At least please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>NPY is a co-transmitter released by sympathetic nerve terminals along with norepinephrine to dynamically modulate the cardiac function (Tan et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2016). Elevated circulating NPY levels are associated with adverse outcomes in chronic heart failure patients and people suffering from arrhythmia (Ajijola et al., 2020; Kalla et al., 2020). All of these previous studies suggest that NPY is important in the pathogenesis of sympathetic neuronal dysfunction. The rationale for focusing on NPY is that we found it striking that distinct groups of neurons expressing NPY vs. not expressing NPY innervated the heart. Given what we know about NPY, we were immediately interested in this population as they may be a target in chronic heart failure. We have added this into the paper (Line 101).</p><p>The comment about other potential candidates is an important one. Since we did not characterize any other populations, we avoided speculating about other potential targets, however, they include Galanin-expressing neurons. We have revised the discussion to clarify that although we have focused on NPY-expressing neurons, populations of neurons expressing other markers may also represent targets in disease states (line 386).</p><p>We did not specifically investigate age and sex-related differences in this population of neurons and agree that this interesting question should be the objective of future investigations. We could not find any cardiovascular literature studying age and sex-related differences in NPY-expressing neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The abbreviation NPY is not explained in the summary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explained the abbreviation neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the summary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the last sentence of the first paragraph of the discussion the authors mention that</p><p>&quot;These findings lay the groundwork for new therapeutic approaches that target specific neuronal subtypes in heart failure.&quot;</p><p>This is correct but it might be helpful to be rephrased since no in-depth studies from heart failure models are presented in the present manuscript.

This/point 3 is also important since heart failure goes along with profound changes within the cardiac neural control (as partly outlined by the authors in the introduction). In this context, the concept of transdifferentiation during the development and progression of heart failure might come into play.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the informative comment. Transdifferentiation of neurons within the neuronal subpopulation is a common phenomenon and has been reported (PMID: 20051627) previously. We completely agree and will investigate this in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Also it would be of interest in more detail to the reader and community to get additional insights on how the here presented cell types and insights are related to &quot;classical neurotransmitters&quot;, other neuropeptides, and how the neuronal subtypes might interfere with other cells/cell types like Schwann cells, microglia, satellite glia.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion. As it opens a new field, and we will extend our current studies in this direction. To directly address this point, we have revised the discussion to more clearly state that NPY+ and NPY- neurons all have the machinery to make catecholamines (line 335). Thus, as indicated in the graphical abstract, cardiac neurons in stellate ganglia synthesize and release norepinephrine, however, a subset co-release NPY while others do not. Regarding interactions with other subtypes, this is an intriguing question. Drawing from CNS literature, astrocytes have shown circuit-specificity i.e. astrocytes associated with different brain circuits appear to exhibit some functional differences. This may be true in stellate ganglia as well, in terms of satellite glial cells and should be investigated.</p><p>References</p><p>Ajijola, O.A., Chatterjee, N.A., Gonzales, M.J., Gornbein, J., Liu, K., Li, D., Paterson, D.J., Shivkumar, K., Singh, J.P., and Herring, N.
