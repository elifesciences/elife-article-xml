Some lincRNAs function in various aspects of gene regulation, but it is not clear in general to what extent lincRNAs contribute to the information flow from genotype to phenotype. To explore this question, we systematically analysed cellular roles of lincRNAs in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Using seamless CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing, we deleted 141 lincRNA genes to broadly phenotype these mutants, together with 238 diverse coding-gene mutants for functional context. We applied high-throughput colony-based assays to determine mutant growth and viability in benign conditions and in response to 145 different nutrient, drug, and stress conditions. These analyses uncovered phenotypes for 47.5% of the lincRNAs and 96% of the protein-coding genes. For 110 lincRNA mutants, we also performed high-throughput microscopy and flow cytometry assays, linking 37% of these lincRNAs with cell-size and/or cell-cycle control. With all assays combined, we detected phenotypes for 84 (59.6%) of all lincRNA deletion mutants tested. For complementary functional inference, we analysed colony growth of strains ectopically overexpressing 113 lincRNA genes under 47 different conditions. Of these overexpression strains, 102 (90.3%) showed altered growth under certain conditions. Clustering analyses provided further functional clues and relationships for some of the lincRNAs. These rich phenomics datasets associate lincRNA mutants with hundreds of phenotypes, indicating that most of the lincRNAs analysed exert cellular functions in specific environmental or physiological contexts. This study provides groundwork to further dissect the roles of these lincRNAs in the relevant conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>long non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>phenomics</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd><kwd>high-throughput phenotyping</kwd><kwd>RNA function</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095598/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bähler</surname><given-names>Jürg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R018219/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bähler</surname><given-names>Jürg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R009597/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bähler</surname><given-names>Jürg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Townsend</surname><given-names>StJohn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013372</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust Centre for Mitochondrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phenomics assays reveal hundreds of mutant phenotypes for long non-coding RNAs grown in specific environmental or physiological contexts, indicating that most of these RNAs exert cellular functions under certain conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomes produce pervasive and diverse non-coding RNAs. How much genetic information is transacted by this non-coding ‘dark matter’ remains a matter of debate. A substantial but poorly understood portion of transcriptomes consists of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). lincRNAs are longer than 200 nucleotides, lack long open reading frames, and do not overlap any neighbouring coding regions. While not all lincRNAs may be functional, several have well-defined roles in gene regulation and some other cellular processes. Different lincRNAs can control gene expression at different levels, from transcription to translation, and either in <italic>cis</italic> (acting on neighbouring genes) or in <italic>trans</italic> (acting on distant genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fauquenoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Popadin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schlackow et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>). Although lincRNAs show little sequence conservation between species, functional principles seem to be conserved which can help us to understand their biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ulitsky, 2016</xref>). Specific lincRNAs have been implicated in complex human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Batista and Chang, 2013</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>). For example, Xist exerts a tumour-suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yildirim et al., 2013</xref>), TUNA is associated with neurological function and Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>), and lincRNA1 delays senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelmohsen et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, lincRNAs are emerging as diagnostic molecular markers as they can be easily detected in blood and could provide more readily accessible drug targets than proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DeWeerdt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite these efforts and insights based on studying selected lincRNAs, the systematic picture remains incomplete as the importance of most lincRNAs is unknown. Functional analyses of lincRNAs are challenging given their profusion, poor annotation, low expression, and limited methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bassett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kopp and Mendell, 2018</xref>). Knowledge of lincRNA function is therefore scarce even in well-studied organisms, highlighting the need for more systematic approaches. Large-scale genetic studies of lincRNAs and other non-coding RNAs have emerged, starting to provide a more global picture on their functions and contributions to phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balarezo-Cisneros et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bester et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tuck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that many lincRNAs play specialized roles in specific conditions and, therefore, need to be analysed in the relevant conditions.</p><p>The fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, is a potent genetic model system to study gene regulation and lincRNA function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fauquenoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>). Although only the most highly expressed lincRNAs show purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>), their regulation is often affected by expression quantitative trait loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clément‐Ziza et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, transposon insertions in up to 80% of non-coding regions of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome can affect fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grech et al., 2019</xref>). RNA metabolism of fission yeast is similar to metazoan cells. For example, RNA interference (RNAi), RNA uridylation, and PABPN1-dependent RNA degradation are conserved from fission yeast to humans, but absent in budding yeast. Genome-wide approaches by us and others have uncovered widespread lincRNAs in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilhelm et al., 2008</xref>). Nearly all <italic>S. pombe</italic> lincRNAs are polyadenylated and transcribed by RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>). Transcription of lincRNAs starts from nucleosome-depleted regions upstream of positioned nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>), and the regulation of some lincRNAs involves specific transcription factors such as Gaf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rodríguez-López et al., 2020</xref>). Most <italic>S. pombe</italic> lincRNAs are cryptic in cells growing under standard laboratory conditions, being suppressed by RNA-processing pathways such as the nuclear exosome, cytoplasmic exonuclease, and/or RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), but they become induced during starvation or sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>). A substantial portion of lincRNAs are actively translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duncan and Mata, 2014</xref>), raising the possibility that some of them code for small proteins. A few <italic>S. pombe</italic> lincRNAs have been functionally analysed: <italic>meiRNA, mamRNA, nam1,</italic> and <italic>rse1</italic> control meiotic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andric et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fauquenoy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Touat-Todeschini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>SPNCRNA.1164</italic> regulates the <italic>atf1</italic> transcription factor gene in <italic>trans</italic> during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leong et al., 2014</xref>), several lincRNAs activate the downstream <italic>fbp1</italic> gene during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oda et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>prt</italic> controls <italic>pho1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shah et al., 2014</xref>), and <italic>nc-tgp1</italic> inhibits the <italic>tgp1</italic> gene by transcriptional interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ard et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Most <italic>S. pombe</italic> lincRNAs may not function under benign laboratory conditions when they are typically very lowly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>). Phenomics approaches seek to rigorously characterize phenotypes associated with many gene variants under diverse conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brochado and Typas, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rallis and Bähler, 2016</xref>). Such broad, high-throughput (HTP) phenotyping is an effective approach to uncover functional clues for unknown genes. For example, while only 34% of all budding yeast gene-deletion mutants display a growth phenotype under the standard condition, 97% of these mutants show suboptimal growth in at least one condition when assayed under a large number of chemical or environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</xref>). We have established a sensitive, reproducible platform for HTP colony-based assays to determine cellular fitness under diverse conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kamrad et al., 2020b</xref>). Here we take advantage of this potent approach to broadly investigate phenotypes of 150 lincRNAs (12.6% of the 1189 lincRNAs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>), using deletion and/or overexpression mutants, supplemented with HTP microscopy and flow cytometry assays of deletion mutants. Colonies of a representative set of 238 coding-gene mutants were phenotyped in parallel for functional comparison. Using these different assays, we collected quantitative data for over 1.1 million unique colonies and over 5.7 million cells in a wide range of conditions. This study reveals hundreds of novel lincRNA-associated phenotypes and provides a framework for follow-on studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental strategy for functional profiling of lincRNAs</title><p>We focused on lincRNAs, rather than other types of non-coding RNAs, because (1) they are poorly characterized in general but emerge as varied regulatory factors; (2) they can be deleted without directly interfering with coding gene function; and (3) they are more likely to function in <italic>trans</italic> as RNAs than antisense or promoter-associated ncRNAs which can affect neighbouring or overlapping genes via their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ard et al., 2017</xref>). For functional profiling, we selected 150 <italic>S. pombe</italic> lincRNA genes that produce well-defined transcripts and are well-separated from neighbouring coding regions (over ~200 bp), based on genome browser views of RNA-seq data. We established efficient HTP methods to genetically manipulate these lincRNAs. For deletions, we applied a CRISPR/Cas9-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodríguez-López et al., 2016</xref>); this approach allowed us to knock out the precise regions transcribed into lincRNAs without inserting any markers or other alterations, thus avoiding indirect physiological effects. For overexpression, we applied restriction-free cloning to express the lincRNAs from a plasmid under the control of the strong, inducible <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Maundrell, 1993</xref>). Gene overexpression (‘gain of function’) provides complementary phenotype information to gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prelich, 2012</xref>); moreover, any phenotype caused by a lincRNA that is ectopically expressed from a plasmid points to a function that is exerted over a distance (in <italic>trans</italic>) via the lincRNA itself rather than via its transcription or other local effects. We managed to delete 141 different lincRNAs (111 of which with at least two independent guide RNAs) and to overexpress 113 lincRNAs, with 104 lincRNAs being both deleted and overexpressed. These lincRNAs ranged in length from ~90 to 5100 nucleotides and in GC content from 25% to 46%, with means of 820 nucleotides and 34% GC content, respectively. These lincRNAs are distributed across the entire nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Strains were arrayed randomly around a control grid at a density of 384 colonies per plate. We assayed the deletion or overexpression strains in response to diverse environmental factors such as different nutrients and drugs as well as oxidative, osmotic, heavy-metal, protein-homeostasis and DNA-metabolism stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), including some combined factors which can reveal additional phenotypes by non-additive effects that are not evident from single conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rallis et al., 2013</xref>). For drugs and stressors, we applied low and high doses, where wild-type cell growth is normal or inhibited, respectively, to uncover both sensitive or resistant mutants. For the deletion mutants, we measured colony size to determine cell growth across 149 different nutrient, drug, and stress conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For 68 of these conditions, we also measured colony redness using the phloxine B dye, which stains dead cells and thus provides a measure for viable cells in colonies: bright red colonies have higher portions of viable cells than dark red colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kamrad et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lie et al., 2018</xref>). Cell growth and viability provided complementary functional information and produced strong biological signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For the overexpression mutants, we assayed cell growth across 47 conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We established a normalization procedure based on control grids to correct for known variations between and within plates which effectively reduces noise in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kamrad et al., 2020b</xref>).

Although control conditions measured in the same batch tended to be more similar, the batch effects remained much smaller than the biological signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, our colony-based phenotyping assays produce robust and reproducible results with high sensitivity. For the lincRNA deletion mutants, we also screened for cell-size and cell-cycle traits using HTP microscopy and flow cytometry analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Among the total of 51 coding-gene mutants growing slower in our assays, 49 have previously been associated with the phenotype ontology ‘abnormal vegetative cell population growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2013</xref>), thus validating our assay for this phenotype. With respect to colony viability, three lincRNA mutants showed lower viability than wild-type cells, two in rich medium and one in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 2 and 3</xref>).

Here, using a less conservative analysis, we applied a multivariate, global approach by converting effect sizes to a modified z-score to indicate the deviation from the expected phenotype value in units of standard deviations from the wild-type control in the same condition. Several conditions involved the same stressor, for example, the same drug used at different doses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We aggregated such related conditions and used the strongest median response for each mutant and set of conditions (Materials and methods). The protein-coding mutants generally showed stronger phenotypes than the lincRNA mutants as measured by the magnitude of the effect sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To compare phenotypes across the two types of mutants, we discretized the data, classing mutants as either sensitive (–1), resistant ( + 1), or similar (0) to their fitness in the corresponding control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thresholds were chosen at ±1.5 standard deviations for both growth and viability data, which resulted in ~23% of all data points classed as non-zero in each dataset. We limited this analysis to 41 sets of aggregated ‘core’ conditions in which all mutants were phenotyped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>Applying this analysis, most lincRNA mutants showed few or no phenotypes across the 41 core conditions, while 16 lincRNA mutants showed strong phenotype profiles across many conditions. Such uneven distribution in the phenotype numbers associated with lincRNAs indicates that the data reflect biology rather than technical noise. In total, 194 mutants showed a phenotype in five or more sets of conditions, including the 16 lincRNA mutants, and these mutants were used for hierarchical clustering. Clear patterns were evident, and we divided the genes into three main clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Clusters 1, 2, and 3 contained 2, 10, and 4 lincRNAs, respectively, providing an opportunity to infer function through ‘guilt by association’ with known protein-coding genes in the same clusters. This approach was somewhat limited because only 115 of the 178 protein-coding genes in the clusters had known or inferred biological roles. Using the AnGeLi tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bitton et al., 2015</xref>), we identified functional enrichments for the clusters as described below.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional signatures in long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) phenotype profiles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hierarchical clustering of discretized data for 16 lincRNA mutants (green) and 178 coding-gene mutants (grey), as indicated above the columns.

This cluster was enriched in various GO categories related to protein localization/transport, cellular respiration, phosphate metabolism, and protein translation (the latter including five cytosolic/mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, six translation factors, and three subunits of the elongator complex). The cluster also included nine genes involved in nutrient- or stress-dependent signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). With respect to phenotype ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2013</xref>), this cluster was enriched in multiple terms related to cytoskeleton aberrations, abnormal respiration and translation, as well as altered cell growth and stress sensitivity. Indeed, 80% of the mutants in this cluster have previously been associated with decreased cell population growth, and 87% are associated with increased sensitivity to chemicals. These enrichments validate our phenotype data.</p><p>Cluster 1 contained the two lincRNAs, <italic>SPNCRNA.989</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.1343</italic>, which accounted for ~56% of the colony-viability phenotypes among the lincRNA deletion mutants. When overexpressed, however, they generated just 1–2 hits, much fewer than average (see below). This pattern suggests that these lincRNAs may function in <italic>cis</italic>, regulating nearby genes. Notably, both lincRNAs are located upstream of genes regulated by the Pho7 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwer et al., 2017</xref>), which functions during phosphate starvation and other stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carter-O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>): <italic>SPNCRNA.989</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.1343</italic> are divergently expressed to <italic>atd1</italic> and <italic>tgp1,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). <italic>SPNCRNA.1343</italic> partially overlaps with the <italic>nc-tgp1</italic> RNA that regulates phosphate homeostasis by repressing the adjacent <italic>tgp1</italic> gene via transcriptional interference; deletion of <italic>SPNCRNA.1343</italic> has been shown to increase <italic>tgp1</italic> expression by inhibiting <italic>nc-tgp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ard and Allshire, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yague-Sanz et al., 2020</xref>). Inspection of the region upstream of <italic>SPNCRNA.989</italic> suggested a regulatory mechanism similar to <italic>tgp1</italic>, with divergent transcripts towards <italic>atd1</italic> likely driven by a bidirectional promoter from the nucleosome-depleted region upstream of <italic>SPNCRNA.989</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These patterns suggest that additional Pho7-regulated genes, like <italic>atd1</italic>, are controlled via upstream RNAs, similar to the <italic>tgp1, pho84,</italic> and <italic>pho1</italic> genes that respond to phosphate limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carter-O’Connell et al., 2012</xref>). The similar phenotypes of <italic>SPNCRNA.989Δ</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.1343Δ</italic> mutants therefore suggest that these lincRNA deletions interfere with the expression of their neighbouring genes and thus with processes affected by this regulon. In spotting assays, the phenotypes of <italic>SPNCRNA.989Δ</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.1343Δ</italic> often differed from those of <italic>tgp1Δ</italic> and <italic>atd1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results are consistent with the lincRNA deletion leading to induction, rather than repression, of their coding-gene neighbours.</p><p>Cluster 2 contained a majority of genes that are not associated with any functional annotations, including 10 lincRNAs genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This cluster was enriched for long-lived mutants and for genetic interactions (based on Biogrid data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Breitkreutz et al., 2007</xref>), meaning that the protein-coding genes within this cluster are approximately four times more likely to interact with each other than expected by chance. This cluster included seven genes involved in stress and/or nutrient signalling pathways and six genes for transcription factors functioning during stress/nutrient responses or in unknown processes. The phenotype data in this cluster were sparse and lacked a convincing functional signature across the coding and lincRNA genes.</p><p>Cluster 3 was characterized by most mutants showing rapid growth in VPA, formamide, and sodium orthovanadate, and many of these mutants also showed higher viability in benign conditions but lower viability in VPA. This cluster was enriched for long-lived mutants and for energy metabolism, including four genes each functioning in glycolysis and the TCA cycle. Intriguingly, one of the four lincRNA genes in this cluster, <italic>SPNCRNA.236</italic>, is located upstream the pyruvate-kinase gene <italic>pyk1,</italic> which is involved in the last step of glycolysis to generate pyruvate for the TCA cycle or fermentation. The finding that the <italic>SPNCRNA.236Δ</italic> mutant leads to a similar phenotypic signature as does deletion of glycolysis or TCA cycle genes raises the possibility that <italic>SPNCRNA.236</italic> acts in <italic>cis</italic> to control <italic>pyk1</italic> expression. Consistent with this idea, <italic>SPNCRNA.236Δ</italic> mutants grow slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) while increased activity of Pyk1 leads to faster growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamrad et al., 2020a</xref>). However, <italic>SPNCRNA.236</italic> also generates phenotypes in 11 conditions when overexpressed from a plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), including faster growth in minimal medium, which is the opposite of the slower growth of the deletion mutant in the same condition. Thus, it is also possible that <italic>SPNCRNA.236</italic> can act in <italic>trans</italic>.</p><p>We validated phenotypes of five lincRNA deletions from clusters 1 and 3 as well as deletions from neighbouring coding genes using serial dilution spotting assays under 13 conditions. Detection of subtle phenotypes involving 5% differences in growth is difficult with such spotting assays. Nevertheless, we could confirm 11 (84%) of the phenotypes detected by the HTP colony-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We conclude that there is generally a good agreement between these different phenotyping assays.</p><p>To further explore our dataset, we discretized all deletion-mutant phenotypes, both from lincRNAs and coding genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 2-4</xref>). Pearson correlations of phenotype profiles were then used for constructing a network that was visualized with Cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). The network included several distinct clusters. A large, tight cluster consisted mostly of protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, highlighted in red). This cluster, which was similar to cluster 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), included <italic>SPNCRNA.989</italic> and was enriched for genes involved in phosphate metabolism and translation, and 89% of the mutants in this cluster displayed slow growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Another large cluster was enriched for lysine metabolism with 18% of the mutants showing ageing-related phenotypes such as increased lifespan during quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sideri et al., 2014</xref>). This cluster also included three lincRNAs: <italic>SPNCRNA.318, SPNCRNA.426,</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.965</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, highlighted in blue). Network analysis of the whole phenotypic dataset revealed further connections between several lincRNAs and coding genes. For example, a negative phenotypic correlation was evident between <italic>SPNCRNA.1460</italic> and <italic>fbp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, upper left); <italic>fbp1</italic> is a key gene responding to glucose starvation that is regulated by upstream non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hirota et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoffman and Winston, 1990</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oda et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>SPNCRNA.1460</italic> is located upstream of <italic>scr1,</italic> encoding a transcriptional repressor that negatively regulates <italic>fbp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tanaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vassiliadis et al., 2019</xref>). This link raises the possibility that <italic>SPNCRNA.1460</italic> controls <italic>scr1</italic> expression and, therefore, <italic>fbp1</italic> expression. The same cluster also included <italic>car2,</italic> which is also implicated in carbon metabolism, and two priority unstudied genes, whose association suggests that they function in similar processes. Interestingly, some clusters consisted exclusively or mostly of lincRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, upper left). Naturally, these clusters showed no functional enrichments, but they point to several lincRNAs acting in related cellular processes, possibly together.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phenotyping of lincRNA overexpression mutants in multiple conditions</title><p>Gene overexpression provides complementary phenotype information to gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prelich, 2012</xref>). We constructed strains that ectopically overexpressed 113 lincRNAs from a plasmid under the strong <italic>nmt1</italic> promoter in minimal medium (Materials and methods). A real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of eight overexpression constructs showed that the lincRNAs were 35- to 2200-fold overexpressed relative to the empty-vector control strain, which expresses the lincRNAs at native levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We then looked for differences in colony growth under benign conditions compared to empty-vector control cells. We also looked for growth phenotypes in the presence of various stresses or other treatments, relative to growth in benign control conditions and normalized for the growth of empty-vector control cells. In the benign condition, most lincRNA overexpression strains grew faster compared to the empty-vector control. This pattern may reflect an indirect effect of lincRNA transcription by increasing plasmid copy numbers and/or expression of the budding yeast <italic>LEU2</italic> marker that is limiting for growth. Therefore, we normalized the colony growth of overexpression mutants in the stress conditions by the growth in the benign condition to correct for this potential bias. We used a more stringent significance threshold for the overexpression mutants than for the deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) because ectopic overexpression of genes involves cell-to-cell variation in plasmid copy numbers, leading to higher phenotypic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Siam et al., 2004</xref>).

Together, these 102 overexpression strains showed 565 growth phenotypes across conditions. The 565 hits included 347 resistant and 218 sensitive phenotypes (i.e. mutants showing larger or smaller colonies, respectively, in the assay condition than in the control). 14 lincRNA overexpression strains showed more consistent phenotypes in 10 or more conditions, topped by <italic>SPNCRNA.335</italic> that showed sensitive and resistant phenotypes in 12 and 3 conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Over 80% of the 565 phenotypes came from only 21 of the 47 conditions, and ~24% of the phenotypes came from just three conditions: proline as a nitrogen source, 5 mM valproic acid (VPA), and 10 mM hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Proline is a poor nitrogen source which causes nitrogen stress and slows growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davie et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the expression of many lincRNAs is strongly induced under nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>). Together with the results presented here, this indicates that several lincRNAs function during nitrogen stress. VPA is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, and some lincRNAs are involved in histone modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>). Roles for lincRNAs in neurological disorders such as epilepsy are also emerging, and VPA can ameliorate epilepsy partly by repressing some of these lincRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>). HU inhibits DNA synthesis, and our findings suggest that several lincRNAs are involved in related processes. For example, some lincRNAs have been implicated in double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bader et al., 2020</xref>). We propose that several lincRNAs can influence cellular growth in <italic>trans</italic> when ectopically overexpressed under conditions that affect certain cellular processes.</p><p>We looked for functional signatures in the lincRNA overexpression phenotypes using hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Unlike for lincRNA deletion mutants, this dataset did not provide the functional context from coding-gene mutants. We observed a conspicuous sub-cluster of four lincRNA overexpression strains that showed slower growth in many of the conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, highlighted in red). One of these four overexpressed lincRNAs was the well-characterized <italic>meiRNA</italic> that functions in the induction of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Watanabe and Yamamoto, 1994</xref>). In mitotically growing cells, <italic>meiRNA</italic> binds to Mmi1 via its DSR motif and is degraded by the nuclear exosome, while upon induction of meiosis, <italic>meiRNA</italic> binds to the RRM motif of Mei2, which in turn promotes meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamashita, 2019</xref>). The other three lincRNAs in this sub-cluster contain motifs for potential Mei2 binding, including two DSR motifs. Moreover, like <italic>meiRNA,</italic> the other three lincRNAs are also de-repressed in nuclear-exosome mutants and during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these findings raise the possibility that the three unknown lincRNAs in the sub-cluster also function in meiosis. To test this hypothesis, we deleted these three lincRNA genes, along with the meiRNA gene, in a homothallic <italic>h<sup>90</sup></italic> background (to allow self-mating). We then analysed meiosis and spore viability of these four deletion strains together with a wild-type control strain. While cell mating was normal in the deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), meiotic progression was somewhat delayed in <italic>SPNCRNA.1154Δ</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.1530Δ</italic> mutants as well as, most strongly, in <italic>meiRNAΔ</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), with the latter reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yamashita, 2019</xref>). Notably, all four deletion mutants showed significantly reduced spore viability compared to the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As predicted by the clustering analysis, these results indicate that <italic>SPNCRNA.1154, SPNCRNA.1530,</italic> and <italic>SPNCRNA.335</italic> play roles in meiotic differentiation.</p><p>We compared the phenotype data from deletion and overexpression mutants. We obtained data for both types of mutants for 104 lincRNAs in 22 conditions, 18 of which showed phenotypes. Of these 104 lincRNAs, only 7 did not produce any phenotypes in any condition tested. Under the 18 conditions, a higher proportion of lincRNA overexpression mutants (86.5%) than deletion mutants (32.7%) produced phenotype hits in at least one condition. Moreover, lincRNA overexpression generally resulted in larger effect sizes, that is, stronger phenotypes, than did lincRNA deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Similar trends have been reported for coding-gene mutants. For example, 646 and 1302 growth phenotypes are caused by deletion and overexpression mutants, respectively, of non-essential budding yeast genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yoshikawa et al., 2011</xref>), and 64 transcription factor genes of fission yeast show growth phenotypes when overexpressed but not when deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vachon et al., 2013</xref>). Only a few lincRNAs showed phenotypes as both deletion and overexpression mutants. For example, <italic>SPNCRNA.236</italic> showed rapid growth (resistant) phenotypes in both overexpression and deletion mutants in five conditions, while in the benign condition, the overexpression and deletion mutant showed rapid and slow growth, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp6">Supplementary files 2 and 6</xref>). In general, our phenotype data for lincRNA deletion and overexpression mutants showed little overlap and poor correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results illustrate the complementary information provided by these two types of mutants.</p><p>How might lincRNA overexpression result in more phenotypes than lincRNA deletion? Overexpression of a protein-coding gene can burden cells via resource-consuming translation or toxic protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bolognesi and Lehner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moriya, 2015</xref>). Although overexpression of a single lincRNA should not affect resource allocation, it is possible that these AT-rich RNAs engage in non-specific molecular interactions. Recent findings indicate that RNAs are assembly prone and must be tightly regulated as they can promote paraspeckles, stress granules, and phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van Treeck et al., 2018</xref>). Such processes could trigger the overexpression phenotypes in certain physiological conditions, reflecting that lincRNAs are biologically active molecules. Nevertheless, the observed 565 phenotype hits amount to only 10.6% of the potential 5311 hits if overexpression of all 113 lincRNAs caused phenotypes in the 47 conditions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Thus, overexpressed lincRNAs do not generally lead to any non-specific or toxic effects, and the observed phenotypes may, therefore, mostly reflect specific lincRNA functions. Given that many lincRNAs may function in specialized conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pauli et al., 2012</xref>), deletion mutants will only reveal phenotypes when assayed in the relevant conditions. On the other hand, the ‘gain-of-function’ overexpression mutants may also reveal phenotypes in conditions where the lincRNAs do not normally function. Notably, phenotypes that are caused by lincRNAs being ectopically expressed from plasmids point to a function that is exerted in <italic>trans</italic>, via the lincRNA itself, rather than via its transcription or other <italic>cis</italic> effects. Our findings therefore raise the possibility that many of the lincRNAs tested can function over a distance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We applied a phenomics approach to explore the functional importance of <italic>S. pombe</italic> lincRNAs, including colony-based and cellular assays of deletion mutants and colony-based assays of overexpression strains. A panel of deletion mutants of coding genes were screened in parallel for comparison and functional context. Together, these assays revealed phenotypes for 84 of 141 deleted lincRNAs, 229 of 238 deleted coding genes, and 102 of 113 overexpressed lincRNAs. This extensive phenotyping uncovers lincRNAs that contribute to cellular resistance or sensitivity in specific conditions, reflected by altered colony growth and/or viability, and lincRNAs that are involved in the size control and the cell-division cycle. Systematic screening for genetic interactions between lincRNA and coding-gene mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dixon et al., 2008</xref>) could provide valuable clues about functional relationships. As expected, higher proportions of coding-gene mutants showed phenotypes, and these phenotypes tended to be stronger (larger effect sizes) than for lincRNA mutants. In benign conditions, the lincRNA mutants were ~3- and 30-fold less likely to show phenotypes for colony growth or viability, respectively, than coding-gene mutants. This difference was less pronounced in the nutrient, drug, and stress conditions, where many more lincRNA mutants revealed phenotypes, at only approximately two- to fourfold lower proportions than coding-gene mutants for colony growth or viability, respectively. Moreover, compared to lincRNA deletion mutants, the lincRNA overexpression strains were approximately twofold more likely to show phenotypes, which also tended to be stronger. As predicted from clustering of overexpression phenotypes, deletion mutants for three lincRNAs showed defects in meiotic differentiation. Together, these findings support the notion that most lincRNAs play specialized roles in specific conditions. The findings also indicate that lincRNAs in general have subtler functions than proteins, for example, in fine-tuning of gene expression. Accordingly, it was important that our HTP assays were highly sensitive to detect subtle phenotypes. We conclude that a substantial proportion of lincRNAs exert cellular functions under certain conditions, and many of which may act in <italic>trans</italic> as RNAs. This analysis provides a rich framework to mechanistically dissect the functions of these lincRNAs in the physiologically relevant conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Deletion and overexpression strain libraries</title><p>Using a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach and primer design tool for seamless genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rodríguez-López et al., 2016</xref>), we deleted 141 different lincRNA genes located across all the <italic>S. pombe</italic> chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for coordinates).

For quantifying redness/viability, images were taken by reflective scanning using <italic><monospace>--mode Color</monospace></italic>. Images were acquired at 300 or 600 dpi resolution. For colour images, to determine colony redness for viability, we used an opaque fixture to hold the plates in place, the white cover was installed in the scanner lid, and the scanner was covered by a cardboard box to prevent external light interfering with image acquisition. Images were inspected individually and excluded if one or more of the following applied: several colonies were missing due to pinning errors (usually in the corners), evidence of contamination, white background had not been inserted during colour scanning, and/or plate had slipped significantly during scanning so that a whole row/column of colonies was missing from the image. The overall number of excluded plates was low and generally did not result in significant data loss in the final dataset due to the large number of replicate plates.

This entire procedure was repeated in three independent biological replicates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Software, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Methodology, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Details of strains and conditions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-supp1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Phenotype data of long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) deletion mutants.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-supp2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Summary tables of long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) and coding-gene deletion mutants.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-supp3-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Phenotype data of coding-gene deletion mutants.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-supp4-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Clustering analysis of deletion-mutant phenotypes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-supp5-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Phenotype data of long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) overexpression mutants.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-supp6-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-76000-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sarah Aldous, Natalia Borbarán Bravo, Mike Jiang, Janina Karl, Patrycja Krawczyk, Sara Kurz, Kira Kyne, Shirley Liu, and Florence Young for help with deletion and overexpression constructs.

Rodriguez-Lopez et al. describes the analysis of long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) function in fission yeast using both deletion and overexpression methods. The manuscript is very well presented and provides a wealth of lincRNA functional information for the field. This work is an important advance as there is still very little known about the function of lincRNAs in both normal and other conditions. An impressive array of conditions were assessed here. With a large scale analysis like this there is really not one specific conclusion. The authors conclude that lincRNAs exert their function in specific environmental or physiological conditions. This conclusion is not a novel conclusion, it has been proposed and shown before, but this manuscript provides the experimental proof of this concept on a large scale.</p><p>The lincRNA knock-out library was assessed using a colony size screen, a colony viability screen and cell size and cell cycle analysis. Additionally, a lincRNA over-expression library was assessed by a colony size screen. These different functional analysis methods for lincRNAs were than carried out in a wide variety of conditions to provide a very large dataset for analysis. Overall, the presentation and analysis of the data was easy to follow and informative. Some points below could be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p><p>There were 238 protein coding gene mutants assessed in parallel, to provide functional context, which was a very promising idea. But, unfortunately, the inclusion of 104 protein coding genes of unknown function restricted the use of the protein coding genes in the integrated analysis to connect lincRNAs to a known function using guilt by association.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the unknown coding-gene mutants did certainly not help to provide functional context through guilt by association. These mutants were included to generate functional clues for the unknown proteins and compare phenotype hits with unknown lincRNA mutants. Nevertheless, because the known coding-gene mutants included broadly cover all high-level biological processes (GO slim), we could make several useful functional inferences for certain lincRNAs as discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The colony viability screen is not described well throughout the manuscript. Firstly, the use of phloxine B dye to determine cell viability needs to be described better when first introduced at the bottom of page 6. What exactly is this viability screen and red colour intensity indicating? Please define what the different levels of red a colony would indicate as far as viability. I assume an increase in red colour indicates more dead cells? So it is confusing that later the output of this assay is described as giving a resistant/sensitive phenotype or higher/lower viability. How can you get a higher viability from an assay that should only detect lower viability? Shouldn't this assay range from viable (no, or low red, colour) to increasing amounts of red indicating increasingly less viability? Figure 4D is also confusing with the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; annotations. These should be changed to &quot;lower viability&quot; and &quot;viable&quot; or &quot;not viable&quot; and &quot;viable&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The colony-viability screen is described in detail in our recent paper (Kamrad et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). We have now better explained how phloxine B works to determine cell viability (p. 6). The reviewer’s assumption is correct: an increase in red colour indicates more dead cells. However, all phenotypes reported are relative to wild-type cells under the same condition. Many conditions lead to a general increase in cell death, but some mutants show a lower increase in cell death compared to wild-type cells. These mutants, therefore, have a higher viability than wild-type cells, i.e. they are more resistant than wild-type under the given condition. We have tried to clarify this in the text, including the legend of Figure 4. We agree that the ‘red’ and ‘white’ annotations in Figure 4D could be confusing. We have now changed these to ‘low viability’ and ‘high viability’. Again, this is relative to wild-type cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How are you sure that when generating the 113 lincRNA ectopic over-expression constructs by PCR that the sequences you cloned are correct? Simply checking for &quot;correct insert size&quot;, as stated in the methods, is not really good practice and these constructs should be fully sequenced to be sure they contain the correct sequence and that constructs have not had mutations introduced by the PCR used for cloning. Without such sequence confirmation one cannot be completely confident that the data produced is specific for a lincRNA overexpression. Additionally, a selection of strains with the overexpression constructs should be tested by qRT-PCR and compared to a non-over-expressing strain to confirm lincRNA overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>To minimize errors during PCR amplification, we used the high-fidelity Phusion DNA polymerase which features an &gt;50-fold lower error rate than Taq DNA Polymerase. We had confirmed the insert sequences for the first 17 lincRNAs cloned using Sanger sequencing (but did not report this in the manuscript). We have now checked additional inserts of the overexpression plasmids by Sanger sequencing in 96-well plate-format using a universal forward primer upstream of the cloning site. This high-troughput sequencing produced reliable sequence data for 80 inserts, including full insert sequences for 62 plasmids and the first (~900 bp of insert sequences for 18 plasmids). Of these, only the insert for <italic>SPNCRNA.601</italic> showed a sequence error compared to the reference genome: T to C transition in position 559. This mutation could reflect either an error that occurred during cloning or a natural sequence variant among yeast strains (lincRNA sequences are much more variable than coding sequences). So, in general, the PCR cloning accurately preserved the sequence information. We have added this information in the Methods (p. 27-28). Please note that lincRNAs depend much less on primary nucleotide sequence than mRNAs, and a few nucleotide changes are highly unlikely to interfere with lincRNA function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Page 4, lines 19-20 – &quot;A substantial portion of lincRNAs are actively translated (Duncan and Mata, 2014), raising the possibility that some of them act as small proteins.&quot; This sentence does not make sense, lincRNAs can't &quot;act as&quot; small proteins, they can only &quot;code for&quot; small proteins.

First, this is a significant amount of work considering the large set of targets. Second a more importantly, what you’ll end up with is a fold change. What will be considered as overexpression? Which threshold? This is why I prefer a biological read-out (a phenotype) because whatever the fold change, it tells us that there is an effect. It is very likely indeed that some targets are not overexpressed because of their rapid degradation. To me, this is the drawback of any large-scale studies.</p><p>– Also, looking at the expression of the adjacent gene in the case of a cis-effect is interesting though this is likely condition-dependent (because most phenotypes appear in specific conditions). So, what would be the conclusion if there is no effect in classical rich media?</p><p>– The sequence of the insert should be specified, I agree.

We have now clarified this in the Methods (p. 27).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this work from the group of Jurg Bahler, the authors take advantage of the high throughput colony-based screen approach they recently developed (Kamrad et al., eLife 2020) to perform a functional profiling analysis on a subset of 150 lincRNAs in fission yeast. Using a seamless CRISPR/Cas9-based method, they created deletion mutants for 141 lincRNAs. In addition, the authors also generated strains ectopically overexpressing 113 lincRNAs from a plasmid (under the control of the strong and inducible nmt1 promoter).</p><p>The viability and growth of all these mutants was then assessed across benign, nutrient, drug and stress conditions (149 conditions for the deletion mutants, 47 conditions for the overexpression).

Moreover, we have tested the overexpression levels for eight selected overexpression constructs using RT-qPCR analysis. These eight constructs feature the entire range of associated phenotypes hits, including 3 lincRNAs with the highest number of phenotypes in 14 conditions, 3 with no phenotypes, and 2 with intermediate numbers of phenotypes. The RT-qPCR results show that the lincRNAs were 35- to 2200-fold overexpressed relative to the empty-vector control strain (which expresses the lincRNA at native levels). No clear pattern was evident between expression levels and phenotype hits, e.g. lincRNAs without phenotypes when overexpressed showed similar fold-changes as a lincRNA showing 13 phenotypes. We present these results on p. 21/22 and in the new Supplemental Figure 9A, and describe the experiment in the Methods (p. 28).</p><p>As pointed out by Reviewer 2, these fold changes in expression are actually of limited value compared to the phenotype read-outs. The important result is that we detected phenotypes for over 90% of the overexpression strains, indicating that overexpression generally worked. Given that this is a large-scale study, there might be some lincRNA constructs that are faulty or are not overexpressed. It would not be realistic or meaningful to test all constructs. Any follow-on studies focusing on a specific lincRNAs will need to first validate the large-scale results as is common practice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

For the overexpression, I read that each strain was represented by at least 12 colonies across 3 different plates and experiments were repeated at least 3 times. Each condition was assayed in three independent biological repeats, together with control EMM2 plates, resulting in at least 36 data points per strain per condition.</p><p>Perhaps I missed something.

Specific experimental issues that are easily addressable.</p><p>– The pattern of the SPNCRNA.1343 and SPNCRNA.989 mutants is consistent with the idea that these lincRNAs act in cis and that their deletion interferes with the expression of the adjacent tgp1 and atd1 genes, respectively. The authors could easily test by RT-qPCR or Northern Blot that the lincRNA deletion leads to the induction of the adjacent gene. Also, if the hypothesis of the authors is correct, the ectopic expression of these two lincRNAs in trans should not complement the phenotypes of the corresponding mutants. These experiments would reinforce the conclusion of the authors about the specific regulatory effect of the SPNCRNA.1343 and SPNCRNA.989 lincRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>It would actually not be as easy as suggested to obtain conclusive results in this respect. For <italic>SPNCRNA.1343</italic> and its neighbour, <italic>atd1,</italic> the mechanisms involved have already been shown in detail based on several mechanistic studies (Ard et al., 2014; Ard and Allshire, 2016; Garg et al., 2018; Shah et al., 2014; 2014; Yague-Sanz et al., 2020). But these studies did require multiple precise genetic constructs and specialized approaches to interrogate the complex regulatory relationships between the overlapping transcripts which can be both positive and negative. As correctly pointed out by Reviewer 2, we do not know the particular conditions where any cis-regulatory interactions take place, and a negative result would not be conclusive. We have interrogated our RNA-seq data obtained under multiple genetic and environmental conditions (Atkinson et al. 2018) to analyse the regulatory relationship between <italic>SPNCRNA.1343</italic> and <italic>atd1</italic> (studied before) as well as <italic>SPNCRNA.989</italic> and <italic>tgp1</italic> (proposed in our manuscript).
