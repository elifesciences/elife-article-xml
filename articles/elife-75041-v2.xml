To this end plants have developed intricate stress perception and response mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devireddy et al., 2021</xref>), where the chloroplast is recognized as both a major signaling hub and a target for acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kleine et al., 2021</xref>). Likely candidates for regulating chloroplast stress signaling are the hyperphosphorylated nucleotides guanosine pentaphosphate and tetraphosphate (together referred to as ppGpp) that are synthesized from ATP and GDP/GTP by chloroplast localized enzymes of the RelA SpoT Homologue (RSH) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boniecka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field, 2018</xref>). In bacteria, where ppGpp was originally discovered, a considerable body of work indicates that ppGpp and related nucleotides interact directly with specific effector enzymes to regulate growth rate and promote stress acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ronneau and Hallez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bange et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). In plants, ppGpp signaling is less well understood both at the physiological and mechanistic levels. ppGpp levels increase transiently in diverse plants in response to treatment with a range of abiotic stresses and stress-related hormones (abscisic acid, jasmonate, and ethylene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ihara et al., 2015</xref>). The accumulation of ppGpp is controlled by the ppGpp synthesis and hydrolysis activity of three families of chloroplast targeted RSH enzyme, RSH1, RSH2/3, and RSH4/CRSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avilan et al., 2019</xref>). In the angiosperm <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), where ppGpp signaling is best characterized, RSH1 lacks ppGpp synthase activity and acts as the main ppGpp hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>), the closely related RSH2 and RSH3 act as the major ppGpp synthases during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizusawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>), and the calcium-activated RSH (CRSH) is responsible for ppGpp synthesis at night and in response to darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ihara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). RSH2 and RSH3 are bifunctional ppGpp synthase/hydrolase enzymes, and their hydrolase activity was recently shown to be necessary for constraining CRSH-mediated ppGpp production at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). The artificial accumulation of ppGpp itself has been shown to repress the expression of certain chloroplast genes in vivo via the inhibition of chloroplast transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamburenko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). The chloroplastic effectors of ppGpp signaling in plants have not yet been identified. Nevertheless, ppGpp is able to specifically repress activity of the chloroplast guanylate kinase, suggesting the existence of a ppGpp effector mechanism that is found in many firmicute bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nomura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bange et al., 2021</xref>). According to the firmicute model, guanylate kinase inhibition causes a drop in GTP concentration, which in turn results in reduced transcription from rRNA-coding genes where GTP is usually the initiating nucleotide. Over accumulation of ppGpp in the chloroplast by the overexpression of RSH3 or bacterial ppGpp synthase domains has also shown that ppGpp may act as a conserved repressor of photosynthesis in both land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honoki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harchouni et al., 2021</xref>) and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avilan et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the artificial accumulation of ppGpp also appears to protect plants against nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honoki et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a few studies have now demonstrated that ppGpp is required for different physiological processes; these include the regulation of plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono et al., 2020</xref>), plant immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelkefi et al., 2018</xref>), and photosynthesis under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>). However, there are so far no demonstrations that ppGpp is required for abiotic stress acclimation in plants.</p><p>Here, we looked at the role of ppGpp in acclimation to nitrogen deprivation. ppGpp was discovered in bacteria during research into the acclimation of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to amino acid limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cashel and Gallant, 1969</xref>). We reasoned that a similar role was likely to be maintained in plants due to a shared and fundamental requirement for amino acids and the nitrogen to synthesize them. In particular, chloroplasts, and the photosynthetic machinery within, represent a major nitrogen store that must be remobilized during periods of nitrogen limitation and during senescence. We found that ppGpp biosynthesis by RSH2 and RSH3 is necessary for acclimation to nitrogen starvation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. During nitrogen starvation ppGpp acts by remodeling the photosynthetic electron transport chain to downregulate photosynthetic activity, and by protecting against oxidative stress and tissue damage. Furthermore, we show that ppGpp couples chloroplastic and nuclear gene expression during nitrogen starvation. Overall, our work indicates that ppGpp is a pivotal regulator of chloroplast activity with a photoprotective role and that ppGpp signaling is required for the acclimation of plants to harsh environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ppGpp is required for acclimation to nitrogen deprivation</title><p>To determine whether ppGpp plays a significant physiological role during nitrogen starvation we grew a series of <italic>RSH</italic> lines on a nitrogen limiting medium that imposes a progressive nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Quantification of lipid peroxidation products (hydroxy-octadecatrienoic acids [HOTEs], the oxidation products of linolenic acid, the major fatty acid in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves) by HPLC further supported these findings: HOTEs increased in the wild type in response to nitrogen deprivation, and this increase was significantly larger in the ppGpp-deficient lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that nitrogen deprivation promotes ROS accumulation, and that ppGpp is required to prevent overaccumulation of ROS, oxidative stress, and death of cotyledons under these conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ppGpp levels increase at an early stage of nitrogen deprivation</title><p>In bacteria and in plants, ppGpp is known to peak in response to stress before stabilizing at lower levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ihara et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the kinetics of changes in ppGpp concentration during nitrogen deprivation we quantified ppGpp levels in wild-type plants at different timepoints during growth on nitrogen limiting media. We observed a peak in ppGpp levels after 8 days on nitrogen limiting medium that was not observed in plants of the same age grown on nitrogen replete medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The ppGpp concentration decreased and stabilized after 12 days on nitrogen limiting medium. In contrast, the level of GTP decreased throughout the timecourse. We next determined how (p)ppGpp levels were affected in each of the <italic>RSH</italic> lines during growth on nitrogen limiting medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As anticipated we found that ppGpp levels in OX:RSH1 and <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic> lines were lower than in wild-type plants, while they were higher in <italic>rsh1-1</italic> plants. Strikingly, we found that the lines with low ppGpp levels (OX:RSH1 and <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic>) maintained higher levels of GTP than in the wild-type controls or <italic>rsh1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), resulting in dramatic differences in the ppGpp/GTP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, nitrogen limitation leads to an early increase in ppGpp levels and is followed by a progressive diminution of the GTP pool that is dependent on ppGpp accumulation. These results suggest that ppGpp inhibits GTP biosynthesis, perhaps through inhibition of guanylate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nomura et al., 2014</xref>), and supports the hypothesis that plants have a ppGpp effector mechanism that operates through purine metabolism as found in many bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nitrogen deprivation promotes a ppGpp-dependent drop in photosynthetic activity</title><p>Under standard growth conditions artificial production of ppGpp has been shown to downregulate photosynthetic activity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>).

We therefore measured different photosynthetic parameters in the wild type and <italic>RSH</italic> lines during growth on nitrogen limiting medium. A decrease in the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of photosystem II (PSII) caused by an increase in basal fluorescence (Fo, see Materials and methods for formula) was observed in the cotyledons and first set of true leaves of wild-type seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

To understand the state of the entire photosynthetic electron transport chain we next measured the relative rate of electron transport (ETR). We found that nitrogen deprivation led to a large decrease in ETR in wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). The <italic>RSH</italic> lines showed similar ETRs to the wild type under nitrogen replete conditions.

Induction of the MESH ppGpp hydrolase also prevented much of the decrease in ETR observed under nitrogen deprivation, again indicating that this phenomenon is dependent on the activity of RSH enzymes and ppGpp accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The ppGpp-dependent decline in photosynthesis occurs even at low light fluences</title><p>The ppGpp-dependent drop in Fv/Fm during nitrogen deprivation is reminiscent of photoinhibition, a process whose rate is proportional to light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tyystjärvi and Aro, 1996</xref>). We therefore asked whether the ppGpp-dependent decrease in Fv/Fm is similarly dependent on the excitation pressure on the photosystems. Strikingly, under nitrogen deprivation the Fv/Fm of the wild type decreased to a similar minimum regardless of the light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density; low light, 10 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; growth light, 80 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; and higher light, 150 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

A similar phenomenon was observed in the high ppGpp <italic>rsh1-1</italic> line, except that the Fv/Fm dropped at a faster rate and to a considerably lower level. In contrast, in the low ppGpp <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic> mutant we observed almost no decrease in Fv/Fm, regardless of the light intensity tested. The insensitivity of the <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic> mutant indicates that the process is completely dependent on ppGpp biosynthesis. Furthermore, the response of the wild-type and even stronger response of the <italic>rsh1-1</italic> mutant at all light fluences indicate that ppGpp-initiated regulation of Fv/Fm is triggered in response to nitrogen deprivation rather than to changes in the excitation status of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ppGpp is required for the timely degradation of photosynthetic proteins</title><p>In order to better understand the changes in the photosynthetic machinery that underlie the reduction of photosynthetic capacity during nitrogen starvation we analyzed the abundance of representative photosynthetic proteins in the wild type and the low ppGpp line OX:RSH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The mitochondrial marker protein COXII, a subunit of the mitochondrial complex IV, increased to reach a maximum on day 12 of nitrogen deprivation. Interestingly, the COXII maximum was higher in the wild type than in OX:RSH1 plants suggesting increased ppGpp levels could also positively influence mitochondrial activity. PsbS, a key component of nonphotochemical quenching, and SAG12, a marker of senescence, showed similar patterns of accumulation in WT and OX:RSH1 plants.</p><p>We next extended our analysis from OX:RSH1 to the other RSH lines to confirm that ppGpp is responsible for the observed changes in photosynthetic proteins during nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this experiment we normalized to total chlorophyll to exclude possible artifacts linked to normalization on total protein, yet we obtained broadly similar results. PetA and RBCL, the proteins with the greatest differences in OX:RSH1 during the timecourse, were more abundant in the low ppGpp lines OX:RSH1 and <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic> at day 12 under nitrogen deprivation. The same proteins were also less abundant than the wild type in the high ppGpp line <italic>rsh1-1</italic>. Interestingly, PsbA accumulation did not appear different between the lines, contrasting with results from the OX:RSH1 timecourse. However, this difference is likely linked to the chlorophyll normalization because Lhcb1 levels were higher in the wild type and <italic>rsh1-1</italic> mutant, indicating a similar direction of change for the ratio of PSII core to antenna. Finally, to unequivocally link these changes to ppGpp we analyzed representative protein levels in induced MESH ppGpp hydrolase lines, which again showed the ppGpp is required for diminution of PetA and RBCL levels during nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether our immunoblotting experiments indicate the ppGpp is required for the timely reduction in abundance of key photosynthetic proteins during nitrogen starvation, and that proteins such as PsbO (PSII core), PetA (Cyt b<sub>6</sub>f), and RBCL (Rubisco) appear to be preferentially affected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Nitrogen starvation promotes ppGpp-dependent energetic uncoupling of PSII antenna</title><p>The ppGpp-dependent drop in Fv/Fm and drop in the PsbA/Lhcb1 ratio suggest that ppGpp specifically remodels the structure of the PSII complex during nitrogen deprivation. Supporting this idea, we also found a ppGpp-dependent drop in the Chl a/b ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a substantial decrease in PSII RC, which lacks Chl b, to Chl b-rich PSII antenna. An increase in relative PSII antenna abundance might be accompanied by the energetic uncoupling from the PSII RC. Low temperature chlorophyll fluorescence spectra confirmed this hypothesis. During nitrogen deprivation there was a shift of the PSII antenna emission peak toward lower wavelengths in the wild type, indicating an energetic decoupling from PSII RC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crepin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Many chloroplast protein complexes contain subunits encoded by both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes. Notably, in the wild-type chloroplast protein complexes showed coordinate downregulation of both nuclear and chloroplast transcripts in response to nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). However, ppGpp depletion caused widespread misregulation of transcript abundance for complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). For the PSII complex, there was little difference between OX:RSH1 and the wild type under nitrogen replete conditions. However, in OX:RSH1 nitrogen deprivation caused the large-scale uncoupling of the coordination of gene expression between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes: all but one of the transcripts for nuclear-encoded subunits of PSII were downregulated, while all the transcripts for chloroplast-encoded subunits of PSII were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

These results indicate first that nitrogen deprivation promotes the coordinated downregulation of genes encoding chloroplastic proteins in the nuclear and chloroplastic genomes, and second that ppGpp plays a pivotal role in coupling gene expression between nuclear and chloroplast genomes under nitrogen limitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Nitrogen deprivation has long been known to cause a drop in photosynthetic capacity in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Terashima and Evans, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nunes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verhoeven et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu and Zhang, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garai and Tripathy, 2017</xref>). Here, we show that ppGpp signaling plays a major role in this process. We demonstrate that nitrogen starvation leads to an early and transient increase in ppGpp levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and that the capacity to synthesize and accumulate ppGpp is then required for protecting plants against excess ROS accumulation, tissue damage and stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A–D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). We show that ppGpp is likely to mediate the acclimation response by affecting the ppGpp/GTP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), promoting the downregulation of photosynthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A–D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>) and remodeling the photosynthetic machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). Finally, we show that ppGpp may function by specifically downregulating chloroplast transcript abundance during nitrogen deprivation to maintain an equilibrium between chloroplast and nuclear gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). ppGpp was initially discovered thanks to the identification of bacterial mutants that were unable to downregulate rRNA transcription during amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stent and Brenner, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cashel and Gallant, 1969</xref>). Our results here therefore indicate that the fundamental involvement of ppGpp signaling in acclimation to nitrogen deprivation is likely to have been maintained despite the large evolutionary distance separating bacteria from plants that includes major shifts including the domestication of the cyanobacterial ancestor of the chloroplast, and the different regulatory logic and signaling networks of photosynthetic eukaryotes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The physiological relevance of ppGpp signaling in plants</title><p>Depletion or removal of ppGpp is usually necessary for directly establishing the implication of ppGpp in a physiological process. Up to now a handful of studies in plants have directly implicated ppGpp physiological processes by showing a requirement for ppGpp synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelkefi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honoki et al., 2018</xref>). We now add to these studies by using multiple approaches, including three different ppGpp depletion methods (OX:RSH1, <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic> and MESH), to demonstrate that ppGpp is required for acclimation to nitrogen deprivation. Previous work hinted that ppGpp may play such a role by showing that plants ectopically overaccumulating ppGpp appear able to better withstand transfer to media lacking nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honoki et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honoki et al., 2018</xref> also used a similar <italic>rsh2 rsh3</italic> double mutant in their experiments though, apart from a delay in Rubisco degradation, did not observe clear-cut differences from the wild type in terms of photosynthetic activity after transfer to media lacking nitrogen. The reasons for this are not clear, but it could be related to differences in experimental set up such as the timepoints for analysis, how nitrogen starvation was imposed, or the different RSH3 mutant allele used.</p><p>Our findings further reinforce the evidence that RSH enzymes function in the chloroplast. GFP fusion experiments have shown that RSH enzymes are localized to the chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>), and the pleiotropic phenotypes of RSH3 overexpressing plants can be suppressed by chloroplast expression of a ppGpp hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>). However, some proteins, such as ATP synthase subunit beta-3, show low levels of dual targeting that are not detectable using full-length fluorescent protein fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Coverage of the full mitochondrial transcriptome here shows that overexpression of RSH1 has almost no effect on the large-scale changes in mitochondrial transcript abundance that occur in response to nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These results therefore confirm that RSH enzymes operate within the chloroplast.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>New insights into ppGpp signaling in planta</title><p>The kinetics of changes in ppGpp concentration during nitrogen deprivation provide new information on how ppGpp acts in planta. We observed a transient peak in ppGpp levels after 8 days of growth on nitrogen limiting medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar transient peaks of ppGpp accumulation were also observed in plants subjected to different stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ihara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ono et al., 2020</xref>), and are observed in bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varik et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the peak in ppGpp that we observed in response to nitrogen deprivation occurs prior to major changes in Fv/Fm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), or anthocyanin accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These factors along with the progressive nature of the nitrogen starvation suggest that a signaling mechanism activates ppGpp biosynthesis relatively soon after perception of nitrogen supply limitation. The upregulation of <italic>RSH2</italic> and <italic>RSH3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) indicates that there is at least a transcriptional component to this response. However, additional layers of regulation are likely, including for example the allosteric activation of RSH enzymes by interaction with other proteins or small molecules as found for bacterial RSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ronneau and Hallez, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irving and Corrigan, 2018</xref>). After the initial peak the ppGpp concentration then drops to levels not very different to those observed in plants grown in nitrogen replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, OX:RSH1 plants only show slightly lower levels of ppGpp than the wild type despite showing very similar phenotypes to the <italic>rsh<sub>QM</sub></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Together these observations indicate that ppGpp continues to exert an effect after peaking, suggesting the activation of irreversible processes or increased sensitivity to the presence of ppGpp. The second of these possibilities is supported by the phenotype of the high ppGpp <italic>rsh1-1</italic> mutant which displays much stronger photosynthesis phenotypes than wild-type plants despite a relatively modest increase in ppGpp levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).</p><p>GTP is a key nucleotide in ppGpp signaling because it is both the substrate for ppGpp biosynthesis and enzymes in its biosynthetic pathway such as guanylate kinase are potential ppGpp effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field, 2018</xref>). We observed a striking decrease in GTP levels during nitrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Remarkably GTP levels were closely and inversely correlated to ppGpp levels in the wild type and the <italic>RSH</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). GTP is present at levels almost three orders of magnitude higher than ppGpp, so the relationship between ppGpp and GTP cannot be simply explained by the consumption of GTP for ppGpp biosynthesis. Therefore, ppGpp accumulation drives the depletion of the cellular GTP pools by other means, which could for example include the inhibition of enzymes involved in chloroplastic GTP biosynthesis such as guanylate kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nomura et al., 2014</xref>). Even more remarkable is that the ppGpp-driven GTP depletion occurs specifically under nitrogen deprivation because accumulation of ppGpp to high levels in OX:RSH3 plants does not affect the GTP pool under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartoli et al., 2020</xref>). The reduction in GTP levels may contribute to ppGpp signaling in two ways. First, reduced GTP levels are likely to directly contribute to the observed ppGpp-dependent reduction in chloroplast transcription in a similar fashion to ppGpp signaling in firmicute bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bange et al., 2021</xref>). Second, the increase in the ppGpp/GTP ratio will significantly augment the action of ppGpp on effectors where ppGpp competes with GTP for binding. GTP-binding effectors are common in bacteria, and many are conserved in chloroplasts, particularly those involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pausch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Field, 2018</xref>). We propose that the increase in the ppGpp/GTP ratio during nitrogen limitation is may also explain how ppGpp maintains its influence despite decreasing in absolute amounts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The impact of ppGpp on photosynthesis under nitrogen deprivation</title><p>Our work also reveals the wide-ranging physiological effects of ppGpp on photosynthetic activity during nitrogen deprivation. These effects are reminiscent of the photosynthetic changes that occur during senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2019</xref>), and are remarkably similar to those found using the ectopic overaccumulation of ppGpp in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, moss and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maekawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugliani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Imamura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honoki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avilan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harchouni et al., 2021</xref>). However, compared to these studies our more detailed analysis here highlights first the global effect of ppGpp on chloroplast transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and second the strong effect of ppGpp on certain photosynthetic proteins such as PsbO from PSII, PetA from Cyt b<sub>6</sub>f, and RbcL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). ppGpp controls the abundance of these proteins via the downregulation of chloroplast transcript abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), reducing the quantity of transcripts available for translation as well as translation capacity via a likely reduction in rRNA transcription. The downregulation of transcript abundance may involve a GTP concentration-dependent inhibition of transcription as discussed above. However, the strong reduction in subunits from complexes that are usually stable like Cyt b<sub>6</sub>f suggests that more active processes could also be involved. This idea is supported by previous work showing the high stability of Cyt b<sub>6</sub>f in tobacco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hojka et al., 2014</xref>), the selective loss of Cyt b<sub>6</sub>f during natural senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roberts et al., 1987</xref>), and the protease-mediated degradation mechanism for Cyt b<sub>6</sub>f and Rubisco that occurs under nitrogen limitation in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Majeran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). Another argument supporting the idea that ppGpp may act on protein stability is the contrast between reduced transcript and stable protein levels for the nuclear-encoded photosynthetic genes Lhcb1 and Lhca1 in low ppGpp plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). This contrast suggests that ppGpp could promote the degradation of these proteins during nitrogen limitation.</p><p>PSII architecture was also modified in a ppGpp-dependent manner during nitrogen limitation with an increase in the ratio of PSII antenna to RC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>), causing an increase in basal fluorescence and contributing to the decrease in PSII maximal efficiency (Fv/Fm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>). While this phenomenon has similarities to photoinhibition, our data suggest that ppGpp does not increase PSII RC photoinactivation, but instead inhibits the resynthesis of PSII RC via the inhibition of chloroplast transcription. Due to the rapid degradation of photoinactivated PSII RC this leads to an increase in the ratio of PSII antenna to RC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ppGpp is implicated in photoprotection during nitrogen limitation</title><p>During nitrogen deficiency plants must remobilize nitrogen to drive acclimation processes. At the same time, growth arrest leads to a strong decrease in demand for the products of photosynthesis which has the potential to lead to overexcitation and ROS production. Therefore, in addition to remobilizing nitrogen, the plant must also downsize the photosynthetic machinery in a controlled fashion to avoid producing damaging levels of ROS. Here, we show that ppGpp promotes a reduction in the photosynthetic machinery, a major nitrogen store, and at the same time plays a role in protecting against excess ROS production. We show that ROS increases in the wild type in response to nitrogen deprivation, and that defects in ppGpp biosynthesis lead to greater increases in ROS and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D</xref>). The limited ROS increase in the wild type is in agreement with a recent study also showing ROS accumulation in the leaves of nitrogen starved plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Safi et al., 2021</xref>). Chloroplasts are the major source of ROS in photosynthetic plant leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogers and Munné-Bosch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domínguez and Cejudo, 2021</xref>). The role for ppGpp signaling in the prevention of ROS overaccumulation and tissue death during nitrogen limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) is therefore very likely related to its role in downregulating photosynthetic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). As part of this process, ppGpp signaling alters the stoichiometry of PSII components, reducing excitation pressure on PSII and thus electron flow in the photosynthetic chain. Note that the reduced Rubisco levels we observe under nitrogen limitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>) suggest that PSI may be acceptor side limited due to reduced activity of the Calvin–Benson cycle, which could lead to increased superoxide formation by reduction of molecular oxygen at PSI. Indeed, others have proposed that the reduction in levels of active PSII RC during photoinhibition can protect PSI against overexcitation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tikkanen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the ppGpp-mediated alteration of PSII architecture appears to be independent of the global reduction in photosynthetic proteins during nitrogen limitation: photosynthetic proteins are downregulated in low ppGpp plants without major alterations in PSII activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C, D</xref>). On the basis of these results, we suggest that one of the functions of ppGpp signaling may therefore be to optimize nitrogen remobilization, notably via the degradation of the most abundant leaf protein Rubisco, modulating at the same time the photosynthetic machinery to prevent overexcitation and photodamage. The most straightforward explanation based on the evidence presented here is that ppGpp acts through a general and coordinated downregulation of chloroplast gene expression, and further evidence would be needed to determine whether ppGpp is also able to play a more specific role in remodeling photosynthesis.</p><p>We demonstrate a new physiological role for ppGpp signaling and offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its action. The wide range of stresses known to induce ppGpp accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>) and the association between stress and overexcitation of the photosynthetic electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bechtold and Field, 2018</xref>), together suggest that ppGpp signaling may allow plants to anticipate and acclimate to harsh environmental conditions that would otherwise lead to overexcitation of the photosynthetic machinery and oxidative stress. At the same time, our work also highlights important questions about ppGpp function that are not yet fully answered: how does nitrogen limitation activate ppGpp signaling? Does ppGpp target a single process (transcription) or several? and Does ppGpp signaling interact with known photoprotective pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinnola and Bassi, 2018</xref>;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sujith Puthiyaveetil (Reviewer #3); Alizée Malnoë (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript entitled &quot;A ppGpp-mediated brake on photosynthesis is required for acclimation to nitrogen limitation in Arabidopsis &quot; by Romand et al. described ppGpp accumulation is necessary for acclimation to nitrogen starvation in a model plant Arabidopsis. The authors revealed that ppGpp accumulation leads to remodeling the photosynthetic electron transport chain to downregulate photosynthetic activity. It seems to be reasonable that the ppGpp signal works for protecting plant cells from oxidative stress. Further, the authors also clarified that ppGpp accumulation affects patterns of chloroplast gene expression during nitrogen starvation. The crucial findings based on their hard work should be highly appreciated.</p><p>On the other hand, the authors left not a few points to be amended in Materials and methods section. Thereby the manuscript cannot be accepted at present.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Lines 189-194. The attempt to distinguish between in vivo and in vitro nature of the measurements is not clear. Please note Fv/Fm is an in vivo measurement whether it is done on plants grown on plates or quarts sand.</p><p>2. Line 211. &quot;energetic pressure&quot; =&gt; &quot;excitation pressure&quot;.</p><p>3. The protein levels in Figure 3 may reflect a decrease in de novo protein synthesis as wells as an increased degradation. Please qualify the discussion as such.</p><p>4. Lines 375-388. References to Figure 5- supplement 1 and 2 do not correspond with the actual names of Figure 5 supplements. Please rename/rephrase the supplement figure legends or main text.</p><p>5. Line 498. What is the data in support of the increase in antenna to RC transcript ratio? In wild type both RC and antenna transcript levels decrease under nitrogen deficiency.</p><p>6. Please describe the genotype of the quadruple mutant in methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The reason(s) for comparing 8-day-old, non-stressed plants to 12-day-old, stressed plants throughout most of the article is not provided in the text. Please explain this choice.</p><p>– Page 8, Figure 2, panels A and D (also for figure supplement 1 page 39): the Fv/Fm parameter, while informative, can cover several different mechanisms (see Malnoë, Environmental and Experimental Botany, 2018). Please provide Fo and Fm values at least in the source files for these figures. Are the data presented measured on whole seedlings (i.e. including cotyledons)? It would be preferable to separate the data on true leaves from the cotyledons as the metabolism from these two tissue types is vastly different.</p><p>– Line 293, energetic uncoupling could be an indirect effect due to PsbA degradation under -N when ppGpp present. The lower Fv/Fm being due to a high Fo from disconnected antenna, rather than due to damaged centers displaying a high Fo (and low Fm due to qI). Revise statement page 21, lane 499 accordingly. Is the data in Fig3D normalized? Line 508-513, another possibility is that altered ppGpp/GTP ratio affects turnover of D1 (see Kato et al. Plant Physiology, 2018 Vol. 178, pp. 596-611). We would therefore suggest to temper down the statement line 525 that &quot;ppGpp signalling triggers the controlled photoinhibition of PSII&quot; and line 528 &quot;functions as a photoprotective mechanism&quot;. An alternative explanation could be that ppGpp signaling is to enable scavenging of N, and that accumulation of photosynthetic complexes in -N causing imbalance and ROS is an indirect consequence of low ppGpp. Also provide discussion in that section about statement line 98 that there is a higher new leaf initiation rate in low ppGpp lines.</p><p>– Page 12, line 300: what about RNA-seq data from the rsh1-1 mutant? It seems an important control that would confirm claim that ppGpp downregulates chloroplast gene expression (page 15, line 348).</p><p>­ – Line 320, it is stated that with less ppGpp, nuclear encoded genes for photosynthesis/chloroplast activity are downregulated, yet protein amount are the same, could you discuss turnover rate being possibly slower? Page 15, line 354, &quot;ppGpp acts specifically within the chloroplast&quot; but then how do you explain the lower nuclear encoded genes expression when there is less ppGpp?</p><p>– The overexpressor line &quot;OX:RSH1&quot; is under the 35S promoter which has been shown to possibly yield to silencing (see Grefen et al. Plant Journal, 2010 Vol. 64, pp. 355-365). Have you confirmed the higher expression of RSH1 in your various experiments? A lower expression may explain the higher ppGpp levels than expected shown in Figure 1F and discussed line 453.</p><p>– Page 18, line 403: explain &quot;relaxed&quot;, these bacterial mutants were lacking ppGpp, correct and this work showed that a role for ppGpp inhibiting RNA synthesis? Please provide more explanation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A ppGpp-mediated brake on photosynthesis is required for acclimation to nitrogen limitation in Arabidopsis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been reviewed by original reviewers. They judge that the manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before publication. The comments are reliable, so that we further request you to revise the manuscript by taking into account the editor's and the reviewers' comments, which are outlined below:<italic>Editor:</italic></p><p>The title of the journal should provide a clear indication of the biological system and it should avoid specialist abbreviations and acronyms where possible. Thus, the editor judgeds that use of &quot;ppGpp&quot; needs to be avoided in the title, and ask the authors to change the title such as &quot;A bacterial signaling molecule-mediated brake~&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>The authors have provided a detailed response to my comments and have addressed most of my concerns by revising the manuscript. The authors now note, as a reviewer suggested, that the low Fv/Fm values of the ppGpp over accumulator is due to a high Fo values. Given this, the authors have considerably toned down their argument about ppGpp being an active remodeler of PSII functional assembly, but they still allude to this possibility elsewhere (lines 562-570). I don't protest this hugely but there seems to be a unanimous feeling among the three reviewers that the authors also mention (after line 570) an alternate hypothesis that the decreased PSII activity could simply be a consequence of a coordinated decrease in plastid protein synthesis by ppGpp rather than active regulation of PSII function by ppGpp. A similar downregulation of activity may be apparent for PSI but of course they haven't measured it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75041.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Figure 5C does not support this statement. The correct figure would be Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and this actually shows the inverse- the nucleus (antenna) transcript levels decrease more on average than the chloroplast transcripts during nitrogen deficiency for PSII and the other complexes.

Eight day-old non stressed plants were chosen as a control because they are at a similar developmental stage (size, leaf number). The +N control is used principally to show that under normal growth conditions there is little or no difference between the lines for the phenotypes tested.

This is consistent with our other data showing that there are disconnected antennas, and we previously noted it as an effect of ppGpp overaccumulation in Sugliani et al. 2016. We now provide the Fo and Fm values in the source data, and indicate that in the text that an Fo rise is behind the drop in Fv/Fm.</p><p>Data are presented on a whole seedling basis (as shown in Figure 2B). You will note that there are indeed differences in the responses of true leaves and cotyledons. At the same time our experiments on mature plants show that the ppGpp-mediated Fv/Fm response to nitrogen deficiency is not specific to seedlings (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We think that separating out and resolving these differences would be interesting and could reveal tissue specific roles for ppGpp signalling, however we think that this is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 293, energetic uncoupling could be an indirect effect due to PsbA degradation under -N when ppGpp present.

We have modified the discussion to make this point clearer. Below we provide a rationale for our position.</p><p>During nitrogen deficiency the plant requires nitrogen, but also experiences a strong decrease in demand for the products of photosynthesis (energy and sugar) because growth is arrested. Therefore, in addition to remobilising nitrogen the plant must also downsize the photosynthetic machinery to avoid overexcitation. The two needs can be met at the same time because downsizing the photosynthetic machinery will remobilise nitrogen. The photosynthetic chain must be downsized in a controlled manner and with coordination between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes to avoid ROS overaccumulation. This could occur by simply reducing but preserving the same functioning of the whole chain. However, our results show that this is not the case: PSII architecture changes (as measured by 77K (Figure 3D), chlorophyll (Figure 3C), immunoblot (Figure 3A/B) and also Fv/Fm which drops from the early stages of nitrogen deprivation (day 8) to the last moments when chlorophyll can still be easily detected (day 16, Figure 2D)), and we also see differences in the rate of loss of different photosynthetic proteins in a manner that is not proportional to their normal half-lives (e.g. RBCL is lost rapidly and then PetA and LHCB1 only at a late stage). These changes are not necessary for downsizing the photosynthetic chain alone, and indeed it appears that downsizing can occur when ppGpp signalling is defective (Figure 3A). We therefore think that they are representative of finely regulated changes in the photosynthetic chain that together promote energy dissipation/reduced electron flow and prevent ROS accumulation, and can therefore be considered photoprotective. It is interesting to speculate about why the plant does not remobilise more rapidly to re-activate growth- perhaps it allows a certain regulatory flexibility permitting the plant to liberate some nitrogen in the early stages of starvation without committing to the irreversible destruction of the photosynthetic machinery before it is really necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also provide discussion in that section about statement line 98 that there is a higher new leaf initiation rate in low ppGpp lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We noted the leaf initiation phenotype in the results because it was a striking ppGpp-dependent phenotype. We have added a sentence of interpretation in the Results section. At this point we will not discuss this phenotype in the discussion because we can offer only vague speculation on its cause, and this would risk unfocussing the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 12, line 300: what about RNA-seq data from the rsh1-1 mutant?

However, we do not think that this is essential because previous studies from our team and others support the claim the ppGpp is capable of downregulating chloroplast gene expression in plants:</p><p>Sugliani et al. 2016- Quantification of transcription using 4SU RNA labelling</p><p>Yamburenko et al. 2015- Nuclear run on using chloroplast extracts.</p><p>The studies of Maekawa et al. 2015, Sugliani et al., 2016 and Ono et al., 2020 also show that ppGpp affects the abundance of chloroplast transcripts in Arabidopsis by RT qPCR. Our study extends on these findings by showing that the effect of ppGpp is global, and that it occurs under physiological conditions (i.e. not only during an artificial increase of ppGpp).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>­ – Line 320, it is stated that with less ppGpp, nuclear encoded genes for photosynthesis/chloroplast activity are downregulated, yet protein amount are the same, could you discuss turnover rate being possibly slower?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is a good point, and we now draw attention to the possibility in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 15, line 354, “ppGpp acts specifically within the chloroplast” but then how do you explain the lower nuclear encoded genes expression when there is less ppGpp?</p></disp-quote><p>Here we mean that the direct mechanistic targets of ppGpp are within the chloroplast. The alteration in nuclear gene expression is likely to be linked to signalling between the chloroplast and the nucleus. Indeed, it is known that inhibition of chloroplast gene expression can activate retrograde signalling (e.g. see Wu et al. 2019, https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.00421).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The overexpressor line “OX:RSH1” is under the 35S promoter which has been shown to possibly yield to silencing (see Grefen et al.

A lower expression may explain the higher ppGpp levels than expected shown in Figure 1F and discussed line 453.</p></disp-quote><p>The RSH1 overexpression line we use (OX:RSH1 10.4) gives stable and robust overexpression across multiple generations. Seed from the same generation (T4) was used in all experiments reported here, and the RNAseq data also confirm overexpression of RSH1 (Figure 4, source data 1). In addition silencing of OX:RSH1 causes co-suppression of the endogenous <italic>RSH1</italic> gene, and so silenced have an easily identifiable <italic>rsh1</italic> mutant phenotype (like <italic>rsh1-1</italic>). These OX:RSH1 co-suppression lines were reported in Sugliani et al. 2016.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Page 18, line 403: explain “relaxed”, these bacterial mutants were lacking ppGpp, correct and this work showed that a role for ppGpp inhibiting RNA synthesis?

Relaxed mutants no longer show activation of the stringent response and do not accumulate ppGpp. The first bacterial RSH enzyme RelA (Relaxed A) was identified and cloned using one of these mutants.
