Surfactant deficiency results in rapid and uncontrolled bacterial growth in both macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. In contrast, under normal surfactant levels, a significant fraction of intracellular bacteria are non-growing. The surfactant-deficient phenotype is rescued by exogenous addition of surfactant replacement formulations, which have no effect on bacterial viability in the absence of host cells. Surfactant partially removes virulence-associated lipids and proteins from the bacterial cell surface. Consistent with this mechanism, the attenuation of bacteria lacking the ESX-1 secretion system is independent of surfactant levels. These findings may partly explain why smokers and elderly persons with compromised surfactant function are at increased risk of developing active tuberculosis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tuberculosis is a contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Droplets in the air carry these bacteria deep into the lungs, where they cling onto and infect lung cells. Only small droplets, holding one or two bacteria, can reach the right cells, which means that just a couple of bacterial cells can trigger an infection. But people respond differently to the bacteria: some develop active and fatal forms of tuberculosis, while many show no signs of infection. With no effective tuberculosis vaccine for adults, understanding why individuals respond differently to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> may help develop treatments.</p><p>Different responses to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> may stem from the earliest stages of infection, but these stages are difficult to study. For one thing, tracking the movements of the few bacterial cells that initiate infection is tricky. For another, studying the molecules, called ‘surfactants’, that the lungs produce to protect themselves from tuberculosis can prove difficult because these molecules are necessary for the lungs to inflate and deflate normally. Normally, the role of a molecule can be studied by genetically modifying an animal so it does not produce the molecule in question, which provides information as to its potential roles. Unfortunately, due to the role of surfactants in normal breathing, animals lacking them die. Therefore, to reveal the role of some of surfactants in tuberculosis, Thacker et al. used ‘lung-on-chip’ technology. The ‘chip’ (a transparent device made of a polymer compatible with biological tissues) is coated with layers of cells and has channels to simulate air and blood flow.</p><p>To see what effects surfactants have on <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacteria, Thacker et al. altered the levels of surfactants produced by the cells on the lung-on-chip device. Two types of mouse cells were grown on the chip: lung cells and immune cells. When cells lacked surfactants, bacteria grew rapidly on both lung and immune cells, but when surfactants were present bacteria grew much slower on both cell types, or did not grow at all. Further probing showed that the surfactants pulled out proteins and fats on the surface of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> that help the bacteria to infect their host, highlighting the protective role of surfactants in tuberculosis.</p><p>These findings lay the foundations for a system to study respiratory infections without using animals. This will allow scientists to study the early stages of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, which is crucial for finding ways to manage tuberculosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organ-on-chip</kwd><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interactions</kwd><kwd>time-lapse microscopy</kwd><kwd>pulmonary surfactant</kwd><kwd>disease models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000231/2016-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thacker</surname><given-names>Vivek V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>921-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thacker</surname><given-names>Vivek V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_176397</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKinney</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Time-lapse imaging and the modular recreation of host physiology reveal that alveolar epithelial cells, potential permissive infection sites for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, can restrict early bacterial growth via surfactant secretion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early tuberculosis (TB), a respiratory infection caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is strongly influenced by host physiology; due to the small diameter of respiratory bronchioles only the smallest aerosol droplets containing one to two bacilli are successfully transported to the alveolar space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma and Darquenne, 2011</xref>), and the ‘first contact’ with a naive host is by default a single-cell interaction between an Mtb bacillus and a host cell.

Intracellular bacterial growth is slower in macrophages compared to ATs under NS conditions but growth rates in both cell types are equivalent under DS conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).

We therefore asked whether uncontrolled intracellular replication of Mtb in LoCs reconstituted with DS ATs could be rescued by exogenous addition of surfactant. A 1% solution of Curosurf, a pulmonary surfactant formulation comprising dipalmitoylphospatidylcholine (DPPC) and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, was used to treat either the Mtb or the DS LoC prior to infection. Both procedures attenuated intracellular Mtb growth and generated a non-growing fraction similar in magnitude to infected NS LoCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Curosurf treatment affects neither Mtb viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) nor replication in vitro in the absence of host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>) suggesting that surfactant protects by altering the interaction of Mtb with host cells rather than by any direct effect on bacterial physiology. We conclude that uncontrolled intracellular growth of Mtb in DS LoCs is largely attributable to reduced surfactant secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Attenuation of an ESX-1-deficient strain of Mtb is independent of surfactant</title><p>We examined whether Mtb mutants that were previously shown to be attenuated in the mouse model of TB are also attenuated in the LoC model and whether surfactant plays a role in attenuation.

We therefore hypothesized that an additional mechanism of surfactant-dependent protection could be the removal of virulence-associated lipids from the Mtb cell surface. Consistent with this idea, microscopic examination of Mtb exposed to fluorescently labeled Curosurf with a fluorescent analogue of DPPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) revealed that surfactant readily coated the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), albeit heterogeneously (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).

Previous work has revealed the specific roles of hydrophilic SP-A and SP-D proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferguson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pasula et al., 1997</xref>) in altering the uptake and intracellular processing of Mtb in macrophages. Surfactant hydrolase enzymes within the alveolar lining fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scordo et al., 2017</xref> have also been shown to release Mtb cell wall fragments as well as alter Mtb growth in ATs. Together, these studies show that, for the most part, specific components of surfactant can suppress intracellular Mtb growth. However, surfactant lipids have also been reported to upregulate Mtb growth via increased expression of CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dodd et al., 2016</xref>), and the alveolar lining fluid from some patients has also been shown to increase intracellular replication in epithelial cells and exacerbate infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scordo et al., 2019</xref>). However, all these studies focused on the role of specific components of surfactant and none of these studies probed the role of endogenous surfactant expression in co-cultures maintained at the ALI. In contrast, in the LoC model of early TB presented here, secretion of native surfactant by ATs at an ALI can be modulated. This physiological perturbation, which cannot be achieved in animal models due to the lethality of surfactant deficiency, provides a comprehensive view of the role of ATs in early TB and is an important advance over previous co-culture models for TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bermudez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bielecka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parasa et al., 2014</xref>). The unexpectedly rapid and uncontrolled intracellular growth of Mtb at the ALI in the absence of surfactant has not been reported previously in simpler in vitro models of host cell infection. Under NS conditions, we identified a substantial non-growing fraction of intracellular Mtb in both ATs and macrophages, which may be equivalent to the ‘non-growing but metabolically active’ (NGMA) populations previously observed in the lungs of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manina et al., 2015</xref>). These examples underscore some of the advantages of the LoC model, which provides a more faithful mimesis of the complex in vivo environment compared to conventional in vitro models.</p><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that pulmonary surfactant plays an important role in host innate immunity during early Mtb infection, which may partly explain why individuals with defective surfactant function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Finley and Ladman, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Subramaniam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moliva et al., 2019</xref>) also show an increased risk of developing active TB. We also report that ATs are more permissive to Mtb growth than macrophages under NS (but not DS) conditions. Infection of ATs is not an artefact of the LoC model, as we also identified infected ATs in the lungs of aerosol-infected mice using a sensitive microscopy-based approach, which might be more discriminating than FACS-based approaches used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). Alveolar macrophages in the lung have been shown to be sessile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Westphalen et al., 2014</xref>), and so the higher incidence of AT infection in the LoC model is probably due to differences in the method of Mtb inoculation. This in turn suggests a deeper link between the airway and alveolar geometries that determine aerosol deposition in the lungs (which are not captured in the LoC model but could be addressed with 3D bioprinted models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigoryan et al., 2019</xref>]) and resident lung immunity. Given the very low inoculum size in human Mtb (most infected individuals harbor just one primary lesion originating from a single bacillus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mckinney et al., 1998</xref>), we speculate that first contact with an AT, albeit much rarer in vivo could potentially lead to a more aggressive infection. This could provide one explanation for the observation that the proportion of exposed individuals who develop clinical TB is low.</p><p>Time-lapse imaging at an ALI in the LoC infection model directly quantifies bacterial growth rates with a spatiotemporal resolution that is unachievable using indirect measurements of bacterial growth rates in mouse models of TB (e.g. plating tissue homogenates to measure colony-forming units [CFU]). The deliberate choice to use murine over human cells allows us to add macrophages to the chip from a mouse line that constitutively expresses GFP, and provides unambiguous identification of these cells over multiple days which would not be possible with CellTracker and other fluorescent dyes. It also enables us to benchmark the model with previous reports from the mouse model for TB. For example, average growth rates for wild-type Mtb under NS conditions are in good agreement with net Mtb growth rates measured using a plasmid-loss assay in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gill et al., 2009</xref>). However, our microscopy-based approach also reveals the population distribution of growth rates, which highlights that even under NS conditions, a small proportion of cells show robust intracellular Mtb growth, and that robust and attenuated Mtb growth can occur in close proximity to each other on-chip. These observations reinforce an important role for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in host-Mtb outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). The growth characteristics of ESX-1-deficient Mtb in our LoC model are also in agreement with experiments from animal models, further validating the LoC model.</p><p>Exogenous addition of Curosurf, a surfactant replacement formulation of phospholipids and hydrophobic proteins, rescues the effects of surfactant deficiency on mycobacterial growth to a large extent. Phospholipids are the main component of native surfactant, and lipid recycling is a key function of type II ATs and alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olmeda et al., 2017</xref>). The two-way interaction of surfactant with the bacterial cell surface (surfactant removes virulence-associated Mtb surface lipids and proteins, and surfactant lipids coat the Mtb surface) may alter how host cells take up these bacteria, or how they are processed after uptake. More generally, surfactant phospholipids have been shown to have antiviral properties and can serve as a potent adjuvant for antiviral vaccines either on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimoto et al., 2013</xref>) or as a medium for delivery of immune-stimulating molecules to ATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings suggest a potential role for pulmonary surfactant replacement formulations in host-directed therapies against TB. These insights were made possible by use of an organ-on-chip system that reproduces host physiology in a modular and tuneable fashion, which is frequently impossible to achieve in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 primary alveolar epithelial cells</td><td valign="top">Cell Biologics</td><td valign="top">Cat#: C57-6053</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6 primary lung microvascular endothelial cells</td><td valign="top">Cell Biologics</td><td valign="top">Cat#: C57-6011</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Epithelial cell culture medium with kit</td><td valign="top">Cell Biologics</td><td valign="top">Cat#: M6621</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Endothelial cell culture medium with kit</td><td valign="top">Cell Biologics</td><td valign="top">Cat#: M1168</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus, C57BL6</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tg(act-EGFP) 131Osb/LeySopJ</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 006567; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006567">IMSR_JAX:006567</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Female, 6–8 weeks old</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Murine recombinant M-CSF</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisherScientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: PMC2044</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Superscript IV First Strand Synthesis System</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 18091050</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Sybr Green PCR Master Mix</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 4334973</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mouse proSPC (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab40879; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_777473">AB_777473</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mouse Podoplanin-488 (Syrian Hamster monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 53-5381-82; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1106990">AB_1106990</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-mouse CD45-647 (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">BioLegend</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 103124; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_493533">AB_493533</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Lung dissociation kit - mouse</td><td valign="top">Miltenyi Biotec</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 130-095-927</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Fibronectin from human plasma</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#: F1056</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">Native Collagen, Bovine dermis</td><td valign="top">AteloCell</td><td valign="top">Cat#: IAC-50</td><td valign="top">5 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">FIJI</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primary C57BL/6 alveolar epithelial cells (ATs) and lung microvascular endothelial cells were obtained from Cell Biologics, USA, and were certified mycoplasma negative by the supplier.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) coating was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Chips were activated using ER-1 solution (Emulate) dissolved in ER-2 solution at 0.5 mg/ml (Emulate) and exposed for 20 min under UV light. The chip was then rinsed with coating solution and exposed again to UV light for a further 20 min. Chips were then washed thoroughly with PBS before incubating with an ECM solution of 150 μg/ml bovine collagen type I (AteloCell, Japan) and 30 μg/ml fibronectin from human plasma (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS buffered with 15 mM HEPES solution (Gibco) for 1–2 hr at 37°C. If not used directly, coated chips were stored at 4°C and pre-activated before use by incubation for 30 min with the same ECM solution at 37°C. Endothelial cells were cultured overnight at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in T-75 cell culture flasks, detached with 0.05% Trypsin, concentrated to 5–10 million cells/ml, and seeded on the bottom face of the PDMS membrane. The chip was then incubated for a short period at 37°C to allow the endothelial cells to spread and subsequently seeded with ATs. Freshly isolated ATs were seeded directly from cryopreserved vials received from the supplier, whereas DS LoCs were seeded from cells cultured overnight at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in both cases at a concentration of 1–2 million cells/ml. The chip was incubated overnight with complete epithelial and endothelial media in the epithelial and endothelial channels, respectively, under static conditions.

The epithelial face was incubated with epithelial base medium with 200 nM dexamethasone (Sigma Aldrich) without FBS supplementation to promote tight junction formation and surfactant expression as reported in previous LoC studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hassell et al., 2017</xref>). Flow was maintained over 2–3 days with daily replacement of the medium on the epithelial face (with dexamethasone supplementation). At the end of this period, GFP-expressing macrophages differentiated for 7 days in M-CSF (described above) were detached from the petri dish using 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Sigma Aldrich) in PBS at 4°C, centrifuged at 300 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and resuspended in a small volume of epithelial cell media without dexamethasone. This solution containing macrophages was introduced onto the epithelial face and incubated for 30 min at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to allow macrophages to attach to the epithelial cells. Medium on the epithelial face was then removed and the chip was maintained overnight at the ALI. Chips that successfully maintained the ALI overnight were transferred to the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility for Mtb infection.

F-actin on both the epithelial and endothelial face was stained using Sir-Actin dye (Spherochrome) at 1 μM for 30 min concurrently with Hoechst staining, as described above.

A 1 ml aliquot of a culture of Mtb grown to exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub>0.3–0.5) was centrifuged at 5000 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at room temperature, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of epithelial cell media without FBS. A single-cell suspension was generated via filtration through a 5-μm syringe filter (Millipore). The single-cell suspension was diluted 100-fold in epithelial media and 30 μl was added to the epithelial channel of the LoC. The infectious dose was measured by plating serial dilutions of the single-cell suspension on 7H11 plates and counting CFU after 3–4 weeks of incubation at 37°C and varied between 200 and 800 Mtb bacilli. The chip was incubated for 2–3 hr at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to allow Mtb infection of cells on the epithelial face, after which the solution on the epithelial face was withdrawn. The proportion of bacteria that remained on the chip was estimated by plating serial dilutions of the withdrawn solution on 7H11 plates and counting CFU after 3–4 weeks of incubation at 37°C. The epithelial face was returned to ALI and the inlets of the infected chip were sealed with solid pins as a safety precaution for time-lapse microscopy imaging in the BSL-3 facility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Time-lapse microscopy of the Mtb-infected LoC</title><p>The LoC was placed in a microscope stage-top incubator and mounted on the stage of a widefield Nikon Ti-2 microscope. The stage-top incubator was connected to a gas mixer (Okolab) to maintain 5% CO<sub>2</sub> throughout the imaging period. Flow of medium through the vascular channel was maintained throughout this period via the use of a syringe pump. The chip was imaged using a long working distance 20x phase-contrast objective (NA = 0.75, Ph2, Nikon) at 1.5 hr or 2 hr imaging intervals. The epithelial face of the chip (where the refractive index differences were highest due to the ALI) was maintained in focus using the Nikon Perfect Focus System. At each timepoint, a Z-stack of 9–10 images with an axial spacing of 10 μm was taken series for a series of fields of view along the length of the chip to account for the dynamic 3D movement of macrophages between both faces, as well as drift in focus over time. Each field of view was ~660 × 600 μm<sup>2</sup>. Using a Sola SE II light source (Lumencor, USA), macrophages and Mtb were identified through fluorescence emission in the green (macrophages) and red (Mtb) channels using GFPHQ and mcherryHQ 32 mm dichroic filters, respectively. Phase-contrast images were also captured; the poor quality of these images due to the refractive index differences at the ALI serves as a continuous verification that ALI is maintained. All images were captured with an EMCCD camera (iXON Ultra 888, Andor) cooled to −65°C, with an EM gain setting of 300 to allow the sample to be illuminated with a low intensity of incident light in all fluorescent channels with reduced photodamage. Co-localization of the green and red fluorescence signals over a time course was identified as consistent with macrophage infection. Bacteria that did not co-localize with macrophages over time were assumed to infect ATs, which was verified by subsequent immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data analysis of intracellular Mtb growth</title><p>Images were visualized using FIJI. Macrophage and AT infections from each field of view were visually curated by assessing the co-localization of fluorescent signals over time. Smaller stacks of one to two microcolonies were assembled. Custom-written software in MATLAB was used to measure the total fluorescence intensity of each intracellular bacterial microcolony which used the nestedSortStruct algorithm for MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughley, 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hugheylab/nestedSortStruct">https://github.com/hugheylab/nestedSortStruct</ext-link>) written by the Hughey lab. Briefly, at each timepoint, the Z-stack with the highest intensity in the fluorescence channel was identified; this image was then segmented to identify the bacterial microcolony; total fluorescence was measured by summing the intensity of all the pixels in this region after subtracting a value for each pixel that represented the average background fluorescence. We chose to measure the total fluorescence intensity because it accounts for both bacterial growth and dilution of the fluorescent protein due to growth (which is slow in a slow-growing bacterium like Mtb). We were unable to measure microcolony volumes accurately using widefield imaging due to poor axial resolution caused by large refractive index differences at the ALI; therefore, we obtained this value from only the Z stack with the highest intensity. Statistical analysis was performed using Origin 9.2 (OriginLabs), and p-values were calculated using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA test, with the null hypothesis that the medians of each population were equal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Visualization of confocal images</title><p>Z-stacks from confocal images were visualized using ImageJ, 3D projection views and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref> were made using the ClearVolume plugin in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Royer et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Analysis of lamellar body volume</title><p>Custom written software in MATLAB was used to segment lamellar bodies in each slice of the Z-stack, measure area and intensity, and collate the mean intensity and volume over multiple slices, along the lines of the analysis of intracellular bacterial growth described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Simulations of in vivo infections</title><p>Growth rate datasets for wild-type and ESX-1-deficient strains of Mtb in NS and DS LoC conditions were fitted with a non-parametric Kernel Smoothed distribution.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael U Shiloh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Thacker et al. describes the use of lung-on-a-chip microfluidic devices to study early interactions during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection under conditions meant to mimic the alveolar environment in vivo. The authors use time-lapse microscopy to study host cell-Mtb interactions in macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells and the impact of surfactant on Mtb infection. This study suggests that organ-on-a-chip systems might be able to reproduce elements of host-microbe physiology during infection, which is difficult to reproduce ex vivo using single cells, air-liquid interface, organoids or organ explants.</p><p>This is an exciting approach which has the potential to expand the ability to study host-pathogen interactions. However, the reviewers all agree that the manuscript requires a major revision and additional data. Specifically, the manuscript requires improvement in the cell identification/classification, co-localization of Mtb with epithelial cells and macrophages, and distinction between intracellular and extracellular growth in order for the authors to provide convincing data to support their interpretations and conclusions.</p><p>While the reviewers recognize that it is challenging to use live cell imaging in this system, much of the data of the paper, such as comparisons between infection of AECs and macrophages, rests on the ability to determine the precise localization of bacteria. However, neither AECs nor macrophages are specifically identified with high enough resolution to give confidence that the Mtb are associated with those cells specifically, and more importantly, that the bacteria are growing intracellularly rather than extracellularly. Many of the images are of such low resolution that only tiny dots of bacteria are observed.</p><p>In addition, the findings of attenuated growth of Mtb after exposure to surfactant in macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells, changes in the Mtb cell wall after exposure to surfactant, and the finding that exposure to surfactant does not alter the extracellular viability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> have been reported by others using other in vitro models and should be discussed in manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Controls for the Model: What quality control is done for each experiment to determine the ratio of type I and type II AECs in each chip set up for each experiment? This is of particular importance because the authors do not show any images where they stain for both type I and type II AECs in the same chip. Do the authors have images stained for both type of cells to illustrate the composition of each chip? After Figure 1, what staining is done to confirm the DS cells decrease proSPC expression for each experiment? As this is a new model, better images showing well-defined cells and quantification of the number of alveolar epithelial cells type I and II, number of macrophages, numbers of endothelial cells, bacteria per cell, etc. would be helpful to evaluate the model. This applies particularly to Figures 1, 2 and Figure 3 supplement.</p><p>2) Cell Identification: The authors focus on the difference in surfactant gene expression in the newly isolated AECs (NS) versus in vitro passaged AECs (DS), but they also observe that aqp5 is downregulated. In fact, the data support that the cells are de-differentiating during passage in culture, which will have multiple effects on the cells, not just surfactant production. This needs to be further studied in detail to ensure that this cell is not an artifact produced by multi-passaging in vitro. After loss of those markers, how do the authors confirm they still have type I and type II AECs in their cultures? Is there microscopy data with other markers that are retained in the AECs? The authors should use several AT-IIs and AT-Is markers to be certain that the DS cell monolayers indeed still are AECs. Surfactant protein C, although used as a marker for AT-IIs, is a soluble protein that has been shown to interact with many cells within a cellular system. A correlation between SPTPC and AQP5 expression over time is also necessary as points out the differentiation of AT-IIs to AT-Is, a key feature of the role of AT-IIs as progenitors of AT-Is.</p><p>3) Analysis of Mtb Infection and Intracellular versus Extracellular Infection: The authors never stain for type I or type II AECs after infection and make the conclusion that the bacteria are within type II cells based on the absence of macrophage staining. However, the bacteria may not even be inside a cell, or the AECs could be dying during infection. On a related note, there are no data presented that show that type I cells are not infected in the lung on chip system with Mtb. Thus, higher resolution images, with clear colocalization and z-stacks, would increase the confidence in the results. The images and analysis provided do not distinguish between extracellular and intracellular growth. Mtb can form micro-colonies on the cell surface of alveolar epithelial cells and thus, the intracellular growth that they are reporting could be extracellular growth. The authors could treat the system with an antibiotic to kill extracellular Mtb attached to the alveolar epithelial cell surface. Also, can the authors discern between Mtb that are not growing vs. Mtb that are dead?</p><p>4) Studies with the Mtb Mutants: The data arguing for attenuation of Esx-1 mutant Mtb in AECs and macrophages are not strong, and the authors do not actually make a direct statistical comparison between appropriate groups (i.e. AEC NS WT vs Esx-1, or Mac NS WT vs Esx-1). For example, it appears that the mean/median growth rate of WT Mtb in macrophages is ~0.25hr-1, which appears roughly the same for Esx-1 mutant Mtb in the same cells. There may be a difference under DS conditions, but since the comparisons are not made directly it is impossible to know. The authors state that their data with the Esx1 mutant &quot;demonstrates that ESX-1 secretion is necessary for rapid intracellular growth in the absence of surfactant, consistent with the hypothesis that surfactant may attenuate Mtb growth by depleting ESX-1 components on the bacterial cell surface&quot;. This seems like quite a jump in interpretation of the data since the Esx1 mutant is likely attenuated for many reasons, and this attenuation is dominant to any effect that surfactant is having. The authors also show that PDIM levels are not different in the presence or absence of surfactant, and this is an Esx1 dependent lipid.</p><p>What is the purpose for including the icl1/icl2 mutant? This experiment is also not included in the data quantification.</p><p>5) Discussion of Previously Published Data: Similar alterations on the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> cell wall and release of cell wall components to the milieu when exposed to physiological concentrations of human lung surfactant have been already described. The same is applicable to the slower replication rate in ATs (an intracellular killing in macrophages) after <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> exposure to human lung surfactant. Although two different systems, authors need to contrast their findings with these reported ones in their discussion. In addition, it is not clear how many times this was performed. Statistics are mentioned on the figure legends, but there are not stats in the figure.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A lung-on-chip model reveals an essential role for alveolar epithelial cells in controlling bacterial growth in early TB&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Wendy Garrett (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed with text edits before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Similar to the changes made in the Results section, the authors should change the title from “early tuberculosis” to “early <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection”.</p><p>2) The authors repeatedly refer to bacteria as intracellular, including statements like &quot;which provides strong indirect evidence that Mtb growth on-chip must be intracellular&quot;. While a few confocal images are provided to highlight some intracellular bacteria, it is mostly an assumption that the bacteria are intracellular, and it would be more appropriate to be conservative in the interpretation and wording used in the manuscript.</p><p>3) The attenuation of the Esx-1 mutant is overstated. Specifically, the authors write &quot;Macrophages are less permissive than ATs for intracellular growth of ESX-1 deficient Mtb under both NS and DS conditions&quot;. However, Figure 4A, which compares WT and Esx-1 deficient Mtb in NS macrophages demonstrates no difference in growth rates. Thus, the Results and Discussion should be revised to reflect this observation.</p><p>4) In Figure 1N, Q: Labeling shows AEC, but should it be AT?</p><p>5) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1: Please explain colors in the figure legends.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59961.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Controls for the Model: What quality control is done for each experiment to determine the ratio of type I and type II AECs in each chip set up for each experiment?

We cannot characterize ATII and ATI for each live-imaging experiment for Mtb infections because the throughput for such a complex model is low and setting up multiple LoCs to a consistent standard requires extensive work. However, we have expanded the characterization of the DS and NS populations in vitro in liquid culture as well as in situ on-chip to be confident that this phenotype is reproducible.</p><p>Characterization of NS and DS ATs: In the revised manuscript, we expanded the list of Type II AT markers in the qRT-PCR characterization to include all surfactant proteins (<italic>Sftpa</italic>, <italic>Sftpb</italic>, <italic>Sftpc</italic>, <italic>Sftpd</italic>). We also included additional type I markers such as Podoplanin (<italic>Pdpn</italic>), and other markers such as Calveolin-1 (<italic>Cav1</italic>) and Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (<italic>Igfbp2</italic>) that have been reported in the literature to be type I AT markers. These data are shown in a new Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Interestingly, we observed that the DS population had reduced expression of type I AT markers that could be linked to function at the air-liquid interface (such as <italic>Aqp5</italic> and <italic>Pdpn</italic>) in comparison to NS cells, but had increased expression of other type I AT markers (<italic>Cav1</italic> and <italic>Ifgbp2</italic>), consistent with an increase in terminally differentiated type I AT cells in the DS population.</p><p>In situ characterization of NS and DS LoCs: In the revised manuscript, we have also expanded the in situ characterization of the epithelial layer of the LoCs. Since both Pdpn and Aqp5 are membrane proteins, we were unable to visualize them on the same LoC that had been permeabilized for immunostaining for pro-SPC. We therefore imaged multiple, large fields of view via confocal microscopy to quantify the size and volume of lamellar bodies. Z projections are shown in a new panels H and I in Figure 1 and in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. We quantified the number and volume of pro-SPC+ lamellar bodies in an LoC reconstituted with NS and DS ATs, and these new data are included in new panels J and K in Figure 1. We also show that these differences in pro-SPC intensity are retained for 6 days at the air-liquid interface in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Lastly, we also extracted the RNA from the apical channel of one NS and DS LoC and characterized the epithelial cell population via qRT-PCR. (new Figure 1L). This analysis confirmed that the DS LoCs have decreased expression of <italic>Abca3</italic> and some surfactant protein genes. We did not observe differences in expression of type I AT markers or <italic>cxcl15</italic>, a chemokine expressed exclusively by lung epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the primary difference between the NS and DS LoCs is primarily restricted to changes in surfactant production and levels.</p><p>Characterization of cell numbers: In the revised manuscript, we have provided a quantification of cell densities of ATs, endothelial cells, and macrophages on a typical LoC. These new data are included in a new Table 1.</p><p>The description of Figure 1 in the text has been changed in numerous places to account for the additional data in Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2, as well as Figure 1I-L, as discussed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cell Identification: The authors focus on the difference in surfactant gene expression in the newly isolated AECs (NS) versus in vitro passaged AECs (DS), but they also observe that aqp5 is downregulated.

In the revised manuscript, we have characterized both freshly isolated ATs obtained directly from Cell Biologics and the in vitro passaged ATs with an expanded panel of type II and type I AT markers via qRT-PCR. The new data for this are included in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. This shows that passage lowers expression of type II markers linked to surfactant production and secretion as well as type I AT membrane proteins, but increases expression of genes such as <italic>Cav1</italic> and <italic>Igfbp2</italic> that are reported to be expressed in terminally differentiated type I ATs. We therefore believe that these results are consistent with the in vitro type II to type I differentiation and subsequent proliferation of type I ATs. In contrast, on-chip at the air-liquid interface, expression of type I AT markers was not different between the NS and DS LoCs, whereas the expression of type II AT markers such as <italic>Abca3</italic>, <italic>Sftpa</italic>, and <italic>Sftpc</italic> remained lower (Figure 1L). This correlated well with immunostaining for pro-SPC+ lamellar bodies (Figure 1J-K). We also show that the differences in pro-SPC+ lamellar body size and intensity are maintained for up to 6 days at the air-liquid interface (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Analysis of Mtb Infection and Intracellular versus Extracellular Infection: The authors never stain for type I or type II AECs after infection and make the conclusion that the bacteria are within type II cells based on the absence of macrophage staining. However, the bacteria may not even be inside a cell, or the AECs could be dying during infection. On a related note, there are no data presented that show that type I cells are not infected in the lung on chip system with Mtb. Thus, higher resolution images, with clear colocalization and z-stacks, would increase the confidence in the results.

Mtb can form micro-colonies on the cell surface of alveolar epithelial cells and thus, the intracellular growth that they are reporting could be extracellular growth. The authors could treat the system with an antibiotic to kill extracellular Mtb attached to the alveolar epithelial cell surface. Also, can the authors discern between Mtb that are not growing vs. Mtb that are dead?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewers might have misconstrued our claims from the paper. On-chip we only claim that ATs can be infected; we do not distinguish between infection of Type I or Type II cells because we do not have markers for cell-type characterization during live-cell imaging.</p><p>Intracellular vs extracellular growth and identifying macrophage infections: The use of fluorescently labelled macrophages allowed us to unambiguously identify bacteria that co-localise with macrophages over many hours on-chip. We think it is a fair assumption that these bacteria are internalized by the macrophages as one would expect from phagocytic cells, and in many cases we can see the shape of the bacterial structures change due to corresponding changes in macrophage cell shape. This assumption has also been born out in numerous examples of macrophage infection from confocal imaging of fixed samples. We highlight one example in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and additional examples are also shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-G.</p><p>Verification of infection of AT cells: First, images from confocal microscopy characterization of both uninfected and infected LoCs shows clearly the presence of a confluent layer of epithelial cells on the LoC (Figure 1E-I and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In the case of the infected LoCs, this confluent layer is retained for at least the first four days post infection (Figure 2—figure supplement 3) (and in many cases even later) which corresponds to the period of analysis of growth on chip. Further, the confocal images also demonstrate two clear examples of a intracellular growth in ATs. The first shows small number of bacteria, and the second shows a larger cord that forms intracellularly (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Video 4, 5). This substantially strengthens the argument for our assumption that Mtb that do not co-localise with macrophages are growing intracellularly in ATs.</p><p>Measures taken to avoid analysis of growth of bacteria on cell debris: It is indeed likely that Mtb might grow on cell debris at later timepoints subsequent to host cell death and the formation of Mtb clumps. We therefore begin infection with a single cell suspension, and we have been careful to analyse growth rates only in first contact host cells between 2-4 days post-infection. We have clarified this point in the Results.</p><p>In summary, although we cannot unambiguously rule out the occurrence of extracellular Mtb growth between 2-4 dpi for each datapoint in Figures 2-4, a scan of multiple infected cells via confocal microscopy at 4 dpi revealed only isolated examples where there could be some doubt as to the intracellular nature of growth, and certainly not at a level that would bias the results. We additionally show in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 that axenic Mtb growth in the ALI media (the presumed source of nutrients for extracellular bacteria) is very slow, and certainly could not support the rapid growth we observe in the absence of surfactant. We have included sentences in the text to mention this point. Data for the Δ<italic>icl1</italic>Δ<italic>icl2</italic> mutant (discussed in detail under Essential Revisions point 5) further corroborates this.</p><p>Administration of antibiotics: We do not see how we could administer antibiotics to bacteria growing extracellularly on top of the epithelial cells without disrupting the air-liquid interface, a key feature of the model.</p><p>Classification of non-growing vs dead Mtb: We are not able to clearly distinguish Mtb that are dead in the absence of a reliable live/dead marker; hence, we have restricted ourselves to calling this population “non-growing”. We have added a sentence in the text to make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Studies with the Mtb Mutants: The data arguing for attenuation of Esx-1 mutant Mtb in AECs and macrophages are not strong, and the authors do not actually make a direct statistical comparison between appropriate groups (i.e. AEC NS WT vs Esx-1, or Mac NS WT vs Esx-1). For example, it appears that the mean/median growth rate of WT Mtb in macrophages is ~0.25hr-1, which appears roughly the same for Esx-1 mutant Mtb in the same cells. There may be a difference under DS conditions, but since the comparisons are not made directly it is impossible to know. The authors state that their data with the Esx1 mutant &quot;demonstrates that ESX-1 secretion is necessary for rapid intracellular growth in the absence of surfactant, consistent with the hypothesis that surfactant may attenuate Mtb growth by depleting ESX-1 components on the bacterial cell surface&quot;. This seems like quite a jump in interpretation of the data since the Esx1 mutant is likely attenuated for many reasons, and this attenuation is dominant to any effect that surfactant is having. The authors also show that PDIM levels are not different in the presence or absence of surfactant, and this is an Esx1 dependent lipid.</p></disp-quote><p>The data for the direct statistical comparison between the WT and ESX-1 deficient mutant are shown in Figure 4A-D and demonstrates that the ESX-1 deficient mutant does not grow as rapidly as the WT in the absence of surfactant. We therefore believe that our assertion in the text regarding the need for ESX-1 secretion for rapid intracellular growth in the absence of surfactant is supported by the data. Although ESX-1 secretion and PDIM secretion share transcriptional regulators such as EspR (Blasco et al., PMID: 22479184), ESX-1 secretion has been shown to be independent of PDIM secretion (Quigley et al. PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270579">28270579</ext-link>) and PDIM secretion is possible in ESX-1 deficient strains (Augenstreich et al., PMID: 28095608). We have also verified that the <italic>ESX-1</italic> strain does produce and secrete PDIM (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and have added text to clarify this. Our data in Figure 5–figure supplement 2 shows that Curosurf treatment does not appear to remove PDIM from the cell surface from WT Mtb. In our view, this reinforces the point that a key reason for the reduced growth potential of the ESX-1 deficient mutant relative to WT Mtb in DS LoCs but not the NS LoCs is due the depletion of ESX-1 components by surfactant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the purpose for including the icl1/icl2 mutant? This experiment is also not included in the data quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>The Δ<italic>icl1</italic>Δ<italic>icl2</italic> mutant serves two purposes. First it serves as a validation of the model; the Δ<italic>icl1</italic>Δ<italic>icl2</italic> mutant has a severely attenuated phenotype in vivo but is not attenuated for axenic growth in vitro so this is a clear benchmark that our model must meet. We have provided additional images taken with a confocal microscopy at 6 days post infection (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-G), which show that the bacteria are intracellular, and remain as single bacteria and have not grown into clumps or cords. Second, this mutant has been shown not to grow intracellularly, but we show that it grows just as rapidly as WT Mtb in the ALI media that is perfused through the vascular channel of the chips (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), and which presumably would be the source of nutrients to these bacteria were they to grow extracellularly. The lack of growth provides another validation, albeit indirectly, that the bacterial growth in the LoC model occurs intracellularly. We have included sentences in the text to make this point.</p><p>We do not observe on-chip growth for the Δ<italic>icl1</italic>Δ<italic>icl2</italic> strain and show that these bacteria remain as single cells for a period of up to 6 days. The low fluorescence intensities of single Mtb bacteria during live-cell imaging made it difficult to obtain statistics to calculate the growth rate for this mutant. We therefore did not include it in the data quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion of Previously Published Data: Similar alterations on the M. tuberculosis cell wall and release of cell wall components to the milieu when exposed to physiological concentrations of human lung surfactant have been already described. The same is applicable to the slower replication rate in ATs (an intracellular killing in macrophages) after M. tuberculosis exposure to human lung surfactant. Although two different systems, authors need to contrast their findings with these reported ones in their discussion. In addition, it is not clear how many times this was performed. Statistics are mentioned on the figure legends, but there are not stats in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for comprehensively summarizing the various interactions of surfactant with Mtb that have already been reported.

Thus, the Results and Discussion should be revised to reflect this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers have raised a complex point, and we respectfully disagree with their interpretation. There are three variables in this system for which comparisons are made: bacterial strain, host cell type, and the surfactant conditions. The comparison across surfactant conditions (keeping host cell type and bacterial strain constant) is shown in Figure 3. The reviewers have referred to the first half of a sentence that compares growth of the WT or the ESX-1 deficient strain in macrophages relative to ATs under different surfactant conditions (a <italic>comparison across host cell types</italic> keeping bacterial strain and surfactant conditions constant) but cited data from Figure 4A. The data that is relevant to the sentence referred to by the reviewers is in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, where for both strains, growth is slower in macrophages vs. ATs (sub-panel A for WT and sub-panel C for ESX-1 deficient Mtb). However, ESX-1 deficient bacteria show these cell-type specific differences even in DS conditions (sub-panel D) whereas WT do not (sub-panel B). It is these differences that we sought to capture in the sentence quoted by the reviewers. Finally, the comparison across bacterial strains (keeping surfactant conditions and host cell constant) are shown in Figure 4A-D. We agree with the reviewers that Figure 4A does show that there is no additional attenuation of the ESX-1 relative to the WT in NS macrophages. Rather, ESX-1 deficient bacteria are unable to capitalize on the surfactant deficiency and grow as fast as their WT counterparts as we show in Figure 4B and 4D.</p><p>As it appears that the current phrasing of the sentence highlighted by the reviewer and the subsequent sentences cause confusion, we have rewritten them to elaborate on the points stated above. We hope the revised text which follows the order of comparison across surfactant conditions, followed by bacterial strains, and then by host cell-type is clearer.</p><p>Results</p><p>“ In comparison to wild-type Mtb, whose intracellular growth rate is strongly dependent on surfactant levels (Figure 3D-G), intracellular growth of the 5’Tn::<italic>pe35</italic> strain <sup>22</sup> that is deficient in ESX-1 secretion but retains PDIM secretion (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) is largely independent of surfactant levels (Figure 3H-K). Under NS conditions, a greater fraction of ESX-1 deficient bacteria are “non-growing” in ATs (Figure 3I). Under DS conditions, the ESX-1 deficient strain is unable to grow as rapidly as wild-type in both macrophages and ATs (Figure 4B, D) and a fraction (ca. 12%) of ESX-1 deficient bacteria are non-growing in macrophages (Figure 3K). This attenuation in DS conditions is evident by visual inspection at 6 days post infection (Figure 3B vs 3A). Macrophages are less permissive than ATs for intracellular growth of ESX-1 deficient Mtb under both NS and DS conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 C, D). In contrast, wild-type Mtb, grows more slowly in macrophages than in ATs only under NS but not DS conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 A,B). Overall, attenuation of ESX-1 deficient bacteria relative to WT is not rescued by surfactant deficiency.”</p><p>Discussion</p><p>We have toned down the text by removing the adjective “good” in the sentence to describe the agreement between the LoC model and in vivo experiments in relation to the ESX-1 deficient strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 1N, Q: Labeling shows AEC, but should it be AT?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the inadvertent error, this has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 2-Figure 1 Supplement: Please explain colors in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>The information for the colors has been incorporated in the figure legend for Figure 2—figure supplement 1, as well as in Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
