cooperates with CDC6, MCM2-7, and CDT1 to form pre-RC complexes at origins of DNA replication. Here, using tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens, we report that each subunit of ORC and CDC6 is essential in human cells. Using an auxin-inducible degradation system, we created stable cell lines capable of ablating ORC2 rapidly, revealing multiple cell division cycle phenotypes. The primary defects in the absence of ORC2 were cells encountering difficulty in initiating DNA replication or progressing through the cell division cycle due to reduced MCM2-7 loading onto chromatin in G1 phase. The nuclei of ORC2-deficient cells were also large, with decompacted heterochromatin. Some ORC2-deficient cells that completed DNA replication entered into, but never exited mitosis. ORC1 knockout cells also demonstrated extremely slow cell proliferation and abnormal cell and nuclear morphology. Thus, ORC proteins and CDC6 are indispensable for normal cellular proliferation and contribute to nuclear organization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>initiation of DNA replication</kwd><kwd>origin recognition complex</kwd><kwd>CDC6</kwd><kwd>pre-replicative complex</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01-CA13106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><name><surname>Vakoc</surname><given-names>Christopher R</given-names></name><name><surname>McCombie</surname><given-names>W Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-CA045508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1627442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schatz</surname><given-names>Michael C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The initiation of human genome replication requires the six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) and CDC6, with ORC playing additional roles during mitosis and in organization of the cell nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell division requires the entire genome to be duplicated once and only once during S-phase of the cell cycle, followed by segregation of the sister chromatids into two daughter cells. To ensure complete and correct duplication of genomes, the initiation of DNA replication is highly regulated and begins with the assembly of a pre-Replication Complex (pre-RC) at origins of DNA replication throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). Among eukaryotes, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is the best characterized system, from which individual proteins involved in DNA replication have been identified and studied extensively, including functional reconstitution of the entire pre-RC assembly and the regulated initiation of DNA replication from these pre-RCs with purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Remus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, pre-RC assembly begins with the origin recognition complex (ORC), comprising Orc1-6 subunits, binding to each potential DNA replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gibson et al., 2006</xref>). Chromatin-bound ORC then provides a platform for the assembly and recruitment of other pre-RC proteins. Cdc6 binds to ORC, followed by the binding of Cdt1-Mcm2-7 to form head-to-head Mcm2-7 double hexamers to complete the formation of the pre-RC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Araki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bleichert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Evrin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Remus et al., 2009</xref>). The Mcm2-7 double hexamer helicase precursor complex remains bound to DNA in an inactive state until it is activated by additional proteins and protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>). During S phase, cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and the Cdc7-Dbf4-dependent protein kinase (DDK), Sld2, Mcm10, Dpb11, Sld3/7, DNA polymerase ε, Cdc45 and the GINS complex are recruited to activate MCM2-7 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Araki, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Araki et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kamimura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kamimura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Takayama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yeeles et al., 2015</xref>). The functional helicase consists of Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) and when activated it unwinds the DNA in a bidirectional and temporally regulated manner from each origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bleichert et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In all eukaryotes, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and human cells, the ORC1-5 subunits contain a AAA+ or a AAA+-like domain and a winged-helix domain (WHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bleichert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jaremko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ocaña-Pallarès et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tocilj et al., 2017</xref>). In yeast, Orc1-6 remains as a stable complex bound to the chromatin throughout the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aparicio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">DePamphilis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Weinreich et al., 1999</xref>). ORC binds to A and B1 DNA sequence elements within the autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), which contains a conserved ARS consensus sequence (ACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bell and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Celniker et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Deshpande and Newlon, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marahrens and Stillman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rao and Stillman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Rowley et al., 1995</xref>). On the other hand, in human cells, there is no apparent sequence-specific binding of ORC to DNA, and the binding of ORC to chromosomes is dynamic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vashee et al., 2001</xref>). ORC subunits do, however, localize to specific sites within the chromosome, most likely via interactions with modified histones or other chromatin-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Higa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Long et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Miotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tatsumi et al., 2008</xref>). One or more of the human ORC subunits dissociate from the complex soon after the pre-RC is formed. For example, in human cells ORC1 is ubiquitinated by the SCF<sup>skp2</sup> ubiquitin ligase and is degraded during the G1-S transition and early S phase, and then re-appears as cells enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kreitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Méndez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ohta et al., 2003</xref>). In human cells, ORC1 is the first ORC subunit to bind to mitotic chromosomes and is inherited into the daughter cells where it recruits other ORC subunits and CDC6 to form new pre-RCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Okuno et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>ORC is a conserved complex in eukaryotes, and it is essential for DNA replication in <italic>S. cerevisiae, S. pombe,</italic> Xenopus, <italic>and Drosophila</italic>, since mutation or depletion of ORC prevents CDC6 binding and MCM loading onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aparicio et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chuang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pflumm and Botchan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Romanowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Speck et al., 2005</xref>). Besides its function in the initiation of DNA replication, ORC protein subunits also have other important roles that vary with species. In budding yeast, Orc1 directly interacts with silencing regulator Sir1 at the silent mating type loci to mediate transcriptional gene silencing and maintain heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Foss et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fox et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Triolo and Sternglanz, 1996</xref>). ORC1 also plays a role in transcriptional gene silencing of the human <italic>CCNE1</italic> locus in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</xref>). ORC also interacts with heterochromatin protein HP1 and is required for maintenance of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pflumm and Botchan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>ORC2 depletion after pre-RC assembly resulted in spindle and DNA damage checkpoint activation, and impaired sister-chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shimada and Gasser, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Orc2 mutants showed reduced S phase cells, increased number of mitotic cells with abnormally condensed chromosomes and chromosome alignment defects, and more importantly, those mutants could not survive at late larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Loupart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pflumm and Botchan, 2001</xref>). In humans, mutations in ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6 are detected in Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bicknell et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bicknell et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Guernsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">de Munnik et al., 2015</xref>). ORC1 and ORC2 localize to centrosomes and ORC1 regulates the re-duplication of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hemerly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). ORC also localizes to telomeres via the TRF2 shelterin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tatsumi et al., 2008</xref>). It was also shown that siRNA knockdown or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of ORC1 resulted in loss of MCM2-7 from chromatin, abnormal duplication of centrioles, and a change in cell cycle stage distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hemerly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2017</xref>). ORC1, ORC2, ORC3, and ORC5 associate with heterochromatin, and depletion of ORC subunits disrupt localization of heterochromatin and also causes abnormal heterochromatin decondensation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Giri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). ORC2 and ORC3 also specifically localize to centromeric heterochromatin during late S phase, G2 and mitosis and removal of these proteins causes decondensation of centromeric α-satellite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Craig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>There is an emerging debate, however, about the essential nature of ORC in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bell, 2017</xref>). ORC is overexpressed in numerous cancerous cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McNairn and Gilbert, 2005</xref>) and HCT116 colorectal cancer cells can survive with only 10% of the ORC2 protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dhar et al., 2001</xref>). More importantly, it was reported that HCT116 <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<italic>TP53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, but we henceforth use <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) cells in which expression of either ORC1 or ORC2 subunit was eliminated using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene ablation could still proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we developed a genetic method to address the function of the pre-RC proteins ORC and CDC6, particularly focusing on the ORC1 and ORC2 subunits. We demonstrate that ORC proteins are essential for normal cell proliferation and survival of human cells. Moreover, ORC1 or ORC2-depleted cells showed multiple defects in progression through cell division cycle, including DNA replication and mitosis, as well as defects in nuclear structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ORC1-6 and CDC6 are essential for cell survival</title><p>To address the issue of essentiality and to identify functional domains within the ORC and CDC6 proteins, we used unbiased tiling-sgRNA CRISPR negative selection screens. Evaluation of CRISPR knock-out (CRISPR-KO) strategies have shown that targeting regions within protein domains typically show significantly higher degree of negative selection phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Montalbano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). This is because both frameshift and more crucially in-frame mutations within functionally active regions of a protein result in genetic nulls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Off-target effects notwithstanding, targeting known domains that contribute to protein function have informed the design of pooled whole-genome CRISPR screens like GeCKO and Avana. Similarly, applying CRISPR-KO strategies to individual proteins requires selection of a single or a few sgRNAs that target known functional domains and have a considerably low off-target score. However, at least in the case of ORC, CRISPR-based ablation of individual subunits of the complex have reported different phenotypic outcomes. For example, in DepMap, the database that summarizes results from whole-genome CRISPR screens (GeCKO 19Q1 and Avana 20Q2 libraries) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>ORC1</italic> is listed as a common essential gene while <italic>ORC2</italic> is listed as non-essential in tested cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Other members of the pre-RC proteins – <italic>ORC3</italic>, <italic>ORC4</italic>, <italic>CDC6</italic>, <italic>MCM2-7</italic>, and <italic>CDT1</italic> show variability between GeCKO and Avana screens in being described as common essential or not. In 2015, <italic>ORC1</italic>, <italic>ORC4</italic>, and <italic>MCM4</italic> were reported as essential in murine cells by using guides that targeted the AAA+ or WH domains of the proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequently, in human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116, <italic>ORC1</italic>, and <italic>ORC2</italic> were reported to be non-essential for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The rationale for using a pooled tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screen approach was – (a) since essential protein domains correlate with higher negative selection phenotype, we hypothesized that analyzing the effect of every possible guide RNA target site in the ORF might uncover new functional regions, and (b) a high-throughput screen of this nature would provide incontrovertible evidence about the essentiality of ORC and CDC6 proteins, at least in the cell lines tested. A recent study validated this approach by analyzing tiling-sgRNA data from Munoz et. al. and found that up to 17.7% of the regions that displayed a CRISPR knockout hyper-sensitive (CKHS) phenotype, did not overlap with previously annotated domain or known function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, guide RNAs targeting every possible PAM sequence 5′-NGG-3′ (<italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9) across each exon of <italic>ORC1-6</italic> and <italic>CDC6</italic> were designed and synthesized. Pooled CRISPR libraries also included control guide RNAs targeting either known core essential genes such as <italic>CDK1</italic>, <italic>PCNA</italic> etc. as positive controls, or those targeting non-essential gene loci or no loci at all as negative controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Miles et al., 2016</xref>). The total library comprised 882 guides targeting <italic>ORC1-6</italic> and <italic>CDC6</italic>, 1602 negative controls (Used in GeCKO V2 library - ‘NeGeCKO’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>), negative controls used in The Sabatini/Lander CRISPR pooled library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Park et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>Rosa26</italic>, CSHL in-house negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tarumoto et al., 2018</xref>) and 43 positive controls; with a median of three pre-validated guides targeting known essential genes <italic>CDK1</italic>, <italic>CDK9</italic>, <italic>RPL9</italic>, <italic>PCNA</italic> etc; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>_guides). Parallel screens were done in the colorectal cancer derived HCT116-Cas9 cells and human diploid RPE-1-Cas9 cells and the relative depletions of guide RNAs in the cell populations between Day 3 and Day 21 were compared using the guide read counts generated by Illumina based next-generation sequencing (n = 2 for HCT116, n = 1 for RPE-1) and the data was analyzed with MAGeCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The screens performed well as shown by the consistent log fold change (LFC) pattern of depletion or relative enrichment of positive and negative controls, respectively – although the absolute values and the range of LFCs were cell-line specific. The LFC threshold of ‘essentiality’ for each cell line was set at the value at which a guide RNA was depleted more than every negative control as well as ≥ to the median depletion of guides targeting each positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>, red line). In HCT116, LFC ≤ −1 and LFC ≤ −5 in RPE-1 were found to be the cut-off for log fold depletion.</p><p>The results showed significant depletion of guide RNAs that target regions within structurally defined domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3a–c, g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4a–c, g, h–j, n</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5a–c, g, h–j and n</xref>).

It is evident that the method of choice did have a bearing on the phenotypic outcome of the knock-down. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref> that found <italic>ORC1</italic> and <italic>ORC2</italic> to be non-essential also used CRISPR editing as the method of knock-down, but also performed long-term selection for cell proliferation to obtain <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> of <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells. We therefore determined if our screen had guide RNAs that were used in either of the DepMap dataset or used in the directed study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>). For <italic>ORC1</italic> and <italic>ORC2</italic> sgRNAs that were used in DepMap datasets, there was a variation in their phenotype as measured by LFC values, with some guides classifying <italic>ORC1</italic> and <italic>ORC2</italic> as essential and others not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>). Of note is the fact that the guide used to target <italic>ORC2</italic> in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref> study showed activity very close to the cut-off in HCT116 cells and scored as non-essential in RPE-1. It is important to note that when a guide targeting a relatively non-essential region allows for the cells to proliferate, no conclusion can be made about the protein being essential. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref> study used that single guide to insert a gene encoding blasticidin resistance and a poly A cassette into the locus, with the aim of disrupting transcription, while our single-guide-per-locus type of screen did not introduce such large insertions. We find that <italic>ORC1-6</italic> and <italic>CDC6</italic> are all essential in both cell lines tested, and that the dynamic range of depletion of these proteins was greater in diploid RPE-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7a</xref>). Comparison of the results from our screens and the published DepMap, especially about <italic>ORC2</italic>, suggest that using too few guides to target proteins can lead to artifactual observations both in terms of essentiality or non-essentiality, and that overall, the gene-effect is influenced by the combination of the choice of guide RNA and the cell line studied.</p><p>When we evaluate the distribution of LFC for all sgRNAs, we saw a negative correlation with annotated domains (AD) – that is sgRNAs targeting AD regions showed significantly higher depletion compared to those targeting non-annotated domain (NAD) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7a</xref>). This finding is consistent with the only previous study that used tiling-sgRNA negative CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, we see a high correlation between our datasets from both HCT116 replicates (r ≈ 0.7) as well as between HCT116 and RPE-1 (r ≈ 0.47), which is also consistent with the previous study that compared three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7b</xref>). For each ORC subunit (and CDC6), ≥50% of designed sgRNAs target annotated domain (AD) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6a</xref>), with the exception of <italic>ORC4</italic>, which is entirely structured, and thus none of the sgRNAs target NAD regions. For all other genes, the fraction of NAD targeting sgRNAs that scored as essential, as well as their locations within these regions were comparable between cell lines rather than between proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6b–h</xref>). This suggests there are functional modules within the NADs and indeed, at least in some cases, we found that sgRNA dropouts in our screens agree with recent functional studies about these regions. For example, in <italic>ORC1</italic>, in HCT116 we saw depletion of sgRNAs targeting regions between 300–450 aa. In humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this N-terminal region is an unstructured IDR, required for ATP-independent chromatin recruitment of ORC and drives protein phase-separation with DNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bleichert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hossain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, this region of Orc1 has been shown to be critical for interacting with ARS DNA as well, but is completely structured unlike metazoan ORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kawakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Another example is ORC6 in which the N-terminus harbors a structured TFIIB domain, but we noticed sgRNA depletions in the remaining regions, especially the C-terminal extremity, which is a septin-binding-region essential for cytokinesis and mutations in a conserved C-terminal motif have also been linked to Meier-Gorlin Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhmetova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Balasov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Balasov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bicknell et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Prasanth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Xu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Limitations like variability of sgRNA efficiency, target gene copy number, <italic>p53</italic> status of the cell, post-translational modifications, local structure of the gene locus can confound analyses from high-throughput tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Haapaniemi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Munoz et al., 2016</xref>). To determine similarities or differences in ‘regions of essentiality’ in ORC and CDC6 between HCT116 and RPE-1 cell lines, we used the computational tool Protiler, developed specifically for tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2019</xref>). This tool takes into account local outliers due to inactive sgRNA or additive effects, and maps sgRNA depletion signals to amino acids of the target proteins to identify functionally essential regions based on their CRISPR-knockout hyper-sensitivity (CKHS). MAGeCK LFC values for combined HCT116 replicates and RPE-1 were put through this pipeline at two different -t2/--thresholds, 0.25 and 0.5, which detect changing points using the TGUH method described in this study. Almost all annotated domains or their boundaries overlapped with CKHS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplements 8</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">13</xref>). In addition, in ORC1, ORC2, ORC3, ORC6, and CDC6 NAD regions were also determined to be CKHS. Some of the newly identified CKHS regions are in agreement with studies that have found that the N-terminal IDR region of ORC1, ORC2, and CDC6, and a small C-terminal region of ORC6, to be functionally important and therefore indispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhmetova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balasov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hossain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lidonnici et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Parker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Prasanth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At this point, we selected sgRNAs that fall within regions of AD and CKHS overlap to target <italic>ORC2</italic> and characterize the phenotype of such ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). We also received <italic>ORC1</italic> and <italic>ORC2</italic> deficient stable cell lines from the authors of the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>) for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rapid ORC2 removal in cancer cells impedes cell growth and causes DNA damage</title><p>Knock-down of <italic>ORC2</italic> with an siRNA approach was a slow process that took at least 24–48 hr, however, using this method we have observed various defective phenotypes, including G1 arrest, S-phase defects, abnormally condensed chromosomes as well as defects in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). These phenotypes can be outcomes of accumulated errors that happen during any phase of the cell cycle and thus it is hard to distinguish between primary and secondary phenotypes associated with the loss of ORC2. Therefore, we used CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with an auxin inducible degron (mAID) tagged ORC2 to construct cell lines in which endogenous ORC2 could be knocked out by CRISPR, and the complementing CRISPR-resistant mAID-ORC2 could then be rapidly removed from cells, allowing exploration of the importance of ORC2 at different stages of cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). To mediate the endogenous ORC2 knockout, four sgRNAs, hereafter named ORC2-1, ORC2-2, ORC2-3, and ORC2-4, were selected for on-target single guide validation. For complementation, N-terminally tagged mAID-sgRNA resistant ORC2 (mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>) was constructed, and the <italic>ORC2</italic> cDNA was edited to harbor multiple mismatches based on two of the four sgRNAs, ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). To perform ORC2 depletion or genetic complementation, mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> constructs were transduced into two cell lines, TO-HCT116 cell line, which expresses a doxycycline-inducible <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> (Asian rice) <italic>TIR1</italic> (OsTIR1) gene that encodes a plant auxin‐binding receptor that interacts with the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF complex to degrade mAID-tagged proteins and the U2OS cell line. In the dropout CRISPR/Cas9 experiment, cells expressing a positive control RPA3 sgRNA and all four ORC2 sgRNAs, but not the negative control Neg15 sgRNA (CSHL in-house negatives, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), showed depletion over 3 weeks of cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). The effects of ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs could be rescued by mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> in both TO-HCT116_mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> and U2OS_mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> cell lines confirming target specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,h</xref>).</p><p>To acquire clonal cells to study ORC2 depletion phenotypes, TO-HCT116_mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> cells were depleted of the endogenous <italic>ORC2</italic> gene with sgRNA ORC2-1 and single clones were isolated by flow sorting. Five cell lines, ORC2_H-1, ORC2_H-2, ORC2_H-3, ORC2_H-4, and ORC2_H-5, were obtained from two independent CRISPR/Cas9 knockout experiments done about 6 months apart. Sequencing of the target sites showed that the ORC2_H-1 and H-3 cell lines had heterozygous mutations at the sgRNA targeting site which led to premature stop codons downstream of the target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). On the other hand, the H-2, H-4, and H-5 cell lines were homozygous with an identical two-nucleotide-deletion, creating a nonsense mutation at the sgRNA targeting site. Although the ORC2-1 sgRNA targets the C-terminus of ORC2, no truncated form of protein was detected by western blot. Our ORC2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the N-terminal half of ORC2 protein.

We excluded off-target effects by confirming the ORC2_H-2 cell line was resistant to both ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs, but not to the ORC2-3 and ORC2-4 sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Compared with parental TO-HCT116 cell line, the human diploid cell RPE-1 expressed ~ 50% less ORC2, while IMR-90 cells expressed ~ 75% less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The relative levels of ORC3 reflect the levels of ORC2 since they are known to form a cognate complex throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dhar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jaremko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vashee et al., 2001</xref>).

In addition, ORC2_H-2 cells expressed mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> at only about 5% that of endogenous ORC2 levels in TO-HCT116, while H-4 and H-5 cells expressed marginally more at about 10%. It is known that cancer cells can proliferate normally with 10% of the levels of ORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dhar et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Next, we compared the proliferation rates in these cell lines. In normal medium the ORC2_H-2, H-4, and H-5 cells grew slightly slower than the parental TO-HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). When doxycycline was added to induce OsTIR1 expression, proliferation of all cell lines decreased by similar rates, possibly either due to some toxicity to doxycycline or the expression of OsTIR1 protein itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). It is important to note that auxin alone did not affect the proliferation rate of wild type TO-HCT116, H-4, and H-5 cells, but it reduced the proliferation rate of H-2 cells substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This phenotype was probably caused by the leaky expression of Tet-OsTIR1 in ORC2_H-2 cells. Finally, when both doxycycline and auxin were added, all three ORC2 KO cell lines stopped proliferating entirely, whereas the parental TO-HCT116 cells continued to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).</p><p>Concomitant with the lack of cell proliferation, we observed altered cell cycle profiles after mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> was depleted from these cells. Cells were treated with doxycycline and auxin to deplete mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> for 0, 4, 24, and 50 hr. At the 50 hr time point, all three ORC2 KO cell lines had less cells progressing from G1 into S phase, and more cells accumulated in late S phase or the G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cells with a 4C DNA peak (late S/G2/M phase) continued to incorporate EdU, suggesting that DNA replication was not complete, even though the bulk of the genome was duplicated.

CHK1 is essential for the DNA damage response and the G2/M checkpoint arrest and is primarily phosphorylated by ATR, although phosphorylation by ATM has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gatei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Goto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jackson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wilsker et al., 2008</xref>). ORC3 and mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> proteins in ORC2_H-2, H-4, and H-5 cell lines were depleted following 4 hr of auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). A nonspecific smaller band was detected but this band did not co-immunoprecipitate with ORC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). When no auxin was added, ORC1 levels in all four cell lines were similar, but the level gradually decreased after mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> depletion, which could be an effect of the phase in which cells ultimately arrest at the 50 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>). On the other hand, CDC6 protein level increased 1.3- to 1.7-fold in mutant cell lines at 0 hr time point, indicating cells might favor higher CDC6 level when ORC is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>). Phosphorylation of ATM(S1981), ATR(T1989), and CHK1(S345) were detected in H-2, H-4, and H-5 cell lines after 50 hr of auxin treatment, but not in the parental TO-HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a</xref>). Higher levels of P-γH2AX(S139) in H-2, H-4, and H-5 cells were detected even when no auxin was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). This showed that although cells can divide with only 5–10% of ORC2, a certain degree of replication stress exists. In our experiments, when parental and ORC2 mutant cells were treated with doxycycline and auxin, phospho-CHK2(T68) level increased slightly in all four cell lines, suggesting the phosphorylation could be associated with the drug treatment but not depletion of mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> itself. These observations were also supported by results from immunofluorescent staining of individual cells. When cells were treated with doxycycline and auxin for 48 hr, substantially more ATM(S1981) and CHK1(S345) phosphorylation were detected in all three ORC2 mutant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h,i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d–e</xref>). In the absence of doxycycline and auxin, the P-γH2AX(S139) signal was more abundant in ORC2_H-2, H-4, and H-5 cells than in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3f</xref>). To conclude, insufficient ORC2 protein in cells resulted in abnormal DNA replication and DNA damage, and in response to DNA damage, CHK1 was activated and cells arrested in G2 phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Loss of ORC2 results in heterochromatin decompaction and abnormal nuclear morphology</title><p>The ORC2 depleted ORC2_H-2 and ORC2_H-5 cells had twice the nuclear volume following treatment with doxycycline and auxin for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–b</xref>) compared to cells without treatment. The average volume of nuclei was greater than the volume of the largest parental cells, and thus the large nuclear phenotype could not be explained by their arrest in G2 phase with a 4C DNA content. However, since ORC2 depletion using siRNA decondenses centromere-associated α-satellite DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>), this phenotype could be due to cells arrested in late S and G2 phase with decompacted heterochromatin. During interphase, ORC2 and ORC3 localize to the heterochromatin foci and interact with heterochromatin protein 1α (HP1α) through ORC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Pflumm and Botchan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). To detect heterochromatin decompaction, immunofluorescent staining of the centromeric protein C (CENP-C) and HP1α was performed. In TO-HCT116 cells, CENP-C staining showed multiple, compact foci, but in the doxycycline and auxin treated cells that were dependent on mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>, CENP-C foci were larger and more prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). In doxycycline-treated control TO-HCT116, ORC2_H-2, and ORC2_H-5 cells, normal HP1α foci were observed and most of them localized adjacent to the CENP-C foci. However, in the doxycycline and auxin treated ORC2 mutant cells, HP1α foci were decompacted, shown by an expanded pattern of staining rather than discrete foci found in the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a–f</xref>). This phenotype was observed in cells that also showed the large CENP-C foci phenotype. HP1α is involved in phase separation of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Larson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Strom et al., 2017</xref>), and removing ORC (ORC2 in this case) from the heterochromatin might affect the overall compaction. These HP1α fluorescence patterns were different from those previously observed when ORC was removed using an siRNA approach in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). This difference is most likely because HeLa, being hyper tetraploid cells, have a different nuclear organization of HP1α compared to that found in HCT116 cells. HeLa cell HP1α foci are more intense and discrete and colocalize with CENP-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2g</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Auxin-treated ORC2_H2, H-4, and H-5 cells have abnormal nuclear phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Nuclear morphology of TO-HCT116, ORC2_H-2, and H-5 cells after 48 hr of auxin treatment.

During the second cell cycle, however, doxycycline and auxin-treated TO-HCT116 cells progressed through S phase only slightly slower than the untreated cells. By contrast, starting from the second cell cycle, serious defects were observed in ORC2_H-2 auxin-treated cells compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–c</xref>). First, auxin-treated ORC2_H-2 cells exhibited a very slow S phase, indicating that cells were struggling to completely replicate their DNA. Second, cells arrested with a 4C DNA content, which could either be late S or G2/M phase. Third, after 48 hr following release from the double thymidine block, some cells arrested in G1 phase and could not enter S phase. We suggest that in the first cell cycle, although mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> was depleted just before release, the pre-RCs were already formed and the cells were primed to replicate the complete genome. However, starting from the second cell cycle, since ORC2 was entirely lost from cells following cell cycle progression through the previous S, G2 and M phase, the cells began to accrue cell cycle defects. Most ORC2-depleted cells then either arrested in G1 or went through an incomplete S phase and arrested at the G2/M phase, but did not progress further. This experiment indicated ORC2 primarily functions in establishing DNA replication initiation, but based on the results thus far, we could not conclude a role during mitosis because in the first cycle ORC2 depleted cells with a 4C DNA content, progressed through G2/M phase and cell division into the next G1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An MCM complex loading and pre-RC assembly defect in ORC2 depleted cells</title><p>The auxin-treated, mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>-depleted cells could not replicate normally, possibly due to insufficient ORC to form the pre-RC.

When doxycycline was added, MCM2 level in ORC2 H-2 cells dropped slightly to 62.2%, while the other two cell lines remained at similar level, 96.8% in TO-HCT116% and 82.5% in ORC2_H-5 cells. When treated with both doxycycline and auxin, 97.5% of TO-HCT116 G1 phase cells stained for chromatin-bound MCM2, but this decreased to only 4.6% and 22.4% cells in ORC2_H-2 and ORC2_H-5 G1 phase cells, respectively. Importantly, the doxycycline and auxin treated ORC2_H-2 and ORC2 H-5 G1 phase cells had very low levels of MCM2 compared to the MCM2 levels in cells that did not receive auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The different degrees of reduction in MCM2 loading between doxycycline and auxin treated H-2 and H-5 cells reflected the relative levels of mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>.

Cells were synchronized using a single thymidine block and auxin was added or omitted 2 hr before releasing into fresh medium with or without doxycycline and auxin. As expected, in either treated or untreated TO-HCT116 cells, the first cell cycle after release from the thymidine block was normal and cells progressed through mitosis into the second cell cycle (data not shown). During the second cell cycle, in the absence or presence of doxycycline and auxin, it took TO-HCT116 cells about 35–50 min to progress from early prophase to chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b and c</xref>, n = 10 for each). In the absence of doxycycline and auxin, ORC2_H-2 cells also progressed through mitosis like the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, n = 10). In stark contrast, in presence of doxycycline and auxin ORC2_H-2 cells showed condensed chromatin and attempted to congress chromosomes at the metaphase plate but never achieved correct metaphase alignment of chromosomes even after 6–13 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, n = 5).

To determine the CNV status we performed SMASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) analysis on the two parental HCT116 cell lines with the <italic>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background as well as the Shibata et al. <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> deficient lines. Both the parental cell lines showed very similar chromosome copy number, characteristic of HCT116, while both <italic>ORC1</italic> deficient and <italic>ORC2</italic>-deficient cell lines had additional CNVs in chromosomes unrelated to those harboring either <italic>ORC1</italic> or <italic>ORC2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). The significance of these specific loci which showed alterations in copy number when either <italic>ORC1</italic> or <italic>ORC2</italic> was deleted remains to be investigated. However, it was in this analysis that we noticed that in <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells a part of the <italic>ORC2</italic> gene locus that was hugely amplified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> solid arrow). To study in detail the <italic>ORC2</italic> gene region on chromosome two in these cells, we performed long-read Oxford Nanopore sequencing analysis. Compared to the reference allele sequence, <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed highly mutated and heterogenous allele distribution near the CRISPR targeting site used in the Shibata et al. study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). In addition, this <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cell line contained many copies of the plasmid with ORC2 homology arms, used for integration of a disruptive blasticidin cassette into the ORC2 gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, it was the <italic>ORC2</italic> homology arms in the plasmid that showed up as the massive amplification in the CNV analysis by SMASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4a,b,c</xref>). Based on RT-PCR data, aside from the expected heterozygous deletions in exon 7, exon 4 also exhibited multiple heterozygous SNPs at three different sites. Among them, SNP1 resulted in a novel stop codon, while SNP3/4/5 were missense mutations, and SNP2/6 were silent mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). Next, we determined the haplotype phasing information between the heterozygous exon 7 deletion and the potential novel stop codons. One allele of ORC2 contained various mutations in exon 4, in combination with the deleted exon 7, showing that the cell line was heterogeneous to start with. The other allele of <italic>ORC2</italic> that had an intact exon seven also had either wild type or SNPs in exon 4. Since there is a methionine in exon 5, it is possible the truncated ORC2 protein we observed was translated from this internal start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Although substantially altered, based on the sequencing data and the sensitivity of the cells to ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs, we conclude that the cell strain is not a true <italic>ORC2</italic> knockout.</p><p>With regard to the HCT116 <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cell line, we confirmed that they lacked ORC1 protein using multiple antibodies and confirmed that they duplicated at a much slower rate than the parental line, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>). The doubling time of the <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells was four-times longer than the parental cells and we were unable to passage these cells for many generations (by 20–30 generations they stopped proliferating). We also compared HCT116 <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (B14) and HCT116 <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (P44) cell lines with the parental lines, that is either <italic>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background by confocal microscopy [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref> (1-4), 8 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5a–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6a–c</xref>]. There were a myriad of nuclear morphology defects in the <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cell line. When the nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye, up to 10% contained abnormally large nuclei or sometimes what seemed to be multiple nuclei aggregated together in single cell, while other cells appeared normal. When probed further by staining for F-actin and Lamin B1 to observe overall cellular morphology and nuclear membrane integrity respectively, we observed that despite the staining for DNA content looking normal, up to 50% of the <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells showed highly abnormal, involuted nuclear membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8i</xref>). In addition, most of the gigantic nuclei seemed to have lost the nuclear membrane altogether, while those cells that had Lamin B1 staining displayed abnormal nuclear membrane integrity.</p><p>The chromatin organization in the cells was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and revealed huge differences in cell size and nuclear structure between the wild type HCT116 <italic>p53<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6d–f</xref>). About 35% of <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells were grossly larger than wild type cells. Those multinucleate/polyploid giant cells were full of membrane invagination and vacuoles, and also exhibit significant apoptotic activities. Most likely they were formed due to extensive DNA damage and nuclear structural defects and underwent a different type of cell division called neosis, in which intracellular cytokinesis occurs and some mononuclear cells are produced from nuclear budding or asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sundaram et al., 2004</xref>). All these phenotypes pointed to the fact that although <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells do not survive in culture long term, for the duration that they do grow, they proliferate extremely slowly and are grossly abnormal. It may well be the case that <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic> status of the parental HCT116 was required for these cells to be produced in the first place.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cell line believed to be a complete knockout via the use of 3 sgRNAs, one targeting the exon 4, and the others targeting the sixth and seventh introns retained a truncated form of ORC2 that could interact with ORC3 and was expressed from a mutated gene. These cells were still susceptible to <italic>ORC2</italic> knockdown using four sgRNAs selected from our CRISPR screens and also partially rescued the phenotype with two sgRNAs using a CRISPR-sgRNA resistant mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>. Similar to what we found for <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, CRISPR-induced frameshifts in cells often generate truncated proteins that, although may not be recognized by western blot, still preserve whole or partial protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Smits et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these observations with ORC2 and the results with <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> lines, cells were unable to proliferate for many generations and produced abnormally structured cells, as well as data analyzed by tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screens, we conclude that ORC is essential in human cells. This conclusion is consistent with existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hemerly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ohta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Prasanth et al., 2002</xref>) and is not surprising since ORC has multiple functions in human cells.</p><p>The fact that <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells could be obtained might suggest that ORC1 is not essential, but these cells did proliferate very slowly and only for a limited number of generations, and yielded cells with grossly abnormal nuclear structures. Thus, we suggest that it is unlikely to obtain cells that are viable over many generations in the absence of all ORC subunits. The <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells have excess levels of CDC6 protein bound to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shibata et al., 2016</xref>) and since CDC6 is related to ORC1 and can bind to the other ORC subunits, we suggest that CDC6 might compensate, albeit poorly, for the absence of ORC1 in loading MCM2-7 proteins and establishing pre-RCs. A recent report described human cells that proliferated in the absence of ORC2 or ORC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shibata and Dutta, 2020</xref>), but we suggest that a detailed molecular and phenotypic analysis of these cells be examined in greater detail as described in this report.</p><p>The pooled CRISPR/Cas9 domain-focused screen has become a common and powerful tool for uncovering genes that are essential for cell proliferation, cell survival, and for identification of essential functional domains in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Park et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">So et al., 2019</xref>). However, if the screens use only a handful of guides targeting annotated essential regions, it may still result in data which may or may not score a gene as essential. Tiling-sgRNA CRISPR-Cas9 screens on the other hand test ‘functional’ or ‘essential’ domains in a more rigorous and unbiased way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2019</xref>). Using this approach, sgRNAs tiled across entire open reading frames of ORC1-6 and CDC6 enabled us to correlate the negative selection phenotype to functional domains within these proteins. The combined results also confirmed that all ORC1-6 and CDC6 proteins were essential in cancer cells as well as a human diploid cell line, including ORC2 that was characterized as non-essential based on multiple shRNA and whole genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens in numerous types of cells in the DepMap portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link>). We were able to identify many sgRNAs that targeted <italic>ORC2</italic> in the tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screen and the two chosen cloned sgRNAs that killed cells were successfully complemented using a <italic>mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup></italic> transgene, demonstrating specificity of the knockdowns. Thus, single-guide experiments, especially those with negative results, should be interpreted with caution, such that the essential nature of a gene should be examined in depth as we have done here.</p><p>The known functional domains in ORC1, including the BAH, AAA+, and WHD were identified using the open reading frame tiling-sgRNA CRISPR/Cas9 screen, as well as other regions of ORC1, including the intrinsically disordered region (IDR; amino acids 180–480, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) which we know binds to Cyclin A-CDK2 and CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hossain et al., 2019</xref>), as well as many other proteins we have identified and characterized in detail. Additionally, this entire IDR may contribute to DNA-mediated ORC liquid phase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hossain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). The screen also identified an essential region of ORC1 in and around amino acid 750–790 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>), which may represent the pericentrin-AKAP450 centrosomal targeting (PACT) domain that localizes ORC1 to centrosomes to regulate correctly centrosome and centriole copy number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hemerly et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In ORC2, multiple, essential domains were identified, including the AAA+-like domain and the WHD. The WHD of human ORC2 controls access of human ORC to DNA by inserting itself into the DNA-binding channel prior to activation of the protein by binding to ORC1 and subsequent binding to CDC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bleichert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hossain et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jaremko et al., 2020</xref>). The ORC2-carboxy terminus binds to ORC3 and ORC2 is also known to bind to PLK1, the mitotic protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Song et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, ORC2 also has an IDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>; amino acids 30–230) and the sgRNA tiling screen of this region shows CKHS essential amino acids, but a relatively conserved region within this IDR amino acid is reproducibly essential in both HCT116 and RPE-1 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">9a–e</xref>). Recent studies have implicated the N-terminal region of ORC2 to interact with ORC associated (ORCA) protein and may functionally contribute to its role in DNA replication and chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Shen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The use of a mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> enabled rapid removal of ORC2 from cells and analysis of the resulting phenotypes in more detail. It was not surprising that ORC2 is essential for loading MCM2, and hence MCM2-7, to establish pre-RCs and origins of DNA replication across the genome. In the absence of ORC2, cells loaded very little MCM2, most likely resulting in too few origins of replication and a consequently slow S phase and arrest with a near 4C DNA content and ongoing DNA synthesis. ORC2 depletion yielded other phenotypes, including large nuclei and a failure to execute mitosis. The large nuclei, also observed in the <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, have large CENP-C and HP1<italic>α</italic> foci, probably due to decompaction of the centromeric associated α-satellite DNA, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>). We suggest a general role for ORC in nuclear organization and organizing chromatin domains in the nucleus, including heterochromatin. In yeast, ORC is essential for transcriptional silencing at the silent mating type heterochromatic loci <italic>HMRa</italic> and <italic>HMLα</italic> loci and its function in replication are separable from that in silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Palacios DeBeer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ehrenhofer-Murray et al., 1995</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ORC localizes and associates with heterochromatin protein HP1 during interphase and mitosis, and heterozygous recessive lethal mutations in <italic>DmORC2</italic> suppress position effect variegation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pak et al., 1997</xref>). In humans, ORC1 interacts with RB and SUV39H1, a histone methyltransferase that tri-methylates histone H3K9 which HP1 binds to repress E2F1-dependent CCNE1 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</xref>). ORC1 and ORC3 (a tight ORC2 binding partner) directly interact with HP1, and depletion of ORC subunits disrupt localization of HP1 and the compaction of chromosome 9 α-satellite repeats DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pak et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Prasanth et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, ORC1 binds to the histone H3K9me3 and H4K20me2 methylation marks and co-localizes with histone H2A.Z, suggesting ORC may organize higher order chromatin structures via direct interactions with modified histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hossain and Stillman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Long et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanism by which the nuclei become large as a result of ORC depletion is under further investigation.</p><p>A final phenotype we observed in the acute removal of ORC2 is that the cells that replicate DNA and enter into mitosis attempt chromosome congression at the metaphase plate, but never make it, even after 7 hr and eventually die of apoptosis. We had observed abnormal mitotic cells following long-term (72 hr) treatment of cells with shRNAs that targeted <italic>ORC2</italic> but it was not clear if this phenotype was due to incomplete DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>). However, in the current study, acute removal of ORC2 captured some cells with a clear defect in chromosome congression during mitosis. Moreover, both ORC2 and ORC3 localize to centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Craig et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Prasanth et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that they play a role in spindle attachment or centromeric DNA organization, particularly the centromere associated satellite repeat sequences. We speculate that in ancestral species, ORC localized at origins of DNA replication and this ORC also functioned in organization of chromosomes and in chromosome segregation, but upon separation of DNA replication and chromosome segregation with the advent of mitosis, separate functions of ORC in DNA replication, chromatin, or nuclear organization and chromosome segregation were retained, but executed at different times during the cell division cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ORC1</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_004153.4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ORC2</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_006190.5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ORC3</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_181837.3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ORC4</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_001190879.3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ORC5</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_002553.4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">ORC6</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_014321.4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CDC6</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">NM_001254.4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Stbl3</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">C3040</td><td valign="top">High efficiency chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HCT116 <italic>p53+/+</italic></td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">Cat# CCL-247, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0291">CVCL_0291</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cell line maintained in B.

Guides with the canonical PAM (NGG) were aligned to the GRCh38 genome using the BatMis exact k-mismatch aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tennakoon et al., 2012</xref>). A maximum of three mismatches were considered for off-target evaluation. The resulting alignment file was parsed, and each off-target location assigned a penalty according to the number of mismatches to the target sequence and the exact position of each mismatch in the guide, where the farther the mismatch is from the PAM the higher the penalty, and based on the proximity of the mismatches to each other; assigning higher penalties to mismatches that are farther apart.</p><p>The resulting penalties from each assessed off-target site were then combined into a single off-target score for each guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>) with 1.00 as the maximum possible score for guides not having any off-target site with up to three mismatches.

Single sgRNAs were cloned by annealing sense and anti-sense DNA oligos followed by T4 DNA ligation into a BsmB1-digested LRG2.1 vector. To improve U6 promoter transcription efficiency, an additional 5’ G nucleotide was added to all sgRNA oligo designs that did not already start with a 5’ G.</p><p>For an unbiased tiling-sgRNA CRISPR screen, pooled sgRNA libraries were constructed. All designed sgRNAs including positive/negative controls were synthesized in duplicate or triplicate in a pooled format on an array platform (Twist Bioscience) and then PCR cloned into the Bsmb1-digested LRG2.1 vector using Gibson Assembly. To ensure the representation and identity of sgRNA in the pooled lentiviral libraries, a MiSeq analysis was performed (Illumina) and we veriﬁed that 100% of the designed sgRNAs were cloned in the LRG2.1 vector and that the abundance of &gt; 95% of the sgRNA constructs was within fivefold of the mean.</p><p>For <italic>ORC2</italic> CRISPR complementation assays, sgRNA resistant synonymous mutations were introduced to ORC2 by PCR mutagenesis using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB).

Briefly, to ensure a single copy sgRNA transduction per cell, multiplicity of infection (MOI) was set to 0.3–0.35. To achieve the desired representation of each sgRNAs during the screen, the total number of cells infected was determined such that while maintaining the MOI at ~ 0.3, each guide would yield at least 2000 counts at the beginning with Illumina NGS. Cells were harvested at day three post-infection and served as the initial time-point (P1) of the pooled sgRNA library, representing all guides transduced to begin with. Cells were cultured for 10 population doublings (P10) and harvested as the final time point. Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA midi kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Data from a total of 3 screens (HCT116: n = 2; RPE-1: n = 1) is presented in this study.</p><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) library was constructed based on a newly developed protocol.

MAGeCK employs median normalization followed by a Negative Binomial modeling of the counts, and provides the log fold change (LFC) and p-values at both the individual guide and gene levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We used Protiler (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/MDhewei/ProTiler-1.0.0">https://github.com/MDhewei/ProTiler-1.0.0</ext-link>), a computational method for the detection of CRISPR Knockout Hypersensitive (CKHS) regions from high-throughput tiling screens, to call and visualize the essential domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">He et al., 2019</xref>). Protiler uses denoising methods to mitigate the off-target effects and inactive sgRNAs, then applies a wavelet-based changing point detection algorithm to delineate the boundaries of sensitive regions. We separately input averaged LFC values from the two replicates of HCT116 or RPE-1 computed from MAGeCK, and analyzed the dataset at default values for all parameters except -t2/--threshold2. This threshold detects changing points using TGUH method described in this pipeline and we identified CKHS regions at thresholds of 0.25 and 0.5 for each target protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>GFP competition and sgRNA complementation assay</title><p>TO-HCT116, TO-HCT116_mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>, U2OS, U2OS_mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>, HCT116 <italic>p53<sup>-/</sup></italic><sup>-</sup>, HCT116 <italic>p53<sup>-/-</sup></italic>_mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup>, <italic>ORC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> p44, and <italic>ORC2</italic> p44<sup>-/-</sup>_ mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> cells were transduced with individual sgRNA-Cas9-GFP lentiviruses at an MOI of 0.3–0.4 to ensure one copy of sgRNA per cell.

Approximately 500 ng genomic DNA was enzymatically fragmented using dsDNA fragmentase (NEB, M0348L). Following end repair, fragments were joined to create chimeric fragments of DNA suitable for creating NGS libraries (300–700 bp). The fragment size selection was done with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat. No. A63881). Illumina-compatible NEBNext Multiplex Dual Index Primer Pairs and adapters (New England Biolabs, Cat. No. E6440S) were ligated to the selected chimeric DNA fragments. These barcoded DNA fragments were then sequenced using an Illumina 300cycle MiSeqv2 kit on a MiSeq platform.</p><p>The SMASH analysis pipeline searches for Maximal Unique Matches (MUMs) to the human genome in all read pairs using a suffix array. These MUMs were then filtered to exclude short matches below 20 bp, matches with less than 4 bp of excess unique sequence, and matches on read two that are within 1000 bases of the genome coordinate of matches from read 1. The resulting 3–4 on average kept matches per read pair are then added to pre-computed empirically sized bins spanning the genome to generate a raw copy number profile. Regions with identical copy are expected to yield similar bin counts using these empirical bins. This profile is then corrected to remove GC content effects by normalizing counts based on LOWESS smoothing of count vs. GC content data in each bin. Final copy number profiles are normalized so that the autosome has an average copy number of 2. Plots were generated with G-Graph MUMdex software - MUMdex Genome Alignment Anal. Softw.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor Michael Botchan and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew W Parker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Overall all three reviewers felt the work establishes that the ORC subunits and Cdc6 are essential for DNA replication in transformed human cell lines and this result clarifies in important ways how Shibata et al. in their 2016 <italic>eLife</italic> paper may have been misled in regard to ORC2 for sure. However, some adaption may have occurred in ORC 1 null cell lines at some time prior to or at the time of mutation. This null ORC1 line does replicate for roughly 30 generations and contrasts starkly to what happens with the ORC2 nulls. Why? No real discussion is presented and it may it be that Shibata was on to something for cancer cells? The reviewing editor wonders if a repair dependent process for an ORC1 null line may let cells with subsequent defective DNA mutations arise, with the mutations then ultimately leading to cell death or senescence? Investigating the loading of the MCMs may help clarify these questions.</p><p>Experiments are suggested by the reviewers in conversation and first by reviewer #2. Do the authors have an idea of what level of replication is occurring in the Orc1 null cells during propagation? If not, they should implement their FACS/Edu experiment to assess this; the FACS/MCM loading assay might also prove informative. The reference to Asano and Park (PNAS 2008; reviewer #3) does set a precedent for the point that certain types of DNA replication may occur in special cell types with &quot;undetectable&quot; levels of ORC1; e.g., polytene cell replication occurring in salivary glands (although in a subsequent paper certain ORC1 mutations were reported as female sterile and defects were found in follicle cell amplification). However, in tissue with very low levels of ORC 1 from maternal stores, not detectable by protein blot, some MCM loading may still occur, especially in heterogeneous tissue where the majority of protein comes from post replicating cells. We feel the cell-type specific points with these established human cell lines are essential for publication, given the major implications for cancer, which are still controversial even given that ORC 1 null mutations are lethal for both <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mice.</p><p>The reviewers also point out that the present work does not show directly a role for ORC subunits in non-DNA replication functions. The manuscript should clarify what has been done elsewhere to indicate either a direct ORC role in non-replication functions or simply hedge conclusions. We have left each of the reviews for your perusal as many suggestions will help in the revised manuscript. However, again the essential points outlined above will be necessary for <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Chou, Bhalla et al., directly addresses a recent controversy in the replication field as to whether ORC1 and ORC2 are essential genes (Shibata et al., 2016). Using a sgRNA-tiling CRISPR screen specifically targeting all ORC subunits and Cdc6, the authors find all ORC genes and Cdc6 to be essential. The authors then create a cell line that allows for the rapid depletion of ORC2 and characterize the phenotypes upon depletion. They describe several molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with ORC2 depletion. Finally, they reveal that the previously published ORC2 mutant is not a true null mutant.</p><p>Overall, I find the authors data showing that ORC and Cdc6 genes are essential compelling, which agrees with a previous published CRISPR-based screen of cell cycle regulated genes (McKinley and Cheeseman, 2017). The phenotypes described upon depletion of ORC2 are also compelling, however, many of these phenotypes have been described in numerous publications with siRNA-mediated depletion of ORC. Furthermore, the authors fall short in determining which phenotypes are due to loss of specific functions of ORC or secondary phenotypes due to DNA damage accumulation in ORC-depleted cells. This could be addressed by providing qualifying statements in the text.</p><p>1) This paper has many typos and grammatical mistakes. Especially in the Materials and methods section. It would be nice to have a native English speaker read the entire manuscript – including the Materials and methods section.</p><p>2)Figure 2F-H: Why are the ORC2-4 and ORC2-4 sgRNAs not complemented by the mAID-ORC2 construct? Is the construct not resistant to those gRNAs? Or, is the result of off-target effects?</p><p>3) “ORC1 and Cdc6 levels remain unchanged”. This is not true based on the data in Figure 3G. You should quantify the data in Figure 3G.</p><p>4) The authors should quantify their IF images (e.g. # foci/cell). Figures 3H, I, 4C.</p><p>5) Figure 4: Is this a direct effect of ORC2 depletion? The authors could look at heterochromatin compaction in synchronized cells prior to S phase.</p><p>6) Subsection “ORC2 is essential for initiation of DNA replication”: Figure 5: To understand the essential function of ORC it would be nice to know if ORC was degraded prior to release. This experiment would be interpreted very differently if ORC was completely degraded and the first cell cycle proceeded normally vs. if ORC wasn't fully degraded upon release. I'm not sure if the defects in the second cell cycle are a reflection of lack of ORC or genome instability in the first cell cycle. Therefore, I don't think the authors can make the conclusions in the aforementioned subsection without knowing this.</p><p>7) Subsection “An MCM complex loading and pre-RC assembly defect in ORC2 depleted cells”, Figure 6: It would be important to know the level of detection in this assay. The authors say there are no MCMs bound upon ORC2 depletion. But the “negative” cells could have ~10% of WT levels of MCMs. It is known that cells can replicate normally with drastically reduced MCM levels.</p><p>8) Figure 7: Is this a direct effect of ORC2 depletion or an indirect effect of checkpoint activation?</p><p>9) Discussion, end of first paragraph: I don't think this statement is true given that some rapidly evolving yeast species lack many DNA replication and repair proteins (Steenwyk et al. 2019 PLoS Biology (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000255).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript from Chou et al. the authors utilize tiling sgRNA CRISPR screens and experiments in previously published Orc null lines to confirm the essential role of origin recognition complex subunits in cell proliferation of multiple human cancer cell lines. The significance of the work lies primarily in rebutting recent claims published in <italic>eLife</italic> that certain components of the human origin recognition complex are dispensable for proliferation (Shibata et al., 2016), and so represents an important contribution to this discussion. The paper is well written, the approach implemented is thorough and the major conclusions substantiated by the data. Additionally, some new biology is gleamed regarding a general role of ORC in maintaining nuclear architecture that opens the door for future investigation. With one additional experiment to confirm their Orc2 knockout and some added discussion/experimentation regarding the previous Orc1 null line (both points detailed below) the paper will be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The paper is largely framed by the previous findings from Shibata et al. that Orc1 and Orc2 are dispensable for proliferation of human cancer cell lines. While the authors clearly show that Orc2 is essential, their data regarding Orc1 is more ambiguous. Indeed, they observe, consistent with Shibata et al., that the Orc1 null line is a true knockout and yet this cell line is still capable of proliferation. This indicates that some level of DNA replication is occurring, as incomplete replication would quickly halt proliferation (as indicated by their ORC2 knockout line which stops proliferating after a single round of division). Do the authors have an idea of what level of replication is occurring in the Orc1 null cells? If not, they should implement their FACS/Edu experiment to assess this; the FACS/Mcm loading assay might also prove informative. And if replication/Mcm loading is occurring, do the authors agree with the Shibata conclusion, that Orc1 is not absolutely essential for replication in human cancer cells, at least for the short term (fewer than 30 generations)? How might cancer cells cope with this from a mechanistic standpoint? The authors should expand their Discussion to include these points.</p><p>2) The authors' ORC2_1 sgRNA lines are clearly functional knockouts, as indicated by the inability of these cells to proliferate when mAID-ORC2 is depleted. This approach, which included an inducible degron and select resistance to sgRNAs, was well-designed and meticulously executed. However, it is not clear whether Orc2 protein is completely lost in these cells. They state that &quot;no truncated form of protein was detected&quot;. However, their western blot in Figure 3A shows a band migrating slightly faster than the endogenous Orc2 and, given the deletion size of approximately 50 amino acids (or 5 kDa), this species seems to be approximately the correct size of a C-terminal truncated protein. The authors only state that this is a &quot;nonspecific smaller band&quot; but do not provide any data to support this conclusion. Do the authors have additional evidence to add? If not, the authors should use their Orc3 IP experiment (Figure 8—figure supplement 1), for which they have all reagents in hand and which was used to verify that the Shibata Orc2<sup>-/-</sup> is not a true knockout, to confirm in their Orc2_H-2, H-4 and H-5 lines that the faster migrating band is, in fact, a non-specific protein that does not pull down with Orc3 (with positive controls run simultaneously).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Stillman and colleagues describes a detailed analysis of the consequences of eliminating individual subunits of the human DNA replication initiator protein, ORC. This has been a controversial area as some authors (notably Shibata et al) have suggested that ORC1 and ORC2 are not essential, while others (notably McKinley and Cheeseman) have suggested that they are essential. In this manuscript the authors use a combination of high density CRISPR mutagenesis and cell lines that allow rapid depletion to come to the conclusion that all of the ORC subunits and Cdc6 are essential. In addition, the authors perform extensive analysis of strains that allow rapid ORC2 depletion, observing defects in DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and mitosis. Finally, they analyze the previously described cell lines that grow in the absence of ORC1 or ORC2 to address how they are still able to grow.</p><p>In the first part of the paper the authors use a combination of CRISPR targeting and competitive cell growth as a mechanism of assessing the importance of each ORC gene and Cdc6. For each gene they created a series of guide RNAs that spanned the full coding region of each gene and then asked how cells treated with the guide RNA grew relative to control untreated cells. By comparison of the growth differences observed to control guide RNAs that, the authors conclude that all six ORC genes and Cdc6 are essential. What is less clear is whether the authors can conclude that the site of targeting reveals the importance of that region. Although the authors state that targeting sites of conserved regions have more impact than non-conserved regions, there are many instances when this correlation is not observed. In addition, when there are strong effects in non-conserved regions (e.g. the IDRs of ORC1 and ORC2) the authors conclude that they are essential regions of the protein. It is not clear that the differing effects could just as likely be due to the frequency of making deletions and frame shifts at different regions rather than their conservation(for example, if the local DNA sequences have micro-homologies that lend themselves to deletions). If the authors want to make such conclusions they need to provide a more quantitative analysis than what is shown in the current manuscript (e.g. show a correlation between the LFC and the extent of conservation of the targeted region – i.e. the 20 aa on either side of the CRISPR cut site).</p><p>Much of the remaining data concerns the analysis of cell lines in which ORC2 can be rapidly removed from cells by regulated degradation. They show that removal of ORC2 leads to rapid loss of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Using markers for the DNA damage checkpoint they also show that this checkpoint is activated in these cells. They further find that depletion of ORC2 results in aberrant nuclear morphology and decondensation of centromeric heterochromatin. Not surprisingly, they also see defects in replication initiation. This is not particularly well demonstrated by the data in Figure 5 as all the defects observed could be due to difficulty in elongation. However, the data in Figure 6 addressing MCM2 association with chromatin are more compelling and are certainly in line with the known functions of ORC. Finally, the authors observe ORC2 depletion also results in defects in centromeric condensation, nuclear morphology, and entry into and completion of mitosis.</p><p>The last section of the paper looks into the previously identified cell lines &quot;lacking&quot; ORC1 or ORC2 and comes to different conclusions regarding the two cell lines. For the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> line, the conclusion is simple. It is clear that there is still functional ORC2 present. In the case of the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line, this does not seem to be the case. Instead, the authors focus on the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line characteristics. They observe that it has limited proliferation capacity of 30 generations or less and that it has significant morphological and cell division defects. Nevertheless, the data seems to show that ORC1 is not required for successful cell division and DNA replication (similar to what was reported by Shibata et al.). The authors should do a better job of saying that they agree with the previous studies and discuss more about how this could be the case instead of only focusing on the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> strain not being a deletion. For example, there are other studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also observing ORC1 as being non-essential for DNA replication (Park, S.Y., and Asano, M. (2008). The origin recognition complex is dispensable for endoreplication in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105, 12343-12348.). Certainly, it is true that these cells are unhappy and at a severe competitive advantage, but they are replicating their DNA and proliferating in the absence of ORC1 and this observation remains unexpected and worthy of discussion by the authors.</p><p>Overall, this paper provides strong evidence that ORC is an essential DNA replication protein. The authors also identify a myriad of defects of ORC depletion beyond DNA replication (some of which have been observed previously by the Stillman using less refined ORC depletion methods). What is not clear based on the data, is whether the defects in chromatin condensation, nuclear morphology, and mitosis are due to direct effects of ORC on these events versus indirect defects of the incomplete DNA replication that occurs as a consequence of ORC depletion. This alternative possibility should be discussed more directly by the authors as there is nothing in the paper to suggest that the effects are direct (e.g. experiments removing ORC function in G1 or M phase arrested cells).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61797.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall all three reviewers felt the work establishes that the ORC subunits and Cdc6 are essential for DNA replication in transformed human cell lines and this result clarifies in important ways how Shibata et al. in their 2016 eLife paper may have been misled in regard to ORC2 for sure.

This null ORC1 line does replicate for roughly 30 generations and contrasts starkly to what happens with the ORC2 nulls. Why? No real discussion is presented and it may it be that Shibata was on to something for cancer cells? The reviewing editor wonders if a repair dependent process for an ORC1 null line may let cells with subsequent defective DNA mutations arise, with the mutations then ultimately leading to cell death or senescence? Investigating the loading of the MCMs may help clarify these questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new discussion in the paper that addresses the possible mechanism for why the <italic>ORC1</italic> depleted cells proliferate, although we want to emphasize that these cells hardly proliferate and their life span is very limited, so ORC is essential in both transformed and diploid cells.

Do the authors have an idea of what level of replication is occurring in the Orc1 null cells during propagation? If not, they should implement their FACS/Edu experiment to assess this; the FACS/MCM loading assay might also prove informative. The reference to Asano and Park (PNAS 2008; reviewer #3) does set a precedent for the point that certain types of DNA replication may occur in special cell types with &quot;undetectable&quot; levels of ORC1 ; e.g., polytene cell replication occurring in salivary glands (although in a subsequent paper certain ORC1 mutations were reported as female sterile and defects were found in follicle cell amplification). However, in tissue with very low levels of ORC 1 from maternal stores, not detectable by protein blot, some MCM loading may still occur, especially in heterogeneous tissue where the majority of protein comes from post replicating cells. We feel the cell-type specific points with these established human cell lines are essential for publication, given the major implications for cancer, which are still controversial even given that ORC 1 null mutations are lethal for both <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We show using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gRNA tiling that ORC1 is essential in both cancer cells and in human diploid cells and we have added cell proliferation data to show that the <italic>ORC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> depleted cells have a very slow doubling rate and can only divide for a limited number of generations, and have many cells with a highly abnormal nuclear morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers also point out that the present work does not show directly a role for ORC subunits in non-DNA replication functions. The manuscript should clarify what has been done elsewhere to indicate either a direct ORC role in non-replication functions or simply hedge conclusions. We have left each of the reviews for your perusal as many suggestions will help in the revised manuscript. However, again the essential points outlined above will be necessary for eLife publication.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Chou, Bhalla et al., directly addresses a recent controversy in the replication field as to whether ORC1 and ORC2 are essential genes (Shibata et al., 2016). Using a sgRNA-tiling CRISPR screen specifically targeting all ORC subunits and Cdc6, the authors find all ORC genes and Cdc6 to be essential. The authors then create a cell line that allows for the rapid depletion of ORC2 and characterize the phenotypes upon depletion. They describe several molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with ORC2 depletion. Finally, they reveal that the previously published ORC2 mutant is not a true null mutant.</p><p>Overall, I find the authors data showing that ORC and Cdc6 genes are essential compelling, which agrees with a previous published CRISPR-based screen of cell cycle regulated genes (McKinley and Cheeseman, 2017). The phenotypes described upon depletion of ORC2 are also compelling, however, many of these phenotypes have been described in numerous publications with siRNA-mediated depletion of ORC. Furthermore, the authors fall short in determining which phenotypes are due to loss of specific functions of ORC or secondary phenotypes due to DNA damage accumulation in ORC-depleted cells. This could be addressed by providing qualifying statements in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and have made changes to the Discussion to highlight defects in context. We have also added new data that clarifies the change in nuclear morphology upon ORC2 depletion and when this occurs during the cell division cycle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) This paper has many typos and grammatical mistakes.

Or, is the result of off-target effects?</p></disp-quote><p>The mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> construct was made specifically to be resistant to ORC2-1 and ORC2-2 sgRNAs (Figure 2D). It is not expected that the ORC2-3 and ORC2-4 gRNAs will be complemented since they still cut the transgene. The fact that we could see specificity for the gRNAs in the complementation argues strongly against off target effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) “ORC1 and Cdc6 levels remain unchanged”.

The authors could look at heterochromatin compaction in synchronized cells prior to S phase.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, Cells were synchronized in G1 phase followed by ORC2 depletion and the result is shown in new Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B. While the cells stayed in G1, we harvested cells at two different time points after auxin treatment. The nuclear volume was unchanged. CENP-C staining was also unchanged (data not shown). We suggested that this abnormal heterochromatin phenotype we observed after ORC depletion in asynchronous cell is due to cells lacking ORC2 during S phase that affect sister chromatid cohesion loading (Zheng et al., 2018). The centromeric region showed decompaction in late S/ G2 phase and we confirmed this prediction by demonstrating re-arrangement of heterochromatin protein HP1α concomitant with an increase in CENP-C staining, providing evidence of a global nuclear decondensation upon ORC2 depletion (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2) We compared the HP1α staining in HCT116 cells and HeLa cells since we have previously studied the localization of HP1α in cells depleted of ORC subunits and HeLa, unlike HCT116 cells, have clustered heterochromatin foci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “ORC2 is essential for initiation of DNA replication”: Figure 5: To understand the essential function of ORC it would be nice to know if ORC was degraded prior to release. This experiment would be interpreted very differently if ORC was completely degraded and the first cell cycle proceeded normally vs. if ORC wasn't fully degraded upon release. I'm not sure if the defects in the second cell cycle are a reflection of lack of ORC or genome instability in the first cell cycle. Therefore, I don't think the authors can make the conclusions in the aforementioned subsection without knowing this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown the depletion of mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> in a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. The mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> was depleted upon release from a second thymidine block in the auxin-treated ORC2_H-2 cells group. The depletion persists until the last collection at 48 hr. (Lane 23-28). We proposed that although mAID-ORC2<sup>gr</sup> was depleted upon release, the pre-RC was already formed during the second thymidine incubation. Thus the first S phase is normal. However, during the second cell cycle, ORC2 is entirely lost from the cells since the previous S, G2 and M phases, and therefore cells begin to show cell cycle defects consistent with a loss of pre-RC assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “An MCM complex loading and pre-RC assembly defect in ORC2 depleted cells” Figure 6: It would be important to know the level of detection in this assay.

As shown in the new data, within the G1 population, ORC2_H-2 cells have only 4.6 % MCM2<sup>DNA</sup> pos., and the MCM2<sup>DNA</sup> neg. population is shifted downward, suggesting that “negative” cells do not retain MCM2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 7: Is this a direct effect of ORC2 depletion or an indirect effect of checkpoint activation?</p></disp-quote><p>It is hard to tell whether it’s an indirect effect of checkpoint activation. While most cells have checkpoint activation, only a very small percentage of the cells enter mitosis to exhibit the abnormal phenotype. ORC2 localizes at the kinetochore during M phase, and we suggest that those mitotic cells lacking ORC2 cannot properly align and segregate sister chromatids during M phase. But we do not know if ORC2 directly controls or is essential for recruiting other factors sometime during or before M phase for sister chromatid alignment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Discussion, end of first paragraph: I don't think this statement is true given that some rapidly evolving yeast species lack many DNA replication and repair proteins (Steenwyk et al. 2019 PLoS Biology (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000255).</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been edited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript from Chou et al. the authors utilize tiling sgRNA CRISPR screens and experiments in previously published Orc null lines to confirm the essential role of origin recognition complex subunits in cell proliferation of multiple human cancer cell lines. The significance of the work lies primarily in rebutting recent claims published in eLife that certain components of the human origin recognition complex are dispensable for proliferation (Shibata et al., 2016), and so represents an important contribution to this discussion. The paper is well written, the approach implemented is thorough and the major conclusions substantiated by the data. Additionally, some new biology is gleamed regarding a general role of ORC in maintaining nuclear architecture that opens the door for future investigation. With one additional experiment to confirm their Orc2 knockout and some added discussion/experimentation regarding the previous Orc1 null line (both points detailed below) the paper will be suitable for publication in eLife.</p><p>1) The paper is largely framed by the previous findings from Shibata et al. that Orc1 and Orc2 are dispensable for proliferation of human cancer cell lines. While the authors clearly show that Orc2 is essential, their data regarding Orc1 is more ambiguous. Indeed, they observe, consistent with Shibata et al., that the Orc1 null line is a true knockout and yet this cell line is still capable of proliferation. This indicates that some level of DNA replication is occurring, as incomplete replication would quickly halt proliferation (as indicated by their ORC2 knockout line which stops proliferating after a single round of division). Do the authors have an idea of what level of replication is occurring in the Orc1 null cells? If not, they should implement their FACS/Edu experiment to assess this; the FACS/Mcm loading assay might also prove informative. And if replication/Mcm loading is occurring, do the authors agree with the Shibata conclusion, that Orc1 is not absolutely essential for replication in human cancer cells, at least for the short term (fewer than 30 generations)? How might cancer cells cope with this from a mechanistic standpoint? The authors should expand their Discussion to include these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments, and we have now included additional data on the ORC1 depleted cells showing that they have a cell cycle division half-life of 96hrs, compared to the parental cells that divide every 24 hrs. Furthermore, the cells cannot be maintained for more than 20-30 generation, showing that ORC1 is essential. The cells over-express CDC6 which forms a complex with the ORC subunits, and it is possible that the very compromised cell proliferation observed in the absence of ORC1 is due to compensatory over-expression of CDC6. We also show that the ORC1 depleted cells yield large number of cells with a very abnormal nuclear morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors' ORC2_1 sgRNA lines are clearly functional knockouts, as indicated by the inability of these cells to proliferate when mAID-ORC2 is depleted. This approach, which included an inducible degron and select resistance to sgRNAs, was well-designed and meticulously executed. However, it is not clear whether Orc2 protein is completely lost in these cells. They state that &quot;no truncated form of protein was detected&quot;. However, their western blot in Figure 3A shows a band migrating slightly faster than the endogenous Orc2 and, given the deletion size of approximately 50 amino acids (or 5 kDa), this species seems to be approximately the correct size of a C-terminal truncated protein. The authors only state that this is a &quot;nonspecific smaller band&quot; but do not provide any data to support this conclusion. Do the authors have additional evidence to add? If not, the authors should use their Orc3 IP experiment (Figure 8—figure supplement 1), for which they have all reagents in hand and which was used to verify that the Shibata Orc2<sup>-/-</sup> is not a true knockout, to confirm in their Orc2_H-2, H-4 and H-5 lines that the faster migrating band is, in fact, a non-specific protein that does not pull down with Orc3 (with positive controls run simultaneously).</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve shown the nonspecific smaller band does not co-IP with anti-ORC3 antibody in a new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C. Thus, we conclude that this band is not able to function like an ORC2 protein that binds to ORC3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Stillman and colleagues describes a detailed analysis of the consequences of eliminating individual subunits of the human DNA replication initiator protein, ORC. This has been a controversial area as some authors (notably Shibata et al) have suggested that ORC1 and ORC2 are not essential, while others (notably McKinley and Cheeseman) have suggested that they are essential. In this manuscript the authors use a combination of high density CRISPR mutagenesis and cell lines that allow rapid depletion to come to the conclusion that all of the ORC subunits and Cdc6 are essential. In addition, the authors perform extensive analysis of strains that allow rapid ORC2 depletion, observing defects in DNA replication, chromosome condensation, and mitosis. Finally, they analyze the previously described cell lines that grow in the absence of ORC1 or ORC2 to address how they are still able to grow.</p><p>In the first part of the paper the authors use a combination of CRISPR targeting and competitive cell growth as a mechanism of assessing the importance of each ORC gene and Cdc6. For each gene they created a series of guide RNAs that spanned the full coding region of each gene and then asked how cells treated with the guide RNA grew relative to control untreated cells. By comparison of the growth differences observed to control guide RNAs that, the authors conclude that all six ORC genes and Cdc6 are essential. What is less clear is whether the authors can conclude that the site of targeting reveals the importance of that region. Although the authors state that targeting sites of conserved regions have more impact than non-conserved regions, there are many instances when this correlation is not observed. In addition, when there are strong effects in non-conserved regions (e.g. the IDRs of ORC1 and ORC2) the authors conclude that they are essential regions of the protein. It is not clear that the differing effects could just as likely be due to the frequency of making deletions and frame shifts at different regions rather than their conservation(for example, if the local DNA sequences have micro-homologies that lend themselves to deletions). If the authors want to make such conclusions they need to provide a more quantitative analysis than what is shown in the current manuscript (e.g. show a correlation between the LFC and the extent of conservation of the targeted region – i.e. the 20 aa on either side of the CRISPR cut site).</p><p>Much of the remaining data concerns the analysis of cell lines in which ORC2 can be rapidly removed from cells by regulated degradation. They show that removal of ORC2 leads to rapid loss of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Using markers for the DNA damage checkpoint they also show that this checkpoint is activated in these cells. They further find that depletion of ORC2 results in aberrant nuclear morphology and decondensation of centromeric heterochromatin. Not surprisingly, they also see defects in replication initiation. This is not particularly well demonstrated by the data in Figure 5 as all the defects observed could be due to difficulty in elongation. However, the data in Figure 6 addressing MCM2 association with chromatin are more compelling and are certainly in line with the known functions of ORC. Finally, the authors observe ORC2 depletion also results in defects in centromeric condensation, nuclear morphology, and entry into and completion of mitosis.</p><p>The last section of the paper looks into the previously identified cell lines &quot;lacking&quot; ORC1 or ORC2 and comes to different conclusions regarding the two cell lines. For the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> line, the conclusion is simple. It is clear that there is still functional ORC2 present. In the case of the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line, this does not seem to be the case. Instead, the authors focus on the ORC1<sup>-/-</sup> cell line characteristics. They observe that it has limited proliferation capacity of 30 generations or less and that it has significant morphological and cell division defects. Nevertheless, the data seems to show that ORC1 is not required for successful cell division and DNA replication (similar to what was reported by Shibata et al.). The authors should do a better job of saying that they agree with the previous studies and discuss more about how this could be the case instead of only focusing on the ORC2<sup>-/-</sup> strain not being a deletion. For example, there are other studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also observing ORC1 as being non-essential for DNA replication (Park, S.Y., and Asano, M. (2008). The origin recognition complex is dispensable for endoreplication in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 105, 12343-12348.). Certainly, it is true that these cells are unhappy and at a severe competitive advantage, but they are replicating their DNA and proliferating in the absence of ORC1 and this observation remains unexpected and worthy of discussion by the authors.</p><p>Overall, this paper provides strong evidence that ORC is an essential DNA replication protein. The authors also identify a myriad of defects of ORC depletion beyond DNA replication (some of which have been observed previously by the Stillman using less refined ORC depletion methods). What is not clear based on the data, is whether the defects in chromatin condensation, nuclear morphology, and mitosis are due to direct effects of ORC on these events versus indirect defects of the incomplete DNA replication that occurs as a consequence of ORC depletion. This alternative possibility should be discussed more directly by the authors as there is nothing in the paper to suggest that the effects are direct (e.g. experiments removing ORC function in G1 or M phase arrested cells).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this analysis and for suggestions. We have analyzed the tiling sgRNA data in greater detail and have been able to show that indeed the cohort of sgRNAs that target highly conserved annotated domains display a significantly higher depletion phenotype compared to those targeting non-annotated domain regions. Furthermore, to be sure of the regions that are not part of annotated domains but seem to be hypersensitive to CRISPR-knockout we have run the Protiler analysis pipeline which denoises the data to rule out false-positives arising due to inactive sgRNA or additive effects. The new analysis has been included in entirely new Figure 2 supplements and the essential regions of the proteins are consistent between cancer and normal cells.</p><p>Additionally, previous studies that have characterized CRISPR cut site indels/mutations have reported that reproducible DNA repair patterns are not explained by microhomologies (MH). While MH lends itself to deletions, their frequency is limited and if they occur, deletions only happen when the MH is extremely close to the protospacer adjacent motif. Furthermore, an intact microhomology mediated end-joining pathway is required for this phenomenon which is absent from HCT116 cell lines – and can be beneficial in identifying novel genetic liabilities compared to lines with intact MMEJ, RPE1 in our case.

C., Yusa, K. and Bradley, A. Off‐target assessment of CRISPR‐Cas9 guiding RNAs in human iPS and mouse ES cells. Genesis 53, 225–236 (2015)].</p><p>To further address this question of the role of ORC2, we performed a new G1 synchronization experiment with ORC2 depletion and the result is shown in new Figure 4—figure supplement 3. While arresting the cells in G1, we harvested two time points after auxin treatment. The nuclear volume remained unchanged. CENP-C staining was also unchanged (data not shown). We suggest that this abnormal heterochromatin phenotype is due to cells lacking ORC2 during S phase that affects sister chromatids cohesion loading (Zheng et al., 2018), therefore, the centromeric region showed decompaction in late S/G2 phase. We have also provided new evidence of heterochromatin decondensation after 48 hr of ORC2 depletion in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><p>It is hard to tell whether aberrant mitosis is an indirect effect of incomplete DNA replication, checkpoint activation or due to a direct effect of ORC loss. Because most cells arrest at G1, late S, or G2 phase with checkpoint activation, only a very small percentage of cells enter mitosis to exhibit the abnormal phenotype. ORC2 localizes at the kinetochore during M phase, and we suggest that those mitotic cells lacking ORC2 cannot properly align and segregate sister chromatids during M phase. This could be due to direct outcome of ORC2 removal or that ORC2 is essential for recruiting other factors before M phase. In Figure 5 we’ve shown that cells can progress normally during first cell cycle upon release from double thymidine block, which indicates loss of ORC2 during mitosis doesn’t affect cell division. Nonetheless, ORC2 could still be part of an essential components for recruiting or loading important factors for chromosome congression, and this action can be traced back to G1 or S phase, which will then be hard to discriminate from its replication function.</p><p>We have added new discussion about the loss of ORC1 in the cells and the possibilities of how they can have the limited proliferation. We have also added a discussion of a more recent paper by Shibata and Dutta, 2020, on the reported loss of ORC2 and ORC5 in human cell lines.</p></body></sub-article></article>
