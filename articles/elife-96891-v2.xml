development. However, the molecular mechanisms coordinating proper axonal extension and turning are poorly understood. Here, metastasis suppressor 1 (Mtss1), a membrane protrusion protein, ensured axonal extension while sensitizing axons to the Semaphorin 3E (Sema3E)-Plexin-D1 repulsive cue. Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling enhanced Mtss1 expression in projecting striatonigral neurons. Mtss1 localized to the neurite axonal side and regulated neurite outgrowth in cultured neurons. Mtss1 also aided Plexin-D1 trafficking to the growth cone, where it signaled a repulsive cue to Sema3E. Mtss1 ablation reduced neurite extension and growth cone collapse in cultured neurons. <italic>Mtss1</italic>-knockout mice exhibited fewer striatonigral projections and irregular axonal routes, and these defects were recapitulated in <italic>Plxnd1</italic>- or <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that repulsive axon guidance activates an exquisite autoregulatory program coordinating both axonal extension and steering during neuronal pathfinding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>Semaphorin 3E</kwd><kwd>Plexin-D1</kwd><kwd>Mtss1</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018749</institution-id><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KBRI 23-BR-01-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Won-Jong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2014R1A1A2058234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Won-Jong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2020M3E5D9079766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Won-Jong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2022M3E5E8017701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>Won-Jong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Researcher Program 2020R1C1C1010509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Namsuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Repulsive guidance cues enhance a dual-functioning axonal trafficking facilitator, allowing navigating axons to ensure proper pathfinding by coordinating positive extension and negative steering during nervous system development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the developing nervous system, axons of newly generated neurons extend toward destination targets and make connections to establish a functional circuit following an exquisitely designed program. In this long-range pathfinding process, axons encounter attractive and repulsive signals from guidance molecules, and diverse combinations of ligand–receptor pairs communicate signals to a neuron from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</xref>). In addition to the conventional guidance mode, which has been established, recent studies have demonstrated the complexity of signaling through different mechanistic layers, such as crosstalk between guidance molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poliak et al., 2015</xref>), guidance switching between different holoreceptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>), or guidance tuning by intrinsic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonanomi et al., 2019</xref>). In general, the specific cognate guidance receptors that sense extracellular signals are mostly localized in growth cones, a specialized structure at the fore of a growing axon, and these receptors convey intracellular signaling cues within neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franze, 2020</xref>). Therefore, proper signaling from guidance molecules in the growth cone surface is critical as axons travel to their destination. Because the axonal destination can be as far as a meter or more away from the soma, various transport systems consisting of specific adaptors and motor proteins transport guidance proteins to axon terminals and are thus critical for axonal movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Winckler and Mellman, 2010</xref>). However, how individual guidance molecules are correctly delivered to growth cones and can accommodate the axonal growth pace is unclear, and the molecular machinery critical for the specific transportation of guidance molecules is unknown.</p><p>Growth cones are highly dynamic and motile cellular structures that facilitate axon growth and steering through activated receptors that alter cytoskeletal actin and microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowery and Van Vactor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitriol and Zheng, 2012</xref>). Therefore, guidance receptors undoubtedly need to be localized to these protrusive structures to control actin dynamics. Since actin filament assembly is typically accompanied by membrane remodeling, a group of cytoskeletal scaffold proteins linking actin to the cell membrane must be activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vitriol and Zheng, 2012</xref>). One such protein group consists of Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins, which have been implicated in many actin-associated membrane functions, such as cell motility, endocytosis, and organelle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Among these proteins, metastasis suppressor 1 (Mtss1, also called missing in metastasis), one of a few inverse BAR (I-BAR) domain subfamily proteins, is notable due to its capability of forming cellular protrusions by promoting inverse membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Machesky and Johnston, 2007</xref>). Because of its unique ability to connect the plasma membrane inner leaflet with actin, the role of Mtss1 has been characterized in promoting spine protrusions as well as neuronal dendrite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawabata Galbraith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saarikangas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). However, in contrast to these many studies of Mtss1 on the dendritic side during development, few studies have investigated whether Mtss1 is expressed and plays a specific role in axons.</p><p>Semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), a class 3 secreted semaphorin family protein, conveys guidance signals by directly binding with the Plexin-D1 receptor in both the nervous and vascular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh and Gu, 2013a</xref>). The Sema3E-Plexin-D1 pair mainly transmits a repulsive guidance cue via local cytoskeletal changes, thereby inhibiting axonal overgrowth and/or ectopic synapse formation in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukuhara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling is involved in dendritic synapse formation as well as traditional axon projection in the basal ganglia circuitry, which is essential for diverse behavioral and cognitive functions in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrman et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, Plexin-D1 is expressed only in direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) projecting to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), one of two distinct types of MSNs in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Plexin-D1-positive striatonigral axons travel through the corridor between the globus pallidus (Gp) and reticular thalamic nucleus (rTh)/zona incerta (ZI), in which Sema3E molecules reside and emit repulsive signals to direct proper pathway formation toward the SNr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrman et al., 2013</xref>). However, how the striatonigral pathway coordinates axonal growth and steering during pathfinding remains largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the repulsive Sema3E-Plexin-D1 guidance signaling pair in striatonigral-projecting neurons during mouse basal ganglia circuit development. We found that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling coordinates axonal extension and diversion by enhancing the action of the facilitator protein Mtss1 during active striatonigral projection progression. In the context of the important and intricate networks in the brain, this study provides evidence showing that autoregulatory factor expression regulated by guidance signaling leads to the correct neuronal trajectory to the destination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling regulates Mtss1 expression in the developing striatum</title><p>The majority of striatal neurons are MSNs (up to 90%), and the MSNs are equally divided into direct and indirect pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>).

Because of the relative abundance of Plexin-D1-positive neurons, we expected a high probability of discovering the potential downstream responsive genes modulated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling in the striatum.

These results suggest that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling activation can increase Mtss1 expression in striatal neurons during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mtss1 is selectively expressed in striatonigral-projecting neurons during the active pathfinding period</title><p>To determine whether this Mtss1 expression is specific to Plexin-D1-positive neurons, we first performed fluorescence in situ hybridization. Mtss1 expression significantly overlapped with <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-positive neurons in both the cortex and striatum, and its expression was reduced in <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Moreover, when we performed immunostaining with Drd1a-tdT mice, in which direct-pathway MSNs fluoresced red (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ade et al., 2011</xref>), Mtss1 expression significantly overlapped with Drd1a-tdT striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>; 98.2 ± 1.72%), suggesting that Plexin-D1 signaling mediates Mtss1 expression selectively in striatonigral projecting MSNs. Although Mtss1 was expressed at a low level regardless of Plexin-D1 presence at E16.5, it seemed to be under the control of Plexin-D1 signaling in the developing striatum from the last gestation period to the early postnatal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). Furthermore, the Sema3E ligand activating the Plexin-D1 receptor was predominantly expressed in the thalamus and released into the striatum, probably during thalamostriatal projection at E16.5, as observed in the early postnatal stage in a previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Next, we analyzed the expression profiles of Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 from the developmental stage to the adult stage. Both Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 were expressed in the embryonic striatum, and their expression was elevated in the perinatal stage. Interestingly, Mtss1 expression was maintained at a relatively high level from E18.5 to P5 and then declined sharply and disappeared in the adult striatum, and although Plexin-D1 showed a similar expression pattern, its expression was maintained at a low level in the adult striatum, presumably to regulate other functions such as thalamostriatal synapse formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M and N</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling regulates Mtss1 expression in cultured medium spiny neurons</title><p>To determine whether Plexin-D1-driven Mtss1 expression can be recapitulated in vitro, we compared the Mtss1 levels in cultured striatal neurons isolated from wild-type and <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-null mice. In wild-type neurons, both Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 expression levels were low at day 3 in vitro (DIV3) and then increased by DIV6. In contrast, <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout neurons failed to elevate Mtss1 expression by DIV6, suggesting that Mtss1 expression is induced at the cellular level rather than by indirect systemic changes at the circuit level in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In addition, the expression of Mtss1 was decreased in cultured <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Next, to further confirm that the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 guidance pair is required for the activation of Mtss1 expression in striatonigral neurons, we supplemented the <italic>Sema3e</italic>- or <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout neurons with exogenous Sema3E ligand according to the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. Given that some Sema3E ligands are naturally present in our striatal cultures from globus pallidus neurons, conducting tests on the exogenous Sema3E effect in the <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout cultures is ideal to minimize experimental variation. In fact, Mtss1 expression was increased by Sema3E replenishment in <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout neurons, whereas it was not altered in <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). Moreover, since Akt is already known to mediate the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling cascade in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burk et al., 2017</xref>), we next examined whether disturbing Akt activity alters Mtss1 expression in cultured neurons. Treatment with an Akt inhibitor, MK2206, downregulated Mtss1 expression but caused no changes in Plexin-D1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–M</xref>). Furthermore, the elevated expression of Mtss1 due to the addition of exogenous Sema3E supplement in <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout neurons was also diminished by MK2206, suggesting that the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 pathway is involved in Mtss1 expression through Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and O</xref>).

Mtss1 overexpression in COS7 cells led to a diverse degree of morphological changes, such as excessively spiky or thin and long processes, and highly localized in F-actin-enriched protrusions. However, overexpression of Mtss1 lacking the I-BAR domain failed to generate these protrusive shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Mtss1 lacking WH2 domain showed much weaker effect because WH2 is an important region for Mtss1 interaction with F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mattila et al., 2003</xref>).

Next, we analyzed neurite length in <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout neurons. Interestingly, there was no difference in neurite length between Drd1a-positive wild-type MSNs and <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout MSNs at DIV3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>), probably due to the low Mtss1 induction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, whereas the length was significantly reduced in the <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-deficient MSNs at DIV6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>). These results suggest the possibility that Mtss1 expression is independent of Plexin-D1 signaling in the young neurons as observed in early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

Moreover, to determine whether Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 can bind directly to each other, we performed an in vitro protein–protein binding assay using the purified ICD of Plexin-D1 and the I-BAR domain of Mtss1 proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, both proteins precipitated together, suggesting that Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 play a role as direct binding partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mtss1 transports Plexin-D1 to the growth cone in cultured direct-pathway MSNs</title><p>Because of the high probability of localization of the Plexin-D1-Mtss1 complex at the cell membrane, Mtss1 may regulate Plexin-D1 function at the cell surface. To investigate the role of Mtss1 in Plexin-D1 activity, we first examined whether Mtss1 affects the Plexin-D1 level on the plasma membrane by performing a surface molecule biotinylation analysis. We observed that overexpressed Plexin-D1 proteins in COS7 cells were efficiently biotinylated on the cell surface, but the Plexin-D1 protein level on the surface was not changed during Mtss1 coexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Another potential mechanism by which Mtss1 may affect Plexin-D1 activity might be endocytic regulation because Plexin-D1 is rapidly endocytosed after Sema3E treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burk et al., 2017</xref>). However, Mtss1 coexpression did not affect Sema3E-induced Plexin-D1 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Additionally, Mtss1 overexpression did not change the binding affinity of Sema3E for Plexin-D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data, including those regarding Sema3E-independent complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), suggest that Mtss1 does not directly affect the functional role of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 at the cell-surface level.</p><p>We next hypothesized that Mtss1 forms a complex with Plexin-D1 that targets Plexin-D1 to filopodium-like structures since we observed that Mtss1 is mainly involved in protrusion formation and neurite outgrowth in cultured cells. To test this possibility, we coexpressed Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 and analyzed their localization in COS7 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>, when Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 were coexpressed, both proteins were mostly present in F-actin-enriched protrusions. However, overexpression of Plexin-D1 lacking the ICD overlapped with Mtss1 to a lesser extent than overexpression of wild-type Plexin-D1, whereas Mtss1 was abundant in the protrusions. In addition, Mtss1 lacking the I-BAR domain, which possesses membrane-bending activity, did not generate filopodia-like protrusions in COS7 cells but was localized with F-actin, including in marginal areas, probably via the Mtss1 WH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mattila et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, although Plexin-D1 was evenly distributed throughout a cell, most Plexin-D1 was not present with Mtss1 missing the I-BAR domain. In addition, the localization of Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 in the protrusions was also not disturbed in the presence of Sema3E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These results suggest that Mtss1 not only induces cell protrusion formation but also contributes to Plexin-D1 localization to specific sites.</p><p>Next, to confirm that Mtss1 leads Plexin-D1 to protrusive structures, such as growth cones in cultured neurons, Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 localization was analyzed by transfecting <italic>Mtss1</italic>-deficient striatal neurons with expression constructs carrying both proteins. Both overexpressed Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 proteins seemed to be colocalized along growing neurites, but the Mtss1 mutant lacking the I-BAR domain showed reduced Plexin-D1 level as well as a low colocalization rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). As shown in COS7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>), wild-type Mtss1 proteins were present with Plexin-D1 in F-actin-enriched regions of growth cones; in contrast, mutant Mtss1 was expressed at a lower level than wild-type Mtss1 and failed to colocalize with Plexin-D1, resulting in reduced Plexin-D1 localization in the growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). However, the intensity of Plexin-D1 upon co-expression of wild-type Mtss1 or mutant Mtss1 remained unchanged in the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). It is plausible that overexpressed proteins accumulate in the soma, and a limited proportion of them are destined to the axon terminal on demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Droz et al., 1973</xref>). To explore the role of Mtss1 in transporting Plexin-D1, we directly monitored the movement of Plexin-D1 along neurites in real time by imaging Drd1a-positive MSNs expressing Plexin-D1-GFP fusion proteins in wild-type and <italic>Mtss1</italic>-knockout neurons at DIV6. Our live-cell imaging showed that the majority of Plexin-D1-containing vesicles were dynamically transported in both proximal and distal directions in wild-type MSNs. In contrast, the Plexin-D1-positive vesicles in <italic>Mtss1</italic>-deficient MSNs remained stationary, and their overall numbers in neurites were also slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–K</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). These observations demonstrate that Mtss1 facilitates the dynamic transportation of Plexin-D1 along the growing neurites of direct-pathway MSNs, leading to an increased rate of Plexin-D1 localization in the growth cones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mtss1 facilitates Plexin-D1 transport to the growth cone in cultured Drd1a-positive medium spiny neurons (MSNs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunocytochemistry for Mtss1-myc or Mtss1ΔI-BAR -myc (green), vsv-Plexin-D1 (red) in the axons of MSNs transfected with vsv-Plexin-D1 and Mtss1-myc or Mtss1ΔI-BAR-myc, using <italic>Mtss1</italic>-null mice as a background.

The AP-Sema3E binding assay has been used in many previous studies as an alternative method to detect endogenous Plexin-D1 protein due to the lack of reliable anti-Plexin-D1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>).

Moreover, we examined whether Mtss1 expression affects Plexin-D1 levels on the Drd1a-tdT-positive tracks at P5 using the same methodology as employed at E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Our findings revealed a decreased ratio of AP-Sema3E binding per tdT staining, suggesting that Mtss1 is implicated not only in axonal projections but also in Plexin-D1 trafficking in navigating striatonigral projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N–Q</xref>).</p><p>We then investigated whether Mtss1 specifically contributes to the development of descending striatonigral projections rather than dendritic arborization.

Collectively, our results confirm that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling activates Mtss1 action, through which striatonigral neurons are extended and steered through the proper route to the target destination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>).</p><p>Finally, since Sema3E-Plexin-D1 is well known to regulate both neural and vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh and Gu, 2013a</xref>), we wondered whether Mtss1 also plays a role in the vasculature as a downstream player of the common guidance cue.

In these processes, the axon terminals are constantly facing both types of signals en route to their destination. In the present study, we show that repulsive guidance cues, namely, Sema3E-Plexin-D1 pairs, induce a dual-functioning facilitator, Mtss1, through which navigating axons ensure incessant extension to their target tissues while exhibiting sensitivity and subsequent steering in response to repulsive signals. In our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), Plexin-D1 on the cell body of direct-pathway MSNs in the striatum receives its specific ligand, Sema3E, through the thalamostriatal projection at the late embryonic stage and induces a unique pool of regulatory factors, including Mtss1. Mtss1 then generates axonal projections to targets in the substantia nigra while enabling Plexin-D1 to transport along axons. In the growth cones, Mtss1 promotes membrane curvature to form a protruding filopodium, and Plexin-D1 is positioned on the cell surface to sense the external repulsive guidance signals from Sema3E. Currently, it is not clear whether Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 are present as a complex at the membrane surface of the growth cone, but Mtss1 does not seem to directly affect the repulsive signaling activation of Sema3E-Plexin-D1. In this way, Mtss1 provides an efficient transport system for its own activator during striatonigral axon growth and potentiates the repulsive guidance cue.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gene expression by axon guidance signaling</title><p>Although many studies have reported the identification of proteins locally synthesized in the axon terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2012</xref>), most proteins required for growth cone behavior are generated in and delivered from the soma. Because of the diverse roles of guidance molecules, such as driving neuronal cell migration, cell death, and axonal regeneration, as well as in traditional axonal navigation in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>), guidance signaling is generally thought to be involved in the activation of a gene expression program in the nucleus. However, few studies have examined gene expression changes induced by guidance signaling at the level of transcriptional regulation, and the most definitive results have been obtained in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell and Bashaw, 2018</xref>). A well-described example is the Frazzled (Fra) receptor in the regulation of midline axon crossing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the truncated ICD of Fra is generated by gamma-secretase and enters the nucleus to activate transcription of the <italic>commissureless (comm</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015</xref>). In a rodent model, microarray analysis of the Robo mutant revealed hundreds of DEGs that may be related to the dynamics of neuronal progenitors in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeh et al., 2014</xref>). Another example is Eph-Ephrin signaling in neural progenitor cells, where Ephrin-B1 reverse signaling downregulates miR-124 expression to inhibit neurogenesis as a posttranscriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arvanitis et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Through a bulk RNA-seq analysis, we showed that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling changed the expression of specific genes, including Mtss1, required for the precise axon guidance of striatonigral neurons. Since ablation of Plexin-D1 expression results in the ectopic formation of thalamostriatal synapses on the MSN cell body as well as on dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), it is likely that Plexin-D1 is expressed in the soma of MSNs and is capable of transmitting gene expression signals. Although Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling regulated the expression of a set of genes in the present study, the precise signaling cascade that extends into the nucleus is still not completely understood. Nevertheless, we cannot dismiss the possibility that Mtss1 expression activation through Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling may be subject to post-transcriptional or translational regulatory mechanisms. Thus, to uncover the molecular mechanism through which these guidance molecules mediate specific gene expression or ensure stability, comprehensive studies on gene regulation in a suitable homogeneous cellular model are necessary. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that diverse extracellular stimuli induce mechanotransduction through dynamic changes in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks, which depend on Rho family proteins to cascade signals in the cytosol and nucleus to activate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dupont and Wickström, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giehl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Percipalle and Visa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Samarakoon et al., 2010</xref>). Previously, Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling was shown to modulate such cytoskeletal rearrangement through the PI3K/Akt pathway in regulating endothelial cell mobility, axonal growth, and growth cone collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aghajanian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burk et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, we found that disturbance of Akt signaling reduced Mtss1 expression in young cultured MSNs, suggesting that activation of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling induces specific molecule expression through similar Akt-mediated actin dynamics.</p><p>Despite the fact that Mtss1 is a downstream molecule under Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, it is still puzzling how Mtss1 expression is specifically and selectively regulated during striatonigral pathfinding. Since Mtss1 expression did not appear to be affected by <italic>Plxnd1-</italic>knockout at early embryonic stages and some level of Mtss1 persisted in cultured neurons lacking <italic>Sema3e</italic> or <italic>Plxnd1</italic>, we cannot exclude the possibility that other pathways activate Mtss1 expression. Nevertheless, it is certain that Mtss1 expression is under Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling activation during striatonigral projection and that, when axons reach their destination at P7, Mtss1 expression is downregulated. Such concurrence of Mtss1 downregulation and axonal projection leads us to speculate that target-derived factor-driven retrograde signaling may be involved in this gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrington and Ginty, 2013</xref>), and elucidating the relevant mechanism may be an interesting objective for future study. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that levels of both Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 were exclusively upregulated during the late gestation to early postnatal period, followed by an abrupt downregulation. Therefore, it is plausible that the activation of Mtss1 relies on the reinforcement of Plexin-D1 signaling. During angiogenic sprouting, the expression of Plexin-D1 in endothelial cells is controlled by VEGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). However, the upstream pathway responsible for Plexin-D1 expression in neurons and the precise regulation of signaling strength in this context is still uncertain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Trafficking of Plexin-D1-Mtss1 in striatonigral neurons</title><p>Another intriguing finding in our study is that Plexin-D1-containing vesicles undergo both anterograde and retrograde movement along neurites in cultured direct-pathway MSNs. Until now, neurotrophin or semaphorin 3A-mediated retrograde trafficking has been extensively studied due to its crucial role in controlling the growth of axons and dendrites, promoting neuronal survival, and facilitating synaptogenesis within the peripheral nervous system. Additionally, finely regulated anterograde transport is essential for replenishing receptors on the growth cone surface to ensure the responses of appropriate target-derived guidance signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamashita, 2019</xref>). We observed that Mtss1 contributes to the Plexin-D1 localization in the growth cone of cultured MSNs and in the terminal region of descending striatonigral projections. Previously, it has been reported that signaling endosomes containing Sema3A/Plexin-A at the axonal growth cones are retrogradely transported to soma. This process facilitates the localization of AMPA receptor GluA2 to the distal dendrites, thereby regulating dendritic development in the cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamashita et al., 2014</xref>). Since it is known that Plexin-D1 plays a role in the somatodendritic synaptogenesis of direct-pathway MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), the connection of the retrograde trafficking Plexin-D1-positive vesicles in this process or other developmental mechanisms like retrograde Sema3A signaling in the soma remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Axon-specific role of Sema3E-Plexin-D1-Mtss1 in striatonigral neuron</title><p>Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling is involved in dendritic synapse formation during the postnatal stage as well as traditional axon projection from the embryonic to the postnatal stage in the basal ganglia circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, since axon projection and synapse formation are sequential events that occur in different cellular compartments during circuit establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuo and Liu, 2019</xref>), Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling may play discrete roles within different parts of a neuron, such as the dendrite versus the axon, through a unique subset of molecules. Indeed, our observations that the duration of Mtss1 expression coincided with active striatonigral axon pathfinding, Mtss1 was significantly expressed on the axonal side, and axon projection defects were observed after Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling disruption suggest that the Sema3E-Plexin-D1-Mtss1 complex appears to mainly regulate axon projection and guidance, at least during striatonigral pathway development. However, the cellular distribution of Mtss1 is somewhat controversial, as its expression is mainly observed on the dendritic side of Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons, and its knockout shows defective dendritic arborization and spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kawabata Galbraith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saarikangas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), while a study has also shown that Mtss1 is more localized in the axoplasmic compartment of Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayn-Leichsenring et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, <italic>Mtss1-</italic> knockout did not show clear dendritic changes in MSNs, at least at P5 when an active axon trajectory occurs; however, given the enlarged ventricle and decreased cortical volume phenotype in knockout adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minkeviciene et al., 2019</xref>), later Mtss1 expression (even at low levels) may affect overall dendritic development. Consistent with this assumption, a previous study reported a slight decrease in dendritic spine density but a slight increase in the number of dendritic crossings without a change in total dendritic length in the direct pathway MSNs of 3- to 4-week-old <italic>Plxnd1-</italic> or <italic>Sema3e-</italic>knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Sema3E-Plexin-D1-Mtss1 complex modulates MSN dendritic development later than the axonal pathfinding period.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Counterintuitive mechanism of attractive and repulsive guidance by Mtss1</title><p>From a traditional guidance point of view, our finding was somewhat unexpected because it was counterintuitive: conventional repulsive guidance cues that mediate growth inhibition induce upregulation of a positive regulator of neurite extension. We revealed that Mtss1 plays a dual role in striatonigral neurons, axon extension by membrane protrusion ability, and axon guidance by efficient Plexin-D1 trafficking to the growth cone. Therefore, our findings represent two important discoveries regarding the axon guidance mechanism. First, axon guidance signaling can switch on the specific regulatory program necessary for facilitating its own function, thereby generating the appropriate machinery to accomplish an intrinsic guidance role during neuronal pathfinding. Second, molecules such as Mtss1 coordinate positive and negative growth potentials in the axonal pathfinding route. Axon guidance cues require various auxiliary proteins to perform their programmed functions, in particular, transporting guidance receptors to the growth cone, endocytic sorting, and activating signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Donnell et al., 2009</xref>), but none of the cofactors discovered to date have induced direct expression regulation of the guidance signaling with which it is involved. Previous studies have shown that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling can switch its role from repulsive to attractive by interacting with the coreceptors neuropilin-1 (Npn1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2) in subiculum neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>). This mechanism is not applicable to developing striatonigral MSNs because the Npn1 receptor is not expressed in early postnatal striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, striatonigral neurons seem to adopt a new strategy, such as activating their own attractive driver to promote axonal growth. From a phenotypic perspective, it is also plausible that the positive or negative guidance roles of Mtss1 may be interdependent. Striatonigral extension defects could potentially lead to inadequate responses to Sema3E signals during pathfinding, consequently resulting in misguided projections. Similarly, guidance defects may disrupt normal signaling processes within the growth cone, thereby transmitting incorrect information for the replenishment of Plexin-D1 to the soma. This erroneous signaling could weaken Mtss1 expression and normal trafficking, ultimately leading to axonal growth defects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Diverse roles of BAR domain proteins in the axon guidance signaling pathway</title><p>Mtss1 promotes membrane curvature through the I-BAR domain and induces the redistribution of lipids in the membrane, thereby increasing the local phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) level at the negatively curved membrane. The elevation of local PIP<sub>2</sub> levels leads to membrane binding of the I-BAR domain via electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, Sema3E binding to Plexin-D1 elevates PIP<sub>2</sub> locally to activate Arf6, resulting in rapid focal adhesion disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sakurai et al., 2011</xref>). Since Mtss1 I-BAR can interact with Plexin-D1 at the curved membrane, the local increase in PIP<sub>2</sub> in the curved membrane region may trigger signaling cascades. Although BAR-domain proteins play pivotal roles in membrane dynamics, a direct association between BAR-domain proteins and axon guidance receptors has not been extensively studied, and functional relevance in vivo is unclear. One example is the srGAP2 protein, which has been studied and shown to bind directly with the SH3 domain of the Robo1 guidance protein in cooperation with the F-BAR and RhoGAP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guez-Haddad et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in endothelial cells, Plexin-D1 forms a complex with SH3BP1, another small GTPase protein containing the N-BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tata et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to the effect of Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 complex formation via the I-BAR domain, SH3BP1 colocalized with Plexin-D1 at lamellipodia in a complex formed via the N-BAR domain and mediates Sema3E-induced cell collapse through Rac1 activity regulation. However, in contrast to the effect of the Mtss1 mutant lacking the I-BAR domain, which failed to change the cell morphology, SH3BP1 lacking N-BAR led to cell collapse. Moreover, Sema3E binding to Plexin-D1 caused SH3BP1 to be released from the complex, whereas Sema3E did not interfere with the Plexin-D1-Mtss1 complex. In addition, the presence of Mtss1 had no effect on the endocytosis of Plexin-D1 by Sema3E or on the ability of Sema3E to bind to Plexin-D1. Hence, it is plausible that Mtss1 plays a role as a facilitator of Plexin-D1 trafficking rather than as a direct downstream signaling transducer such as SH3BP1. Because of the diverse roles played by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 across cell types, the effect of signaling induced by this guidance cue may be determined by distinct downstream molecules that share structural similarities in a relevant biological context. Another intriguing finding is the specific complex formation between Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 in the present study. Plexin-D1 did not form a complex with other BAR-domain-containing proteins, srGAP2 and IRSP53, known to have a role in neurons. While we did not conduct an extensive examination, it is noteworthy that at least two other Plexin proteins were unable to form a complex with Mtss1. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the structural characteristics underlying these interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Variable axon projection defects in direct pathway MSNs mediated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling</title><p>To modulate movement information conveyed through basal ganglia circuitry, two distinct types of striatal MSNs send axonal projections to different targets: a direct-pathway MSN expresses the dopamine D1 receptor to promote movement, and an indirect-pathway MSN expresses the dopamine D2 receptor to inhibit movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Surmeier et al., 2007</xref>). Because of these unique functional and anatomical features, decoding the distinct molecular properties of the two types of MSNs and the regulatory mechanisms involved in circuitry formation is important. A few previous transcriptome analyses have been performed with juvenile and adult mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kronman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lobo et al., 2006</xref>), but an understanding of the molecular repertoire of each MSN during development is very limited. In the present study, Mtss1 was identified as a selective molecule expressed in striatonigral projection neurons mediated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, but its expression is limited to only the early striatonigral projection period; therefore, the previous transcriptome database in adults may have failed to identify Mtss1 as a specific marker molecule in direct-pathway MSNs.</p><p>In this study, Mtss1 expression was found to be relatively high during the perinatal period and then was dramatically downregulated by P7, by which time striatonigral projection has been completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morello et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with a previous study showing that Plexin-D1-positive cells in the striatum were first detected on E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van der Zwaag et al., 2002</xref>), we found that its expression increased in the early postnatal stage. During a similar developing window in the striatonigral pathway, Sema3E was predominantly expressed in the GP and rTh/ZI, which is located in the route to the substantia nigra; therefore, the absence of repulsive Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling resulted in defects in striatonigral projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrman et al., 2013</xref>). However, we did not find ectopic projections, misguidance defects, or enlarged paths in <italic>Mtss1-</italic> or <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout mice. Nevertheless, we observed fewer projections with aberrantly tangled patterns. These discrepancies may be explained by the following observations. First, because we used a genetic model to selectively label the striatonigral projections, we could detect abnormal phenotypes at a better specific resolution. Second, we noticed a certain degree of developmental retardation in the <italic>Mtss1-</italic> or <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-knockout neonates, even among those in the same litter; therefore, we strictly selected samples on the basis of body weight. However, despite the low striatonigral projection formation rate in the <italic>Mtss1-</italic>, <italic>Plxnd1</italic>-, or <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout mice, the adult mice showed a normal overall range of projection boundary size and width, suggesting that a decrease in repulsive signals in the mutants may have widened the descending projections. Third, the mouse genetic background may have led to the observed phenotypic discrepancies. We previously observed that certain vascular phenotypes were more evident in <italic>Sema3e</italic>-knockout mice with a 129SVE background than in those with a C57BL/6 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oh and Gu, 2013b</xref>), implying that relatively minor defects may vary depending on the genetic background.</p><p>Although Sema3E-Plexin-D1 has a similar mechanism of action as a common guidance cue in the nervous and vascular systems, it also exhibits completely different behavior in each system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oh and Gu, 2013a</xref>). For example, the Plexin-D1-Npn1-VEGFR2 complex transmits an attractive signal upon Sema3E binding in specific neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>), but endothelial cells still respond negatively to Sema3E despite the presence of all three receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oh and Gu, 2013b</xref>). Interestingly, Sema3E-Plexin-D1 utilizes Akt-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics for its signaling cascade in both neuronal and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moriya et al., 2010</xref>), and various auxiliary molecules, such as SH3BP1, Arf6, and GIPC1, have been revealed in each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sakurai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tata et al., 2014</xref>). However, only a few of these cofactors have shown a common molecular mechanism and expression by exchanging cells with each other, suggesting that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling requires unique factors to perform different functions. Similarly, we identified Mtss1 as a downstream factor of the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 cue, but its function seems to be limited in neurons, at least in vivo. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate whether Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling activates a specific pool of regulatory factors required for vascular development and to compare this with the results obtained in neurons, which will help us understand the underlying mechanism of specific molecule expression by guidance signaling. Furthermore, given the tremendous complexity of wiring in the central nervous system, it will be intriguing to discover new dual-function molecules similar to those in the Sema3E-Plexin-D1-Mtss1 complex that are involved in the formation of other circuits in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Plxnd1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (<italic>Plxnd1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>Sema3e<sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chauvet et al., 2007</xref>) were maintained on a C57BL/6 (#000664, The Jackson Laboratory) background.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hisashi Umemori (Reviewer #2); Pirta Hotulainen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>, at least in the present form.</p><p>Specifically, all three reviewers agree that this study is interesting with regard to the regulation of Mtss1 mRNA expression by the presence of PlexD1, and the requirement for Mtss1 to mediate Sema3E repulsive signaling in neurons in vitro. However, mechanistic insight is lacking. In particular, two key questions remain unanswered: how does Sema3E-PlexD1 regulate Mtss1 translation? What the actual functional link is between Mtss1 and Sema3E/PlexD1 signaling? If you are able to address these issues, we would be willing to reconsider the story in the form of a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study Kim et al. investigate mechanisms of axon extension and repulsive guidance mediated by signaling involving the secreted semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), its receptor plexin D1 (PlexD1), and the cytosolic membrane remodeling protein metastasis suppressor 1 (Mtss1). Sema3E/PlexD1 signaling has been shown to mediate classical repulsive guidance in developing CNS neurons and vasculature, and also select synapse formation for direct-pathway medium spina neurons (MSNs) that project to the substantia nigra (SNr). Here, the authors show using bulk transcriptomic profiling in striatal tissue that in PlexD1-/- mutants there is a dramatic down regulation of Mtss1 mRNA expression, and this can be observed in the striatum in situ and also when assessing Mtss1 protein biochemically. In heterologous non-neuronal cells in culture the authors show that the PlexD1 cytoplasmic domain and also the Mtss1 I-BAR domain are required for a direct interaction between these two proteins in a Sema3E-independent manner (similar assessment of these interactions in neurons in vivo or culture is not presented). In COS cells it is observed that co-expression of PlexD1 and Mtss1 leads to protrusive shape changes with co-localization of these two proteins that appears in part dependent upon the Mtss1 BAR domain-similar co-localization is seen in striatal neurons in culture. Importantly, Mtss1 is shown to be required for Sema3E neuronal growth cone collapse, and also for normal neurite outgrowth. Significant but modest defects in neuronal pathways reaching the SNr are presented in Mtss1 mutants, and these are shown in the context of the striatonigral pathway to be similar to what is observed in PlexD1 mutants.</p><p>Overall, this study is interesting with regard to regulation of Mtss1 mRNA expression by the presence of PlexD1, and the requirement for Mtss1 to mediate Sema3E repulsive signaling in neurons in vitro. However, we do not learn whether or not Mtss1 functions more generally in PlexD1-expressing cells that respond to Sema3E (i.e. vasculature), what the mechanism of action is regarding how PlexD1 regulates Mtss1 translation, or what the actual functional link is between Mtss1 and Sema3E/PlexD1 signaling-much of these data presented here are correlative.</p><p>1. Figure 1- Are similar effects on Mtss1 expression seen in Sema3E mutants? This is key, regardless of the result, in order to inform conclusions relating to actual activation of PlexD1 signaling with regulating of Mtss1 expression. Further, is there evidence directly showing that in neurons stimulated with Sema3E, Mtss1 expression is increased and, as a control, that this is not observed in Plxnd1-KO neurons. In Figure 1H, is Mtss1 present only in neuronal bodies? And what is the Mtss1 expression pattern in theSNr? Also, is there an explanation for why at P7 (Figure 1G) Mtss1 decreases while PlxnD1 is still elevated?</p><p>2. Page 6 – The claim that failure to see elevated Mtss1 expression in cultured striatal neurons shows that Mtss1 expression is regulated in a &quot;cell autonomous manner&quot; is not supported by this experiment since non-cell-autonomous interactions among these neurons in culture are not ruled out using this approach.</p><p>3. Figure 2 – Are any of these interactions assessed at the level of Western analysis between PlexD1 and Mtss1 observed in neurons, either in culture or in vivo? Further, if PlexD1 loss-of-function (LOF) leads to loss of Mtss1 expression, are the direct interactions between PlexD1 and Mtss1 in any way required to regulate Mtss1 expression (either in heterologous cell culture or in neurons)? Indeed, is Mtss1 mRNA expression regulated by Sema3E/PlexD1 in COS cells? Further, given results from others involving neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) in PlexD1-medated CNS axon guidance (Chauvet et al., 2007), has this co-receptor component been explored in the context of these interactions with Msst1 or Sema3E-dependence for them (or for that matter any other aspects of Mtss1 function in subsequent experiments in this study)?</p><p>4. Figure 3 – Does Sema3E affect the co-localization of PlexD1 and Mtss1 observed in COS cells? Further, the statement on page 8 &quot;….These results confirm that the Plexin-D1 and Mtss1proteins form a complex in specialized cell structures such as filopodia…&quot; is not supported by these imaging data-at best this modest co-localization is correlative.</p><p>5. Figure 4 – These data show a degree of co-localization of overexpressed PlexD1 and Mtss1 in Mtss1-/- neurons and the strong result that Mtss1 is required for Sema3E collapse. However, the conclusion that somehow PlexD1membrane targeting is the mechanism that mediates this effect is not strongly supported by these data. Does loss of Mtss1 affect membrane targeting of exogenous and also endogenous PlexD1? Can a transmembrane domain-containing PlexD1 protein targeted to the membrane affect neuronal morphology independent of Mtss1? Also, does the Mtss1 Bar-domain deletion construct fail to rescue Sema3E growth cone collapse in these neurons in vitro? Finally, what is the link to PlexD1 signaling with regard to effects of Mtss1 on neurite outgrowth? Clearly loss of Mtss1 does affect neurite outgrowth, but this is not directly linked in this study to PlexD1 and appears to be independent of Plexin signaling.</p><p>Also, what are the growth rates and growth cone responses at DIV6? Based on the Western blos from Figure 1L, there is a large difference between expression of Plxnd1/Mtss1 at DIV3 (when Sema3E-treatments were done in Figures 4H and Suppl. Figure 5) and at DIV 6.</p><p>6. Figure 5 – I am not convinced that there is reduced PlexD1 localization on axon trajectories-Sema3E-AP binding is reduced, however so is the trajectory be assessed, so in the absence of a ratiometric assessment of PlexD1 (as evidenced by Sema3E-AP binding) this is not convincing. Further, the statement &quot;….Since no significant change in Plexin-D1 levels was observed in the striatum of Mtss1-deficient mice compared to those in littermate controls…&quot; is not supported by bulk Western analysis of PlexD1 protein since no neuronal localization information is provided by these data.</p><p>7. Figure 6 – Have the authors looked in cross section at the Drd1a-tdT-labeled striatonigral pathways in order to provide data supporting the schematic in panel L? This could include higher resolution assessment of axon numbers in this pathway, which would support the overall conclusions regarding guidance effects mediated by Mtss1.</p><p>8. Have the authors attempted to generalize their analysis of Mtss1 function to the developing vasculature? Given that the strongest results here relate to regulation of Mtss1 mRNA expression by PlexD1 and also the requirement for Mtss1 for neuronal growth cone collapse, generalizing Mtss1 function to other PlexD1-expressing tissues known to respond to Sema3E would strengthen this study.</p><p>9. The authors are urged to review work in the guidance field involving the regulation of transcription by guidance cue receptors so that statements in the Discussion can be brought in line with work in this area (for example, netrin-mediated DCC signaling to the nucleus that regulates commissureless expression-see Russell and Bashaw, 2019, for a review).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Kim, Li et al. identified Mtss1 as a molecule regulated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling and investigated its roles in striatonigral axon growth and turning. They first showed that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling induces Mtss1 expression in striatonigral projecting neurons. They then showed that Mtss1 physically interacts with Plexin-D1 and that Plexin-D1 localization at the axon growth cone appears to be perturbed in the absence of Mtss1. Finally, the authors showed that striatonigral axonal projections are impaired in Mtss1 KO mice, an outcome that is phenocopied in Plexin-D1 KO mice. With these data, the authors propose that Mtss1 is upregulated in response to Sema3E, possibly from the thalamostriatal neurons, through Plexin-D1, then interacts with Plexin-D1, facilitates the transport of Plexin-D1 to the growth cone, and sensitizes striatal axons to Sema3E for axonal repulsion, while contributing to axonal extension. This is a novel and exciting model proposing how axonal growth and pathfinding are regulated in the thalamo-striato-nigral circuit. However, additional data would help fully support their model. Furthermore, images and quantifications could be improved, and quantification methods could be clearly described. Specific points are listed below.</p><p>1. An interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Sema3E from the thalamostriatal neurons upregulates Mtss1 expression in striatonigral neurons. However, currently, the paper only includes the expression pattern of Sema3E. The authors could experimentally show the role of thalamic Sema3E.</p><p>2. Another interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Mtss1 binds to and transports Plexin-D1 to the growth cone. While the authors' data suggest that Plexin-D1 in the growth cone appears to be altered in the absence of Mtss1, the authors could demonstrate that indeed Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 are co-trafficked along axons.</p><p>3. The quality of images could be improved. Also, quantifications are missing for several figures. Furthermore, where quantifications are done, the methods used for the quantifications are not clearly described in the methods.</p><p>4. The discussion can be expanded. The authors may discuss more about their proposed model (Supplementary Figure 7).</p><p>Specific suggestions are listed below.</p><p>1. An interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Sema3E from the thalamostriatal neurons upregulates Mtss1 expression in striatonigral neurons. Regarding this point, the authors could inactivate Sema3E from thalamostriatal neurons and demonstrate the effect on Mtss1 expression and striatonigral axonal pathfinding.</p><p>2. Another interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Mtss1 binds to and transports Plexin-D1 to the growth cone. Regarding this point, the authors could demonstrate that indeed Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 are co-trafficked along axons, ideally with live imaging.</p><p>3. The quality of images should be improved. It is difficult to evaluate colocalization (e.g., Figure 3C, 4A), membrane localization (e.g., Figure 1H), axonal growth and pathfinding from the images presented. Also, quantifications are missing for several figures (including staining and Western blotting). Please quantify (e.g., Figure 1G, 1H, 2). Furthermore, where quantifications are done, the methods used for the quantifications are not clearly described in the methods. Please describe the methods, including the methods of normalization and verification of reproducibility (e.g., Figure 3D, 4B, 4C, 5-7).</p><p>Related to this point, Pearson's R may not be sufficient to establish colocalization as it could be influenced by the amount of protein expression. The authors may perform additional colocalization analysis, for example, by using a pixel scrambled image and demonstrating that the colocalization is not random. Also, the authors may consider quantifying the percent of Mtss1 that is positive for Plexin-D1 and vice versa.</p><p>4. The discussion can be expanded. The authors may discuss more about their proposed model (points #1 to #4 in Supplementary Figure 7), including the mechanistic insights into the roles of Mtss1 in axonal turning vs. growing.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1. The term &quot;cell-autonomous&quot; may not be used appropriately by the authors in the paper. Since the authors propose that Sema3E from the thalamus activates Plexin-D1 to upregulate Mtss1, this does not appear cell-autonomous.</p><p>2. Plexin-D1-Mtss1 binding in a cell line may involve other molecules. Hence the binding could be indirect.</p><p>3. In Figure 4, if Plexin-D1 is not localizing to the growth cone, then where is it localized? The authors could include a lower magnification image showing the cell body and axon and quantify Plexin-D1 localization in these cellular compartments.</p><p>4. The use of AP-Sema3E is an established way of detecting Plexin-D1 localization. However, since it is expected that Mtss1 KO mice would have defects in both Plexin-D1 expression/localization and axon projections, the Sema3E binding may not be sufficient to conclude both &quot;poor neuronal projection&quot; and &quot;reduced Plexin-D1 localization&quot;. Additionally, here, too, the authors need to explain how the quantifications were done to determine the Plexin-D1 positive path (%).</p><p>5. In Supplementary Figure 4E, Mtss1deltaWH2-myc seems to have much weaker effects. Since this construct contains the I-BAR domain, the authors may want to add some explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the developing nervous system, the axons of newly generated neurons extend toward destination targets following an exquisitely designed program. Axon guidance molecules are critical for neuronal pathfinding because they regulate both directionality and growth pace. This study describes a novel role for a Mtss1 in axon guidance. In general this is a good study but as Mtss1 has not been found earlier to be expressed in axons, expression and localization of endogenous Mtss1 in axons should be shown convincingly.</p><p>I think that authors convincingly show that Sema3E-Plexin-D1signaling regulates Mtss1 expression in projecting striatonigral neurons. Also Plexin-D1 – Mtss1 interaction seems clear as well. I like the idea that Plexin-D1 brings Mtss1 to filopodia where Plexin-D1 can bind Sema3E. However, the results presented for this idea were not convincing. First of all, expression and localization of endogenous Mtss1 should be shown. This is especially important because we did not find Mtss1 from axons (Saarikangas et al., Dev Cell 2015, Supplementary figure 2). There can be many reasons for this, age or cell type, for example, but due to this controversy, expression and localization of endogenous Mtss1 in axons must be shown convincingly.</p><p>In Figure 4, overexpressed Mtss1 localization is not supporting the idea of bringing Plexin-D1 to filopodia and plasma membrane. To me this localization looks quite strange. I am not sure what to do with this but maybe localization of endogenous Mtss1 will help here. Maybe overexpressed construct is not folding right? Is it dynamic? Actin looks strange in this cell as well (Figure 4A) (F-actin in the middle, where are filopodia, arcs, lamellipodia?).</p><p>Furthermore, the text says on line 195 that &quot;Mtss1 targeting of Plexin-D1 to the growth cone is critical for robust Sem3E-induced repulsive signaling.&quot; For this, it would be good to show Plexin-D1 localization (endogenous) in Mtss1 cKO cells vs. control cells. Is there a change? Mtss1 overexpression seems to keep Plexin-D in the middle of growth cone rather than bringing Plexin-D to the filopodia and plasma membrane (Figure 4A). Plexin-D localization without Mtss1 overexpression is missing (is there a change in localization?).</p><p>Text says on lines 218-221 that &quot;In mice expressing wild-type Mtss1 showed a significant level of Plexin-D1 in the neuronal pathway reaching the substantia nigra, whereas Mtss1-knockout mice exhibited poor neuronal projection and reduced Plexin-D1 localization on E17.5 (Figure 5A).</p><p>I have struggled by myself in measuring dendrite length in vivo and therefore I ask, how it was ensured that slices are from same depth and same cutting angle? If they vary, does it affect on results?</p><p>These are the critical issues. If Mtss1 is not expressed in axons (just as a possibility), is it possible that it affects axons by other mechanisms?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96891.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We have incorporated new data as suggested by the editors and reviewers and have carefully addressed their comments in the new manuscript. Thank you for your time and effort in helping us improve the quality of our research.</p><p>Key Question 1. how does Sema3E-PlexD1 regulate Mtss1 translation?</p><p>First, to support the Mtss1 expression through Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, we examine Mtss1 levels by adding exogenous Sema3E ligand directly to the cultured Sema3e-deficient striatal neurons at DIV2, prior to in vitro neuronal connections according to the scheme in Figure 2E. Sema3E administration increases Mtss1 expression in cultured MSNs from Sema3e-null striatum, but not from Plxnd1 knockout mice (Figures 2E-2I).</p><p>We also examined the expression of Mtss1 after treatment with an Akt inhibitor, MK2206 because Akt is already known to mediate the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling cascade in neurons (Burk et al., 2017). We found that the inhibition of Akt signaling attenuated the induction of Mtss1 expression by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling in the cultured MSNs (Figures 2J-2M). Additionally, MK2206 treatment attenuated the increased Mtss1 expression caused by the addition of exogenous Sema3E in the Sema3e-knockout neurons (Figures 2N-2O), suggesting that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 pathway is involved in Mtss1 expression through Akt signaling.</p><p>We are highly intrigued by the prospect of deciphering the molecular mechanism through which these repulsive axon guidance molecules mediate specific signaling cascades to regulate gene expression profiles in the future investigations. To pursue this research, we will need to identify an appropriate homogeneous cellular model and conduct in-depth gene regulation studies. We discussed other possibilities in the revised manuscript (Lines 384-417).</p><p>Key Question 2. What the actual functional link is between Mtss1 and Sema3E/PlexD1 signaling?</p><p>To explore the functional link between Mtss1 and Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, we performed a few more experiments. First, we conducted the rescue experiments by overexpressing Mtss1 in the cultured Plxnd1 KO MSNs. As shown in Figures 3K-3L, Mtss1 overexpression rescued the growth reduction phenotype in Plxnd1 KO MSNs, suggesting that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling regulates axonal growth through Mtss1.</p><p>Second, we have shown that Mtss1 is not only involved in axonal projections, but also in Plexin-D1 trafficking in navigation of striatonigral projections. To investigate the functional link in Plexin-D1 trafficking, we performed an AP-Sema3E binding assay to label the endogenous Plexin-D1 in the growth cones of cultured Drd1a-positive MSNs at DIV6 derived from WT or Mtss1 cKO mice. The data show that the intensity of Plexin-D1 was significantly decreased in Mtss1-deficient MSNs compared to WT, indicating that the absence of Mtss1 disrupts the normal trafficking of Plexin-D1 to the growth cones in cultured MSNs (Figures 5L-5M). To further investigate the role of Mtss1 in Plexin-D1 trafficking, we performed the time-lapse live imaging in cultured MSNs from WT or Mtss1 cKO mice. As shown in Figures 5G-5K and Videos 1-4, the dynamic transport of Plexin-D1-containing vesicles was defective in Mtss1-deficient MSNs. These data provide strong evidence that Mtss1 regulates Plexin-D1 trafficking, and its localization in combination with the co-localization analysis in Figures 5A-5F.</p><p>Third, using ratiometric assessment of Plexin-D1 localization in Mtss1-KO mice, we found in vivo evidence that despite reduced neuronal projections in the Mtss1-deficient MSNs, Plexin-D1 localization in striatonigral projections was more severely reduced in Mtss1-KO mice (Figures 7A-7E and 7N-7Q). These findings suggest that Mtss1 plays a role in facilitating the dynamic transport of Plexin-D1 along the growing neurites of direct-pathway MSNs, leading to an increased rate of Plexin-D1 localization in growing cones (Figures 5, 7A-7E, and 7N-7Q).</p><p>Fourth, we performed additional experiments to investigate whether Mtss1-mediated Plexin-D1 localization to the growth cones accelerates the repulsive response to the Sema3E ligand. We performed a growth cone collapse assay in cultured MSNs (Figures 6A-6F). In the initial submission, we found that WT Drd1a-tdT-positive MSNs showed a high collapse rate after exogenous Sema3E treatment, but MSNs lacking Mtss1 exhibited a lower collapse rate. For this revised manuscript, we performed rescue experiments by reintroducing WT Mtss1 into Mtss1-KO MSNs. We found that reintroduction of Mtss1 resulted in significant growth cone collapse, whereas overexpression of Mtss1 without the I-BAR domain, which does not bind to Plexin-D1, showed a reduced response to Sema3E (Figures 6A-6D). We also observed an irregular projection pattern in Mtss1 cKO mice or Plxnd1 cKO or Sema3e KO mice (Figure 8 and Figure 7—figure supplement 10). These results showed that the repulsive signaling by Plexin-D1 in response to Sema3E was significantly impaired by Mtss1 deficiency. However, unlike SH3BP1 or GIPC (Tata et al., 2014; Burk et al., 2017), Mtss1 was not involved in Plexin-D1 endocytosis and Plexin-D1 display on the plasma membrane (Figure 5—figure supplements 5A-D). Therefore, these results suggest that Mtss1 functions as a facilitator of Plexin-D1 trafficking and enhances the repulsive guidance of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling.</p><p>Finally, we conducted experiments to explore whether Mtss1, under the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, also plays a role in the vasculature as a downstream mediator of common guidance cues. However, we found that (1) Mtss1 is not expressed in the developing vasculature and (2) its expression is not induced in the cultured endothelial cells (Figure 8—figure supplement 11). These results suggest that Mtss1 activation by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling pathway and its function in neurons appear to be selective and distinct. We discussed this in the revised manuscript (Lines 538-551)</p><p>Taken together, we believe that our new data provide more compelling evidence to elucidate the mechanism of Mtss1 expression and its functional association with Plexin-D1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study Kim et al. investigate mechanisms of axon extension and repulsive guidance mediated by signaling involving the secreted semaphorin 3E (Sema3E), its receptor plexin D1 (PlexD1), and the cytosolic membrane remodeling protein metastasis suppressor 1 (Mtss1).

We performed the experiments as you suggested and found a reduction in Mtss1 expression in the striatum of Sema3e KO mice (Figures 1F-1G) as well as in the cultured neurons isolated from Sema3e KO (Figures 2C-2D).</p><p>As your suggestion, we checked the expression of Mtss1 in neurons after activating Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling by treating with Sema3E ligand. Mtss1 expression was increased by Sema3E replenishment in Sema3e-knockout neurons, whereas it was not altered in Plxnd1-knockout neurons (Figures 2E-2I).</p><p>Regarding the localization of Mtss1, we observed Mtss1 in the neuronal bodies in the striatum (Figure 1J) and observed in striatonigral axon tract and SNr (Figure 7—figure supplement 7). Intriguingly, we also found Mtss1 in the axonal side of the cultured MSNs at DIV3 (Figure 3A). While we observed the presence of Mtss1 in the SNr region, we cannot exclude the possibility that substantia nigra neurons may express Mtss1 at this stage.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We have also been contemplating deeply about the issue that you have raised. Our study revealed that the regulation of Mtss1 expression is not solely dependent on Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling. As shown in Figures 1K, 1L, 2A, and 2B, Mtss1 expression was observed at basal levels both in vivo and in cultured MSNs even in the absence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling. This indicates the presence of an additional regulatory mechanism in Mtss1 expression. During the developmental stage of P7, which coincides with the arrival of axons at their target destination, there is a noticeable decrease in the expression of Mtss1. This correlation between the reduction of Mtss1 expression and the completion of axonal projection has led us to speculate that retrograde signaling, possibly mediated by target-derived factors, may play a role in regulating the expression of Mtss1. A possible alternative explanation is that certain factors that suppress the expression of Mtss1 may begin to be expressed as Drd1a+ MSNs mature.

We quantified the interaction between Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 in Figure 4F. We attempted to perform co-immunoprecipitation with in vivo striatum tissue to see the direct interaction between them. However, due to the nonspecific band issues of similar sizes, we were not able to clearly see their interaction in vivo and cultured neurons. Instead, we confirmed their direct interaction using pull-down assay using purified proteins as shown in Figure 4G. Furthermore, we performed additional immunoprecipitation experiments to test whether Mtss1 binds to other Plexin family proteins or, conversely, whether Plexin-D1 can interact with any BAR domain-containing protein (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). Our data clearly show that the formation of Mtss1-Plexin-D1 complex is relatively specific.</p><p>In this study, despite endogenous Mtss1 expression, Sema3E treatment did not induce Mtss1 expression in the Plexin-D1-overexpressing Cos7 cells or endothelial cells (Figure 3—figure supplements 3A-B and Figure 8—figure supplement 11C). Thus, we do not believe that the Plexin-D1-Mtss1 interaction is directly involved in the regulation of Mtss1 expression in general. Instead, we clearly demonstrated that Mtss1 functions as a specific transporter for Plexin-D1 trafficking in the direct-pathway MSNs (Figures 5G-5M).</p><p>Neurophilin is not expressed in the striatum (Ding et al., 2013). We mentioned that in the discussion part of revised manuscript (Lines 470-471).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 3 – Does Sema3E affect the co-localization of PlexD1 and Mtss1 observed in COS cells? Further, the statement on page 8 &quot;….These results confirm that the Plexin-D1 and Mtss1proteins form a complex in specialized cell structures such as filopodia…&quot; is not supported by these imaging data-at best this modest co-localization is correlative.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for your question and comments. We observed no effect of Sema3E treatment on the co-localization of Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 in the immunocytochemistry of COS cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 5H) and co-immunoprecipitation (Figures 4E-4F). The results suggest that ,unlike SH3BP1 that binds to Plexin-D1, Mtss1 is not involved in the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling pathway but participated in trafficking of Plexin-D1 from cell body to axons.</p><p>We have deleted the sentence in the revised manuscript as you mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4 – These data show a degree of co-localization of overexpressed PlexD1 and Mtss1 in Mtss1-/- neurons and the strong result that Mtss1 is required for Sema3E collapse. However, the conclusion that somehow PlexD1membrane targeting is the mechanism that mediates this effect is not strongly supported by these data. Does loss of Mtss1 affect membrane targeting of exogenous and also endogenous PlexD1? Can a transmembrane domain-containing PlexD1 protein targeted to the membrane affect neuronal morphology independent of Mtss1? Also, does the Mtss1 Bar-domain deletion construct fail to rescue Sema3E growth cone collapse in these neurons in vitro? Finally, what is the link to PlexD1 signaling with regard to effects of Mtss1 on neurite outgrowth? Clearly loss of Mtss1 does affect neurite outgrowth, but this is not directly linked in this study to PlexD1 and appears to be independent of Plexin signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplements 5A-D. Mtss1 did not affect membrane targeting of Plexin-D1 nor endocytosis of Plexin-D1. Mtss1 was crucial for transportation of Plexin-D1 to the growth cone, as shown in the time-lapse imaging and AP-Sema3E binding experiments in cultured MSNs (Figure 5) and aided to receive repulsive signals to Sema3E (Figure 6). Currently, it is not clear whether Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 are present as a complex at the membrane surface of the growth cone, but at least Mtss1 contributes to Plexin-D1 transport between the soma and the growth cone. We discussed this in the revised manuscript (Lines 363-368).</p><p>Ectopic expression of vsv-Plexin-D1DICD, which does not interact with Mtss1 (Figure 4C) did not rescue the reduced collapse phenotype shown in Plexin-D1-deficient MSNs, whereas full-length Plexin-D1 did.

As shown in Figures 3K-3L, the neurite outgrowth defect was recovered, suggesting that Plexin-D1 controls the axonal length of MSNs at DIV6 via regulation of Mtss1 expression in cultured MSNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, what are the growth rates and growth cone responses at DIV6? Based on the Western blos from Figure 1L, there is a large difference between expression of Plxnd1/Mtss1 at DIV3 (when Sema3E-treatments were done in Figures 4H and Suppl. Figure 5) and at DIV 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. We performed additional experiments at DIV6. As shown in Figures 3I-3J and 6E, the growth rates and growth cone responses of Plxnd1-null MSNs at DIV6 were significantly reduced. Neurite outgrowth in Mtss1-deficient MSNs was impaired at both DIV3 and DIV6. However, axon length abnormalities in Plexin-D1 null MSNs were only observed at DIV6, but not at DIV3 (Figures 3B-3J). We believe that phenotype is due to the fact that Mtss1 was not regulated by Plexin-D1 in the cultured MSNs at DIV3, as shown in Figures 2A and 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5 – I am not convinced that there is reduced PlexD1 localization on axon trajectories-Sema3E-AP binding is reduced, however so is the trajectory be assessed, so in the absence of a ratiometric assessment of PlexD1 (as evidenced by Sema3E-AP binding) this is not convincing. Further, the statement &quot;….Since no significant change in Plexin-D1 levels was observed in the striatum of Mtss1-deficient mice compared to those in littermate controls…&quot; is not supported by bulk Western analysis of PlexD1 protein since no neuronal localization information is provided by these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate to your profound insight and suggestions. As you suggested, we have performed a ratiometric assessment of Plexin-D1 and axons in WT or Mtss1-KO (Figures 7A-7E and 7N-7Q). At E17.5 in Mtss1 cKO mice, both Plexin-D1 and neurofilament decreased in the striatonigral tract, but the decrease in Plexin-D1 was significantly greater than that in neurofilament, as shown in Figures 7A-7E. Furthermore, we performed additional experiments to convince that Mtss1 affects both striatonigral extension and Plexin-D1 trafficking by quantifying the intensity of Plexin-D1 relative to tdT expression in neonatal pups at P5 (Figures 7N-7Q). We believe that these additional data contribute to more confident conclusions in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 6 – Have the authors looked in cross section at the Drd1a-tdT-labeled striatonigral pathways in order to provide data supporting the schematic in panel L? This could include higher resolution assessment of axon numbers in this pathway, which would support the overall conclusions regarding guidance effects mediated by Mtss1.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer recommended, we improved the images of axons in the Drd1a-tdT-labeled striatonigral pathway by using Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Figures 7K, 7R, Figure 7—figure supplement 8A, Figure 7—figure supplement 8D, and Figure 7—figure supplement 10A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Have the authors attempted to generalize their analysis of Mtss1 function to the developing vasculature? Given that the strongest results here relate to regulation of Mtss1 mRNA expression by PlexD1 and also the requirement for Mtss1 for neuronal growth cone collapse, generalizing Mtss1 function to other PlexD1-expressing tissues known to respond to Sema3E would strengthen this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments on our study. To address the reviewer’s points, we obtained endothelial cell-specific Tie2-cre mice and investigated the expression of Mtss1 and its potential role in the developing vasculature using Mtss1 cKO mice (Tie2-cre; Mtss1<sup>f/f</sup>). As shown in Figure 8—figure supplement 11, our results showed that Mtss1 mRNA was not as highly expressed as Plexin-D1 mRNA in the vasculature at E14.5, and we did not observe any significant phenotype in the Mtss1 cKO mice unlike Plxnd1 cKO mice (Gu et al., 2005). In addition, when we performed the Sema3E ligand treatment experiment in endothelial cell lines (HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) or HCMEC/D3 (human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells)), Mtss1 was not induced by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, unlike in the cultured MSNs (Figure 2 and Figure 8—figure supplement 11C). We discussed this in the revised manuscript (Lines 538-554).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors are urged to review work in the guidance field involving the regulation of transcription by guidance cue receptors so that statements in the Discussion can be brought in line with work in this area (for example, netrin-mediated DCC signaling to the nucleus that regulates commissureless expression-see Russell and Bashaw, 2019, for a review).</p></disp-quote><p>We added it in the discussion of revised manuscript (Lines 375-379).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Kim, Li et al. identified Mtss1 as a molecule regulated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling and investigated its roles in striatonigral axon growth and turning. They first showed that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling induces Mtss1 expression in striatonigral projecting neurons. They then showed that Mtss1 physically interacts with Plexin-D1 and that Plexin-D1 localization at the axon growth cone appears to be perturbed in the absence of Mtss1. Finally, the authors showed that striatonigral axonal projections are impaired in Mtss1 KO mice, an outcome that is phenocopied in Plexin-D1 KO mice. With these data, the authors propose that Mtss1 is upregulated in response to Sema3E, possibly from the thalamostriatal neurons, through Plexin-D1, then interacts with Plexin-D1, facilitates the transport of Plexin-D1 to the growth cone, and sensitizes striatal axons to Sema3E for axonal repulsion, while contributing to axonal extension. This is a novel and exciting model proposing how axonal growth and pathfinding are regulated in the thalamo-striato-nigral circuit. However, additional data would help fully support their model. Furthermore, images and quantifications could be improved, and quantification methods could be clearly described. Specific points are listed below.</p><p>1. An interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Sema3E from the thalamostriatal neurons upregulates Mtss1 expression in striatonigral neurons. However, currently, the paper only includes the expression pattern of Sema3E. The authors could experimentally show the role of thalamic Sema3E.</p><p>2. Another interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Mtss1 binds to and transports Plexin-D1 to the growth cone. While the authors' data suggest that Plexin-D1 in the growth cone appears to be altered in the absence of Mtss1, the authors could demonstrate that indeed Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 are co-trafficked along axons.</p><p>3. The quality of images could be improved. Also, quantifications are missing for several figures. Furthermore, where quantifications are done, the methods used for the quantifications are not clearly described in the methods.</p><p>4. The discussion can be expanded.

An interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Sema3E from the thalamostriatal neurons upregulates Mtss1 expression in striatonigral neurons. Regarding this point, the authors could inactivate Sema3E from thalamostriatal neurons and demonstrate the effect on Mtss1 expression and striatonigral axonal pathfinding.</p></disp-quote><p>We highly appreciate the reviewer’s insightful and helpful comments on our manuscript. To address the suggested concern, we observed the phenotype of striatonigral tract in Sema3e KO mice, as observed in Plxnd1 cKO or Mtss1 cKO mice. In Sema3e KO mice, we found a significant reduction in the width of the striatonigral tract, accompanied by irregular projections, as shown in Figure 7—figure supplements 10A-G. It is important to note, however, that this phenotype was comparatively milder than that observed in Plxnd1 cKO or Mtss1 cKO mice. Typically, the receptor phenotype is more severe than the ligand phenotype in axon guidance molecules. This trend is evident in Figures 7K-7M, 7R-7T, 8A-8F, Figure 7—figure supplements 8A-H, and Figure 7—figure supplements 10A-G, where the phenotype in Plxnd1 cKO or Mtss1 cKO mice is more pronounced than in Sema3e KO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another interesting aspect of the proposed model is that Mtss1 binds to and transports Plexin-D1 to the growth cone. Regarding this point, the authors could demonstrate that indeed Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 are co-trafficked along axons, ideally with live imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive comments. We checked the localization of Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 along axons by using structured illumination microscopy (N-SIM). As shown in Figures 5A-5C, Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 proteins colocalized along growing axons, but the Mtss1 mutant lacking the I-BAR domain showed reduced Plexin-D1 levels as well as a low colocalization rate (Due to the reduced intensity, we employed Costes’ randomized pixel scrambled image method for quantification).</p><p>To further address the trafficking issue, we conducted time-lapse live imaging experiment. We generated a Plexin-D1-GFP and Mtss1-RFP fusion DNA construct and co-transfection into MSNs. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect co-transfected healthy MSNs due to extremely low transfection efficiency. Instead, we analyzed the live trafficking of Plexin-D1 from WT or Mtss1 KO MSNs after single transfection of the Plexin-D1-GFP construct (Figures 5G-5K, Videos 1–4). To analyze Plexin-D1 trafficking, we utilized Particle Tracking Recipe in AIVIA microscopy image analysis software (Aivia lnc.). As shown in Figures 5G-5I, both velocity and total distance of Plexin-D1-GFP were significantly reduced in MSNs derived from Mtss1 KO mice. This observation is consistent with the diminished levels of endogenous Plexin-D1 in the growth cone of MSN derived from Mtss1 KO mice (Figures 5L-5M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The quality of images should be improved. It is difficult to evaluate colocalization (e.g., Figure 3C, 4A), membrane localization (e.g., Figure 1H), axonal growth and pathfinding from the images presented. Also, quantifications are missing for several figures (including staining and Western blotting). Please quantify (e.g., Figure 1G, 1H, 2). Furthermore, where quantifications are done, the methods used for the quantifications are not clearly described in the methods. Please describe the methods, including the methods of normalization and verification of reproducibility (e.g., Figure 3D, 4B, 4C, 5-7).</p><p>Related to this point, Pearson's R may not be sufficient to establish colocalization as it could be influenced by the amount of protein expression. The authors may perform additional colocalization analysis, for example, by using a pixel scrambled image and demonstrating that the colocalization is not random. Also, the authors may consider quantifying the percent of Mtss1 that is positive for Plexin-D1 and vice versa.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. We have improved the quality of the images (Figures 5D, 7K, 7R, Figure 7—figure supplements 8A and 8D). And we softened our claims about the colocalization in Figure 5—figure supplement 5F because the reviewer #1 also pointed out it. We replaced Figure 1H into Figures 1H and 1J in the revised manuscript. In addition, we have added the new supporting data in Figure 7—figure supplement 7 to clearly show the localization of Mtss1 in the striatonigral tract in vivo. As the reviewer recommended, we performed the quantifications (Lines 106-107, Figures 1N, 4F, 5C, 5F, and Figure 5—figure supplement 5G). Moreover, the detailed methods for the quantification were described in the Figure legend section and Quantification and Statistical analysis section in Materials and methods (Lines 846-859).</p><p>As commented by the reviewer, we employed Costes’ randomized pixel scrambled image method in Figures 5C, 5F, and Figure 5—figure supplement 5G. Images were analyzed for colocalization using the Just Another Colocalization Program (Jacop) plugin on ImageJ, which statistical data are reported from the Costes’ randomization based colocalization module (Bolte and Cordelieres, 2006) to account for the influence by the amount of protein expression. We described that in the Figure legend section and Quantification and Statistical analysis section in Materials and methods (Lines 846-859).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The discussion can be expanded.

The term &quot;cell-autonomous&quot; may not be used appropriately by the authors in the paper. Since the authors propose that Sema3E from the thalamus activates Plexin-D1 to upregulate Mtss1, this does not appear cell-autonomous.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the phrase in the revised manuscript in accordance with your suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Plexin-D1-Mtss1 binding in a cell line may involve other molecules. Hence the binding could be indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. To explore whether the binding between Plexin-D1 and Mtss1 is direct or not, we performed an in vitro binding assay with the purified Plexin-D1 (intracellular domain) and the I-BAR domain of Mtss1 protein. As shown in Figure 4G, they directly bind to each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 4, if Plexin-D1 is not localizing to the growth cone, then where is it localized? The authors could include a lower magnification image showing the cell body and axon and quantify Plexin-D1 localization in these cellular compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback. We quantified the levels of Mtss1 and Plexin-D1 in the cell body (Figure 5—figure supplements 6A-B) and along axons (Figures 5A-5C) using structured illumination microscopy (N-SIM). Inhibiting the interaction with Mtss1 significantly reduced Plexin-D1 levels in axons. However, the expression levels of vsv-Plexin-D1 or Mtss1-myc or Mtss1DI-BAR -myc in the cell body remained unchanged, at least in our overexpression system. We speculated that this was likely due to the limited proportion of proteins transported to the nerve endings within the total protein pool. Although the extent to which the synthesized proteins in the cell body can be transported to nerve terminals is not fully understood, a previous study in chick peripheral nerve revealed that about 5% of slowly transported proteins can reach to the axoplasm (Droz B. et al., 1973). Thus, we believe that the majority of newly synthesized Plexin-D1 proteins are stored in the cell body and actively transported either anterogradely or retrogradely on demand. We mentioned this possibility in the result part of revised manuscript (Lines 231-234). As shown in Figures 5G-5K and Videos 1-4, the movement of Plexin-D1-positive vesicles dramatically reduced. These results indicate that Mtss1 facilitates the dynamic transportation of Plexin-D1 along the growing neurites of MSNs, leading to an increased rate of Plexin-D1 localization in the growth cones, as shown in Figures 5L-5M. We discussed this in the revised manuscript (Lines 418-432).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The use of AP-Sema3E is an established way of detecting Plexin-D1 localization. However, since it is expected that Mtss1 KO mice would have defects in both Plexin-D1 expression/localization and axon projections, the Sema3E binding may not be sufficient to conclude both &quot;poor neuronal projection&quot; and &quot;reduced Plexin-D1 localization&quot;. Additionally, here, too, the authors need to explain how the quantifications were done to determine the Plexin-D1 positive path (%).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s valuable comments. As the reviewer#1 suggested, we conducted a ratiometric evaluation of Plexin-D1 and axons in WT or Mtss1-KO, as shown in Figures 7A-7E and 7N-7Q. At E17.5 in Mtss1 cKO mice, both Plexin-D1 and neurofilament exhibited a decrease in the striatonigral tract. However, reduction in Plexin-D1 was notably more significant than that in neurofilament, as shown in Figures 7A-7E. Additionally, we performed supplemental experiments to substantiate that Mtss1 influences both striatonigral extension and Plexin-D1 trafficking by quantifying the intensity of Plexin-D1 relative to tdT expression in neonatal pups at P5 (Figures 7N-7Q). We believe that these additional data contribute to more confident conclusions in our study. We described the quantification method in Figure7 legend (Lines 1204-1207).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Supplementary Figure 4E, Mtss1deltaWH2-myc seems to have much weaker effects. Since this construct contains the I-BAR domain, the authors may want to add some explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Mtss1 lacking the WH2 domain showed a much weaker effect because WH2 is an important region for Mtss1 interaction with F-actin (Mattila et al., 2003). We explained that in the result part of revised manuscript (Lines 148-149).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the developing nervous system, the axons of newly generated neurons extend toward destination targets following an exquisitely designed program. Axon guidance molecules are critical for neuronal pathfinding because they regulate both directionality and growth pace. This study describes a novel role for a Mtss1 in axon guidance. In general this is a good study but as Mtss1 has not been found earlier to be expressed in axons, expression and localization of endogenous Mtss1 in axons should be shown convincingly.</p><p>I think that authors convincingly show that Sema3E-Plexin-D1signaling regulates Mtss1 expression in projecting striatonigral neurons. Also Plexin-D1 – Mtss1 interaction seems clear as well. I like the idea that Plexin-D1 brings Mtss1 to filopodia where Plexin-D1 can bind Sema3E. However, the results presented for this idea were not convincing. First of all, expression and localization of endogenous Mtss1 should be shown. This is especially important because we did not find Mtss1 from axons (Saarikangas et al., Dev Cell 2015, Supplementary figure 2). There can be many reasons for this, age or cell type, for example, but due to this controversy, expression and localization of endogenous Mtss1 in axons must be shown convincingly.</p><p>In Figure 4, overexpressed Mtss1 localization is not supporting the idea of bringing Plexin-D1 to filopodia and plasma membrane. To me this localization looks quite strange. I am not sure what to do with this but maybe localization of endogenous Mtss1 will help here. Maybe overexpressed construct is not folding right? Is it dynamic? Actin looks strange in this cell as well (Figure 4A) (F-actin in the middle, where are filopodia, arcs, lamellipodia?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable comments from the reviewer. The indicated image has been replaced with a new one (Figure 5D). We believe that the F-actin enriched structure in the center of the growth cone is an F-actin arc. Furthermore, Mtss1 was not involved in the plasma membrane localization of Plexin-D1 (Figure 5—figure supplements 5A-B). Instead, Mtss1 facilitates Plexin-D1 trafficking from the cell body to the axons (Figures 5, 7A-7E, 7N-7Q, and Videos 1-4). Notably, we observed endogenous Mtss1 expression in axons of cultured MSNs (Figure 3A) at DIV3 in vitro and in striatonigral projecting axons (Figure 7—figure supplement 7) in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the text says on line 195 that &quot;Mtss1 targeting of Plexin-D1 to the growth cone is critical for robust Sem3E-induced repulsive signaling.&quot; For this, it would be good to show Plexin-D1 localization (endogenous) in Mtss1 cKO cells vs. control cells. Is there a change? Mtss1 overexpression seems to keep Plexin-D in the middle of growth cone rather than bringing Plexin-D to the filopodia and plasma membrane (Figure 4A). Plexin-D localization without Mtss1 overexpression is missing (is there a change in localization?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s constructive suggestions. As shown in Figures 5L-5M, we observed the diminished level of endogenous Plexin-D1 in the growth cone of MSN derived from Mtss1 cKO mice compared to control.
