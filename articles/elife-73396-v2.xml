variant, androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7), in prostate cancer is correlated with poor patient survival and resistance to AR targeted therapies and taxanes. Currently, there is no specific inhibitor of AR-V7, while the molecular mechanisms regulating its biological function are not well elucidated. Here, we report that AR-V7 has unique biological features that functionally differentiate it from canonical AR-fl or from the second most prevalent variant, AR-v567. First, AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics via a pathway distinct from the nuclear localization signal dependent importin-α/β pathway used by AR-fl and AR-v567. We also show that the dimerization box domain, known to mediate AR dimerization and transactivation, is required for AR-V7 nuclear import but not for AR-fl. Once in the nucleus, AR-V7 is transcriptionally active, yet exhibits unusually high intranuclear mobility and transient chromatin interactions, unlike the stable chromatin association of liganded AR-fl. The high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 together with its high transcriptional output, suggest a Hit-and-Run mode of transcription. Our findings reveal unique mechanisms regulating AR-V7 activity, offering the opportunity to develop selective therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AR-V7</kwd><kwd>prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>intranuclear mobility</kwd><kwd>transcriptional activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 CA203702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seaho</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 CA062948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Au</surname><given-names>CheukMan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA137020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giannakakou</surname><given-names>Paraskevi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA216800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giannakakou</surname><given-names>Paraskevi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA228512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giannakakou</surname><given-names>Paraskevi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA179100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rickman</surname><given-names>David S</given-names></name><name><surname>Giannakakou</surname><given-names>Paraskevi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-17-1-0162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Adeline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32CA220988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukhtar</surname><given-names>Eiman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Advanced microscopy techniques reveal unique biological features that distinguish androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) from the canonical AR, including high intranuclear mobility and rapid nuclear import that occurs independently of importin-α/β.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Androgen receptor (AR) remains a critical therapeutic target in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), due to overactive AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman and Feldman, 2001</xref>). Next-generation AR inhibitors targeting either androgen biosynthesis (abiraterone acetate) or AR ligand binding (enzalutamide) have shown improved clinical outcomes including survival. However, these new therapies are not curative due to the development of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2015</xref>). Expression of active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) which re-activate AR transcriptional program in CRPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonarakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maughan and Antonarakis, 2015</xref>) is one of the key drivers in disease progression and is believed to be one mechanism of resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Structurally, the majority of AR-Vs lack the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is the target of most AR-targeted therapies, and are constitutively active in the nucleus driving AR-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Uo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Watson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Among more than 20 alternatively spliced AR variants identified to date, AR-V7, which arises from cryptic exon inclusion, is the most prevalent variant in CRPC followed by the exon-skipping AR-v567.

Together these data suggest that AR-V7 is a driver of CRPC progression and a desirable therapeutic target. However, the exact mechanism(s) underlying AR-V7 oncogenic functions are not well understood. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), transcriptomic, and epigenetic studies have identified AR-V7 cistromes and target genes, both distinct and shared with AR-fl, as well as splicing factors that drive AR-V7 production, in an effort to elucidate potentially unique to AR-V7 regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melnyk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previously we showed that AR-fl binds microtubules (MTs) via the hinge domain and uses them as tracks for fast nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thadani-Mulero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). Taxanes stabilize MTs and inhibit AR signaling by impairing AR-fl nuclear import and subsequent activation of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonarakis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darshan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thadani-Mulero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to AR-fl, the hinge-containing AR-v567 binds MTs and is sensitive to taxane treatment.

Nuclear import is mediated by a conserved bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif, which in AR-fl and AR-v567 is comprised of parts of exons 3 and 4. AR-V7 lacks exon 4, which is the second half of the canonical bipartite NLS, and although its cryptic exon 3 has been implicated in NLS reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>), the canonical NLS motif of AR-V7 is compromised. Yet, AR-V7 is constitutively localized to the nucleus in both cell lines and clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watson et al., 2010</xref>), indicating efficient nuclear import. To measure basal nuclear import kinetics of the AR-Vs (AR-V7, AR-v567, and AR-fl), plasmids encoding each GFP-tagged AR were microinjected into the nuclei of AR-null PC3 cells and nuclear translocation kinetics was monitored by live-cell time-lapse confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). For each protein, we calculated the extent and rate of nuclear import by quantifying the % nuclear GFP-AR protein in single cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). AR-fl remained largely in the cytoplasm under basal condition, exhibiting ~20% nuclear accumulation which remained steady over the duration of the experiment, indicating very low basal nuclear import kinetics. AR-v567 reached a maximum of ~50% by 90 min. In contrast, AR-V7 exhibited fast nuclear import kinetics, reaching ~50% nuclear accumulation within the first 25 min and ~75% nuclear accumulation by 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data suggested that AR-V7 exhibited the highest basal nuclear import rates, likely via a more efficient nuclear import mechanism. It is established that canonical AR-fl utilizes the classical importin-α/β nuclear import mechanism where the importin-α binds to the NLS of AR protein followed by importin-β binding, forming a trimeric (cargo-NLS/importin-α/importin-β) complex in the cytoplasm which enters the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) using the Ran-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pemberton and Paschal, 2005</xref>). To identify the mechanisms mediating AR-V7 nuclear import, we examined the involvement of the MT-transport system and the importin-α/β-Ran-GTP pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darshan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenster et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaku et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thadani-Mulero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). We analyzed the translocation kinetics of each variant by live-cell time-lapse imaging using chemical probes that disrupt MTs (docetaxel [DTX]) or importin-β (Importazole [IPZ]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–1D</xref>). In agreement with our published data, AR-fl readily translocated to the nucleus upon addition of the synthetic AR ligand R1881, while perturbation of MTs with DTX, abrogated this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thadani-Mulero et al., 2014</xref>). IPZ inhibited the R1881-induced AR-fl nuclear translocation, confirming the role of importin-β in the canonical AR-fl nuclear import pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaku et al., 2008</xref>), and that AR-v567 shares the same pathway of nuclear import with AR-fl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, neither DTX nor IPZ had an effect on AR-V7 nuclear localization, indicating that nuclear import of AR-V7 is both MT and importin-α/β independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics independently of microtubules or the importin-α/β pathway, unlike AR-fl or AR-v567.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

We observed a similar pattern of intranuclear kinetics for each protein, when co-expressed in the same sub-nuclear area, as the kinetics observed when each protein was expressed alone with fast AR-V7 fluorescence recovered vversus slow recovery of ligand-bound AR-fl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DNA binding mutation abrogates AR-V7 transactivation and accelerates nuclear mobility kinetics</title><p>To resolve the conundrum between the high nuclear mobility of AR-V7 and its high transcriptional activity, we introduced the A573D DBD mutation into AR-V7 or AR-fl expression plasmids and introduced them into PC3 cells. We detected a significant increase in the mobility of the mutant AR-fl-A573D compared to AR-fl, in the presence of ligand, with T ½ of 4 s versus 17 s, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). No difference was observed in the absence of ligand, suggesting that immobilization of the ligand-bound AR-fl is mediated by theDBD of AR-fl. Surprisingly, we found that the already high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 was further accelerated by the DBD mutation with recovery T ½ for AR-V7-A573D at 2 s vversus 4 s for AR-V7, p&lt;0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These data suggested that DNA-binding mediates the transient chromatin interactions exhibited by AR-V7. Next, we examined the effect of the DBD mutation on the transcriptional output of AR-fl and AR-V7, using ARE-mCherry expression as a transcriptional readout in single cells, or target gene mRNA expression by RT-qPCR in cell populations. Our results revealed that the A573D mutation abrogated transcriptional activity in both, ligand-bound AR-fl and AR-V7, as evidenced by the significant decrease in ARE-mCherry expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>).

Reactivation of AR signaling is a hallmark of CRPC, largely mediated by the nuclear activity of the AR splice variant AR-V7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonarakis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonarakis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hörnberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maughan and Antonarakis, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identify that AR-V7 nuclear import does not use the canonical NLS-dependent importin-α/β pathway, in contrast to AR-fl and AR-v567. Earlier findings suggested that the C-terminal cryptic exon 3 (CE3) domain of AR-V7 might mediate its nuclear import due to it similarity with the second bipartite NLS of AR-fl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). The same study, also showed that a synthetic truncated AR-V7 lacking the CE3 domain, did not bind importin-β, yet was transcriptionally active in the nucleus. These data not only show the CE3 motif is dispensable for nuclear import, but they are also consistent with our results where pharmacologic inhibition of importin-β, has no effect on AR-V7 nuclear localization confirming an NLS-independent mechanism of AR-V7 nuclear entry. The molecular weight of AR-V7 protein together with its cytoplasmic sequestration upon nucleoporin inhibition suggest that AR-V7 requires active transport via the NPC, likely using nuclear transporters known to recognize proteins without a classical bipartite NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importin 11 (IPO11), is such an alternative nuclear transport receptor, recently shown to mediate PTEN nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Using a catalytic mutant IPO11 we observed no effect on AR-V7 nuclear import, suggesting that other nuclear transport receptors may be involved. In ongoing work beyond the scope of this manuscript, we are systematically testing the impact of each importer on AR-V7 nuclear localization. Alternative mechanisms of nuclear import may rely on the recognition of post-translational modifications that mediate AR-V7 recognition by another beta-like nuclear importer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Putker et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that the same inactivating mutations introduced in the D-box domain (A596T and S597T), identified in patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centenera et al., 2008</xref>), had a different effect on AR-fl compared to AR-V7. It is well established that the D-box domain is important for AR dimerization in the nucleus,which occurs prior to DNA binding, and that mutations in this domain impair nuclear AR dimerization and activation of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van Royen et al., 2012</xref>). Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) showed that D-box mutations in AR-V7 inhibited AR-V7 homodimerization in the nucleus. In addition, our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) revealed that D-box mutant AR-V7 is transcriptionally inactive because it is sequestered in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the D-box domain may be important for the nuclear translocation of AR-V7, which is distinct from its function in AR-fl.</p><p>Analysis of single PC3 cells co-expressing tagged AR-FL and AR-V7, showed significant increase in AR-fl nuclear localization, in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) in agreement with recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested a potential physical interaction between the two proteins in the cytoplasm and a shared mechanism of nuclear import. To test this hypothesis, we used IPZ to inhibit importin-α/βmediated AR-fl nuclear import and observed no effect on AR-V7, implying that AR-V7 and AR-fl use independent nuclear import pathways and that likely there is no physical interaction between the two proteins in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Along these lines, previous studies showed that AR-V7 does not co-precipitate with AR-fl and that they form a physical complex in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roggero et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, when the transcriptionally inactive AR-V7-A537D mutant was co-expressed with AR-fl, we observed a similar fractional increase in AR-fl nuclear translocation, in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-E</xref>) implicating non-transcriptional mechanisms. It should be noted that the mere localization of AR-fl in the nucleus in castrate conditions does not imply AR signaling activation. Taken together our own findings and published results, we posit that there is no evidence that AR-V7 mediated fractional increase in nuclear AR-fl contributes to the overall activity of AR-V7 in driving castrate-independent growth in PC.</p><p>This study also revealed unique nuclear biology of AR-V7, distinct from that of ligand-bound AR-fl, suggesting a distinct mode of transcriptional action. The chromatin binding dynamics of nuclear hormone receptors (glucocorticoid, progesterone, estrogen, and androgen) have been closely correlated with their respective transcriptional output and affinity to their ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farla et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klokk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McNally et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stenoien et al., 2001</xref>). It is well established that AR-V7 is constitutively active in the nucleus having largely overlapping cistromes and target genes with canonical AR-fl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cato et al., 2019</xref>). Herein, using live-cell imaging and photo-conversion to quantify subnuclear dynamics of AR proteins, we show that ligand-bound AR-fl is transcriptionally active and exhibits low intranuclear mobility, prolonged residence time on chromatin. and high occupancy rates on promoter AREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Conversely, AR-V7 is transcriptionally active, yet exhibits unusually high intranuclear mobility and transient chromatin interactions with low occupancy rates. The high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 together with its high transcriptional output, suggest a Hit-and-Run model of transcription, where a transcription factor (TF) transiently binds a DNA sequence to regulate target genes (the ‘hit’), and before vacating the site (the ‘run’) recruits secondary TFs which form stable complex at the regulatory site that sustain a stable long-term effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charoensawan et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the Hit-and-Run is often applied to transcriptional repressors, where gene silencing does not necessarily require continuous TF residence on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shah et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, a recent study showed that AR-V7 functions as a transcriptional repressor in CRPC, preferentially binding several co-repressors compared to AR-fl, likely due to differences in H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cato et al., 2019</xref>). This mode of transcription is likely to be promoted by structural differences relative to AR-fl and post-translational modifications specific to AR-V7. It has also been shown that the chromatin residence of nuclear receptors, such as estrogen receptor, can be slowed in the presence of antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guan et al., 2019</xref>), and the effect of N terminal domain AR inhibitors on the intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 remains to be determined. Finally, the reported diversity of AR-V7 regulated transcriptomes across patients with CRPC, which likely results from the cell-context specific AR-V7 cistromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) is compatible with a Hit-and-Run mode of transcription that allows for fast adaptation to environmental cues. The role of these intrinsic differences between AR isoforms in promoting their unique modes of transcriptional action remains to be investigated. The precise machinery regulating the rapid nuclear import of AR-V7 and its therapeutic relevance will be a subject of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>PC3, LNCaP, C4-2, HEK-293T, and 22Rv1 cell lines were obtained from the ATCC.

receptor (AR) that lacks the androgen-binding domain, is constitutively active, and is typically expressed as prostate cancers become resistant to anti-androgen therapies. Clinically, there is intense interest in overcoming anti-androgen resistance, and part of this includes understanding differences between AR-V7 and AR, to be able to therapeutically target AR-V7. This manuscript provides a robust analysis of the regulation of nuclear import and the chromatin-binding features of AR-V7 versus AR. The work reveals that AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics in an NLS- and importin-α/β- independent manner, dependent on the dimerization (D-box) domain mediates AR-V7 nuclear import, revealing a new function for this domain versus its role in the full-length AR. The work also shows that AR-V7 employs an unconventional mode of transcription characterized by high intranuclear mobility, with transient and unstable chromatin interactions, likely reflecting a &quot;Hit-and-Run&quot; mechanism. This greatly enlarges the mechanistic understanding of AR-V7 function, and may help with developing new therapeutic agents.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73396.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Golemis</surname><given-names>Erica A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0567t7073</institution-id><institution>Fox Chase Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Isaacs</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.06.03.446940">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.03.446940v1.abstract">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Prof. Dr. John T. Isaacs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agree that the experiments are carefully performed and the data are convincing, and the study is important. The reviewers concur that there are some experiments that are essential to solidify the findings.</p><p>1. The authors show that neither DTX or IPZ affect AR-V7 nuclear localization, suggesting that nuclear import of AR-V7 is independent of microtubules and importin-B. However, the authors do show that WGA, an inhibitor of nucleoporin-mediated transport, results in cytoplasmic sequestration of AR-V7. They suggest in the discussion that a β-like importin family member with the capacity to mediate import for proteins without a classical NLS might be a candidate importer. This should be investigated more thoroughly and some attempt made to nominate the nuclear transporter for AR-V7, as this would further delineate how the regulation of AR-V7 and AR-FL differ, and is directly related to the main thrust of the authors' manuscript.</p><p>2. One major issue throughout is that most studies are done by ectopic expression of tagged plasmids in AR-null cells (PC3). It is unclear if these results would hold in situations where AR-V7 and AR-FL are co-expressed. Some of the key experiments – for example Figure 1F, Figure 2, Figure 3A, etc. should be performed in cell lines co-expressing AR-V7 and AR-FL (22RV1, VCaP, and LN95), with and without isoform-specific knockdown of AR-FL/AR-V7. Additionally, C-terminal endogenous tagging of AR-FL and AR-V7 by CRISPR-mediated knockin, followed by a repeating of some of these same experiments, should be considered.</p><p>3. The results in Figure 3A suggest that co-expression of AR-V7 and AR-FL increases AR-FL expression in the nucleus under basal conditions. This is intriguing and may be consistent with the findings of Watson et al., PNAS 2010, suggesting that AR-V7 activity requires AR-FL expression. Increased AR-FL nuclear localization under low androgen conditions may also drive castration resistance, and perhaps AR-V7 drives this indirectly by promoting AR-FL nuclear import, rather than directly. Can the authors determine whether the increased nuclear AR-FL upon AR-V7 co-expression is active (by reporter gene activity or the expression of downstream targets)? Does co-expression or AR-V7 and AR-FL in an AR-dependent line drive increased AR-FL nuclear localization and enzalutamide resistance? Although IPZ treatment indicated that FL-AR import still requires importin, it does not rule out the possibility that FL-AR and AR-V7 may dimerize within the nucleus and lead to increased nuclear retention of FL-AR. This can be tested using a D-box mutant of FL-AR co-expressed with AR-V7.</p><p>Optional Revisions</p><p>1. Figure 1D – is there a specific reason why this experiment was done in M12 cells while most other experiments seem to be done in PC3?</p><p>2. Can the authors more clearly label what is the difference between the &quot;AR-V7 with AR-fl&quot; and &quot;AR-fl with AR-V7&quot; conditions in Figure 3B?</p><p>3. Figure 4C – to eye, all the replicate dots look identical (but perhaps there is just very little variability between them?). Please double check this. Statistics also needed for this panel. Also would check some additional AR-V7 target genes as delineated in Cato et al., Cancer Cell 2019 (Figure 2). Particularly given that study and authors' data suggesting that AR-V7 is a repressor, would make sense to check the impact on genes that are repressed, rather than activated by AR-V7.</p><p>4. The authors could expand the discussion to emphasis their thoughts as to the implication of the differences between AR FL vs. ARv7 driven transcriptional regulation.</p><p>5. The authors have determined that RanGTPase activity and the nucleoporin complex are partially required for nuclear import of AR-V7. It might benefit the readers if the authors can briefly describe what other mechanisms exist which can explain these findings.</p><p>6. In Figure 4D, the DNA binding mutant (A573D) does not seem to affect AR-V7 nuclear localization, but it was not quantified and not mentioned in the text. It would be helpful to include the quantification data.</p><p>7. In figure 5, the authors showed that co-expression of AR-V7 with FL-AR does not affect AR-V7 mobility when the FL-AR is activated by R1881. It would be interesting to see whether AR-V7 mobility is changed in the presence of Apo-AR as a fraction of Apo-AR may dimerize with AR-V7 and activate a subset of genes using mechanisms which are different from FL-AR and AR-V7 alone.</p><p>8. Although it has been suggested that fast nuclear mobility of AR appears to be associated with antagonist bound AR, however, it has also been shown recently that ER antagonist/SERDs immobilized ER on chromatin and which may account for the antagonist activities of these compounds (Guan et al., Cell 2019). Furthermore, with respect to GR, it has been shown that the intranuclear mobility of this receptor correlated with the affinity of the ligand with which this receptor binds. Therefore, these other previous findings should be discussed in the context of the current finding.</p><p>9.

Given that AR-V7 does not contain a canonical NLS and ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor PTEN, also without canonical NLS, facilitates its nuclear import via importin-11 (IPO11), we tested the involvement of IPO11 in AR-V7 nuclear import. Using a dominant-negative mutant IPO11, which abrogates its nuclear import function, we show no effect on AR-V7 nuclear localization. This data is now shown in Figure 1- supplement 2. In ongoing studies beyond the scope of this manuscript, we plan to systematically test the involvement of individual nuclear import receptors, including non-canonical importins and transportins with knockdown experiments. The discussion is updated to reflect these new findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Specifically, we have confirmed the results shown in Figure 2 on the effect of the catalytic mutant RanQ69L on the impaired nuclear localization of AR-V7, in C4-2 cells with endogenous AR-fl stably expressing inducible GFP-AR-V7. In addition, transient transfection of cells endogenously co-expressing AR-fl and AR-V7, such as 22RV1 cells, corroborated the above findings. These data are now shown in Figure 2-supplment 1 and discussed in results and discussion. We have expanded and clarified the methods to reflect this.</p><p>To confirm the partial cytoplasmic accumulation of AR-V7-D-Box, observed following microinjection in PC3 cells (Figure 2C-2D, original submission), we generated C4-2 cells with endogenous AR-fl to stably express doxycycline inducible GFP-AR-V7 D-Box mutant. Quantitation of the subcellular localization of the AR-V7 D-Box mutant revealed statistically significant increase in AR-V7’s cytoplasmic localization in the presence of the D-Box mutations, further suggesting that the D-Box domain may be involved in AR-V7 nuclear localization. These data are now displayed in new Figure 2E-2F and discussed in the text.</p><p>Finally, we considered the CRISPR knock-in tagging suggestion, however, it is unfortunately not feasible as AR-V7 is an RNA splice variant and not present in the genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

However, due to the very small number of cells co-expressing both constructs, we could not reliably use reporter gene activity which reflects population averaging. To answer this important question, we are currently developing a single-cell sensitive AR-fl-specific fluorescent reporter assay so that we can image single cells that co-express both proteins and get a fluorescent readout, indicative of active AR-fl.</p><p>To answer the question of whether co-expression or AR-V7 and AR-FL in an AR-dependent line drive increased AR-FL nuclear localization, we have co-transfected an AR-dependent line (LNCaP) with AR-fl and AR-V7 and observed increased nuclear localization of AR-fl in the presence of AR-V7. In addition, a similar experiment performed in C4-2 cells with inducible AR-V7 confirmed the effect of AR-V7 on enhanced AR-fl nuclear localization. These data are now shown in figure 3C and 3F, respectively. As the number of LNCaP cells co-expressing both AR-Fl and AR-V7 was less than 10% of the transfected population, enzalutamide resistance could not be assessed using population-averaging classical cytotoxicity assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional Revisions</p><p>1.

The authors could expand the discussion to emphasis their thoughts as to the implication of the differences between AR FL vs. aRv7 driven transcriptional regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have added elaborating ideas to the Discussion section. We highlight those alternate modes of transcriptional action for AR-V7 may be promoted by differences in protein structure and post-translational modifications relative to AR-fl. Cato et al. suggest that AR-V7 binds preferentially to transcriptional co-repressors, likely due to differences in H3K27 acetylation. How structural differences may impact co-regulator binding with AR-V7 relative to AR-fl remain to be investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors have determined that RanGTPase activity and the nucleoporin complex are partially required for nuclear import of AR-V7. It might benefit the readers if the authors can briefly describe what other mechanisms exist which can explain these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Our work revealed the partial requirement for RanGTPase activity in AR-V7 nuclear import by utilizing a RanQ96L mutant, which has lowered intrinsic GTPase activity. This suggests that RanGTPase is not the only factor that regulates the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of AR-V7, yet it plays a role. Functionally, this may suggest that AR-V7 can enter the nucleus even if its nuclear importer is not re-exported into the cytosol. To clarify, our work also showed that AR-V7 import depends completely on its passage through the nuclear pores. We have edited the discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

However, this would be challenging to measure since the fraction of Apo-AR present in the nucleus is likely to be low relative to the amount of AR-V7, and we would not see a meaningful difference in FRAP studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
