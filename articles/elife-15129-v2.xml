However, the mechanisms used to expose DSBs to the repair machinery and to restore the chromatin organization after repair remain elusive. Here we show that induction of a DSB in human cells causes local nucleosome disassembly, apparently independently from DNA end resection. This efficient removal of histone H3 from the genome during non-homologous end joining was promoted by both ATM and the ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeler INO80. Chromatin reassembly during DSB repair was dependent on the HIRA histone chaperone that is specific to the replication-independent histone variant H3.3 and on CAF-1 that is specific to the replication-dependent canonical histones H3.1/H3.2. Our data suggest that the epigenetic information is re-established after DSB repair by the concerted and interdependent action of replication-independent and replication-dependent chromatin assembly pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15129.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15129.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DSB repair</kwd><kwd>NHEJ</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>disassembly</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd><kwd>H3.3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA95641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The human genome is unpackaged to allow DNA breaks to be joined back together, and then repackaged into chromosomes afterwards.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decades of studies have emphasized the critical importance of chromatin components, whose nature and spatial organization regulate cellular function and identity, including DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deem et al., 2012</xref>). DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur intrinsically during normal cell metabolism, or are caused by exogenous agents, such as ionizing radiation (IR) or some classes of chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, DSBs are essential intermediates during programmed recombination events, such as meiosis, budding yeast mating-type switching, and lymphocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mimitou and Symington, 2011</xref>). Unrepaired and/or inappropriately repaired DSBs can be cytotoxic lesions, posing a severe challenge to maintaining genome integrity. Eukaryotic cells have evolved two mechanistically distinct pathways to repair DSBs: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ceccaldi et al., 2016</xref>). In mammalian cells NHEJ is responsible for repairing the majority of DSBs throughout the cell cycle, while HR is mostly active in late S and G2 phases when a sister homolog is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kass and Jasin, 2010</xref>). Currently a major challenge is to understand how the dynamic states of chromatin influence these repair mechanisms.</p><p>Within the cell, eukaryotic DNA is packaged into the nucleoprotein structure known as chromatin. The nucleosome is the primary level of chromatin structure, with about 146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histones, which includes two molecules each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van Holde, 1989</xref>). Due to the intimate nature of the histone-DNA interactions within the nucleosome, the local chromatin structure has to be disrupted to allow the cellular machinery to gain access to DSBs to mediate their repair. How the chromatin changes to allow DSB repair to happen is not clear. Also, how the chromatin structure, and the epigenetic information that it carries, is reestablished after DSB repair is complete, is poorly understood.</p><p>Upon generation of DSBs, the local chromatin structure is altered at many different levels, including histone post-translational modifications, chromatin relaxation, histone exchange, histone mobilization and histone removal from the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deem et al., 2012</xref>). The last of these processes, chromatin disassembly, ultimately allows free access of the repair machinery to the DNA lesion. Complete nucleosome disassembly, indicated by the removal of histone H3 from the DNA, has been observed in the vicinity of an unrepairable DSB undergoing extensive resection in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsukuda et al., 2005</xref>). This chromatin disassembly was dependent on MRE11 and the INO80 ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsukuda et al., 2005</xref>), both of which are required, either directly or indirectly, for timely DNA resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Paull and Gellert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Attikum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gospodinov et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, during HR in yeast, at least some nucleosomes are disassembled from around DSBs, because inhibition of the chromatin reassembly process reduced the local histone occupancy after DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). These yeast studies provide precedent for local histone removal from around a DSB, seemingly dependent on DNA end-resection, and indicate that histone reassembly occurs during DSB repair to reestablish the genomic packaging and potentially the epigenetic information.</p><p>Chromatin disassembly and reassembly also appear to occur during DSB repair in mammalian cells. Displacement of histones H2B and H3 was apparent during DSB repair around DSBs that were generated by introduction of the I-PpoI and HO homing enzymes into mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sunavala-Dossabhoy and De Benedetti, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berkovich et al., 2007</xref>). Using these systems, the displacement of H2B from the periphery of nucleosomes around a DSB in mammalian cells was dependent on NBS1, a component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 DNA end resection complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berkovich et al., 2007</xref>). In agreement with the idea that DNA end resection drives nucleosome disassembly, loss of H3, which resides in the central part of the nucleosome and is indicative of disassembly of the entire nucleosome, was only observed in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>). In cells arrested in G1 phase, which can only repair DSBs by NHEJ, only H2A-H2B were removed during DSB repair not H3-H4. This suggested that only partial, not complete nucleosome disassembly, accompanies NHEJ in mammalian cells.</p><p>The mechanism by which chromatin is disassembled and reassembled during DSB repair is unclear. In yeast, the H3-H4 histone chaperone Asf1 is required for chromatin assembly after HR repair, but this function is due to the role of Asf1 in promoting acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Nucleolin, a nucloeolar histone chaperone for H2A-H2B, was shown to be involved in nucleosome disruption in the vicinity of a DSB within the rDNA locus in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>). The factors involved in chromatin disassembly from DSBs in other regions of the mammalian genome are unknown. Also, how chromatin is reassembled in mammalian cells after DSB repair is unknown.</p><p>Insights that may be relevant to chromatin disassembly and reassembly during DSB may be provided by the chromatin dynamics during transcription, replication and UV damage repair. The histone chaperone CAF-1 deposits newly-synthesized H3/H4 onto the DNA following DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaillard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Smith and Stillman, 1991</xref>). Another histone chaperone, HIRA, deposits the histone variant H3.3/H4 onto the genome at times other than DNA synthesis, particularly during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ray-Gallet et al., 2002</xref>). The histone chaperone ASF1 donates the histones to CAF-1 and HIRA, where mammalian ASF1A predominantly delivers the H3.3/H4 to HIRA for replication-independent chromatin assembly and ASF1B predominantly delivers H3.1/H4 to CAF-1 for replication-dependent chromatin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tyler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</xref>). During NER and prior to the assembly of H3.1 into chromatin, HIRA assembles H3.3 into the chromatin around UV lesions. This was unexpected because repair of UV damage involves DNA synthesis which usually engages CAF-1-mediated H3.1 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2013</xref>). This transient deposition of H3.3 primes the chromatin for later recovery of transcription after repair of UV lesions by NER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2013</xref>). Whether H3.3 is also incorporated prior to H3.1 onto the DNA during DSB repair is unknown, and the underlying mechanisms that regulate such chromatin alterations would also need to be uncovered.</p><p>In this study, we set out to delineate nucleosome dynamics during DSB repair in human cells. We found that DSBs lead to complete nucleosome disassembly around the DNA ends, restricted to within 750 bp from DNA ends. Unexpectedly the chromatin disassembly is independent of DNA end resection because the repair occurred during NHEJ and during MRE11 inhibition. ATM and INO80 facilitate histone disassembly during DSB repair. Meanwhile, chromatin reassembly after repair required both the HIRA-mediated replication-independent pathway and the CAF-1-mediated replication-dependent pathway, suggesting that they occur in a coordinated manner to reestablish the chromatin structure after DSB repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Histone disassembly and reassembly around DSBs in human cells</title><p>To investigate the dynamics of nucleosomes during DSB repair in mammalian cells, we deployed an I-PpoI homing endonuclease inducible system, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pankotai et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The H3 occupancy closely followed the kinetics of the cutting and repair using PCR products centered 200bp to the 5’ and 3’ of the I-PpoI site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and 1B</xref>). All data was normalized to histone occupancy at the <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene at each time point, which is not near any I-PpoI sites. Furthermore, it appears that nucleosomes adjacent to the break were disassembled completely from around all the DSBs in the population, because histone occupancy dropped to 50% at the three-hour time point at which 50% of the DNA was cleaved. Histone occupancy returned to the pre-damage levels at the 6–8 hr time point, which is the same time point at which the DNA lesion is approximately 100% repaired, indicating that chromatin reassembly occurs concomitant with DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and 1B). The histone H3 disassembly around the DSB progressively diminished at 500bp and 750bp from the break as compared to 200bp from the I-PpoI site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while no conspicuous histone H3 loss was observed at either 1000bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or 3000bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) from the break. This corresponds to a region of approximately 8 nucleosomes being disassembled during DSB repair in human cells. Importantly the observed histone H3 disassembly around a DSB does not appear to be a consequence of persistent DNA end resection, because the DNA level (ChIP input) around the I-PpoI-induced DNA breaks was not significantly affected by induction of DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>This situation is not unique to the <italic>SLCO5A1</italic> gene, because we observed similar kinetics of DSB induction and repair for I-PpoI sites within the <italic>RYR2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top panel) and the <italic>INTS4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data show that the I-PpoI system generates site-specific DSBs in human cells efficiently that are effectively repaired somewhat synchronously. Furthermore, these data show that chromatin disassembly and reassembly accompany cutting and repair of I-PpoI sites within the human genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Chromatin disassembly and reassembly occur during NHEJ, independent of DNA end-resection</title><p>To determine whether the observed nucleosome disassembly and reassembly around DSBs occurred during HR or NHEJ, we knocked-down essential components of each repair pathway. Knockdown of RAD51, the recombinase in HR, had no detectable effect on the kinetics of DSB cutting and repair compared to knockdown with a scrambled RNA, indicating that efficient repair of the I-PpoI site occurs in the absence of HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, knockdown of KU80, a key factor in NHEJ, led to the more rapid accumulation of breaks and no detectable repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This result indicates that NHEJ is the major pathway involved in the repair of this I-PpoI site in asynchronous cells, and is consistent with the failure to observe a DNA repair defect upon RAD51 knockdown. The NHEJ pathway is the preferential DSB repair pathway used in G1 phase of the cell cycle. That repair of the I-PpoI break requires KU80 but not RAD51 is not a consequence of effects of the knockdowns on the cell cycle because flow cytometry analysis detected no apparent change in the cell cycle phase distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As additional evidence that chromatin disassembly and reassembly around the DSB was occurring during NHEJ, we observed efficient chromatin disassembly and reassembly during RAD51 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, chromatin disassembly still occurs in the KU80 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that chromatin disassembly occurs prior to recruitment of the core NHEJ machinery.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15129.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DNA resection is not required for histone H3 disassembly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The repair of the I-PpoI sites is by NHEJ not HR.

To determine whether activation of the DNA damage checkpoint via ATM or ATR signaling initiates chromatin assembly, we applied ATM (KU55933) and ATR (VE-821) inhibitors to the I-PpoI repair assay. Inhibition of ATR did not disrupt the histone H3 disassembly and reassembly around the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, the kinetics of induction of the DSB was also similarly delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> top panel), indicating that the delayed chromatin disassembly was a consequence of the delayed DNA cutting and that SMARCAD1 played no role in promoting chromatin disassembly in the inducible DSB system that we were using. We sought to discover whether SMARCAD1 led to a chromatin structure that was less accessible to the I-PpoI endonuclease and found no evidence for this (data not shown). However, we found that the induction of the I-PpoI endonuclease itself was markedly reduced upon SMARCAD1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which was presumably due to a role of SMARCAD1 directly or indirectly in its expression.

Meanwhile, knockdown of ASF1B led to a subtle delay in chromatin reassembly compared to the kinetics of DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). ASF1A/B functions together with the HIRA chaperone in the assembly of the replication-independent variant of H3, H3.3, while ASF1A/B also functions with CAF-1 in the assembly of replication-dependent histone H3.1 and H3.2. To determine which chromatin assembly pathway functions after DSB repair in humans, we knocked down CAF-1 and HIRA. Knockdown of CAF-1 led to a major defect in chromatin reassembly after DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the CAF-1-dependent chromatin assembly pathway is utilized during DSB repair in human cells, even in the absence of significant DNA resection or DNA synthesis.

Repair of DSBs by NHEJ was accompanied by the apparent complete disassembly of nucleosomes adjacent to the break, spanning up to 1500 bp around the break. We found that chromatin disassembly around the DSB is a checkpoint-stimulated response to breaks involving an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. Meanwhile, HIRA-mediated assembly of H3.3 and CAF-1 mediated assembly of H3.1 occur after DSB repair in an interdependent manner, suggesting that coordinated mechanisms exist to accurately reestablish the epigenetic information carried by the chromatin structure after DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Chromatin disassembly and reassembly during NHEJ in mammalian cells</title><p>In agreement with our findings, previous work has shown that histone H3 loss occurs around a DSB in asynchronous human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>). However, in that study histone H3 loss was not detected during G1 phase when NHEJ is the predominant form of repair for the non-nucleolar regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>). The authors attributed the observed H3 loss around a DSB within the rDNA locus in asynchronous cells to be accompanying HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, their H3-H4 loss reached over 7 kb away from the break ends with no clear decrease at this distance from the break, suggesting it could be a lot more extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, in our analyses, histone H3 was disassembled during NHEJ and the histone H3 disassembly was a local event, restricted to within 0.75 kb away from DSBs. One explanation for the difference in results could be due to the fact that the previous analysis of chromatin disassembly examined I-PpoI sites within the rDNA in the nucleolus. In humans, the rDNA is present in approximately 300 copies of tandem repeats and has a specialized chromatin structure, generally being heterochromatic. Furthermore, the rDNA has a unique nucleolar DNA damage response, enabling HR-mediated repair of I-PpoI-induced DSBs within the rDNA at any phase of the cell cycle, including G1, presumably templated by rDNA repeats in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Sluis and McStay, 2015</xref>). As such, the chromatin disassembly study from the Kastan group was likely examining chromatin disassembly at the rDNA during homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldstein et al., 2013</xref>), while we examined chromatin disassembly from euchromatin during NHEJ, which could explain the difference in size of the domain of chromatin disassembly. The failure to observe complete nucleosome disassembly around a DSB within the rDNA in G1 phase by Kastan’s group may reflect the unique chromatin structure of the rDNA repeats and their region-specific DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Sluis and McStay, 2015</xref>). While we have not completely ruled out all types of end-resection in our study, many lines of evidence indicate that the I-PpoI sites we examined are being repaired by an NHEJ mechanism that does not involve much end resection including: (i) the failure to see loss of the DNA signal around the break in the ChIP input, (ii) the lack of involvement of ATR, (iii) the lack of need for the nuclease activities of MRE11 for repair, (iv) no requirement for the single-stranded binding protein RAD51 for repair, (v) the complete dependency on KU80 for DNA repair, and (vi) no requirement for SMARCAD1 in chromatin disassembly, which only plays a role during DNA resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rowbotham et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Costelloe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). As such, all the available evidence points to the chromatin disassembly and reassembly around the DSBs induced within the euchromatic genes that we examined, occurring during NHEJ repair.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism and function of chromatin disassembly during NHEJ</title><p>Given that the molecular events during NHEJ repair occur at the DNA ends, it was somewhat unexpected to find complete disassembly of up to 8 nucleosomes around a DSB during NHEJ. One possibility is that the local histone disassembly may facilitate efficient recruitment of the NHEJ repair machinery to DSBs, while avoiding the loss of epigenetic information that would occur due to extensive histone disassembly. In agreement with a role for chromatin disassembly in efficient NHEJ, knockdown of INO80 or inhibition of ATM, both of which compromise chromatin disassembly around a break, lead to DNA repair defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 and 4</xref>), although this could also be due to additional roles of ATM and INO80 in the DNA damage response. INO80 has been shown previously to be recruited to DSBs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kashiwaba et al., 2010</xref>), although its exact function there was not clear. It was interesting to find a role for INO80 in promoting chromatin disassembly around a DSB, because in yeast, the role of INO80 in chromatin disassembly around a DSB is dependent on INO80’s role in promoting DNA resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tsukuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Attikum et al., 2004</xref>). However, in our studies in mammalian cells, INO80 promotes chromatin disassembly in the absence of apparent DNA resection, suggesting that it can directly modify chromatin structure during DSB repair. In agreement, INO80 is required to promote accessibility of the NER machinery to UV lesions in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). Given that ATM phosphorylates INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morrison et al., 2007</xref>), it will be interesting to determine whether the involvement of ATM in stimulating chromatin disassembly during NHEJ is mediated via it phosphorylating, and potentially activating, INO80. Consistent with this prediction, we found that combined inhibition of ATM in cells with IN080 knockdown, led to the same degree of defect in chromatin disassembly as INO80 knockdown alone. The function of INO80 in chromatin disassembly at a DSB presumably depends on its histone eviction activity and its ATPase activity, although further study is needed to characterize the detailed molecular mechanism. It is plausible that histone disassembly during DSB repair is mediated by the collaboration between a variety of nucleosome remodelers and chaperones, as well as other factors besides INO80. On the other hand, different nucleosome remodelers may play distinct, but non-redundant roles in chromatin disassembly during DSB repair, as we showed that SMARCAD1 is dispensable for this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism and function of chromatin reassembly after NHEJ</title><p>Chromatin reassembly occurs after DSB repair and is not required for DSB repair per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We found that the histone chaperones ASF1A and ASF1B play non-redundant roles in histone H3 reassembly during DSB repair, with ASF1A playing an essential role in regulating histone reassembly around a DSB, while ASF1B is dispensable for this function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). ASF1A/B donates histones to the H3.3 HIRA histone chaperone, and in agreement, HIRA was required for chromatin assembly after DSB repair. ASF1A/B also donates histones H3.1 and H3.2 to CAF-1, and CAF-1 knockdown also led to a major defect in chromatin reassembly after DSB repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In agreement, both HIRA and CAF-1 are recruited to sites of NER, and HIRA deposits H3.3 in response to UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2013</xref>). However, this previous study was not able to quantitate chromatin assembly during NER repair due to the random nature of the UV induced DNA damage. Given that we were inducing DSBs at known locations, we were able to measure the local histone occupancy. We saw a complete defect in chromatin assembly when we knocked down HIRA. The involvement of HIRA is consistent with the repair being via NHEJ, which does not involve significant DNA synthesis. Indeed, HIRA has been shown to mediate a gap-filling mechanism of H3.3 deposition without the need for transcription or any sequence specificity, given the non-specific DNA binding ability of HIRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, we observed an almost complete block in chromatin assembly after DSB repair when we knocked down CAF-1 (noteworthy, the CAF-1 knockdown was not complete, so its contribution could be even stronger in reality), suggesting that CAF-1 is required for chromatin assembly after DSB repair without ongoing DNA synthesis. It is unlikely that these results are due to indirect effects of CAF-1 knockdown, for example on cell cycle progression, because the defect in chromatin reassembly was localized specifically to the region around the DSB. Furthermore, all the cells would not have had a chance to progress through S phase within the short time course of cutting and repair that occurred in our experiments. The role of CAF-1 in chromatin assembly after DSB repair is not due to an indirect effect on HIRA levels, because no change in HIRA protein level was seen upon knockdown of CAF-1. In agreement with our findings, a recent study found specific recruitment of both the Hir complex and CAF-1 to meiotic DSBs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brachet et al., 2015</xref>). This recruitment of CAF-1 to DSBs during meiosis was not dependent on PCNA nor on DNA strand invasion, indicating that CAF-1 recruitment to DSBs was independent of DNA synthesis per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brachet et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, both H3.3 and H3.1 have been observed to be recruited to sites of DSB damage, in laser microirradiation analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Luijsterburg et al., 2016</xref>). These results, together with ours, suggest that the replication-dependent and replication-independent chromatin assembly pathways function in an interdependent manner after DSB repair. Such a concerted mechanism may be necessary to allow faithful reassembly of chromatin structures after DSB repair, perhaps in order to enable the accurate re-establishment of transcription programs. Future studies will reveal how these two pathways are coordinated at the molecular level. It will also be important to determine whether the pattern of H3 variant deposition after DSB repair is the same as that which existed prior to the DNA damaging event.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that immediately following the induction of DSBs in mammalian cells, histone disassembly occurs on both sides of the break. This step is tightly regulated as only about 4 nucleosomes are disrupted on each side of the DNA break, presumably for efficient recruitment of the NHEJ repair machinery. ATM and histone remodelers such as INO80 actively participate in the histone disassembly. After DSB repair, histones are reassembled back to the repaired DNA regions to restore their local chromatin structures, and this step requires functional coordination between histone chaperones ASF1A, CAF-1 and HIRA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA repair assays</title><p>HEK293T cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jerry Workman, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is nice paper that assists in resolving the critical factors that contribute to double strand break (DSB) repair. In particular, the requirements for chromatin remodeling and histone chaperones are demonstrated in reconstructing the chromatin environment during induction of DSBs and repair. The authors utilize an inducible system to create site-specific DSB in mammalian cells. Through multiple lines of evidence (chemical inhibitors and measurements of input DNA) DNA end resection is not evident during repair or nucleosome (de)assembly. Nevertheless, nucleosome eviction is still observed and found to be dependent on ATM and the INO80 chromatin remodeler. In the absence of this activity, repair is deficient. Histone chaperones are then needed to reassemble the chromatin surrounding DNA breaks. The logic of the manuscript is concise and the data largely convincing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major concern is whether the apparent loss of histones next to the break might be an artifact of the break itself. If the ChIPed DNA fragments are sheared to on average 500 base pairs then a ChIP signal could be seen from histones bound on either side of the primers within 500 bps. However, if you cut next to the primers with the targeted nuclease then the ChIP signal can only come from histones bound within 500 base pairs of the other side (i.e. bound on one side but not both sides). Hence an artificial apparent drop in histone cross linking. The authors need to test or convincingly deal with this possibility.</p><p>2) At times it is difficult to discern significant differences in H3 occupancy after DSB formation between wildtype and mutant cell lines. p-values should be calculated when authors suggest significant alterations.</p><p>3) Not all of the panels have error bars. The nature of the assay is not robust, measuring less than 2 fold changes. Thus the statistics are important and error bars are needed.</p><p>4) The connection between ATM and INO80 function in nucleosome disassembly is not particularly strong. Are the authors suggesting that ATM regulates INO80 to facilitate nucleosome disassembly? If so can a more direct assay be performed, such as shINO80 knockdown in the presence and absence of ATM inhibitor to assess epistatic or added effects.</p><p>5) Most experiments in this manuscript used only one shRNA to knock down target protein. The authors should include at least one more shRNA to exclude off-target effects. This is an important issue as the effect of knockdown of some genes on nucleosome disassembly assembly is small (maximum 2 fold). Alternatively, it is a good idea to reintroduce the protein to see whether the defects can be rescued by the effects.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the authors showed that depletion of SMARCAD1 reduces the expression level of endonuclease IppoI. Therefore, it is important to analyze the IppoI expression level in every experiment to make sure it is not affected, especially in INO80 mutant cells.</p><p>7) I suspect that nucleosome disassembly/assembly and repair efficiency depends on the cell cycle. The effect of INO80 knockdown. KU80 and Rad51 on cell cycle should be analyzed.</p><p>8) It is hard to imagine that knockdown CAF-1 and HIRA affect nucleosome assembly similar after DNA repair. If this is the case, one would expect to detect H3.1 and H3.3 at break sites similarly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15129.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A major concern is whether the apparent loss of histones next to the break might be an artifact of the break itself.

Hence an artificial apparent drop in histone cross linking. The authors need to test or convincingly deal with this possibility.</italic></p><p>It is true that introducing a DSB could lead to a decrease of the potential DNA fragments that can be ChIPed down. However, this is not the reason for the observed histone level decrease for the following reasons. The sonicated fragment size is generally about 500 bps in our assays, while the closest primer set from the break end is centered around 200bps away. Given that our replicon size is about 100-120bps, this means that the closest primer end in our assay is still about 140-150 bps away from break end. Even if that statistical counting indeed has an effect, the effect should be no more that 25%. In addition, we also detect 50% decrease at 500 bps away, as well as at 750 away. These two sites should not be affected by that statistical model. Moreover, we show that certain conditions (knockdown of INO80 and ATM inhibition) lead to no histone removal at specific time points that have efficient cutting. If the apparent histone loss is an artifact of the break itself, these results would have never have been obtained. In addition, the fact that knockdown of the histone chaperones ASF1, CAF-1 and HIRA all have effective DNA repair, yet there is no return of the histones by ChIP, shows that this signal is not an artifact of the break itself reducing the ChIPability of the flanking DNA. If it were, the ChIPed signal would have returned in the ASF1, CAF-1 and HIRA knockdowns upon DNA repair. The approach and interpretation of histone ChIP around a break that we use is the norm in the field, and is also used by the Soutoglou and Kastan labs.</p><p><italic>2) At times it is difficult to discern significant differences in H3 occupancy after DSB formation between wildtype and mutant cell lines. p-values should be calculated when authors suggest significant alterations.</italic></p><p>p values have now been calculated for the knockdown cell lines and inhibitors, and significantly different time points from the control cells are indicated.</p><p><italic>3) Not all of the panels have error bars. The nature of the assay is not robust, measuring less than 2 fold changes. Thus the statistics are important and error bars are needed.</italic></p><p>The only data that did not previously have error bars was the experiments using the ATR and MRE11 inhibitors, both of which showed no change from the wild type / no drug control. As such, we were not making statements of novel roles for these proteins from these particular data.In addition, all experiments included the analysis of two DNA regions of equal distance to the 5’ and 3’ of the IPpoI site, that showed highly consistent results, strikingly so for the MRE11 inhibitor experiments. In the case of the MRE11 inhibitor experiments, we also performed the ChIP at both 200bp and 500bp away at both 5’ and 3 ‘to the IPpoI site and saw the identical result. The analysis of four different regions itself indicates the reproducibility of the effect and could be considered more meaningful than analyzing the same region multiple times. But as requested by the reviewers, we have now repeated the ATR inhibitor analyses two more times to provide error bars. Unfortunately, we were not able to do this for the MRE11 inhibitor experiments, given that they were provided in limited quantities by a colleague from my previous institution, so were not readily available, in addition to the time limitations and large amounts of other additional experiments that were needed for this revision.</p><p><italic>4) The connection between ATM and INO80 function in nucleosome disassembly is not particularly strong. Are the authors suggesting that ATM regulates INO80 to facilitate nucleosome disassembly? If so can a more direct assay be performed, such as shINO80 knockdown in the presence and absence of ATM inhibitor to assess epistatic or added effects.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have now combined INO80 knockdown with ATM inhibition, and found that there is no synergistic increase. This is consistent with ATM modifying INO80 to promote chromatin disassembly, but far from proves it. We have included the new data and discussed it in the text accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) Most experiments in this manuscript used only one shRNA to knock down target protein. The authors should include at least one more shRNA to exclude off-target effects. This is an important issue as the effect of knockdown of some genes on nucleosome disassembly assembly is small (maximum 2 fold). Alternatively, it is a good idea to reintroduce the protein to see whether the defects can be rescued by the effects.</italic></p><p>These are good points, and we have now repeated the critical findings of the paper with additional shRNAs, to show that the results are not off target effects. The data are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the authors showed that depletion of SMARCAD1 reduces the expression level of endonuclease IppoI. Therefore, it is important to analyze the IppoI expression level in every experiment to make sure it is not affected, especially in INO80 mutant cells.</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> we showed that upon knockdown of SMARCAD1, I-PpoI mediated cleavage of the DNA occurred at around 8 hrs, as opposed to 3hrs in the normal situation. This is what led us to analyze the IppoI induction and show that they are indeed greatly delayed and reduced upon SMARCAD1 knockdown. However, in the other mutants, the kinetics and extent of I-PpoI mediated cleavage of the DNA is not significantly altered and as such the functional read out of I-PpoI activity shows that I-PpoI is being expressed. Western blots of I-PpoI for every experiment would provide no additional information.</p><p><italic>7) I suspect that nucleosome disassembly/assembly and repair efficiency depends on the cell cycle. The effect of INO80 knockdown. KU80 and Rad51 on cell cycle should be analyzed.</italic></p><p>Our data show that in asynchronous cells, the repair pathway that is used to repair the I-PpoI sites that we examine is NHEJ. NHEJ occurs efficiently throughout the cell cycle, but it is likely that there are differences in nucleosome disassembly/assembly pathways used through the cell cycle. Accordingly, as requested, we have examined the effects on INO80, KU80 and Rad51 knockdown on the cell cycle and find no significant alteration in the proportion of cells in G1, S, or G2/M. This data is now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>8) It is hard to imagine that knockdown CAF-1 and HIRA affect nucleosome assembly similar after DNA repair. If this is the case, one would expect to detect H3.1 and H3.3 at break sites similarly.</italic> </p><p>In agreement with our findings, a paper a few months ago from Haico van Attikum’s group (Luijsterburg et al., Mol Cell, 2016) indeed shows incorporation of H3.1 and H3.3 at sites of double strand breaks, using SNAP labeling of newly-synthesized histones. We have now cited this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
