part of developing innovative therapies, it can be reduced by adherence to evidence-based rigorous research practices. Supported through the European Union’s Innovative Medicines Initiative, the EQIPD consortium has developed a novel preclinical research quality system that can be applied in both public and private sectors and is free for anyone to use. The EQIPD Quality System was designed to be suited to boost innovation by ensuring the generation of robust and reliable preclinical data while being lean, effective and not becoming a burden that could negatively impact the freedom to explore scientific questions. EQIPD defines research quality as the extent to which research data are fit for their intended use. Fitness, in this context, is defined by the stakeholders, who are the scientists directly involved in the research, but also their funders, sponsors, publishers, research tool manufacturers, and collaboration partners such as peers in a multi-site research project. The essence of the EQIPD Quality System is the set of 18 core requirements that can be addressed flexibly, according to user-specific needs and following a user-defined trajectory. The EQIPD Quality System proposes guidance on expectations for quality-related measures, defines criteria for adequate processes (i.e. performance standards) and provides examples of how such measures can be developed and implemented. However, it does not prescribe any pre-determined solutions. EQIPD has also developed tools (for optional use) to support users in implementing the system and assessment services for those research units that successfully implement the quality system and seek formal accreditation. Building upon the feedback from users and continuous improvement, a sustainable EQIPD Quality System will ultimately serve the entire community of scientists conducting non-regulated preclinical research, by helping them generate reliable data that are fit for their intended use.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nonregulated research</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>research rigor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010767</institution-id><institution>Innovative Medicines Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>777364</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacLeod</surname><given-names>Malcolm R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A system has been developed that supports generation of reliable basic biomedical research data while being open-access and lean with no negative impact on freedom of scientific exploration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>The challenge: discovery of novel therapies requires rigor in research practices</title><p>The success rate in the discovery of novel, safe and effective pharmacotherapies has been declining steadily over the last few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Scannell et al., 2012</xref>). There are several factors likely accounting for this unfortunate record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DiMasi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Waring et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shih et al., 2018</xref>). While some of these factors (e.g. deeper knowledge of disease biology or clinical trial methodology) will take years, if not decades, of continued research to be properly addressed, others can be readily controlled today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bespalov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Landis et al., 2012</xref>). One area requiring immediate attention is research rigor, which is estimated to be lacking in 50–90% of preclinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Freedman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>High risk of failure is an inherent part of developing innovative therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DiMasi et al., 2016</xref>). However, some risks can be greatly reduced and avoided by adherence to evidence-based rigorous research practices. Indeed, numerous analyses conducted to date have clearly identified measures that need to be taken to improve research rigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Begley and Ioannidis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ritskes-Hoitinga and Wever, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vollert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Volsen and Masson, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The EQIPD consortium: enhancing research quality as the main objective</title><p>Improving research rigor has biomedical, societal, personal, economic and ethical benefits for academia and industry alike, since the development of novel therapies is often rooted in academic discoveries and requires a highly specialized effort of industry to translate these discoveries into clinically useful applications. Moreover, the simple dichotomy between purely academic research and large industry/big pharma efforts is currently being replaced by networks of biotechs, spin-offs, private and public funders, contract research organizations (CROs), academic institutions engaging in drug discovery projects and manufacturers of research tools. It is therefore important that strategies to increase the robustness and reliability of preclinical research, both in terms of conduct and reporting, involve all these different stakeholders.</p><p>To address this challenge in preclinical biomedical research in a collaborative manner, the Enhancing Quality in Preclinical Data (EQIPD; originally called European Quality in Preclinical Data) consortium was formed in 2017 with founding members from 29 institutions across eight different countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://quality-preclinical-data.eu">https://quality-preclinical-data.eu</ext-link>). The consortium works closely with a large group of associated collaborators, advisors and stakeholders representing research institutions, publishers, funders, learned societies and professional societies, from more than 100 organizations in Europe and the US.</p><p>Supported through the European Union’s Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), the EQIPD consortium, among other deliverables, aimed to develop a novel preclinical research quality system that can be applied in both the public and private sectors. Such a quality system should be suited to boost innovation by ensuring the generation of robust and reliable preclinical data while being lean, effective and not becoming a burden that could negatively impact the freedom to explore scientific questions.</p><p>EQIPD defines research quality as the extent to which research data are fit for intended use (for related definitions and explanations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Juran and Godfrey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gilis, 2020</xref>). Fitness, in this context, is defined by the stakeholders, who can be scientists themselves, but also patients, funders, sponsors, publishers, and collaboration partners (e.g. peers in a multi-site research project).</p><p>The EQIPD consortium has developed a quality system that is free for anyone to use.

For example, the development of the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards, introduced first by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the late 1970s, was triggered by poor research practices that compromised human health, such as mis-identification of control and experimental animals, omitted, non-reported or suppressed scientific findings, data inventions, replacements of animals lost to follow-up, and mis-dosing of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bongiovanni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Marshall, 1983</xref>).

see Appendix 1 Glossary for a definition of regulated research), where trained personnel perform mainly routine analyses, following defined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and deliver data ultimately supporting patient safety.</p><p>There have been attempts to develop a quality system based on GLP, that is, taking GLP as the basis and eliminating elements that are seen as excessive for the purposes of non-regulated drug discovery. However, GLP does not provide explicit guidance regarding those aspects of study design, conduct, analysis and reporting that are important to minimize the risk of bias and make research robust. In other words, even if it were made less demanding, conventional GLP cannot address some of today’s key challenges in non-regulated preclinical research.</p><p>In contrast, the EQIPD Quality System is a novel system specifically aimed at supporting innovation in preclinical biomedical research. While the direct consequence of installing a quality system will be the generation of research data that are of higher rigor, the ultimate goal is to improve the efficiency of developing novel effective and safe therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Development of a new quality system by EQIPD</title><p>EQIPD was started in October 2017 and during the first phase (until June 2018), three work packages of the EQIPD consortium have delivered:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A systematic review of guidelines for internal validity in the design, conduct and analysis of research involving laboratory animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vollert et al., 2020</xref>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>An inventory of current practices and expectations toward quality management in non-regulated preclinical research (based on interviews with 70 consortium members and stakeholders);</p></list-item><list-item><p>A review and analysis of governance in existing quality management systems (AAALAC International; ASQ Best Quality Practices for Biomedical Research in Drug Development; BBSRC Joint Code of Practice; ISO 9001, ISO 17025, ISO 15189; Janssen discovery quality system; Novartis research quality system; OECD Principles of GLP; RQA – Quality Systems Workbook).</p></list-item></list><p>During the second phase (July 2018 - January 2019), a working group was assembled from the EQIPD consortium members (n = 20).

EQIPD does not ‘invent’ needs or requirements of your funders or your collaborators.

The five principles are, therefore, instrumental in finding answers to specific questions – for example, is this particular practice in line with the EQIPD expectations? or should this particular process be documented?</p><sec id="s5-1"><title>Flexible: driven by the needs of an individual research unit</title><p>Research environments are highly diverse: the needs of researchers at a big pharma company are different from those at a biotech; the needs of CROs are different from those of academic labs, etc. Thus, improving data quality is a challenge that cannot be tackled using a one-size-fits-all solution and flexibility is a critical requirement for future success.</p><p>The EQIPD Quality System is flexible: researchers are not confronted with a long and definitive A-to-Z list of what should be done and in what sequence. Instead, implementation of the EQIPD Quality System is characterized by:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>user-specific content – that is the exact nature of the individual elements of the EQIPD Quality System are defined largely by the users and their environment;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a variable trajectory – that is there are very limited expectations regarding the sequence of introducing the different elements of the EQIPD Quality System; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>no deadlines or fixed timelines – that is each unit adopts the EQIPD Quality System at its own pace, depending on the existing needs and available resources.</p></list-item></list><p>EQIPD has developed tools (for optional use) that help scientists to identify and organize information to address their own customized needs (e.g. related to <italic>my</italic> research funding source, <italic>my</italic> national regulations for the use of animals, expectations of <italic>my</italic> collaboration partners, policies set by <italic>my</italic> institution, <italic>my</italic> own commitment to research rigor, etc.). Being unique to a research unit or a researcher, such needs can be very specific to local or personal circumstances (i.e. essential for <italic>my</italic> success, <italic>my</italic> funding, <italic>my</italic> career, for instance because of the requirements of <italic>my</italic> preferred funder), and as such may be addressed with a higher or lower priority. Based on these factors, each research unit or researcher can determine their sequence of actions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). EQIPD tools offer examples and ready-to-use solutions as well as information to develop new user-specific solutions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flexible sequence of implementation of the EQIPD core requirements.</title><p>Depending on the current needs, a research unit may prioritize the implementation of one or another core requirement. For example, tasks related to core requirement ‘B’ are highly relevant for the research unit’s parent institution, the funding organization and a scientific journal where the research team plans to publish the results of their work. In contrast, core requirement ‘C’ is of lower importance and can, therefore, be addressed at a later timepoint.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63294-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For example, EQIPD has reviewed research quality expectations of several major public funders and pharmaceutical companies.

Typically, the Process Owner should be someone who directs the work of the research unit (e.g. group leader, principal investigator, CEO or department head) and is knowledgeable about the importance of quality in research. EQIPD expects the Process Owner to be identified at the very first step of implementing the EQIPD Quality System (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; core requirement #1).</p><p>In the second step, the Process Owner defines the <italic>scope</italic> - that is, the research unit (lab, territory, organization or part thereof) where the EQIPD Quality System will be applied - and identifies colleagues who will be actively involved in working on the implementation, as well as those who will be informed and may need to be trained about the new process (core requirement #2; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To that end, the Process Owner sets up a <italic>communication plan</italic> to support the team’s buy-in and to facilitate a two-way information flow, in order to also capture feedback related to performance of the existing and newly introduced practices.</p><p>EQIPD also expects research units to define <italic>quality objectives</italic> (core requirement #3; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Although it may sound formal, this core requirement is indispensable and should be articulated at a level understandable and meaningful to everyone in the research unit.</p><p>Why are quality objectives needed? Once the Process Owner has decided to accept the role and responsibilities and has defined the research unit where the EQIPD Quality System will be implemented, it is worth getting prepared to answer questions that will likely come from colleagues inside and outside of the research unit: why are we doing this if, at least today, no such quality system is required by funders or collaboration partners and if, at least on first sight, we can successfully meet the goals without changing anything?</p><p>The answer to these questions helps to justify the efforts and time to be invested in the implementation and maintenance of the quality system. It also provides an argument by balancing the potentially negative impact on traditional metrics of scientific success (e.g. fewer positive results generated, more time needed to complete projects) against the value of higher quality research (greater confidence in the results and scientific interpretations when results are shared with peers or published, improved rigor in decision making, more robust publications that stand the test of time, etc.).</p><p>In EQIPD terms, the answer should be documented as a <italic>mission statement</italic>, that is, a concise summary of why quality matters for that specific research unit. EQIPD provides examples of how scientists working in different roles and at various types of organizations may answer the question ‘why quality matters’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eqipd-toolbox.paasp.net/wiki/Why_quality_matters">https://eqipd-toolbox.paasp.net/wiki/Why_quality_matters</ext-link>).</p><p>It is important that the mission statement is understood, willingly accepted and followed by all members of the research unit.</p><p>If a Process Owner, alone or together with the research team members, cannot generate a clear and convincing answer to this question, no further steps should be taken and the implementation of the quality system is best postponed until a good answer is found and the research team is willing to embrace a quality mindset.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>EQIPD Quality System as part of the overall organizational quality culture</title><p>The Process Owner may also be asked and should be prepared to explain that the EQIPD Quality System does not replace and does not intend to re-interpret any of the existing rules, policies and other quality systems (which focus on specific areas) that apply to the research unit’s environment.</p><p>EQIPD mandates that ‘all activities must comply with relevant legislation and policies’ (core requirement #4; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) and that a ‘research unit must have a procedure to act upon concerns of potential misconduct’ (core requirement #5; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). For the vast majority of organizations, no additional effort will be required to meet these expectations. If so, why are they included in the list of core requirements?</p><p>First, EQIPD does not want to be associated with organizations that engage in or tolerate unacceptable ethical practices or legal violations.</p><p>Second, the EQIPD Quality System is focused on quality, not legislation. Legislation may differ from country to country and for different research activities; hence, it is not possible to specify these individually in the EQIPD Quality System. Furthermore, EQIPD cannot oversee the way an organization deals with the legal requirements of, for example, handling hazardous substances, but emphasizes the need for compliance with such regulations as a basis on which all other quality measures rest.</p><p>A particularly relevant example concerns the care and use of laboratory animals that play a pivotal role in the research process. Society has granted the biomedical research community with the privilege to use laboratory animals in research under very specific conditions, all aiming to prevent inappropriate use of these ethically highly sensitive resources. Clearly, it is not acceptable to waste animals due to poor study design, conduct or analysis.</p><p>Ethical concerns on the use of animals in research have promoted the creation of a legal framework in almost every country (e.g. Animal Welfare Act in the US; Directive 2010/63 in the EU). Scientific evidence demonstrates that many aspects of animal care and use that are beyond the legal requirements have a direct impact on research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guillén and Steckler, 2020</xref>). The EQIPD team has developed a concise checklist that allows scientists to review if their animal care and use processes meet at least a minimum standard that supports the implementation and maintenance of the EQIPD Quality System. This review could optionally serve as the basis for further, more specific accreditation of the animal care and use program (i.e. AAALAC International accreditation) to ensure the implementation of high standards of animal care and use that would further contribute to increasing the quality of research (Appendix 2 Animal care and use checklist).</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>EQIPD-defined principles, user-defined content</title><p>Implementation of the EQIPD Quality System does not require researchers to stop or reduce ongoing experimental work. It is designed so that it takes only minimal effort to sign up and begin the journey toward a quality system that should help researchers gradually improve certain quality aspects of their work.</p><p>The EQIPD Quality System gives guidance on expectations for quality-related measures, defines criteria for adequate processes (i.e. performance standards; see Appendix 1 Glossary for definition) and provides examples of how such measures can be developed and implemented. However, it does not prescribe any pre-determined solutions. Rather, users define their own specific solutions tailored to their individual settings.</p><p>For example, integrity of research data is one of the central concepts that the EQIPD Quality System aims to support. Four core requirements define the desired outcomes for raw data generation and handling (core requirement #6; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), data storage (core requirement #7; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), data traceability (core requirement #8; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and transparency of reported data (core requirement #9; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the ‘what’ is clearly described. However, there are various ways to fulfil these requirements. For instance, secure data storage could be achieved by using conventional paper-based laboratory notebooks, electronic laboratory notebooks, custom-built electronic solutions or paper-based controlled-access archives. Thus, there is flexibility in how integrity of research data could be achieved, and it is for the users of the system to decide on the best solution for their specific situation.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5"><title>Focused on the generation of fit-for-purpose research data</title><p>In general, EQIPD recommends that scientists apply protection against risks of bias for every study and unambiguously disclose the protective measures used. Each study has a particular purpose and the rigor applied to the study should be defined, documented in advance and be commensurate with the purpose of the study.</p><p>There are modes of research that can tolerate a certain level of uncertainty and do not lead to a formal <italic>knowledge claim</italic> (see Appendix 1 Glossary for definition). Such work is an essential part of the research process and may be used to generate hypotheses or to provide evidence to give the investigator greater confidence that an emerging hypothesis is valid, to develop new methods or to ‘screen’ compounds for potential effects prior to more formal testing.</p><p>There are also modes of research where researchers cannot accept inadequate control of the risks that can bias the research results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dirnagl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hooijmans et al., 2014</xref>). For research that is conducted with the prior intention of informing a knowledge claim, EQIPD requires that maximal possible rigor is applied (and exceptions explained and documented in the study plan; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Such research will usually (but not always) involve some form of null hypothesis statistical testing or formal Bayesian analysis. Here, hypotheses are articulated in advance of data collection, with pre-specified criteria defining the primary outcome measure and the statistical test to be used.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Expectations toward rigor in study design.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">All research</th><th valign="top">Research informing a formal knowledge claim <break/>(i.e. research requiring maximal rigor)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Study plan</td><td valign="top">Should be defined and documented before starting the experiments</td><td valign="top">Must be defined and documented before starting the experiments</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Study hypothesis</td><td valign="top">Advised to define</td><td valign="top">Must be pre-specified</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Blinding</td><td valign="top">Advised to implement</td><td valign="top">Should be implemented, exceptions must be justified and documented</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Randomization</td><td valign="top">Advised to implement</td><td valign="top">Should be implemented, exceptions must be justified and documented</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sample size calculation</td><td valign="top">Advised to define and document before starting the experiments</td><td valign="top">Must be defined and documented before starting the experiments (e.g. included in the study plan)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Data analysis</td><td valign="top">Advised to define and document before starting the experiments</td><td valign="top">Must be defined and documented before starting the experiments (e.g. as a formal statistical analysis plan and/or included in the study plan)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Inclusion and exclusion criteria</td><td valign="top">Advised to define and document before starting the experiments</td><td valign="top">Must be defined and documented before starting the experiments (e.g. included in the study plan)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Deviations from study plan</td><td valign="top">Advised to document</td><td valign="top">Must be documented</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Preregistration</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">Should be implemented</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Examples of research requiring maximal possible rigor include:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Experimental studies to scrutinize preclinical findings through replication of results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kimmelman et al., 2014</xref>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Research aimed at generating evidence that enables decisions which will invoke substantial future investment (e.g. a decision to initiate a new drug development project or to initiate GLP safety assessment of a new drug candidate);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Studies for which any outcome would be considered diagnostic evidence about a claim from prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nosek and Errington, 2020</xref>);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Labor-, resource-, and/or time-intensive studies that cannot be easily repeated.</p></list-item></list><p>EQIPD requires that investigators assert in advance whether a study will be conducted to inform a formal knowledge claim (core requirement #10; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and that they explicitly state this in the study (experimental) plans prepared before studies and experiments are conducted.</p><p>Further, it is required for all types of research that everyone in the research unit is adequately trained and competent (core requirement #11; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), has access to protocols for experimental methods (core requirement #12; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), follows adequate procedures for the handling and storage of samples and materials (core requirement #13; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and uses research equipment and tools that are suitable for the intended use (core requirement #14; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-6"><title>A system, not just a collection of guidelines and recommendations</title><p>Development and implementation of flexible and fit-for-purpose solutions are usually enabled by introducing a continuous improvement process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deming, 1986</xref>).

The EQIPD Toolbox provides information on what is the raw data and what are the best practices in recording and handling the raw data (How). In many cases, the new workflow is applied and has the desired effect. In some cases, there may be deficiencies identified that require remediation such as changes in the protocols, additional communication, educational and training efforts. Evaluation of the success in implementation of new processes concludes the cycle (Assessment).</p><p>In addition, the successful use of a new method or procedure often requires training, adequate and timely communication, feedback on incidents and errors, etc. To fully establish the EQIPD Quality System, several corrective or feedback mechanisms have to be included.

Tools developed and shared by EQIPD can also be used for other purposes – for example, as a source of information about specific aspects of good research practice, as a guidance for specific types of projects (e.g. industry-academia collaboration), or to enable a specific collaboration project by providing a purpose-fit certification of the current practices being in line with the EQIPD expectations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>Levels of use of the EQIPD framework.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Levels of use:</th><th valign="top">Information only (incl. training)</th><th valign="top">Purpose-fit certification</th><th valign="top">Quality System</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">EQIPD guidance:</td><td valign="top">Recommendations on best practices, examples, templates</td><td valign="top">Basic set of core requirements</td><td valign="top">Full set of core requirements</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Main users:</td><td valign="top">Research units, funding organizations</td><td valign="top">Research units</td><td valign="top">Research units</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Expected use:</td><td valign="top">As necessary, follow specific recommendations or use provided tools to improve work processes (e.g. increase transparency or make raw data findable or improve reporting) <break/>As appropriate, use information provided by EQIPD in training programs; communicate to collaborators, grantees, etc.</td><td valign="top">Confirm that current quality practices are in line with the basic set of EQIPD core requirements (related to data integrity and rigor in study design, conduct, analysis, and reporting)</td><td valign="top">Align current research quality practices with the EQIPD expectations (implement full set of core requirements including those that define quality system – i.e. availability of resources, process owner, quality objectives, and continuous improvement mechanisms)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Dedicated efforts by the research unit (e.g., regular and sustained efforts, dedicated personnel):</td><td valign="top">None</td><td valign="top">Limited</td><td valign="top">Yes <break/>(proportional to quality objectives)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Context of use:</td><td valign="top">Research unit is informed about expectations by current or future collaborators, funders, sponsors, publishers, etc.</td><td valign="top">Flexible solution driven by the time- and resource-critical needs of specific collaboration(s)</td><td valign="top">Stable solution for long-term maintenance of research rigor standards</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Assessment by the EQIPD team:</td><td valign="top">No</td><td valign="top">Yes</td><td valign="top">Yes</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Since the scientists themselves will be the main users of the EQIPD framework, their leading and proactive role in improving the quality of their own scientific data will define the ways the framework can be used to prepare more and more research units to accept a Quality System as a means for long-term maintenance or research rigor standards.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Implementation of the EQIPD Quality System</title><p>Even a lean and user-friendly quality system requires effort and resources to be implemented and maintained.

This basis includes absolute must-have (core) elements that:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>are the same for all labs</p></list-item><list-item><p>are required to support the next steps</p></list-item><list-item><p>can be completed within days</p></list-item></list><p>This set of requirements was chosen according to the principles that are uniform to all types of research units and is completed by the following four steps:</p><p>Step 1. Establish a Process Owner</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>WHY: This process needs a leader who takes the overall responsibility for implementing the EQIPD Quality System and is willing to drive the process forward.</p></list-item><list-item><p>WHAT: EQIPD defines the Process Owner as a person within the research unit who has the necessary resources or access to them, the authority, the competence and takes the responsibility to start all implementation steps needed to establish the EQIPD Quality System.</p></list-item><list-item><p>HOW: Different research units may have differing criteria for identifying such leaders, ranging from a self-nomination for a small research unit to dedicated professionals in larger organizations.</p></list-item></list><p>Step 2. Define quality objectives</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>WHY: The EQIPD Quality System will turn into a burden and resources will be wasted if the Process Owner and the research team do not understand the objectives of investing time and efforts into the implementation and maintenance of the system.</p></list-item><list-item><p>WHAT: The Process Owner, alone or in discussions with the research team, develops a concise summary of why quality matters for that specific research unit. The Process Owner discusses with the team what specifically is at stake if the proper quality is not maintained.</p></list-item><list-item><p>HOW: EQIPD provides a template with guiding questions to develop a quality objective summary (called ‘Mission’) as well as examples of statements on how a quality system or higher research rigor could help scientists achieve goals in different environments and at different positions.</p></list-item></list><p>Step 3. Set up a communication plan in the research unit where the EQIPD Quality System is to be applied</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>WHY: The EQIPD Quality System can only be implemented in a specific research environment where roles and responsibilities of every team member are clearly defined and there is a clear plan for communication between team members.</p></list-item><list-item><p>WHAT: Define a research unit (lab, territory, organization or part thereof) where the EQIPD Quality System will be applied in order to identify all colleagues who need to be informed about the new process, colleagues who need to be actively involved in working on the EQIPD Quality System implementation; set up a communication plan/schedule of working meetings; make sure that the communication plan supports a two-way information flow (i.e., also to capture feedback related to the performance of the existing and newly introduced practices).</p></list-item><list-item><p>HOW: Depending on the organization, the initial information can be distributed via email, the intranet or during regular or extraordinary team meetings. The Process Owner may assemble a dedicated team or appoint a colleague to be responsible for implementing the EQIPD Quality System. The Process Owner is responsible for establishing a Communication Plan. EQIPD provides guidance for establishing the communication plan and templates for documenting all roles and responsibilities. All these templates (as well as all other guiding and supporting information) can be found in the Toolbox.</p></list-item></list><p>Step 4. Establish a documentation plan to make data and associated documents traceable and any changes transparent</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>WHY: Traceable and transparent handling of all information related to study design, conduct, analysis and reporting is a pre-requisite for good research practice.</p></list-item><list-item><p>WHAT: The documentation plan should ensure the ability to find the source of data (raw and analyzed) that is presented in a report or presentation and should contain a contemporaneous description of the experiment from which the data originated. A qualified reviewer should be able to link figures, graphs, conclusions, and other summary data to the raw data that was processed/analyzed; link the summary data to the corresponding experiment described in a lab notebook entry; and, likewise, link the lab notebook entry to the raw data (e.g., when generated by an automated instrument).</p></list-item><list-item><p>HOW: Depending on the organization, resources and workflows, this could be an electronic or paper-based lab notebook, a more complex Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), or some other form of archiving as long as the information handling procedures are transparent and properly documented.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s15-2"><title>Phase 2 – Defined by user-specific needs</title><p>During this Phase, the primary focus is on challenges that are specific to the research unit where the EQIPD Quality System is being established.</p><p>The team led by the Process Owner identifies needs pertinent to the researchers’ environment – e.g., related to funding sources, collaboration partners, reporting and publication strategies, institutional, national and applicable international laws and regulations, use of animal subjects, etc.</p><p>Some of these needs have already been reviewed by the EQIPD team, summaries are available from the Toolbox.</p><p>Others will need to be reviewed by the Process Owner and the team to identify and develop appropriate solutions.</p><p>There are no time limits set to complete this phase. The organization may also remain in this position if, for example, there are not enough financial or personnel resources to continue the process. The decision to move to the next phase is made by the Process Owner and the team based on the following criteria:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All high-priority challenges have been addressed;</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are motivation, resources and organizational support to complete the implementation of the EQIPD Quality System.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s15-3"><title>Phase 3 – Complete the system</title><p>The EQIPD team has designed a set of 18 Core Requirements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) that must be fulfilled in order to reach the status of a functional quality system. Several of these Core Requirements are addressed during Phase one and Phase 2.</p><p>The goal of Phase three is to address those Core Requirements that have not been implemented so far but are essential to complete the development of the EQIPD Quality System.</p><p>However, for different research units, the remaining effort will be different because the Core Requirements addressed during Phase two are selected/chosen depending on the user-specific needs.</p><p>Therefore, it is anticipated that there will be research units for which Phase three requirements will only be a small step, as most Core Requirements have already been implemented during Phase 1 and 2, and those for which this final step may be a significant task demanding time and resources.</p><p>EQIPD also explicitly acknowledges the possibility for research units to not pursue the completion of the System. In fact, going through Phase 1 and 2 in many cases may already enable high quality research outputs and researchers may be satisfied with the progress achieved and make an indefinite pause.</p><p>*****</p><p>In summary, the core requirements necessary to build and declare a functional EQIPD Quality System are spread over three implementation phases. It is expected that, in most cases, these requirements will not appear as a burden because:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>during Phase 1, the number of requirements is kept to an absolute minimum and the goal is only to ensure that the research team has everything needed in place to start building a Quality System;</p></list-item><list-item><p>during Phase 2, requirements are mostly introduced indirectly – via research processes that are important and fully understandable for the users (i.e., while addressing the various needs specific to their environment, from funding and publishing to environmental health and safety);</p></list-item><list-item><p>during Phase 3, research teams deal with the remaining requirements that may be easier to handle because:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>a major portion of the work has already been done, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>there is a habit established that makes continuous improvement a manageable routine.</p></list-item></list></list-item></list><p>After the Quality System is established, the maintenance focus is on continuous improvement that accompanies the use of the Quality System. For example, there may be new needs and challenges identified.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63294.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Zaidi</surname><given-names>Mone</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Curtis</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution/></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The study reports the development of a novel quality system created under the aegis of the EQIPD Consortium.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Curtis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You describe the work from the Enhancing Quality in Preclinical Data (EQIPD) consortium, whose main goal was to develop a preclinical research quality system that can be applied in both public and private sectors and is non-proprietary. This constitutes a set of 18 principles, or &quot;core requirements&quot;, that define objectives for the planning of research as well as for operations and analysis. Overall, the enthusiasm for this manuscript was modest and while all reviewers agreed that the article should be published, there were major suggestions for improvement.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers noted that the paper was noble for taking on the topic of false or misleading research findings and their goal to improve research rigor and honesty. Moreover, their introduction of a host of processes and box-checking steps to incorporate into research would be appreciated by lab managers. However, the reviewers note that, written in its current form as a process document, there were few concrete examples provided to illustrate the concepts discussed as applicable to a general research lab. This lack of applied concepts also led to confusion regarding the underlying EQUIPD initiative itself: there was confusion regarding its implementation as software vs advisory committee vs regulatory philosophy. In addition to providing examples of how to apply the EQUIPD principles in a practical, concrete example, one reviewer suggested that working with journals to help them understand and check submissions for compliance with such a set of rules may be a worthwhile endeavor; in other words, EQUIPD would seem meaningless if compliance checkers did not exist as part of the overall process. Lastly, a revision of the introduction and context of the work is recommended; reviewers took issue with the notion that reduced drug approvals over recent years is attributable to poor preclinical rigor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63294.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers noted that the paper was noble for taking on the topic of false or misleading research findings and their goal to improve research rigor and honesty. Moreover, their introduction of a host of processes and box-checking steps to incorporate into research would be appreciated by lab managers. However, the reviewers note that, written in its current form as a process document, there were few concrete examples provided to illustrate the concepts discussed as applicable to a general research lab.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new Table 3 to illustrate “what this is all about” – i.e. five basic principles that explain how the EQIPD QS operates. For each principle, we use an example of randomization for a specific illustration how principles are applied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This lack of applied concepts also led to confusion regarding the underlying EQUIPD initiative itself: there was confusion regarding its implementation as software vs advisory committee vs regulatory philosophy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed information about the tools and have revised the text to make it clear that this manuscript presents a novel Quality System rather than software or anything else. We have also provided additional illustrations such as Figure 2 that illustrates optional use of tools developed by EQIPD. Finally, we have added a new Table 5 that provides an overview of how the EQIPD framework cane be used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to providing examples of how to apply the EQUIPD principles in a practical, concrete example, one reviewer suggested that working with journals to help them understand and check submissions for compliance with such a set of rules may be a worthwhile endeavor; in other words, EQUIPD would seem meaningless if compliance checkers did not exist as part of the overall process.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new section describing the assessment processes that have been developed by EQIPD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, a revision of the introduction and context of the work is recommended; reviewers took issue with the notion that reduced drug approvals over recent years is attributable to poor preclinical rigor.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to make sure that reduced drug approvals are attributable to lacking research rigor.
