however, the emergence of rifampin resistance necessitates the development of new antibiotics. Here, we communicate the first single-molecule characterization of MtbRNAP elongation and its inhibition by three diverse small-molecule inhibitors: N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (D-IX216), streptolydigin (Stl), and pseudouridimycin (PUM) using high-resolution optical tweezers. Compared to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNA polymerase (EcoRNAP), MtbRNAP transcribes more slowly, has similar mechanical robustness, and only weakly recognizes <italic>E. coli</italic> pause sequences. The three small-molecule inhibitors of MtbRNAP exhibit strikingly different effects on transcription elongation. In the presence of D-IX216, which inhibits RNAP active-center bridge-helix motions required for nucleotide addition, the enzyme exhibits transitions between slowly and super-slowly elongating inhibited states. Stl, which inhibits the RNAP trigger-loop motions also required for nucleotide addition, inhibits RNAP primarily by inducing pausing and backtracking. PUM, a nucleoside analog of UTP, in addition to acting as a competitive inhibitor, induces the formation of slowly elongating RNAP-inhibited states. Our results indicate that the three classes of small-molecule inhibitors affect the enzyme in distinct ways and show that the combination of Stl and D-IX216, which both target the RNAP bridge helix, has a strong synergistic effect on the enzyme.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>single molecule biophysics</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM041376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ebright</surname><given-names>Richard H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM032543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Wenxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/006w34k90</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optical tweezers are used to gain mechanistic insight in the mechanism of inhibition of three distinct compounds being developed as antibiotics against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the second most prevalent infectious disease causing morbidity and mortality worldwide (after COVID-19). There are 10 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths yearly, which incur $12 billion in medical and economic costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">World Health Organization, 2023</xref>). Rifampin is a small-molecule inhibitor of MtbRNAP and is a first-line treatment for TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Severinov et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Molodtsov et al., 2017</xref>). The emergence and proliferation of rifampin resistance in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> have led to an effort to identify and develop new small-molecule inhibitors that effectively inhibit rifampin-resistant MtbRNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gill and Garcia, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stefan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). A thorough understanding of the activity of MtbRNAP and its interactions with these new inhibitors is critical for informing and facilitating inhibitor development against TB.</p><p>In the last three decades, single-molecule optical tweezers studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> RNAP (EcoRNAP) and eukaryotic RNAP II have provided key insights on transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 1998</xref>), including the direct, real-time observation of single-base-pair stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbondanzieri et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, these studies have revealed details about sequence-dependent pausing, factor-dependent pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neuman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref>), and backtracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lisica et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shaevitz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galburt et al., 2007</xref>). However, single-molecule studies of MtbRNAP and its inhibition by small-molecule inhibitors have been scarce. Current studies have primarily been structural and bulk assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyaci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyaci et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chakraborty, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gulten and Sacchettini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hubin et al., 2017</xref>), with only one study by single-molecule methods addressing initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vishwakarma et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a study of transcription elongation by MtbRNAP and its inhibition by small-molecule inhibitors using high-resolution single-molecule optical tweezers. First, we characterize <italic>in singulo</italic> the transcription elongation of MtbRNAP alone, including its pause-free velocity and mechanical robustness. Next, we assess three small-molecule inhibitors that target the transcription elongation of MtbRNAP. These inhibitors bind to sites distinct from rifampin and remain effective despite polymerase mutations that confer resistance to rifampin. These inhibitors are D-IX216 (an N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ebright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2017</xref>), streptolydigin (Stl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rinehart et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Temiakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arseniev et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zorov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuske et al., 2005</xref>), and pseudouridimycin (PUM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maffioli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cain et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maffioli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamides selectively inhibit Mycobacterial RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2017</xref>) by binding to a site at the N-terminal end of the bridge helix. This site is conserved in Mycobacterial polymerases but not in other bacterial polymerases. The bound inhibitor interferes with the conformational dynamics of the bridge helix that are necessary for nucleotide addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ebright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we used D-IX216, we found that addition of this inhibitor results in the enzyme transitioning to different inhibition states that add nucleotides much more slowly. Stl acts as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of bacterial RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rinehart et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Temiakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zorov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuske et al., 2005</xref>). Stl binds to the region between the bridge helix and trigger loop, interfering with the closing of the trigger loop, which is required for nucleotide addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Temiakov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuske et al., 2005</xref>). We find that Stl stabilizes pausing by the enzyme. PUM is another broad-spectrum inhibitor of bacterial RNAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maffioli et al., 2019</xref>) and is a nucleoside analog of UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maffioli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cain et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maffioli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhringer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sosio et al., 2018</xref>), competitively inhibiting the binding of UTP. Additionally, PUM also appears to have an additional inhibitory effect on the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maffioli et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, when combined, D-IX216 and Stl exhibit synergistic inhibition of the enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biophysical and mechanochemical characterization of MtbRNAP</title><p>We studied the elongation of MtbRNAP using a high-resolution optical tweezers assay, where the RNAP and one end of the DNA template were tethered to polystyrene microspheres held in optical traps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, left panel).

DTD analysis of this activity yields values similar to D-IX216-free MtbRNAP, further suggesting that the fast activity corresponded to a D-IX216-free enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Hence, we identify the fast DTD states as the pause-free, elemental pause, and the long pause states. In contrast, the slow and super-slow activities were exclusively observed with D-IX216 present, indicating that they arise from its binding to the RNAP. We shall refer to the slow and super-slow as <italic>inhibited states</italic> of the enzyme, to differentiate them from the nucleotide addition states obtained from DTD analysis mentioned earlier. When bound to D-IX216, MtbRNAP displayed a consistent slow nucleotide addition rate lasting tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). The inhibited states persist for several steps and can interconvert with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). DTD analysis of these inhibited states revealed that the slow and super-slow inhibited states consist of multiple (nucleotide addition) states, each exhibiting distinct nucleotide addition rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). We emphasize here that inhibited states refer to a persistent activity of the enzyme lasting for multiple incorporation cycles, while nucleotide addition states may change between every step. The rates of the various nucleotide addition states found for the slow and super-slow inhibited states do not match those of the pause-free, elemental pause, or long pause states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), so we conclude that these are states distinct from the normal ones visited by the polymerase.</p><p>When the concentration of D-IX216 was increased from 70 to 560 nM, the kinetic parameters extracted from the DTD analysis did not greatly change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref>), suggesting that the slow and super-slow inhibited states occur during the prolonged binding of a single D-IX216 molecule. This inference was supported by our washing experiments, which revealed that removing D-IX216 from the transcription medium of the affected polymerase did not immediately restore normal enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>). If this interpretation is correct, the conversion to the slow activity results from a binding event, while reversion to the fast activity is due to unbinding. Using the lifetimes of the fast and slow activities in the 280 nM case, we calculated a <italic>k<sub>on</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>off</sub></italic>, and <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> for D-XI216, obtaining 0.133±0.006 µM<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup>, 0.0032±0.0014 s<sup>–1</sup>, and 24.1±10.6 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4b</xref>). The <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> so attained is consistent with the IC<sub>50</sub> of ~100 nM. We have no explanation for what process is involved in the interconversion between the slow and the super-slow inhibited states, but we speculate that it may correspond to two distinct binding modes of the inhibitor to the enzyme, affecting its activity differently.</p><p>We also examined whether the induced slowing by D-IX216 could be due to reduced rNTP affinity by decreasing the rNTP concentration from 250 µM to 25 µM (~5 to ~0.5 x K<sub>M</sub> for the uninhibited polymerase) in the presence of D-IX216. However, the DTD behavior of the slow and super-slow inhibited states remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4c</xref>), suggesting that rNTP binding is not rate-limiting in these inhibited states, unlike what is expected at these concentrations in the absence of the inhibitor.</p><p>Lastly, we investigated the effects of D-IX216 on transcription across the Mtb molecular ruler to determine if these effects were sequence-dependent. Our findings revealed that slow or super-slow events occurred randomly along the DNA template, consistent with our observations using the original sequence of Mtb DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). When MtbRNAP is in the slow inhibited state while crossing the repeats region, we observed that D-IX216 increases the residence time at every position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). We normalized the RTH values to the median residence time of each inhibited state to account for the different incorporation times associated with the fast, slow, and super-slow inhibited states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, middle). This normalization demonstrated that the relative strength of the designated pause increased, as indicated by the heightened RTH peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, right). If pause <italic>c</italic> is an off-pathway pause, a kinetic competition should exist between forward translocation and pausing. Therefore, we attribute the increased strength of this pause to a decrease in the transcription rate caused by the inhibitor. In conclusion, we found that D-IX216 globally slows MtbRNAP translocation in a sequence-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Streptolydigin induces backtracking in MtbRNAP</title><p>Using the Mtb molecular ruler, we added 4.5–45 µM Stl to a transcribing MtbRNAP under 18 pN of assisting constant force.

This analog was positioned on the template strand of the DNA-RNA hybrid, initially at position +2, and then moved towards position +1 due to the RNAP translocation process. The workflow included the use of a fluorescent artificial bubble to measure the effect of Stl on the translocation state of MtbRNAP. After the RNAP incorporated one rATP, the translocation state was measured by the dye’s fluorescence in the following base in the template DNA. When the base was paired, fluorescence was low due to quenching; when the base was unpaired, such as in the post-translocated state, the fluorescence was high. The assay conditions consisted of transcription buffer and 100 µM rATP, along with either 100 µM dATP, 0.25 µM MtbGreA, 7.5 µM Stl, or 0.25 µM MtbGreA / 7.5 µM Stl.

In this assay, we assemble the RNAP bubble to be just in front of the 2AP, whereby translocation by the RNAP causes the 2AP to un-basepair and fluoresce more strongly. The cognate rNTP is not present in solution, so the fluorescence persists after translocation. This allows us to distinguish between the post-translocated and the other states of the enzyme (pre-translocated or otherwise, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

The resulting plasmids were named pET-DUET-BC-avitag or pET-DUET-BC-sortag, respectively. As for the vectors for expressing Mtb transcription factors, we amplified the corresponding gene from the Mtb genome and inserted it into the plasmid pET His6 TEV LIC (Addgene, # 29653) using ligation-independent cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To make plasmids with the DNA templates for the single-molecule assays, we took pUC19 and cloned the promoter AC50, the 10 bp stalling cassette, and the transcribable region, which derived from a ~2.7 kb region of genes rpoB and C from the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> Erdman genome (a gift from Professor Sara Stanley). We used an additional round-the-horn site mutagenesis to remove the lac promoter. We named this plasmid pUC19-del-Lac-AC50-MtbrpoBC. We used this plasmid to create another plasmid containing a molecular ruler. First, we removed one side of the BsaI in the rpoC gene by inserting a 255 bp DNA fragment of terminator WhiB1. Second, we replaced the stalling sequence with a 20 bp CU-less cassette using round-the-horn mutagenesis. Third, we used NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB E2621S) to insert a synthetic DNA fragment, an 8 x repeat of a 63 bp sequence of pause <italic>c</italic> (Genescript), into the rpoB gene.

First, we pre-incubated approximately 1 µM of biotinylated-MtbRNAP with around 10 µM of MtbCarD at 37 °C for 5 min in a final volume of 2 µL. Subsequently, we diluted the biotinylated MtbRNAP in buffer TB40 (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 mM TCEP) to a concentration of 10 nM. We then stalled 5 nM of polymerases by incubating them with 150 µM GpG, 2 nM Mtb DNA template in stall buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 3 µM rATP, 3 µM rGTP, and 3 µM rCTP) at 37 °C for 20 min. If we were to use the Eco DNA repeat, we would substitute GpG with ApU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Whitley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To attach the DNA handles or stall complexes to the microbead surfaces, we used a few different methods. In the first method, we incubated a 0.1 nM stalled complex labeled with double-digoxygenin with 0.05–0.1% passivated anti-dig beads in TB40 buffer for 10 min at 22 °C. Then, we added 0.05 µg/µL heparin at 22 °C for 5 min to remove non-competent polymerases. In the second method, we incubated 0.2–0.5 nM digoxygenin-labeled DNA handle with 300 nM neutravidin and the same amount of anti-digoxigenin beads at 22 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of heparin. In the third method, we conducted ligation-based deposition by incubating a 0.1 nM stall complex with 0.1–0.05% passivated oligo beads, 0.1 mM rATP, and 4 U/µL T4 DNA ligase in TB40 buffer at 22 °C for 45 min to facilitate the ligation reaction. This was followed by a 5 min treatment with heparin at 22 °C. In the fourth method, we attached 0.2–0.5 nM DNA handle by incubating it with passivated complementary oligo beads, 300 nM neutravidin, 0.1 mM rATP, and 4 U/µL of T4 DNA ligase in TB40 buffer for an identical prolonged incubation, followed by heparin treatment. The bead depositions were either kept on ice for immediate use, or preserved by flash freezing and stored at –80 °C.</p><p>For every 10 µL of deposited beads, we added 1000–1500 µL of degassed TB130 Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 130 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM TCEP, and 5 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>) before injecting into the fluidics chamber.</p><p>In the experiments with MtbCarD and MtbGreA, the final amount of initiating CarD contributed to the amount free in solution in elongation was as low as ~13 pM (diluted from 100 to 120 nM MtbCarD), and neither causes any effects on pausing or velocity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>High-resolution optical tweezer transcription elongation assay</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, there is a representation of the optical tweezers setup, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>, there are representations of assisting constant force, opposing constant force, and opposing passive mode experiments.

In short, the single-molecule assay to measure transcription elongation involves two beads, one coated with RNAP stalled complexes, and one coated with DNA handles with neutravidin on the free end. The two beads are caught in separate traps, and when the beads are brought in close proximity, the neutravidin on the end of the DNA handle binds to the biotin attached to the RNAP and a tether is formed. The beads are brought apart, and the DNA handle separates the RNAP from the surface of the bead to reduce photodamage. We also used an oxygen-scavenger system based on sodium azide to increase the robustness of collecting processive activity. For both EcoRNAP and MtbRNAP, the attachment to biotin is done via its β' subunit.</p><p>We injected the microbeads into a microfluidics chamber through different channels to diffuse them to a central main channel, trapped them by optical tweezers, and brought them close to each other from the tether. To resume the elongation activity, we flowed a solution containing rNTPs, transcription factors, and/or inhibitors through a shunt positioned very close to the tethered complex. We used fluidic valves to control the flow via gravity. When transcribing the Eco repeat sequence, we used a nucleotide cocktail of 1 mM rUTP, 1 mM rGTP, 0.5 mM rATP, and 0.25 mM rCTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabizon et al., 2018</xref> to match previous studies.</p><p>The instrument records the trap separation and monitors the displacement of the beads from the centers of the traps, and handles force feedback for the constant force experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tropea et al., 2009</xref>).

Briefly, the repeating pauses let us determine a scale factor and offset factor to each transcription trace based on the location of the pauses. The scale is chosen to space the pauses 68 bp apart, and the offset is chosen to place the pause at position 50 bp into the repeat. This is done by taking the RTH of the repeat, averaged across the 8 repetitions, for a range of scale factors. The one that aligns the pauses best is the one with the most peaked RTH (a poor scale factor does not align the pauses, so makes the RTH flat, a good scale factor aligns the pauses and thus it will show up as a peak). The offset factor is then chosen to place the location of the strongest peak in the best RTH at 50 bp.</p><p>For the analysis of passive mode data, individual stalling force-velocity profiles are generated and the force <italic>F</italic> and velocity <italic>V</italic> is transformed into normalized units <italic>v</italic> and <italic>f</italic>, with the velocity normalized by dividing by the maximum force <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> and the force normalized by dividing by the stall force, which is the force at which the velocity is half of <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic>. These individual force-velocity profiles are averaged together and fit to the function <italic>v(f)=(1+A)/(1+Aexp(fδ/kT</italic>)). For a short derivation, let the nucleotide addition cycle be made up of two steps that occur sequentially, one force-independent (comprising the biochemical transitions) and force-dependent (comprising the mechanical transitions). Let the rates of these terms be <italic>k<sub>biochemical</sub> = k<sub>b</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>mechanical</sub>(F)=k<sub>m</sub>*exp(-Fd/kT</italic>). For the mechanical term, the system must move some distance <italic>d</italic> against the optical tweezers’ force <italic>F</italic> to reach the transition state, so the transition state energy is raised by <italic>Fd</italic> and the rate is affected via a Boltzmann factor. The transcription velocity is then the inverse of the sum of the inverses of these two rates: <italic>V(F) = (k<sub>b</sub><sup>–1</sup>+k<sub>m</sub><sup>–1</sup>exp(Fd/kT))<sup>–1</sup></italic>. Let <italic>V<sub>max</sub> = V(0)=1/(k<sub>b</sub><sup>–1</sup>+k<sub>m</sub><sup>–1</sup></italic>), so the normalized velocity <italic>v(F)=V(F)/V<sub>max</sub> = k<sub>b</sub><sup>–1</sup>+k<sub>m</sub><sup>–1</sup> /(k<sub>b</sub><sup>–1</sup>+k<sub>m</sub><sup>–1</sup>exp(Fd/kT</italic>)).

A is a parameter that dictates the ratio between the biochemical (force-independent) and mechanical (force-dependent) rates, and <italic>δ</italic> is the force dependence of the mechanical term.

When stating &quot;significant,&quot; please explicitly describe the statistical test or analysis method used.</p><p>2) Please clarify inconsistent nomenclatures as indicated by reviewer #1.</p><p>3) Please clarify or repeat the same concentrations of D-IX216 in the individual vs. combined inhibitor treatments with Stl.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The studies by Herrera-Asmat et al., appear to be carefully performed and the statistical analysis of the data appropriate. However, there are a number of nomenclature inconsistencies and several unsupported conclusions as well as missing primary data that are both necessary and must be addressed before publication. These additions will significantly improve presentation of the data and conclusions for the wide audience of <italic>eLife</italic> and assure the experimental reproducibility that is essential to move the field forward.</p><p>There are a number of data and editorial issues that made evaluation of the Herrera-Asmat et al., manuscript quite difficult and time consuming. In general, the data appear to be carefully collected, and the statistical evaluation well thought through. Nevertheless, the authors need to address several issues to improve both the clarity and accuracy of the manuscript. These are:</p><p>1) P.3, L.92-93: nowhere in the manuscript are the number of (individual) molecules analyzed noted. The optical tweezers setup can only observe a single RNAP molecule at a time. These observations may include multiple kinetic events from individual molecules that underpin statistical significance. However, to understand the general nature of these kinetic events, one must observe and characterize multiple individual molecules to provide power to any statistical analysis.</p><p>2) P.3, L.118-125: The authors define three kinetic states of the RNAP; pause-free (pf), elemental pause (ep) and long pause (lp). However, this abbreviated nomenclature is not used consistently throughout the manuscript, making reading and evaluation difficult at best. This is complicated by random changes in this nomenclature that include &quot;on-pathway (for pf) and short pauses (for ef). Moreover, it was not clear to this referee whether there was a connection between pf, ef, and lp to the fast, slow and super-slow activities observed for the RNAP's in the presence of drug inhibitors. This should be explicitly considered in the text.</p><p>3) P.4, L.134: Isn't the &quot;passive mode&quot; functionally equivalent to the &quot;opposing force&quot; mode? Ultimately the authors clearly determine at which &quot;opposing&quot; force the polymerase stalls. This seems to be another case where consistent use of nomenclature would help the reader.</p><p>4) P.4, L.150-153: This is a rather confusing sentence. By definition backtracking must occur after a stall in forward polymerase activity. Thus, δ seems more likely to be the nucleotide distance to the transition where the opposing mechanical force equals the polymerization force?</p><p>5) P.5,L.157: Isn't it more accurate that, MtbRNAP tends to pause less frequently than EcoRNAP under &quot;both&quot; assisting &quot;and opposing&quot; force &quot;for&quot; both the Eco and Mtb templates?</p><p>6) P.6,L.174-175: This is a rather speculative conclusion without some genetic or mutational data and should be either eliminated or dramatically tempered.</p><p>7) P.5, L.186-189: Inconsistent (often confusing) nomenclature. The authors define the drug inhibitor D-IX216 as &quot;AAP&quot; in the introduction. Then inconsistently use D-IX216 and/or AAP throughout the manuscript. Either refer to AAP as the class of drugs and D-IX216 as the specific drug used in the studies, or AAP as the acronym for D-IX216, but not both or either depending on the mood.</p><p>8) P.5,L.193: The force conditions for this drug concentration analysis should be explicitly detailed.</p><p>9) P.6,L228-229 (and throughout the manuscript): The use of the word &quot;region&quot; does not seem appropriate. This really is a measure of polymerase &quot;activity&quot;. There would seem to be no reason not to refer to these kinetic regions as fast, slow and super-slow (polymerase) activities.</p><p>10) P.6,L.250 and 252: Figure 4e should refer to the left and right panels, respectively, to focus on specific results.</p><p>11) P.7,L.285-290: These sentences seem repetitive and are quite confusingly written. There must be a better way to express the differences in mathematical treatment of deep backtracking and shallow backtracking mechanics, and the relative fitting that describes the results.</p><p>12) P.8,L.307-308: These are not &quot;seemingly conflicting&quot; results. They are just &quot;different results&quot;.</p><p>13) P.8,L.331: Is this AAP's as a general class, or specifically D-IX216? I read it as the latter, but these continued confusing nomenclatures made simple reading of the manuscript quite difficult!</p><p>14) P.9,L.350: Two different concentrations of D-IX216 were used in the individual vs. combined inhibitor treatments with Stl. This difference makes these studies not exactly comparable and may change the results and interpretation. A repeat of these studies with comparable concentrations of drug is essential for this entire section and is a significant flaw in these studies.</p><p>15) P.9,L360: Rather than, &quot;Therefore we propose&quot;, one might consider, &quot;These studies appear consistent with the hypothesis …&quot;.</p><p>16) P.9,L389: &quot;unbinding&quot; should be replaced by &quot;inhibitor dissociation&quot;.</p><p>17) P.10,L.397-399: There must be a much simpler way of expressing the differences and relative value of single molecule studies vs. bulk studies? There is no question that the present studies identified new kinetic processes that would be impossible by bulk analysis. But the present sentence obscures this fact with repetitive words and pretentious language.</p><p>18) P.10,L.412-415: It would seem to this referee that the final sentence could better reflect the capabilities of single molecule analysis for antibiotic mechanics in developing combined treatments for improved patient outcomes?</p><p>19) Figure 2d (right panel): Equations should be included in Supplementary Materials with terms for Boltzman relation defined (not presently included anywhere in the manuscript). This could include the actual calculations, which were not immediately obvious and required significant time to deconvolute.</p><p>20) Figure 3b (right panel): Marking pause sites (a,b,c,d,his) would visually help readers.</p><p>21) Figure 3c (right panel): Marking pause site bands (a,b,c,d,his) for MtbRNAP would visually help readers. One assumes that the MtbRNAP pause site c is the major band and ultimately made up the MtbRNAP pause site array? Why was pause site b not used as an equivalent array? Seems a strong pause at least in early time points.</p><p>22) Figure 4a (left panel): What is the concentration of D-IX216?</p><p>23) Figure 4a (right panel): The pause dwell times for the fast kinetics prior to the super-slow activity seem different that the fast or slow activities?</p><p>24) Figure 5e and 5g: The authors must use consistent nomenclature for pf, ef, and lp in these panels. Moreover, the meaning of AF (assisted force) and OP (opposing force) should be included in the legend.</p><p>25) Figure 6c: The illustration of polymerase kinetic activity and State 1,2,3 is different than Figure 4d. It would be useful if the authors stuck to a type of illustration to make comparisons of Figures easy for the reader.</p><p>26) Suppl. Figure S2c: Use pf and ep, or some consistent nomenclature!</p><p>27) Suppl. Figure S4c: Same as #26 – consistent nomenclature, please!</p><p>Methods:</p><p>1) The studies were not performed at physiological ionic strength (looks like ~70mN). One wonders if there might be significant kinetic differences.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Referee report for &quot;Pleomorphic effects of three small-molecule inhibitors on transcription elongation by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> RNA polymerase&quot; by Omar Herrera-Asmat et al.</p><p>In this work, the authors use their well-established single-molecule optical tweezers assay to study the activity of the RNA polymerase from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. In particular, they investigate the changes in activity in the presence of three small-molecule inhibitors: N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (D-IX216), streptolydigin (Stl), and pseudouridimycin (PUM). They find a diverse range of effects on the polymerase, including transitions into a very slow activity state (induced by D-IX216 and PUM), induction of pausing and backtracking. Overall, the work provides interesting insights into the activity of an important pathogen with implications for the development of new drugs. This is a timely and relevant study that I found well-presented and interesting to read. Below, are some suggestions for clarifications and further improvements.</p><p>- In several places they authors make statements like &quot;there are no significant effects&quot; (line 133) or &quot;we observed an insignificant decrease&quot; (line 307). It would be good to explicitly state what statistical test / method of analysis was used.</p><p>- Related to the last point: In many of the figures there are bar charts essentially comparing various kinetic parameters. I believe it would be useful to -at least for key parameters- indicate which differences are statistically significant and which ones are not.</p><p>- The model used in Figure 2 to describe the force-dependent transcription velocity is not well explained. There is &quot;a parameter A&quot; (line 146), but then there is also lower case &quot;a&quot;, which is never defined? Also, the authors give values for the stall force, which does not appear to be a parameter in the model, but do not seem to give values for Vmax, which is used to rescale the axes. I think the model should be better explained and all parameters defined.

However, there are a number of nomenclature inconsistencies and several unsupported conclusions as well as missing primary data that are both necessary and must be addressed before publication. These additions will significantly improve presentation of the data and conclusions for the wide audience of eLife and assure the experimental reproducibility that is essential to move the field forward.</p><p>There are a number of data and editorial issues that made evaluation of the Herrera-Asmat et al., manuscript quite difficult and time consuming. In general, the data appear to be carefully collected, and the statistical evaluation well thought through. Nevertheless, the authors need to address several issues to improve both the clarity and accuracy of the manuscript. These are:</p><p>1) P.3, L.92-93: nowhere in the manuscript are the number of (individual) molecules analyzed noted. The optical tweezers setup can only observe a single RNAP molecule at a time. These observations may include multiple kinetic events from individual molecules that underpin statistical significance. However, to understand the general nature of these kinetic events, one must observe and characterize multiple individual molecules to provide power to any statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have now tabulated the number of traces (=number of individual RNAPs) from each condition tested in this work in Supplementary File 2, and have added references to the text and methods denoting that N information can be found there. For instance, one reference in Methods reads: “A list of conditions studied in the optical tweezers assay, including numbers of traces for each, is included in Supplementary File 2”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) P.3, L.118-125: The authors define three kinetic states of the RNAP; pause-free (pf), elemental pause (ep) and long pause (lp). However, this abbreviated nomenclature is not used consistently throughout the manuscript, making reading and evaluation difficult at best. This is complicated by random changes in this nomenclature that include &quot;on-pathway (for pf) and short pauses (for ef). Moreover, it was not clear to this referee whether there was a connection between pf, ef, and lp to the fast, slow and super-slow activities observed for the RNAP's in the presence of drug inhibitors. This should be explicitly considered in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviser raises a valid point. We now have unified nomenclature for these states and have explicitly defined them. To be clear, the analysis of the dwell time distributions yields kinetic states k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, …. For the inhibitor-free polymerase, we relate these k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, and k<sub>3</sub> to k<sub>pf</sub>, k<sub>ep</sub>, and k<sub>lp</sub>, respectively, since the kinetic lifetimes of the k<sub>1/2/3</sub> states match the lifetimes of the k<sub>pf/ep/lp</sub> states that have been previously described in other studies (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110749). For the states observed under the action of D-IX216 (slow and super-slow), the analysis of the dwell time distributions also yields a k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, and k<sub>3</sub>, but we do not relate those to k<sub>pf</sub>, k<sub>ef</sub>, and k<sub>lp</sub>. We have made this point clearer in the main text when this is discussed.</p><p>The labeling of states in Figures 1e, 2a, 4d, 5e, 6c, 7b, S2c (Figure 4 supplement 1), and S4c (Figure 4 supplement 3), have been changed to Pause-free, Elemental Pauses, and Long Pauses.</p><p>When discussing the slow and super-slow DTD analysis, we emphasize the differences between the states observed in the presence of D-IX216 and pf/ep/lp, relevant section copied here: “We emphasize here that inhibited states refer to a persistent activity of the enzyme lasting for multiple incorporation cycles, while nucleotide addition states may change between every step. The rates of the various nucleotide addition states found for the slow and super-slow inhibited states do not match those of the pause-free, elemental pause, or long pause states (Figure 4d), so we conclude that these are states distinct from the normal ones visited by the polymerase.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) P.4, L.134: Isn't the &quot;passive mode&quot; functionally equivalent to the &quot;opposing force&quot; mode? Ultimately the authors clearly determine at which &quot;opposing&quot; force the polymerase stalls. This seems to be another case where consistent use of nomenclature would help the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. Passive mode is an experimental procedure where the distance between the optical traps is kept fixed and therefore, as the enzyme moves, the force opposing the molecule increases. Thus, the difference between ‘passive mode’ and ‘opposing force mode’ as currently written in the text is as to whether force feedback is applied to keep the force constant at a series of pre-set values (‘opposing force mode’), or to let the force rise (in real time) as the polymerase transcribes (‘passive mode’). We have edited the terms to be clearer: the experimental modes are now ‘opposing passive mode’, ‘opposing constant force mode’, and ‘assisting constant force mode’. The relevant portions of the text and figures have been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) P.4, L.150-153: This is a rather confusing sentence. By definition backtracking must occur after a stall in forward polymerase activity. Thus, δ seems more likely to be the nucleotide distance to the transition where the opposing mechanical force equals the polymerization force?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that δ relates to the attainment of the stall state, but since that stall state is the backtracked state (as evident in visible backwards movement that occurs with stalling), we interpret it as being related to the degree of backtracking. If δ is related to the mechanical inhibition of polymerase forwards translocation (“fighting against the polymerization force”), then a value of δ close to the step size of the motor, 1bp, would have been obtained, but the experimental value of ~15bp strongly suggests that it describes a quantity related to the backward movement (backtracking) of the enzyme.</p><p>To elaborate, there is probably an intermediate stall state between forward translocation and backtracking, but since there is presumably no change in tether extension in the attainment of this state, the rate of attaining this state cannot be force-dependent. So, stalling is probably a stochastic process by which the polymerase transiently stochastically pauses, from which it can transit to a backtracking state, and the rate of going from the stochastic pause to the backtrack pause involves backward displacement and is therefore force-dependent with the opposing force promoting movement towards the backtracking direction. This process (a polymerase even in the absence of any drug first enters a short pause, from which it can enter a backtrack pause) matches proposed mechanisms for polymerase backtracking, e.g. see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110749.</p><p>We have edited the text to try to be clearer on these points and on the model itself. The main text section now reads: “The force-velocity curves can be fit to an unrestrained Boltzmann relation <italic>v(f)=(1+A)/(1+Aexp(fδ/kT))</italic>, where the process is split into mechanical (force-dependent) and biochemical (force-independent) terms. The ratio of these terms at zero force is the parameter A, and the strength of force dependence is <italic>δ</italic> (Figure 2d, see Methods). For both Eco and Mtb RNAPs, we find that A &lt;&lt; 1, indicating that biochemical transitions are rate-limiting at zero force in these instances, in line with prior findings for EcoRNAP. The value of δ is the distance to the transition state of polymerase stalling via backtracking, so we interpret this as the backtracking distance required by the RNAP to stall. For MtbRNAP, we obtain a value of 14 ± 1 nt (95% CI) (Figure 2d), comparable to the 13 ± 1 nt observed for EcoRNAP and findings from earlier studies on EcoRNAP.” We have also added a section to Methods where this model is derived and discussed in more depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) P.5,L.157: Isn't it more accurate that, MtbRNAP tends to pause less frequently than EcoRNAP under &quot;both&quot; assisting &quot;and opposing&quot; force &quot;for&quot; both the Eco and Mtb templates?</p></disp-quote><p>While the reviewer’s suggested statement would probably be true, Figure 1e does not relate to any opposing force data, and we don’t show any analysis directly comparing EcoRNAP and MtbRNAP in constant opposing force mode. So, we opt to keep the text as-is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) P.6,L.174-175: This is a rather speculative conclusion without some genetic or mutational data and should be either eliminated or dramatically tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and have elected to remove this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) P.5, L.186-189: Inconsistent (often confusing) nomenclature. The authors define the drug inhibitor D-IX216 as &quot;AAP&quot; in the introduction. Then inconsistently use D-IX216 and/or AAP throughout the manuscript. Either refer to AAP as the class of drugs and D-IX216 as the specific drug used in the studies, or AAP as the acronym for D-IX216, but not both or either depending on the mood.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was to do as you suggest: to refer to the family of drugs as AAPs, while the specific one we have tested is D-IX216. The phrase in the introduction (“the N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (AAP) D-IX216”) is unclear, we meant to define AAP as the shortening of N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide, separate from D-IX216. We realize we don’t have to define AAP, so we have removed this abbreviation. The sentence now reads “These inhibitors are D-IX216 (an N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide), streptolydigin (Stl), and pseudouridimycin (PUM),” which should be clearer. We have eliminated all reference to AAP otherwise. In particular, we referred to the drug we tested as “AAP” in a few places in the text. These have been changed to D-IX216.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) P.5,L.193: The force conditions for this drug concentration analysis should be explicitly detailed.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments were performed in constant assisting force mode. We have added this information to the text, the relevant section is copied here: “Upon adding 70-560 nM D-IX216 to a transcribing MtbRNAP (Figure 4a) under 18pN of assisting constant force, …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) P.6,L228-229 (and throughout the manuscript): The use of the word &quot;region&quot; does not seem appropriate. This really is a measure of polymerase &quot;activity&quot;. There would seem to be no reason not to refer to these kinetic regions as fast, slow and super-slow (polymerase) activities.</p></disp-quote><p>We had a lot of trouble thinking about nomenclature for these. We like your suggestion and have changed them to ‘fast/slow/super-slow activity’, at least until we define the term ‘inhibited state’ later on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) P.6,L.250 and 252: Figure 4e should refer to the left and right panels, respectively, to focus on specific results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) P.7,L.285-290: These sentences seem repetitive and are quite confusingly written. There must be a better way to express the differences in mathematical treatment of deep backtracking and shallow backtracking mechanics, and the relative fitting that describes the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the confusion results from including the final sentence, we think it is unnecessary and causes more confusion than clarity. The section now reads: “The recovery from the Stl-induced pauses before and after backtracking both exhibited single-exponential distributions (Figure 5c). A single-exponential distribution of backtrack durations is associated with <italic>deep backtracking</italic> and recovery via endonucleolysis, whereas a power law distribution (<italic>t<sup>-3/2</sup></italic>) corresponds to diffusive recovery from more shallow backtracking (Figure 5d).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) P.8,L.307-308: These are not &quot;seemingly conflicting&quot; results. They are just &quot;different results&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed it to your suggestion; the text now reads “These differing results may reflect differences in the mechanism of Stl inhibition between EcoRNAP and MtbRNAP.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) P.8,L.331: Is this AAP's as a general class, or specifically D-IX216? I read it as the latter, but these continued confusing nomenclatures made simple reading of the manuscript quite difficult!</p></disp-quote><p>As noted before (comment 7), this is a typo. This should read D-IX216.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) P.9,L.350: Two different concentrations of D-IX216 were used in the individual vs. combined inhibitor treatments with Stl. This difference makes these studies not exactly comparable and may change the results and interpretation. A repeat of these studies with comparable concentrations of drug is essential for this entire section and is a significant flaw in these studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included data of D-IX216 at 560 nM alone to make the comparison with the combined case straightforward. The changes can be seen in Figure S5a, Figure 7, and in the passages that reference those figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) P.9,L360: Rather than, &quot;Therefore we propose&quot;, one might consider, &quot;These studies appear consistent with the hypothesis …&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, we have changed the text to the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) P.9,L389: &quot;unbinding&quot; should be replaced by &quot;inhibitor dissociation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, it has been changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) P.10,L.397-399: There must be a much simpler way of expressing the differences and relative value of single molecule studies vs. bulk studies? There is no question that the present studies identified new kinetic processes that would be impossible by bulk analysis. But the present sentence obscures this fact with repetitive words and pretentious language.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, our intention here was not to compare bulk vs. single-molecule, as the referenced study is also a single-molecule force spectroscopy study. We at first thought it was possible that they did not document backtracking because they could not resolve it occurring (hence the reference to ‘spatiotemporal resolution’), but we realize it is also possible that the difference comes from the species of polymerase, as they studied EcoRNAP while we used MtbRNAP. The passage now reads: “Previous single-molecule studies have shown that Stl lengthens existing pauses in EcoRNAP, which is consistent with our observation that pause <italic>c</italic> is extended with Stl in MtbRNAP. However, in those studies, EcoRNAP was not found to backtrack after inhibition by Stl, which points to a difference in the inhibition mechanism of this drug with these two polymerases.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) P.10,L.412-415: It would seem to this referee that the final sentence could better reflect the capabilities of single molecule analysis for antibiotic mechanics in developing combined treatments for improved patient outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have elaborated a bit and have expanded this final sentence to a small paragraph on the benefits of single-molecule approaches in drug discovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Figure 2d (right panel): Equations should be included in Supplementary Materials with terms for Boltzman relation defined (not presently included anywhere in the manuscript). This could include the actual calculations, which were not immediately obvious and required significant time to deconvolute.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to Methods more description of the model, including an explanation of the form and the terms. We have added to the text a reference to this section when Figure 2d is cited. Also, the ‘simplifications’ (the other equations) were not defined and we believe actually to be more confusing than helpful, so we have removed them. It is now just one equation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) Figure 3b (right panel): Marking pause sites (a,b,c,d,his) would visually help readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Good idea, we have added those labels to the pauses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) Figure 3c (right panel): Marking pause site bands (a,b,c,d,his) for MtbRNAP would visually help readers. One assumes that the MtbRNAP pause site c is the major band and ultimately made up the MtbRNAP pause site array? Why was pause site b not used as an equivalent array? Seems a strong pause at least in early time points.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reader for this comment. Pause c is notably stronger than the other pauses, so we tried that first for creating the ruler and it worked so we did not test others. It is possible that pause b could have worked, too. The band of pause b indeed is initially as dark as pause c’s, which means they have similar pausing efficiencies (percentage of RNAPs that pause at that site), but the band lasts for much longer with pause c, meaning it has a longer pause duration (length of time the RNAP spends at this pause). We want the strongest pause (high efficiency and duration) for the ruler to make the detection of the ruler pause the easiest in the single-molecule assay.</p><p>We think maybe this could have come up since the band for pauses b and c for MtbRNAP might be ambiguous, we have now marked the relevant pause band on both sides of the gels to be more precise in showing which band corresponds to which pause. It should be more obvious that pause c is the strongest, and that the band lasts for much longer than e.g. pause b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) Figure 4a (left panel): What is the concentration of D-IX216?</p></disp-quote><p>It is 140nM, and it has now been noted in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) Figure 4a (right panel): The pause dwell times for the fast kinetics prior to the super-slow activity seem different that the fast or slow activities?</p></disp-quote><p>In the single-molecule assay, activity from RNAP to RNAP can vary a bit, e.g. compare Figure 1a’s differing activities from the three different molecules. We did wonder if these speed and pausing variations in the region of fast activity before switches correlated to the activity in the slow or super-slow regions, but could not find any such correlation (see Figure 4—figure supplement 3c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24) Figure 5e and 5g: The authors must use consistent nomenclature for pf, ef, and lp in these panels. Moreover, the meaning of AF (assisted force) and OP (opposing force) should be included in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the figures and text to refer to the states of the fast polymerase as pf/ef/lp. We have added the AF/OF definitions in the legend, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25) Figure 6c: The illustration of polymerase kinetic activity and State 1,2,3 is different than Figure 4d. It would be useful if the authors stuck to a type of illustration to make comparisons of Figures easy for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have formatted the two graphs to be the same, like Figure 4 (grouped by fast/slow/super-slow)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26) Suppl.

In particular, they investigate the changes in activity in the presence of three small-molecule inhibitors: N(α)-aroyl-N-aryl-phenylalaninamide (D-IX216), streptolydigin (Stl), and pseudouridimycin (PUM). They find a diverse range of effects on the polymerase, including transitions into a very slow activity state (induced by D-IX216 and PUM), induction of pausing and backtracking. Overall, the work provides interesting insights into the activity of an important pathogen with implications for the development of new drugs. This is a timely and relevant study that I found well-presented and interesting to read. Below, are some suggestions for clarifications and further improvements.</p><p>- In several places they authors make statements like &quot;there are no significant effects&quot; (line 133) or &quot;we observed an insignificant decrease&quot; (line 307). It would be good to explicitly state what statistical test / method of analysis was used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We admit that we have been looser than we should have been with the term ‘significant’. For cases where we have not applied a significance test, we have changed language to not use that word. For example, in Line 133, we now say “no dramatic effects on k<sub>pf</sub> or k<sub>el</sub>”. Due to the nature of the high number of transitions observed for each of these states, very slight differences can come up as statistically significant (narrow confidence intervals for fitting), our goal is to guide the reader towards the meaningful changes through the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Related to the last point: In many of the figures there are bar charts essentially comparing various kinetic parameters.
