OSCA/TMEM63 family has recently been identified as mechanically activated ion channels. Previously, based on the unique features of the structure of OSCA1.2, we postulated the potential involvement of several structural elements in sensing membrane tension (Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018). Interestingly, while OSCA1, 2, and 3 clades are activated by membrane stretch in cell-attached patches (i.e. they are stretch-activated channels), they differ in their ability to transduce membrane deformation induced by a blunt probe (poking). Here, in an effort to understand the domains contributing to mechanical signal transduction, we used cryo-electron microscopy to solve the structure of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (At) OSCA3.1, which, unlike AtOSCA1.2, only produced stretch- but not poke-activated currents in our initial characterization (Murthy et al., 2018). Mutagenesis and electrophysiological assessment of conserved and divergent putative mechanosensitive features of OSCA1.2 reveal a selective disruption of the macroscopic currents elicited by poking without considerable effects on stretch-activated currents (SAC). Our results support the involvement of the amphipathic helix and lipid-interacting residues in the membrane fenestration in the response to poking. Our findings position these two structural elements as potential sources of functional diversity within the family.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL143297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Andrew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS105067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dubin</surname><given-names>Adrienne E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002836</institution-id><institution>Ray Thomas Edwards Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Andrew B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural comparison and electrophysiology of OSCA channels shed light on potential structural features influencing response to poke stimulus.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanotransduction allows organisms to gather information about their external surroundings as well as internal processes. Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels are capable of sensing mechanical stimuli and transducing this information to the cell as electrochemical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>). MA ion channels are diverse and capable of responding to different stimuli such as osmotic stress, membrane deformation, touch, and hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haswell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ranade et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work, we identified OSCA/TMEM63 as a conserved family of MA ion channels spanning several eukaryotic clades and having considerable diversity in the plant kingdom, where species commonly have more than one paralog. For example, <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has 15 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> L. <italic>japonica</italic> (rice), 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). We demonstrated these channels can respond to membrane stretch even more robustly than hypertonicity, originally thought to be the relevant stimulus, with some members (OSCA1.1 and OSCA1.2) also able to respond to poke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). We used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to solve the structure of OSCA1.2 in a closed state in both detergent (LMNG) and nanodiscs at high-resolution, identifying a new architecture for MA ion channels that is structurally homologous to TMEM16 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>). Results from other groups are consistent with ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maity et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to the TMEM16 family, OSCAs are dimeric and each subunit has a pore lined by transmembrane helices (TMs) 3â7, instead of a single pore along the symmetry axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maity et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). A hydrophobic gate on the extracellular half of the pore blocks ion flow. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support our placement of the pore and position lipids along an opening of the pore pathway in the transmembrane domain (TMD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on the unique structural characteristics of OSCA1.2, we proposed that two features might be involved in sensing membrane deformation: the amphipathic helix (AH) located in the first intracellular loop, and the Beam-Like Domain (BLD), composed of the two cytoplasmic membrane-parallel helices and a hydrophobic hook that connects them and re-inserts itself into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the close association of these two elements to the membrane, we reasoned that they could serve as sensors of mechanical stimuli and transmit the signal to the pore through interactions with the TMD. Additionally, a fenestration allows the membrane access to the pore, and MD simulations placed lipids in close association with four positively charged residues in this area suggesting a potential role in gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>). We sought to determine whether these regions contributed to mechanotransduction.</p><p>Here, we used cryo-EM to determine a high-resolution structure of AtOSCA3.1, the first reported OSCA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiyosue et al., 1994</xref>), in nanodiscs. In our initial characterization, OSCA3.1 responded to stretch but not poke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). Comparison of the OSCA3.1 structure reported here to previous structures of OSCA1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and OSCA1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>) revealed subtle differences. Structure-function analyses revealed the involvement of the AH and the lipid-interacting residues in the pore pathway of OSCA1.2 in the ability of the channel to respond to membrane deformation by poking. Our results suggest that these features are not only important for activation of OSCA1.2 by poking but may serve to tune the response of OSCA/TMEM63 members to diverse stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall architecture of OSCA3.1 is similar to OSCA1.1 and OSCA1.2</title><p>We recombinantly tagged OSCA3.1 with EGFP at its C-terminus, expressed the construct in HEK293F cells, and purified it using Lauryl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol (LMNG) supplemented with cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS).

The pore profile of these OSCAs is maintained and the small radii towards the extracellular side suggests these channels are in a closed/non-conductive state, as suggested by previous MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Likewise, the two Ï-helical turns in TM5 and TM6a seen in previous structures near the neck of the pore are present at similar positions in OSCA3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maity et al., 2019</xref>). We identified multiple lipid-like densities in one of our postprocessed maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, one of these densities is located at the pore fenestration, at a position similar to that observed in previous MD simulations of OSCA1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>), supporting the proposed occupation of the pore pathway by lipids. Recent cryo-EM structures of AtOSCA1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2024</xref>), and AtOSCA1.1 and human TMEM63A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) also place a lipid at a similar position.</p><p>Previously, the structure of OSCA3.1 was solved in a digitonin micelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and more recently, in LMNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). The similarity of our nanodisc sample to these detergent structures suggests that the use of detergent did not affect the conformation or oligomerization of OSCA3.1, similar to previous results with OSCA1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4aâb</xref>). However, the inter-subunit cleft in the nanodisc structure is wider due to outward movements of innermost TMs ranging from ~4â8 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4c</xref>) relative to the digitonin sample, which was recently denoted as an âextendedâ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, our nanodisc structure represents a further âextendedâ state than the one found both in digitonin and LMNG micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4d</xref>). Whether these differences represent biologically meaningful states, an effect of the lipid environment (detergent vs lipids), or inherent flexibility of the channel remains to be determined. Additionally, our structure enabled a higher degree of certainty in the residue assignment relative to the initial digitonin structure, particularly for TM0 where sidechains were not previously modelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).

AHs can serve as both membrane anchors and sensors of membrane deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drin and Antonny, 2010</xref>), and they are present in many MA ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brohawn et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>). There is evidence for their involvement in mechanical force transduction; for example, in the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance MscL, an AH in the cytoplasmic side of the bilayer links membrane tension to protein conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavi et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, structures of members of the TMEM16 family, structural homologs of OSCAs, have a similarly placed helix in this region; however, it is located in the cytosol and does not present amphipathic properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c-e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>). Involvement of TMEM16A in the detection of mechanical forces in myocytes and bile ducts was dependent on calcium influx (potentially caused by an upstream MA cation channel) and not a direct response to the mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bulley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dutta et al., 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, characterization of TMEM16 proteins as MA ion channels has not been reported. Based on these observations, we mutated the membrane-facing residues at each end of the AH of OSCA1.2 in an effort to decrease its propensity to interact with the membrane. Single (W75K or L80E) and double (W75K/L80E) mutants in OSCA1.2 strongly abrogated the response to indentation of the membrane with a blunt glass probe (poke) (WT: 47 of 51 cells produced MA currents; W75K: 3 of 24; L80E: 2 of 16; W75K/L80E: 2 of 24; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, top panel). Moreover, in OSCA1.2<sub>W75K/L80E</sub>, a larger displacement of the membrane by the probe relative to the WT appeared to be needed to observe currents (âapparent thresholdâ; WT: 5.3Â±0.5 Âµm (N=46; mean Â± S.E.M.), W75K/L80E: 15.3Â±2.3 Âµm (N=2), with the none-responsive W75K/L80E cells rupturing at a 13.0Â±0.5 Âµm (N=22); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, bottom panel). The insensitivity to the poking stimulus was not due to poor membrane trafficking of these constructs (see below).

The OSCA3.1 structure revealed that two of these lysine residues (K435 and K536 of OSCA1.2) have been replaced by isoleucine (I423 and I525, respectively), which are expected to reduce the interaction with lipid phosphate head groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

We solved the structure of OSCA3.1 at a resolution of 2.6 Ã in a non-conductive state and revealed a marked structural conservation to previous OSCA orthologs. The final map presented several lipid-like densities surrounding the channel, including one density close to the pore and several densities populating the inter-subunit cleft. This ion channel was reported to be activated by stretch in cell-attached patches but insensitive to a poke stimulus using a blunt glass probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). Comparisons between the structures of OSCA1.2, which is robustly activated by both poke and stretch, to OSCA3.1, which is only robustly activated by stretch, suggested three domains that might contribute to gating during a poke stimulus. First, a conserved short amphipathic helix (AH) which sits at the membrane interface reminiscent of a similar feature in other MA ion channels like MscL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bavi et al., 2016</xref>), Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saotome et al., 2018</xref>), MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>), and TRAAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brohawn et al., 2012</xref>). Second, side chains in TM4 and TM6b in the vicinity of the membrane fenestration may have differential interactions with lipids as indicated by MD simulations of OSCA1.2. Third, the beam-like domain (BLD) that contains two helices and linker that hooks around the cytoplasmic surface into the membrane in OSCA1.2 but is less well-resolved in the OSCA3.1 map presumably because it is not intimately associated with the channel/membrane. Mutagenesis of the AH and residues at the fenestration in OSCA1.2 largely abrogated its response to poking without affecting its activation by stretch; replacing the BLD with that from OSCA3.1 only slightly impaired the response to poking, having no effect on stretch-induced activation.</p><p>Residues in the AH were mutated to either confer more of an OSCA3.1 character or tend to make the domain less likely to interact with the membrane, similar to the TMEM16 family that are not thought to be directly activated by mechanical stimuli. Swapping the divergent residue in the AH of OSCA1.2 with its equivalent in OSCA3.1 (OSCA1.2<sub>P77R</sub>), had no negative impact on the sensitivity to poking. These data suggest that the difference in poke sensitivity between OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1 is not due to the AH itself. However, when mutations were incorporated to presumably destabilize the interaction of the AH domain with the membrane (OSCA1.2<sub>W75K/L80E</sub>), fewer cells could be activated by poking to similar stimulus strengths while stretch-activation of channels was not impaired. Although a WT OSCA1.2 AH is critical for normal poke-induced channel opening, these mutations do not hinder gating by membrane stretch.</p><p>Substituting the BLD of OSCA1.2 for that of OSCA3.1 had little effect on poke- or stretch-activated responses. Although these results suggest that the BLD may not be involved in modulating the MA response of OSCA1.2, a recent report suggested evolutionary coupling of three sets of residues in the BLD and TM6b that may form electrostatic interactions between these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2024</xref>). The evolutionarily favored residue identities at these sites constitute three potential salt bridges: <bold>R/K</bold>257-<bold>E</bold>557, <bold>E</bold>260-<bold>R</bold>553, and <bold>R/K</bold>261-<bold>E/D</bold>554 (based on OSCA1.2 numbering).

It is worth noting that a similar chimera of AtOSCA1.2 with the IL2 domain of the human ortholog TMEM63A (OSCA1.2<sub>63A IL2</sub>), containing most of the intracellular domain which includes the BLD as well as the dimerization domain, presented little inactivation of SAC akin to monomeric TMEM63A<sub>WT</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>).

Modification of OSCA1.2 residues to match those of OSCA3.1 (OSCA1.2<sub>K435I/K536I</sub>) produced an OSCA3.1-like phenotype (MA currents are observed in response to stretch but rarely to poke). These mutant channels are not completely insensitive to poking but appear to have a very high threshold to activate, one that is often beyond the point of cell rupture by the stimulus (similar to that seen with OSCA1.2<sub>W75K/L80E</sub>). Notably, TM4 in TMEM16 lipid scramblases and TM6 in both TMEM16 scramblases and channels undergo conformational changes during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvadia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalienkova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paulino et al., 2017</xref>). The loss of positive charges in OSCA3.1 may weaken the interactions between residues and lipids, similar to MscS where charge neutralization of the lipid facing residue R59 by the introduction of a leucine strongly altered gating, potentially by disturbing a salt bridge with a lipid phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flegler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rasmussen et al., 2019</xref>). A weaker interaction could decrease the tension generated by the lipids upon mechanical stimulus, hence increasing the force needed to open the channel, as seen in our poke experiments. A similar argument could be made for the AH of OSCAs: by disturbing its coupling with the lipid bilayer, a greater stimulus might be needed to activate the channel. It is also important to note that the membrane of a plant cell contains a different lipid composition than that of HEK293 cells used in our assays, and thus these lipids, or association with the plant cell wall, may alter how these channels respond to physiological stimuli in vivo.</p><p>The phenotypes of OSCA1.2<sub>W75K/L80E</sub> and OSCA1.2<sub>K435I/K536I</sub> suggest a mechanism recruited by poking is no longer able to adequately activate OSCA1.2<sub>W75K/L80E</sub> and OSCA1.2<sub>K435I/K536I</sub> channels. Since the factors contributing to channel activation in the poking assay are not understood, we can only speculate as to mechanisms underlying the loss of sensitivity to poking in these mutants. Our results suggest that these stimuli are sensed by different features of OSCA channels, akin to the well-studied ThermoTRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">FernÃ¡ndez-Ballester et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordt and Julius, 2002</xref>). Polymodal activation mechanisms have been recently reported for the MA channel PIEZO2 where a mutagenesis approach revealed differential effects on the ability to respond to poking and stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Verkest et al., 2022</xref>). Nonetheless, the discrepancy could be due to inherent methodological differences between these two assays, as whole-cell recordings during poking involve channels in inaccessible membranes (at the cell-substrate interface) and channel interactions with extracellular and intracellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson et al., 2022</xref>), while the stretch assay is limited to recording channels inside the patch.</p><p>Overall, the analysis of these mutants demonstrates the involvement of the AH and residues at the membrane fenestration in the MA response of OSCAs, as we initially proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>). The participation of residues from TM4 and TM6 hint at further similarities with TMEM16 family, but to what extent is unknown. Perhaps the most surprising result is the selective disruption of poke-activated currents of OSCA1.2 without affecting its response to membrane stretch, which suggests that changes in these features could serve to fine-tune the response to certain mechanical stimuli and may be a source of functional diversity within this large family. The structures and characterizations presented here and in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>) will prove fundamental in assessing the physiological consequences of these differences and further understanding the role of the OSCA/TMEM63 family.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>For structural studies, the OSCA3.1 (UniProt ID: Q9C8G5) coding sequence was synthesized using optimized codons for expression in human cells and subsequently cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector used in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jojoa-Cruz et al., 2018</xref>).

The resulting ~900 k particles were subjected to, in order, 2D classification, ab initio reconstruction, two rounds of heterogeneous refinement, homogeneous refinement and non-uniform refinement to obtain an initial 3D reference, which reached high-resolution.

Given the large size of the dataset, and the fact that initial processing had returned a high-resolution structure, we decided to apply a 2.6 Ã CTF cutoff to reduce the number of micrographs to 3068 and speed up processing. Templates were generated based on the initial 3D reference. Template picking, followed by local motion correction and 2D classification resulted in 1,913,316 selected particles for our initial stack. Ab initio reconstruction produced three classes, and heterogeneous refinement was performed on the two worst classes. The resulting best class was combined with the best class from ab initio and used for two rounds of heterogeneous and homogeneous refinements. The heterogeneous refinement of the first round was done without symmetry, from that point onwards, C2 symmetry was imposed unless otherwise specified. Only particles belonging to the best class were selected for further processing (318,249).

The structure of OSCA 3.1 is similar to previous OSCA cryo-em structures of both OSCA3.1 and other homologues validating the new structure. Using the novel structure of OSCA3.1 as a guide they created several point mutations to investigate two different mechanosensitive modalities: poking and stretching. To investigate the ability of OSCA channels to gate in response to poking they created point mutations in OSCA1.2 to reduce sensitivity to poking based on the differences between the OSCA1.2 and 3.1 structures. Their results suggest that two separate regions are responsible for gating in response to poking and stretching.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Through a detailed structure based analysis, the authors identified structural differences between OSCA3.1 and OSCA1.2. The use of technically sound data supports the hypothesis that poking and stretching are sensed by two unique regions in the protein. These subtle structural changes between homologues identify regions in the amphipathic helix and near the pore that are essential for gating of OSCA1.2 in response to poking and stretching. Mutations in the AH of OSCA1.2 decrease the sensitivity to poking stimulus however these mutations have similar stretch activated currents to the WT. The point mutations described in the manuscript will set the foundation for investigations into how these two channels sense tension using different regions of structurally similar proteins.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Mutations in the amphipathic helix at W75 and L80 show reduced gating in response to poking stimuli. The gating observed occurs at poking depths similar to cellular rupture, the similarity in depths suggests that these mutations could be a complete loss of functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93147.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jojoa-Cruz</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Scripps Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dubin</surname><given-names>Adrienne E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Scripps Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Wen-Hsin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Scripps Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Andrew B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Scripps Research Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The OSCA/TMEM63 channels have recently been identified as mechanosensitive channels. In a previous study, the authors found that OSCA subtypes (1, 2, and 3) respond differently to stretch and poke stimuli. For example, OSCA1.2 is activated by both poke and stretch, while OSCA3.1, responds strongly to stretch but poorly to poke stimuli.

The authors specifically identify the amphipathic helix (AH), the fenestration, and the Beam Like Domain (BLD) as elements that might play a role in mechanosensing.</p><p>The strength of this paper lies in the technically sound data - the structural work and electrophysiology are both very well done. For example, the authors produce a high-resolution OSCA3.1 structure which will be a useful tool for many future studies. Also, the study identifies several interesting mutants that seemingly uncouple the OSCA1.2 poke and stretch responses. These might be valuable in future studies of OSCA mechanosensation.</p></disp-quote><p>However, the experimental approach employed by the authors to dissect the molecular mechanisms of poke and stretch falls short of enabling meaningful mechanistic conclusions. For example, we are left with several unanswered questions surrounding the role of AH and the fenestration lipids in mechanosensation: Is the AH really important for the poke response if mutating residues conserved between OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1 disrupts the OSCA1.2 ability to respond to poke but mutating the OSCA1.2 AH to resemble that of OSCA3.1 results in no change to its &quot;pokability&quot;? Similar questions arise in response to the study of the fenestrationlining residues.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback. We believe that the different OSCA1.2 mutants on their own suggest an involvement of the AH and fenestration-lining residues in its mechanosensitive response. We attribute the inability to restore the poke response of OSCA3.1 with similar mutations to its inherent high threshold to this particular stimulus and perhaps other structural differences, or a combination of them, that we did not probe in this study. We agree more work is required in the field to address these remaining questions and further dissect the difference between poke and stretch responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jojoa-Cruz et al. determined a high-resolution cryo-EM structure in the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (At) OSCA3.1 channel. Based on a structural comparison between OSCA3.1 and OSCA1.2 and the difference between these two paralogs in their mechanosensitivity to poking and membrane stretch, the authors performed structural-guided mutagenesis and tested the roles of three structural domains, including an amphipathic helix, a beam-like domain, and a lipid fenestration site at the pore domain, for mechanosensation of OSCA channels.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors successfully determined a structure of the AtOSCA3.1 channel reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs by cryo-EM to a high resolution of 2.6 Ã. The high-resolution EM map enabled the authors to observe putative lipid EM densities at various sites where lipid molecules are associated with the channel. Overall, the structural data provides the information for comparison with other OSCA paralogs.</p><p>In addition, the authors identified OSCA1.2 mutants that exhibit differential responses to mechanical stimulation by poking and membrane stretch (i.e., impaired response to poke assay but intact response to membrane stretch). This interesting behavior will be useful for further study on differentiating the mechanisms of OSCA activation by distinct mechanical stimuli.</p><p>Major weakness:</p><p>The major weaknesses of this study are the mutagenesis design and the functional characterization of the three structural domains - an amphipathic helix (AH), a beam-like domain (BLD), and the fenestration site at the pore, in OSCA mechanosensation.</p><p>(1) First of all, it is confusing to the reviewer, whether the authors set out to test these structural domains as a direct sensor(s) of mechanical stimuli or as a coupling domain(s) for downstream channel opening and closing (gating). The data interpretations are vague in this regard as the authors tend to interpret the effects of mutations on the channel 'sensitivity' to different mechanical stimuli (poking or membrane stretch). The authors ought to dissect the molecular bases of sensing mechanical force and opening/closing (gating) the channel pore domain for the structural elements that they want to study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data are unable to distinguish the transduction of a mechanical stimulus and channel gating. We set up to determine whether these features were involved in the mechanosensitive response. However, as the reviewer points out, evaluating whether they work as direct sensors or coupling domains would require a more involved experimental design that lies beyond the scope of this work. Thus, we do not claim in our study whether these features act as direct sensors of mechanosensitive stimuli or as coupling domains, only their involvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors relied on the functional discrepancies between OSCA1.2 (sensitive to both membrane poking and stretch) and OSCA3.1 (little or weak sensitivity to poking but sensitive to membrane stretch). But the experimental data presented in the study are not clear to address the mechanisms of channel activation by poking vs. by stretch, and why the channels behave differently.</p></disp-quote><p>We had hoped that when we switched regions of the OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1 channels we would abolish poke-induced responses in OSCA1.2 and confer poke-induced sensitivity to OSCA3.1. We agree with the reviewer that we were not able to pinpoint the reason or multiple reasons, as it could be a compounded effect of several differences, that caused OSCA3.1 higher threshold and thus we could not confer to it an OSCA1.2-like phenotype. Yet, we shed some light on some of the structural differences that appear to contribute to OSCA3.1 behavior, as mutagenesis of OSCA1.2 to resemble this channel led to OSCA3.1-like phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The reviewer questions if the &quot;apparent threshold&quot; of poke-induced membrane displacement and the threshold of membrane stretch are good measures of the change in the channel sensitivity to the different mechanical stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>The best way to determine an accurate measure of sensitivity to mechanical stimuli is stretch applied to a patch of membrane. There are more complicating factors that influence the determination of &quot;apparent threshold&quot; in the whole cell poking assay, including visualizing when the probe first hits the cell (very difficult to see). With that said, the stretch assay has its own issues such as the creep of the membrane into the pipette glass which we try to minimize with positive pressure between tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Overall, the mutagenesis design in the various structural domains lacks logical coherence and the interpretation of the functional data is not sufficient to support the authors' hypothesis. Essentially the authors mutated several residues on the hotspot domains, observed some effects on the channel response to poking and membrane stretch, then interpreted the mutated residues/regions are critical for OSCA mechanosensation. Examples are as follows.</p><p>In the section &quot;Mutation of key residues in the amphipathic helix&quot;, the authors mutated W75 and L80, which are located on the N- and C-terminal of the AH in OSCA1.2, and mutated Pro in the OSCA1.2 AH to Arg at the equivalent position in OSCA3.1 AH. W75 and L80 are conserved between OSCA 1.2 and OSCA3.1. Mutations of W75 and/or L80 impaired OSCA1.2 activation by poking, but not by membrane stretch. In comparison, the wildtype OSCA3.1 which contains W and L at the equivalent position of its AH exhibits little or weak response to poking. The loss of response to poking in the OSCA1.2 W/L mutants does not indicate their roles in pokinginduced activation.</p><p>Besides, the P2R mutation on OSCA1.2 AH showed no effect on the channel activation by poking, suggesting Arg in OSCA3.1 AH is not responsible for its weak response to poking. Together the mutagenesis of W75, L80, and P2R on OSCA1.2 AH does not support the hypothesis of the role of AH involved in OSCA mechanosensation.</p></disp-quote><p>Mutagenesis of OSCA1.2 in the amphipathic helix for residues W75 and L80 suggests a role of the helix in the poke response in OSCA1.2, regardless of OSCA3.1 having the same residues. Furthermore, the lack of alteration in the response for mutant P77R suggests that specific residues of the helix are involved in this response and is not a case where any mutation in the helix will lead to a loss of function.</p><p>OSCA3.1 WT exhibits a high-threshold response (near membrane rupture) in the poke assay without any mutations, and this could be due to other features, for example, the residues lining the membrane fenestration, as well as features not identified/probed in this study. We agree with the reviewer that the differences in the AH do not explain the different response to poke in OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1, and we have added this statement explicitly in the discussion for clarification (line #251-252).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the section &quot;Replacing the OSCA3.1 BLD in OSCA1.2&quot;, the authors replaced the BLD in OSCA 1.2 with that from OSCA3.1, and only observed slightly stronger displacement by poking stimuli. The authors still suggest that BLD &quot;appears to play a role&quot; in the channel sensitivity to poke despite the evidence not being strong.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the experiments carried out show little difference between the response of OSCA1.2 WT and OSCA1.2 with OSCA3.1 BLD, and we have stated so (line #259: âSubstituting the BLD of OSCA1.2 for that of OSCA3.1 had little effect on poke- or stretchactivated responses. Although these results suggest that the BLD may not be involved in modulating the MA response of OSCA1.2â¦â). However, the section of the discussion that the reviewer points out also considers evidence provided by recent reports from Zheng, et al. (Neuron, 2023) and Jojoa-Cruz, et al. (Structure, 2024) and we suggest an hypothesis to reconcile our findings with these new evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>OSCA1.2 has four Lys residues in TM4 and TM6b at the pore fenestration site, which were shown to interact with the lipid phosphate head group, whereas two of the equivalent residues in OSCA3.1 are Ile. In the section &quot;Substitution of potential lipid-interacting lysine residues&quot;, the authors made K435I/K536I double mutant for OSCA1.2 to mimic OSCA3.1 and observed poor response to poking but an intact response to stretch. Did the authors mutate the Ile residues in OSCA3.1 to Lys, and did the mutation confer channel sensitivity to poking stimuli resembling OSCA1.2? The reviewer thinks it is necessary to perform such an experiment, to thoroughly suggest the importance of the four Lys residues in lipid interaction for channel mechanoactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that the suggested experiments will further improve the quality of the results, but we are no longer able to perform such experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jojoa-Cruz et al provide a new structure of At-OSCA3.1. The structure of OSCA 3.1 is similar to previous OSCA cryo-em structures of both OSCA3.1 and other homologues validating the new structure. Using the novel structure of OSCA3.1 as a guide they created several point mutations to investigate two different mechanosensitive modalities: poking and stretching. To investigate the ability of OSCA channels to gate in response to poking they created point mutations in OSCA1.2 to reduce sensitivity to poking based on the differences between the OSCA1.2 and 3.1 structures. Their results suggest that two separate regions are responsible for gating in response to poking and stretching.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Through a detailed structure-based analysis, the authors identified structural differences between OSCA3.1 and OSCA1.2. These subtle structural changes identify regions in the amphipathic helix and near the pore that are essential for the gating of OSCA1.2 in response to poking and stretching. The use of point mutations to understand how these regions are involved in mechanosensation clearly shows the role of these residues in mechanosensation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In general, the point mutations selected all show significant alterations to the inherent mechanosensitive regions. This often suggests that any mutation would disrupt the function of the region, additional mutations that are similar in function to the WT channel would support the claims in the manuscript. Mutations in the amphipathic helix at W75 and L80 show reduced gating in response to poking stimuli. The gating observed occurs at poking depths similar to cellular rupture, the similarity in depths suggests that these mutations could be a complete loss of function. For example, a mutation to L80I or L80Q would show that the addition of the negative charge is responsible for this disruption not just a change in the steric space of the residue in an essential region.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that the suggested experiments will further improve the quality of the results, but we are unable to perform such experiments due to the authors having moved on from the respective labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have several questions regarding some of the aspects of your study:</p><p>Mutation of the hydrophobic W75 and L80 in OSCA1.2 to charged residues significantly decreases the poke response in OSCA1.2 without affecting the stretch response. However, W75 and L80 are also present in OSCA3.1, which does not respond efficiently to poke. You conclude that these two residues are important for the poke response, but do not delve into why, if these residues are important, OSCA3.1 is not poke-sensitive.</p><p>In addition, mutation of the OSCA1.2 AH to resemble that of OSCA3.1 does not produce channels that are less poke-sensitive. Given the data presented, if AH were a universal &quot;poke sensor&quot;, one could also expect WT OSCA3.1 to exhibit a robust poke response, like OSCA1.2. Here I think it would be important to explain in more detail how this data might fit together.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this issue. We decided to test the importance of the AH due to the presence of similar structures in other mechanosensitive channels. Our data showed that single and double mutants of the AH of OSCA1.2 affected its poke response but not stretch. This supports the idea of the AH involvement in the poke response. Yet, we agree that the differences in the AH between OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1 (P77R mutation) do not explain the higher threshold of OSCA3.1, we have explicitly added this in line #255. The particular OSCA3.1 phenotype may be due to other differences in the structure, for example, differences in the membrane fenestration area, or a combined effect of several differences, which we believe is more likely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also have some questions about the protein-lipid interactions in the fenestration. A lipid has been observed in this location in both OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1 structures. Mutation of the two OSCA1.2 lysines to isoleucines results in channels that are resistant to poke which leads to the conclusion that the interactions between the fenestration lysines and lipids are important for the poke response.</p><p>Here, there are several questions that arise but are not answered:</p><p>It is not shown what happens when OSCA3.1 isoleucines are mutated to lysines - do these mutants result in poke-able channels? Is the OSCA3.1 mechanosensing altered?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a preliminary test on OSCA3.1 I423K/I525K double mutant (n = 3). However, we did not see an increase in poke sensitivity. We attributed this to other unexplored differences in OSCA3.1 having an effect in channel mechanosensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is implied that the poke response is predicated on the lysine-lipid interaction. However, lipid densities are present in both OSCA1.2 and OSCA3.1 structures, indicating that both fenestrations interact with lipids. How can we be certain that the mutation of lysine to isoleucine does not disrupt an inter-protein interaction rather than a protein-lipid one? For example, the K435I mutation might disrupt interactions with D523 or the backbone of G527?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a good point. We believe the phenotype seen is due to a different strength in the interaction between lipids and proteins, however, disrupted interaction with other residues is a valid alternative explanation. We agree that the suggested experiments will further clarify the results, but we are unable to perform such experiments due to the authors having moved on from the respective labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the effects of single lysine-to-isoleucine (K435I or K536I) mutations are not explored.</p><p>The observed effect might be caused by only one of these substitutions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that the suggested experiments will further improve the quality of the results, but we are unable to perform such experiments due to the authors having moved on from the respective labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also wanted to take this opportunity to ask a couple of philosophical (?) questions about using a mammalian system to study ion channels that have evolved to function in plants. Your study highlights the intimate relationship between the lipid bilayer and protein function/mechanosensitivity. Plant cells contain high levels of sterols and cerebrosides that would significantly affect both cell stiffness and the specific interactions that can be formed between the protein and the lipid bilayer. I wonder if the properties of the lipid bilayer might shift the thresholds for poke and/or stretch stimuli and if structural elements that do not appear to have a major role in mechanosensation in a mammalian cell (e.g., BLD) might be very influential in a lipid environment that more closely resembles that of a plant?</p><p>Conversely, is it possible that OSCA channels are not poke-sensitive in plant cells?These questions are beyond the scope of your study, but they might be a nice addition to your discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer poses a great question. Electrophysiological approaches for studying plant mechanosensitive channels suffer the limitation of not being able to fully reconstitute the environment of a plant cell. To be able to patch the cell, the cell wall needs to be disposed of, which eliminates the tension generated from this structure onto the membrane. In that sense, performing these assays in plant cells or another system would not give us a fully accurate picture of the physiological thresholds of these channels. Given this limitation, we performed our study with mammalian cells given our expertise with them. Like the reviewer, we are also intrigued by the effect of different membrane compositions on the behavior of OSCA channels and how these channels will behave under physiological conditions, but we agree with the reviewer that these questions are out of the scope of our work. To address this point, in line #294 we have added: âIt is also important to note that the membrane of a plant cell contains a different lipid composition than that of HEK293 cells used in our assays, and thus these lipids, or the plant cell wall, may alter how these channels respond to physiological stimuli.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 313 For structural studies, human codon-optimized OSCA3.1. Could you please clarify what this means?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the phrase to âFor structural studies, the OSCA3.1 (UniProt ID: Q9C8G5) coding sequence was synthesized using optimized codons for expression in human cells and subsequently cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vectorâ in line #327 to clarify this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a final comment, in the methods you use references to previously published work. I would strongly encourage you to replace these with experimental details.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewerâs argument. However, this article falls under eLIFEâs Research Advances and will be linked to the original published work to which we reference the method. As suggested in the guidelines for this type of article, we only described the methods that were different from the original paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) In line 85, provide C-alpha r.m.s.d. values for the structural alignment among OSCA3.1, OSCA1.1, and OSCA1.2 protomers.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added the C-alpha RMSD in line #86.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In line 90, should the figure reference to Fig. 1d be Fig. 1e?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error.

It will be more informative if the authors can add figures to show the structure of MscL and highlight the analogous AH. In addition, the current Supplementary Fig. 6 is not informative so it should be improved. It is not clear to the reviewer why that stretch of helix in TMEM16 is equivalent or analogous to the AH in OSCAs, either sequence alignment or a detailed structural alignment is helpful to address this point. Also, in lines 120-121, it says this helix in TMEM16 &quot;does not present amphipathic properties&quot;, please show the sequence or amphipathicity of the helix.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback on this figure. Supplementary Fig. 6 has been thoroughly modified to address the reviewerâs concerns. We now include a panel showing the structure of MscL and its amphipathic helix.

The authors speculate that the reason they did not observe a significant effect of channel response to poke/stretch stimuli in the BLD swapping between OSCA1.2 and 3.1 is due to the 2 of 3 salt bridges remaining for the residue pairs. To test the importance of these residue pairs and their coupling for channel gating, instead of swapping the entire BLD, can the authors systematically mutate the residue pairs, disrupt the salt-bridge interactions, and analyze the effect on channel response to mechanical force?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We agree that the suggested experiments will further improve the quality of the results, but we are unable to perform such experiments due to the authors having moved on from the respective labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The reviewer suggests the authors tone down the elaboration of polymodal activation of OSCA by membrane poking and stretch.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the idea of polymodal activation is sufficiently toned down as we only postulate it as a possibility and following we give an alternative explanation based on methodological limitations: âNonetheless, the discrepancy could be due to inherent methodological differences between these two assays, as whole-cell recordings during poking involve channels in inaccessible membranes (at the cell-substrate interface) and channel interactions with extracellular and intracellular components, while the stretch assay is limited to recording channels inside the patch.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In lines 81-83, the authors described the BLD as showing increased flexibility, and the EM map at this region is less well resolved for registry assignment. In the method for cryo-EM image processing and Supplementary Fig. 1, the authors only carried out 3D refinement and classification at the full channel level. Have the authors attempted to do focus refinement or classification at the BLD domain in order to improve the local resolution or to sort out conformational heterogeneity? The reviewer suggests doing so because the BLD domain is a hot spot that the authors have proposed to play an important role in OSCA mechanosensation. Conformational changes identified in this region might provide insights into its role in the channel function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed focused classification on the BLD with and without surrounding regions and, in our hands, it did not improve the resolution or provide further insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Here are a few specific minor corrections that should be addressed</p><p>(1) In lines 117-135, in the discussion of Figure 2, the data shows an apparent increase in the poking threshold to gate W75K/L80E. The substantial increase in the depth required to gate the channel suggests that these channels are less sensitive to poking. Would it be possible to compare the depth at which these two patches show activity and the depth at which the other 22 cells ruptured? Line 161 mentions that the rupture threshold of HEK cells is close to the gating of OSCA3.1 at 13.8 Âµm.</p></disp-quote><p>The distance just before the cell ruptured in 22 cells with no response was 12.5 +/- 2.5 um.
