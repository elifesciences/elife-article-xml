Complications associated with such severe viral infections are many-fold, and include increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Langford et al., 2020</xref>), as well as post-acute COVID-19, where patients experience symptoms extending beyond 3 weeks from the onset of their first COVID-19 symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greenhalgh et al., 2020</xref>). The first report of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients was from Wuhan in March 2020, where 15% of hospitalized patients developed secondary infections, and of those who did not survive their SARS-CoV-2 infection, 50% had a secondary bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Since then many COVID-19 studies reporting secondary infections have been published, with a recent meta-analysis of 24 independent studies that included 3338 patients from five countries reporting that 14.3% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed a secondary bacterial infection, which is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and the financial costs associated with prolonged hospitilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Langford et al., 2020</xref>). The incidence of post-acute COVID-19 varies depending on the group of patients considered, with approximately 10% of patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus remaining unwell beyond 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greenhalgh et al., 2020</xref>). However, this can be as high as 74% when hospitalised patients are considered, where symptoms include breathlessness and excessive fatigue, with abnormal radiological features reported in 12% of this cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The DISCOVER study (DIagnostic and Severity markers of COVID-19 to Enable Rapid triage, REC: 20/YH/0121) was established in March 2020 to collect and analyse longitudinal samples from COVID-19 patients. One study participant, an otherwise healthy male between 45 and 55 years of age presented to hospital with Type-1 respiratory failure (hypoxaemia), 20 days after he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. At the time of testing he was asymptomatic (tested as a house-hold contact of a health-care worker), and this represents Day one on the time-line presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. He became symptomatic for COVID-19 13 days after this, which is within the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 as defined by the CDC of 14 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease), 2020</xref>), and his health declined over the following week. Upon admission to hospital a chest X-ray was taken, and he was admitted to the ICU where he was mechanically ventilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). An RT-PCR test on an endotracheal sample collected at this time did not detect SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that he had cleared the viral infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The development of a recurring ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by a COVID-19 patient.</title><p>A clinical time-line is presented from the point at which the patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (day 1), through to his discharge from the ICU (day 64). Noteworthy clinical features are indicated in the yellow boxes below the time-line. The three x-rays taken during the patient’s time in the ICU are presented, as is a later follow-up x-ray taken in an out-patient (OP) clinic 3 weeks after discharge.

At these meetings, the clinical status of the patient, radiological features, oxygen requirements, inflammatory indices (WCC, CRP, and procalcitonin) and any culture results are discussed. We had no concerns at the time of admission of this patient to the ICU that he had any infection other than that of SARS-CoV-2. Computerised tomography (CT) scans of the patient were collected through his time in the ICU and the classic features of COVID-19, including ground-glass opacities, were evident throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>After a week in the ICU he was diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on the clinical, radiological, biochemical, and microbiological parameters described above. An antibiotic susceptible <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strain was cultured from an aspirate collected from his endotracheal tube (ETT-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) meropenem 0.5 mg/l; piperacillin-tazobactam (pip/taz) 8 mg/l). He was prescribed a seven-day course of pip/taz (4.5 g every 6 hr), and clinically recovered from this bacterial infection. Eight days after finishing this first course of antibiotics his VAP recurred (diagnosed as described above), and a pip/taz resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was cultured from ETT-2 (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &gt;16 mg/l). He was prescribed a seven-day course of meropenem (1 g every 8 hr) and showed signs of clinical improvement. There were no further concerns about a bacterial infection during his ICU stay (i.e. he did not meet any of the clinical diagnostic criteria described above), although a third <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was cultured from a sample (ETT-3) collected two days after he completed his course of meropenem that was resistant to both pip/taz and meropenem (MICs &gt; 16 mg/l and &gt;8 mg/l respectively). His health continued to improve, and he was discharged to the respiratory ward a week later. The patient attended a follow-up clinic 3 weeks after hospital discharge where he reported on-going symptoms such as breathlessness and myalgia, and there was a significant drop in his oxygen saturations after mild exertion to 84%. Eight months following his positive test he is still reporting breathlessness and fatigue, common symptoms of the newly defined ‘Long COVID’ condition.</p><p>To understand the cellular and molecular dynamics of this post-acute COVID-19 case from the perspective of both the pathogen and patient’s immune response, longitudinal respiratory and blood samples were collected and analysed with a view to identifying early diagnostic biomarkers of infection onset and potential opportunities for immunotherapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Metagenomics was used to characterise in depth the composition and genomic features of the bacteria present in this patient’s lower respiratory tract from when he first developed VAP (ETT-1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) to when he had recovered from his second VAP (ETT-3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). ETT-2 collected during his second bout of VAP was unfortunately not available for sequencing. We extracted the entire genetic material from 500 μl of ETTs 1 and 3 with no bacterial enrichment or human DNA depletion steps, and to ensure data for the bacterial component of the samples was generated, these were sequenced on a PromethION (Oxford Nanopore technology). The bacterial DNA from ETT-1 was entirely that of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> corresponding to multi-locus sequence type ST253 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jolley et al., 2018</xref>), a world-wide clone frequently associated with AMR epidemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Treepong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

There were however two noteworthy SNPs in this later sample that explain the increased AMR of this isolate. The <underline>m</underline>ulti-drug <underline>e</underline>fflu<underline>x</underline> pump, MexAB, is transcriptionally regulated by the translated product of the <italic>mexR</italic> gene, MexR.

A second SNP was found that introduced a premature stop codon (Tyr120-stop) in the gene encoding the <underline>o</underline>uter <underline>m</underline>embrane <underline>p</underline>rotein OprD, a protein with a well-established role in the entry of meropenem into the bacterial cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Quale et al., 2006</xref>).

The role of this type of bystander activated T-cells in the recovery of patients remains largely unclear, as these cells can participate in protective immunity towards the virus but can also contribute to tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sandalova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rivino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim and Shin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maini et al., 2000</xref>).

In support of this we detected an increased magnitude of CMV-specific T-cell responses over time, particularly in the CD8+ compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>). We therefore considered whether CMV-specific T-cells were activated and proliferating in the blood of the COVID-19 patient. To test this we performed a brief stimulation of PBMCs with or without HCMV pp65 peptide (CMV) or SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 one peptide pools (the predominant SARS-CoV-2 target in this patient, within those tested) or with a positive control, and assessed the expression of the activation and proliferation markers HLA-DR, CD38 and Ki67 by the cytokine-producing cells that were responding to the peptide pools. Peptide stimulations and negative controls were performed in duplicate wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Both CMV and spike-1-specific CD8+ T-cells showed increased co-expression of HLA-DR and CD38 and of Ki67, indicating that these cells were activated and proliferating ex vivo, while this was less evident for their CD4+ T-cell counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–e and g–h</xref>). This observation is in line with previous reports of bystander T-cell activation for CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sandalova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rivino et al., 2015</xref>). We furthermore analysed the phenotype of CMV and spike 1-specific T-cells on the basis of expression of CCR7 and CD45RA, which identifies naïve (CCR7+ CD45RA+), central memory (TCM: CCR7+ CD45RA-), effector memory (TEM: CCR7- CD45RA-) and effector memory re-expressing RA T-cells (TEMRA: CCR7-CD45RA+). CMV and spike 1-specific CD4+ T cells were mainly contained respectively within the TEM and the TEM/TCM subsets, while CMV and spike 1-specific CD8+ T cells were mainly contained respectively within the TEMRA and the TEM subsets. The predominant TEMRA phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cells in convalescent COVID patients is in line with recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Neidleman et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of a large proportion of CD8+ TEMRA within the CMV and spike 1-specific CD8+ T cell populations also supports the notion that these cells are stimulated through cytokine receptors rather than through the TCR, as TEMRA cells are believed to arise following antigen withdrawal and cytokine-mediated stimulation (for e.g. IL-15), as TCR ligation downregulates CD45RA expression both in vitro and during responses in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Henson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the immune profiles show robust innate and adaptive immune activation in a COVID-19 patient experiencing a secondary bacterial infection, and a detectable T-cell and IgG response targeting both SARS-CoV-2 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Furthermore, we show that CD8+ T-cells targeting viral antigens from SARS-CoV-2 and from the persistent virus HCMV display expression of markers of activation and proliferation and are predominantly TEMRA and TEM cells. Although it is a challenging task to demonstrate that these cells have not encountered their cognate viral antigens in vivo, the TEMRA phenotype of these cells makes it unlikely and suggests that these cells may be proliferating in a bystander way through the action of cytokines present in the inflammatory milieu.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this case report we demonstrate the potential of the application of multidisciplinary technologies to longitudinally-collected patient samples to define the complex dynamics of patient-pathogen-therapy interactions in real-time.

However, the most striking feature of this COVID-19 case was the escalating number of circulating activated T-cells more than two months after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 6 weeks after clearing the viral infection. While we could attribute some of this to the recurring bacterial infection, the scale of the activation considered alongside our evidence of increased frequencies of T-cells specific for unrelated antigens, suggests there may be a significant amount of bystander activation.</p><p>Studies on large COVID-19 patient cohorts have shown that the period of the peak of T-cell activation in COVID-19 is prolonged compared to other acute viral infections or after vaccination with live attenuated viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>), which may be due to the inability of the immune system to downregulate its response.

A complete list of antibodies is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Antibody quantification</title><p>a. <italic>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa:</italic> The PA antigen OprF was diluted in coating buffer, added to the wells of MaxiSorp flat-bottom 96-Well immunoplates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. Immunoplates were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 1 hr at 37°C. Sera from each sample were diluted and added to the immunoplates in triplicate and incubated at 4°C overnight. Biotin mouse anti-human IgG (BD Pharmingen, USA) was added to the plate and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Streptavidin-HRP (R and D Systems, UK) was added and incubated for 30 mins at RT. ELISAs were developed using TMB substrate. Results were recorded using a Multiskan GO Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and absorbance values (OD 450) were converted to ELISA units. OprF antigen was produced using the recombinant vector pSUMO-OprF as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Quigley et al., 2015</xref>). b. ELISA methods were based on the protocols for measuring SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stadlbauer et al., 2020</xref>) with some modifications. A full-length trimeric stabilized version of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was expressed in insect cells using the MultiBac baculovirus expression system and affinity purified, whereas the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was expressed in, and purified from, <italic>E. coli</italic>. High-binding plates (MaxiSorp, NUNC) were coated with either 10 mg/ml Spike or 20 mg/ml N protein in PBS and left overnight at 4°C followed by blocking for 1 hr (3% BSA/0.1% Tween/PBS). Dilution buffer (1% BSA/0.1% Tween/PBS) containing patient plasma samples collected at different time points, or serum controls, were added to wells either in duplicate (for patient, pre-pandemic (PP) or pooled serum standard (PS)) or in single wells (healthy controls, HC) at a final dilution of 1 in 450 (adjusting for dilution of plasma if obtained via PBMC collection) and left for 2 hr at RT. Goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech) was added at 1 in 25,000 in dilution buffer for 1 hr, followed by development with OPD solution (Sigma) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Development was quenched after 30 min using 3M HCl and absorbance measured at 492 and 620 nm using a BMG FLUOstar Omega Spectrophotometer. Plots show mean and standard deviation where samples were run in duplicate.</p><p>Control samples: Serum from n = 6 adult pre-pandemic donors recruited in 2008 for a vaccine trial were obtained from the Bristol Biobank (NHS REC 14/WA/1253) and were used as known-negative controls on the same plate as the COVID19 case samples, in duplicate. In addition, we have included the OD values from the healthy control donor samples which were used as controls for the T cell assays; these donors were collected during the pandemic but reporting no exposure or symptoms prior to sampling (also obtained via the Biobank as explained in the manuscript methods section). These samples were run in single wells on different plates to the COVID19 case samples; however, all plates included a pooled serum (PS) standard control, in duplicate, to assess for inter-plate variability. The PS average ODs across six plates are therefore shown. The PS, HC and PP samples used in this experiment were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min, while the patient plasma were not (after testing negative for SARS-CoV-2). Despite the difference in sample type and handling, we are confident these do not impact on antibody levels or ELISA signal from our own in-house comparisons (data not shown) as well as data from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amanat et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Kapil Gupta and Imre Berger for kindly providing us the spike protein, Natalie Di Bartolo and Ashley Toye for kindly providing us the N protein, both used for the SARS-CoV-2 serology work.

demonstrates the capacity of multidisciplinary technologies to provide illustrative insights into hitherto hidden aspects of the evolution of immune responses during a complicated SARS-CoV2 infection and recovery. In particular, the prominent bystander T cell activation in hospital and escalating number of circulating activated T-cells more than two months after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and six weeks after clearing the viral infection are notable. It is unusual to get this level of detail, albeit for a single patient, and hopefully this would lead to further thinking and research about how to approach and treat patients with long COVID.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Post-acute COVID-19 associated with evidence of bystander T-cell activation and a recurring AMR bacterial pneumonia&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, the major conclusion, namely bystander T cell activation in severe COVID19, even though plausible, is not justified from the data presented in the manuscript. Even with the short form assessment, the manuscript would require significant amount of additional data from multiple patients of different severity and co-infection patterns to make any claims on the finding of bystander activation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Gregarova et al., present a clinical case of COVID-19 and ventilator acquired <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> co-infection with persistent T cell activation, mostly of a bystander nature. While the <italic>Pseudomonasaeruginosa</italic> strain was initially found to be antibiotic sensitive and treated accordingly, within eight days the bacterial infection re-emerged. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mixed infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> associated with AMR infections and a coagulase negative <italic>S. haemolyticus</italic> strain. The authors profiled activation status of monocytes and T cells during the course of the hospitalization of the patient. By profiling antigen specific responses, they identified that a large proportion of activated T cells that neither recognized SARS-CoV2 nor <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> antigens. Responses to HCMV were evident in the patient. Such bystander T cell responses are known in other viral infections also, although the relevance of these is not well understood.</p><p>1) This study uses elegant molecular tools to quantify T cell responses in the patient. The finding that there is an increase in activated bystander T cells during the course of the disease may be important. The authors make an important point about the relevance of this finding to potential use of corticosteroids in treatment of severe COVID19. However, this study does not have the power to inform whether ventilator acquired co-infections are the drivers of this bystander activated state in COVID19 patients.

How to explain a decrease around day 45 on Figure 3B? Was that also an antibiotic effect by the starting of meropenem? It could be further discussed in the paper. And authors should explain a little more in the text about the difference between Figure 3A and 3B.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Dr Gregorova and colleagues present an interesting case report entitled &quot;Post-acute COVID-19 associated with evidence of bystander T-cell activation and a recurring antibiotic-resistant bacterial pneumonia.&quot; The report details a patient that presented with respiratory failure 20 days after testing positive for COVID-19 on screening following exposure to a family member. The patient's course was complicated by two episodes of VAP with metagenomics serially revealing complete genomes of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> encoding antibiotic resistance. The fundamental thrust of the paper is the inference that both the initial respiratory failure and the subsequent VAP episodes result directly or indirectly from immunopathology driven by bystander T cell activation, which the investigators assess by determining CD4 and CD8 cell cytokine expression following PBMCs exposure to viral and bacterial peptides.</p><p>The report is easy to read and proposes an explanation for the patient's respiratory failure that is congruent with known immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, as the authors note, this may help explain the observed efficacy of dexamethasone in patients with respiratory insufficiency. However, there are limitations that reduce enthusiasm.</p><p>1) The paper broadly suggests/implies that bystander activation of T cells is a proximate cause of the VAP episodes without any direct evidence to support this notion. It is well established in the literature that post-viral leukocyte dysfunction (most often lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophage lineage cells) enhance susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections. In this case, the authors demonstrate variably elevated numbers of T cells but do not demonstrate failures of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> sensing/responding/clearance by any cell population.</p><p>2) The essential arguments for bystander activation are the stimulation experiments in Figure 3E-F. These data are widely variable and are difficult to interpret in the absence of data from the times that VAP was first suspected. The only shown dates are from ICU admission and two dates each after several days of VAP therapy.</p><p>3) In a single case report, it is always challenging to confidently know what is driving an observed immune response. This is particularly so in a patient who was well at the time of viral diagnosis but presents 20 days later. Certainly, the authors' inference that the respiratory failure represents COVID-19 immunopathology is plausible, even likely. However, since the interval between diagnosis and respiratory failure is longer than the mean interval reported in recent large series and since longer intervals provide more opportunities for patients to acquire new pathogens/be exposed to new insults, more robust evidence than a single case would typically be expected to make such a claim.</p><p>4) The metagenomics data are impressively generated, but don't drive new understanding. That an intubated patient might acquire two related strains of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> during a single episode of critical illness is unsurprising. As above, there seems to be an underlying implication that the T cell activation drives the SNP differences between the isolates, but that is not further demonstrated. Metagenomic assessment at the time of ICU admission might have been supportive of the authors' assessment that there was no active viral infection (SARS-CoV-2 or otherwise) driving the acute decompensation that led to intubation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for your note appealing the decision on your article &quot;Post-acute COVID-19 associated with evidence of bystander T-cell activation and a recurring AMR bacterial pneumonia&quot; for reconsideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We would like to assure you that the single case did not underscore rejection. We do consider case reports if they change the practice of medicine, bring to the fore important clinical questions and/or trigger new patient-centered research. Your report fell into the first category. With that said, there were significant concerns that I have listed below in consultation with the Reviewing Editor who handled your paper, and we would be happy to send it out for re-review, without a guarantee of acceptance, once we receive a point-to-point response to the critique in the reviews that were sent to you previously.</p><p>Specifically, we would consider a rebuttal that focuses on the comments of reviewer 3 and broadly answers the summarised concerns listed below. This may be done through additional clinical data and experimental data that the authors find feasible.</p><p>The case study's value is in suggesting that bystander T cell activation in SARS-CoV2 infection may have led to a severe COVID-19 presentation. This supports the benefit of corticosteroids in COVID-19. The message is indeed plausible and important. The authors need to tell us how much it adds to what we know (see Mathew et al., 2020).</p><p>The essence of the case report seems to be that a patient with asymptomatic SARS CoV2 infection developed respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID19 at 2 weeks post-infection, requiring hospitalisation. After more than 96 hrs of hospitalisation the patient required ICU admission and was SARS CoV2 negative, but resistant P. Aeurginosa positive on ETT aspirate. At this point bystander T cell activation was noted. The authors link the bystander activation to the SARS-CoV2 infection and disease progression, which is plausible but uncertain due to questions: namely (a) whether an additional infection may have occurred in 2 weeks, (b) whether bystander activation measured at 3 weeks is confidently determined and relatable to original infection, and (c) whether the hospital-acquired multi drug resistant pneumonia is related to the immune dysfunction.</p><p>The specific concerns that need to be considered and addressed are:</p><p>a) Is this severe COVID-19 or a new insult given that 15 days passed from PCR positivity for onset of symptoms? A clear comparison of this to reported intervals between onset of infection and clinical deterioration would help make the case stronger. If this is very unusual, then alternative explanations, such as a new infection, become more likely than severe COVID-19. Clinical data would be helpful, including any repeat PCR at admission.</p><p>b) <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection is probably hospital-acquired and multiple strains are quite possible. The link to bystander cell activation only arises if it led to ineffectual sensing/clearance. Can this be supported by any experimental evidence beyond clinical deterioration?</p><p>c) The essential arguments for bystander activation are illustrated in Figure 3E-F – that were found not to be particularly convincing. At the very least, please provide full data and experimental replicates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63430.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

While the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was initially found to be antibiotic sensitive and treated accordingly, within eight days the bacterial infection re-emerged. Whole genome sequencing revealed a mixed infection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> associated with AMR infections and a coagulase negative S. haemolyticus strain. The authors profiled activation status of monocytes and T cells during the course of the hospitalization of the patient. By profiling antigen specific responses, they identified that a large proportion of activated T cells that neither recognized SARS-CoV2 nor <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> antigens. Responses to HCMV were evident in the patient. Such bystander T cell responses are known in other viral infections also, although the relevance of these is not well understood.</p><p>1) This study uses elegant molecular tools to quantify T cell responses in the patient. The finding that there is an increase in activated bystander T cells during the course of the disease may be important. The authors make an important point about the relevance of this finding to potential use of corticosteroids in treatment of severe COVID19. However, this study does not have the power to inform whether ventilator acquired co-infections are the drivers of this bystander activated state in COVID19 patients. A larger study with defined groups of SARS-CoV2 with and without VAP infection, and VAP infections without SARS-CoV2 infection would be required to evaluate the relevance of the bystander T cell response in COVID19 disease severity/outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in absolute agreement with this reviewer on this matter.

For this patient, the initial samples ETT-1 and ETT-2 coincided with an increasing oxygen requirement, fever, and the patient becoming more clinically unwell, and therefore a clinical diagnosis of likely VAP was made and patient was treated with antibiotics for same. At the time of ETT-3, the patient was clinically well and did not meet any clinical diagnostic criteria for VAP, so this was not deemed significant.

While there is some evidence that antibiotics can interact with aspects of host immunity, the available data suggests the activity is typically suppressive. With this in mind, we feel the increase in activity that coincided with the administration of pip/taz is more likely due to the response of the immune system to the VAP. Regarding the decrease following meropenem treatment, it is possible it plays a roll in the observed decrease in proliferation of some of the cell types we studied (i.e. the CD8<sup>+</sup> and gd T-cells) but as this was not observed for the other cells type studied, we feel it is too speculative to bring into this descriptive study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Dr Gregorova and colleagues present an interesting case report entitled &quot;Post-acute COVID-19 associated with evidence of bystander T-cell activation and a recurring antibiotic-resistant bacterial pneumonia.&quot; The report details a patient that presented with respiratory failure 20 days after testing positive for COVID-19 on screening following exposure to a family member.

With or without prior viral infection, the mechanical ventilation of patients leaves them highly susceptible, such that between 10 and 30% will typically succumb to a bacterial VAP, and this patient has fallen into this category. If we were pushed to make a statement on what we believe might be going on (given the limitation of a single patient) it’s that the onslaught of an invasive bacterial infection immediately after the viral infection (and the heightened and prolonged immune response this triggered) is responsible for the observed bystander activation. This activation may be responsible for the ongoing inflammatory associated problems that patient is experiencing, but again, we believe we have been very careful not to be explicit about this in the manuscript, give its limitation as a case study.</p><p>It is worth noting here that although we detect both an antibody and T-cell response specific to <italic>P. aerunginosa</italic>, we make no comments or assertion as to their role in the clearance of the VAPs, as in both cases the patient was treated with appropriate antibiotics, which will have had a dominant affect on clearing these infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The essential arguments for bystander activation are the stimulation experiments in Figure 3E-F.

As explained above, we have repeated the T-cell stimulation with CMV and SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides on the last vial of PBMCs made available to us, and we now also include data (in duplicate) on the T cell response to both CMV and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We were also able to measure the expression of activating and proliferating markers on CMV-specific T cells and show that CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells are activated and proliferating in line with other studies on bystander activation, showing increased expression of activation and proliferation markers by CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cells when compared to the CMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. We also found that the CD8<sup>+</sup> CMV-specific T cells were predominantly T<sub>EMRA</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> cells while CD4<sup>+</sup> CMV-specific T cells were predominantly T<sub>EM</sub> cells (Figure 4F,I), which is in line with previous reports on this phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In a single case report, it is always challenging to confidently know what is driving an observed immune response.

There was a gap of 13 days from this patient testing positive to the development of symptoms, and a further week before his symptoms became such that he needed hospitalisation. The CDC, based on the findings of several studies, advise that the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as 14 days, which is a day longer than that experienced by this patient.

The patient also had three sets CT scans take; upon admission to the ICU, when the first VAP was diagnosed and between his first and second VAP. The ground glass opacities typical of COVID-19 were evident throughout. These have now been included as supplementary data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), as they are supportive of the fact that the patient required hospitalisation as a result of COVID-19.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The metagenomics data are impressively generated, but don't drive new understanding.

We also show evidence of bystander activation of T-cells, which was not examined in the Mathew et al., paper. In the revised manuscript we now discuss the parallels between our work and what was reported in the Mathew et al., paper (Results section and Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The essence of the case report seems to be that a patient with asymptomatic SARS CoV2 infection developed respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID19 at 2 weeks post-infection, requiring hospitalisation. After more than 96 hrs of hospitalisation the patient required ICU admission and was SARS CoV2 negative, but resistant P. Aeurginosa positive on ETT aspirate. At this point bystander T cell activation was noted. The authors link the bystander activation to the SARS-CoV2 infection and disease progression, which is plausible but uncertain due to questions: namely (a) whether an additional infection may have occurred in 2 weeks, (b) whether bystander activation measured at 3 weeks is confidently determined and relatable to original infection, and (c) whether the hospital-acquired multi drug resistant pneumonia is related to the immune dysfunction.</p><p>a) Is this severe COVID-19 or a new insult given that 15 days passed from PCR positivity for onset of symptoms? A clear comparison of this to reported intervals between onset of infection and clinical deterioration would help make the case stronger. If this is very unusual, then alternative explanations, such as a new infection, become more likely than severe COVID-19. Clinical data would be helpful, including any repeat PCR at admission.</p></disp-quote><p>There were 13 days between the patient testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and developing symptoms. Once admitted to our intensive care unit he was assessed, as all our patients are daily, for signs of additional infection through a process led by a consultant medical microbiologist along with senior pharmacist. At these meetings, the clinical status of the patient, inflammatory indices (WCC, CRP, and procalcitonin) and any culture results are discussed. We had no concerns at the time of admission of this patient to the ICU that he had any infection other than that of SARS-CoV-2. We agree that the time between him testing positive by RT-PCR and develop symptoms is atypical, however the CDC, based on the findings of several studies, advise that the incubation period for COVID-19 can be as long as 14 days, which is a day longer than that experienced by this patient. (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html). We have discussed this in greater details within the revised manuscript (Introduction)</p><p>With regards to additional clinical data, he was tested for SARS-CoV-2 upon admission to hospital as well as upon admission to the ICU the following day, both tests were negative. Until ETT-1, none of his cultures grew anything to suggest a secondary infection. The patient had three sets of CT scans take; upon admission to the ICU, when the first VAP was diagnosed and between his first and second VAP. The ground glass opacities typical of COVID-19 were evident throughout. These have now been included as supplementary data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection is probably hospital-acquired and multiple strains are quite possible. The link to bystander cell activation only arises if it led to ineffectual sensing/clearance. Can this be supported by any experimental evidence beyond clinical deterioration?</p></disp-quote><p>If we have understood this question correctly, we are being asked if we believe there to be a link between the clearance of the recurring VAPs and the observed bystander activation; and whether we have any additional experimental evidence to support this? While we provide additional data (described below) in support of the observed bystander activation, we have been careful not to make any causal links between what we have observed for this patient, except to propose that this massive level of immune activation may be contributing to his ongoing inflammatory-associated symptoms. With regards to clearance of the VAPs, having been treated with antibiotics, the effect of the immune system is likely to be minimal, so we believe it unlikely that the bystander activation contributed positively or negatively to this. We have ensured within the revised manuscript that this is made clearer</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The essential arguments for bystander activation are illustrated in Figure 3E-F – that were found not to be particularly convincing. At the very least, please provide full data and experimental replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>As there are strict ethical constraints on how many blood samples can be collected from severely ill patients, we endeavoured throughout this study to make the best use of what we were able to obtain, which was what was presented in the original manuscript. However, we have since managed to obtain one final vial of PBMCs from this patient collected during his time in the ICU at day 38 post RT-PCR+ test. To address the concern raised here, we have used these cells to provide replicate data that shows the presence of CMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells within the sample. We also show new data that demonstrates (in duplicate) that these CMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells were activated and proliferating, based on their expression of activation and proliferation markers, which supports that they are bystander activated (Sandalova et al., 2014; Rivino et al., 2015) (Figure 4D-E,G-H and Figure 4—figure supplement 4A-B). The expression of activation and proliferation markers by CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells during an infection with an unrelated pathogen is in line with other studies on bystander activation, showing increased expression of activation and proliferation markers by CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cells when compared to the CMV-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. We also found that the CD8<sup>+</sup> CMV-specific T cells were predominantly T<sub>EMRA</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub> cells while CD4<sup>+</sup> CMV-specific T cells were predominantly T<sub>EM</sub> cells (Figure 4F,I), which is in line with previous reports on this phenomenon.</p></body></sub-article></article>
