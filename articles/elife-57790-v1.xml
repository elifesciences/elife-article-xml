diversity of species and this diversity is linked to outcomes ranging from ecosystem stability to medical prognoses. Yet the mechanisms underlying microbial diversity are under debate. While simple resource-competition models don't allow for coexistence of a large number of species, it was recently shown that metabolic trade-offs can allow unlimited diversity. Does this diversity persist with more realistic, intermittent nutrient supply? Here, we demonstrate theoretically that in serial dilution culture, metabolic trade-offs allow for high diversity. When a small amount of nutrient is supplied to each batch, the serial dilution dynamics mimic a chemostat-like steady state. If more nutrient is supplied, community diversity shifts due to an 'early-bird' effect. The interplay of this effect with different environmental factors and diversity-supporting mechanisms leads to a variety of relationships between nutrient supply and diversity, suggesting that real ecosystems may not obey a universal nutrient-diversity relationship.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In most environments, organisms compete for limited resources. The number and relative abundance of species that an ecosystem can host is referred to as ‘species diversity’. The competitive-exclusion principle is a hypothesis which proposes that, in an ecosystem, competition for resources results in decreased diversity: only species best equipped to consume the available resources thrive, while their less successful competitors die off. However, many natural ecosystems foster a wide array of species despite offering relatively few resources.</p><p>Researchers have proposed many competing theories to explain how this paradox can emerge, but they have mainly focused on ecosystems where nutrients are steadily supplied. By contrast, less is known about the way species diversity is maintained when nutrients are only intermittently available, for example in ecosystems that have seasons.</p><p>To address this question, Erez, Lopez et al. modeled communities of bacteria</p><p>in which nutrients were repeatedly added and then used up. Depending on conditions, a variety of relationships between the amount of nutrient supplied and community diversity could emerge, suggesting that ecosystems do not follow a simple, universal rule that dictates species diversity. In particular, the resulting communities displayed a higher diversity of microbes than the limit imposed by the competitive-exclusion principle.</p><p>Further observations allowed Erez, Lopez et al. to suggest guiding principles for when diversity in ecosystems will be maintained or lost. In this framework, ‘early-bird’ species, which rapidly use a subset of the available nutrients, grow to dominate the ecosystem. Even though ‘late-bird’ species are more effective at consuming the remaining resources, they cannot compete with the increased sheer numbers of the ‘early-birds’, leading to a ‘rich-get-richer’ phenomenon.</p><p>Oceanic plankton, arctic permafrost and many other threatened, resource-poor ecosystems across the world can dramatically influence our daily lives. Closer to home, shifts in the microbe communities that live on the surface of the human body and in the digestive system are linked to poor health. Understanding how species diversity emerges and changes will help to protect our external and internal environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbe</kwd><kwd>diversity</kwd><kwd>seasonal</kwd><kwd>nutrient</kwd><kwd>ecosystem</kwd><kwd>competition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM082938</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erez</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name><name><surname>Meir</surname><given-names>Yigal</given-names></name><name><surname>Wingreen</surname><given-names>Ned S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1656466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lopez</surname><given-names>Jaime G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1734030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erez</surname><given-names>Amir</given-names></name><name><surname>Lopez</surname><given-names>Jaime G</given-names></name><name><surname>Weiner</surname><given-names>Benjamin G</given-names></name><name><surname>Meir</surname><given-names>Yigal</given-names></name><name><surname>Wingreen</surname><given-names>Ned S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1748958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meir</surname><given-names>Yigal</given-names></name><name><surname>Wingreen</surname><given-names>Ned S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25GM067110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meir</surname><given-names>Yigal</given-names></name><name><surname>Wingreen</surname><given-names>Ned S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2919.01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meir</surname><given-names>Yigal</given-names></name><name><surname>Wingreen</surname><given-names>Ned S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whereas theories of ecological diversity mostly consider continuously supplied nutrients, a seasonal model uncovers a general mechanism that controls diversity and reconciles conflicting experimental findings.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial communities feature an immense diversity of organisms, with the typical human gut microbiota and a liter of seawater both containing hundreds of distinct microbial types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lloyd-Price et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ladau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weigel and Pfister, 2019</xref>). These observations appear to clash with a prediction of some resource-competition models, known as the competitive-exclusion principle – namely, that steady-state coexistence is possible for only as many species as resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and McGehee, 1980</xref>). This conundrum is familiarly known as the ‘paradox of the plankton’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hutchinson, 1961</xref>). Solving this paradox may provide one key to predicting and controlling outcomes ranging from ecosystem stability to successful cancer treatments in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ptacnik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Elsas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stein et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chesson, 2000</xref> classified mechanisms that purport to solve this paradox into two broad categories: <italic>stabilizing</italic> and <italic>equalizing</italic>. Stabilizing mechanisms prevent extinction by allowing species to recover from low populations, whereas equalizing mechanisms slow extinction by minimizing fitness differences between species.</p><p>Many possible solutions of the paradox that rely on stabilizing mechanisms have been offered: (i) interactions between microbes, such as cross-feeding or antibiotic production and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goyal and Maslov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelsic et al., 2015</xref>), (ii) spatial heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murrell and Law, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tilman, 1994</xref>), (iii) persistent non-steady-state dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hutchinson, 1961</xref>), and (iv) predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thingstad, 2000</xref>). Equalizing mechanisms have been studied through neutral theory, in which all species are assumed to have equal fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hubbell, 2005</xref>), and recent work has proposed resource-competition models that self-organize to a neutral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>). Many proposed solutions for the paradox assume a chemostat framework wherein nutrients are continuously supplied and there is a continuous removal of biomass and unused nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palmer, 1994</xref>). However, in nature nutrients are rarely supplied in a constant and continuous fashion. In particular, seasonal variation is ubiquitous in ecology, influencing systems ranging from oceanic phytoplankton communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang, 2003</xref>) to the microbiota of some human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smits et al., 2017</xref>). How does a variable nutrient supply influence diversity?</p><p>Existing literature on seasonality focuses on stabilizing mechanisms and generally finds that seasonality either promotes or has little effect on coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chesson, 1994</xref>). But do these conclusions extend to equalizing mechanisms? To address this question, we consider a known resource-competition model that permits high diversity at steady state due to the equalizing effects of metabolic trade-offs, which assume that microbes have a limited enzyme production capacity they must apportion. Here, we investigate the equalizing effect of metabolic trade-offs in the context of serial dilution, to reflect a more realistic variable nutrient supply.</p><p>Serial dilution, in which cultures of bacteria are periodically diluted and supplied with fresh nutrients, is well-established as an experimental approach. For example, the bacterial populations in the Lenski long-term evolution experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lenski and Travisano, 1994</xref>), experiments on community assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldford et al., 2018</xref>), and antibiotic cross-protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yurtsev et al., 2016</xref>) were all performed in serial dilution. While previous models of serial dilution have characterized competition between small numbers of species with trade-offs in their growth characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stewart and Levin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith, 2011</xref>), the theoretical understanding of diversity in serial dilution is much less developed than for chemostat-based steady-state growth.</p><p>Here, we show that under serial dilution, metabolic trade-offs can still support high diversity communities, but that this coexistence is now sensitive to environmental conditions. Interestingly, seasonality can both increase and decrease diversity in our model, contrasting what has been observed for stabilizing mechanisms. In particular, we find a surprising dependence between community diversity and the amount of nutrient provided to the community. These changes in diversity are driven by an ‘early-bird’ effect in which species that efficiently consume nutrients that are initially more abundant gain a population advantage early in the batch. To our knowledge, this is the first time this effect has been identified as a major influencer of diversity in seasonal ecosystems.</p><p>This dependence between community diversity and the supplied nutrient concentration allowed us to explore an unresolved question in ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tilman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leibold, 1996</xref>): what is the relationship between the amount of nutrient supplied and the resulting diversity of the community? Experimental studies of this question have mainly been performed in macroecological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mittelbach et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waide et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler et al., 2011</xref>), though recently there has been increased focus on microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bienhold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2017</xref>). In microbial experiments, some evidence has supported the ‘hump-shaped’ unimodal trend predicted by many theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kassen et al., 2000</xref>). However, a meta-analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 2007</xref> found no consistent trend across microbial experiments. What we observe here is concordant with Smith’s result: even in our highly simplified model, there is no general relationship between nutrient supply and diversity. Among the factors we find that influence this relationship are cross-feeding, relative enzyme budgets, differences in enzyme affinities, and differences in nutrient yields. That so much variation appears in a simple model suggests that real ecosystems are not likely to display a single universal relationship between nutrient supply and diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We employ the serial dilution model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).

Adding a small nutrient bolus, letting it be consumed, then removing the additional biomass, and repeating is tantamount to operating a chemostat with a fixed nutrient supply and dilution rate. Indeed, the limit <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≪</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> yields the same steady state as a chemostat. Thus, our results for serial dilution include and generalize those obtained for a closely related chemostat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For completeness, we now briefly describe the chemostat results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>. In the presence of metabolic trade-offs, the chemostat can support a higher species diversity than prescribed by the competitive exclusion principle as we demonstrate theoretically in <italic>Appendix</italic> 4. Specifically, if the nutrient supply lies within the convex hull of the strategies on the simplex (visualized by stretching a rubber band around the outermost strategies, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), an arbitrarily large number of species can coexist at steady state. In the chemostat, such species coexistence is attained when the system organizes such that all nutrient levels are driven towards equality by consumption. Dynamically, if one nutrient level is high, the species that consume it increase in population, leading to faster consumption of that nutrient, thus acting to return the nutrients to equal steady-state levels. Such a self-organized neutral state is an attractor of the chemostat dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>) and, correspondingly, of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≪</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> limit of the serial dilution model. Note that the coexistence steady state is not a single fixed point, but rather a degenerate manifold of possible solutions (details in Appendix 4).</p><p>Thus, in the chemostat-limit of the cases shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> all the species will coexist. Conversely, if the supply lies outside the convex hull, (e.g., if we swapped the positions of the leftmost species and the supply in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) the number of surviving species would be strictly less than the number of nutrients, consistent with competitive exclusion. To understand the convex-hull rule, note that a state of arbitrarily high coexistence can only occur if the chemostat self-organizes to a ‘neutral’ state in which the nutrient concentrations are all equal, and thus all strategies have the same growth rate. This state is achieved if and only if the total enzyme abundances lie along the same vector as the nutrient supply, which is achievable only if the supply lies within the convex hull of the strategies present.</p><p>As in the chemostat model, the serial dilution model can support either coexistence or competitive exclusion. However, if one chooses system parameters near the transition between these two states, it requires a very large number of batches for the simulation to reach steady state. This is a manifestation of the well-known phenomenon of <italic>critical slowing down</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dakos and Bascompte, 2014</xref>).

However, away from this limit we find that the magnitude of the nutrient bolus can qualitatively affect the steady-state outcome of serial dilutions. To understand this effect, we first consider a simple case of two nutrients and two species as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. The two species will coexist if each species is invasible by the other. In our example, we first determine the invasibility of species R (strategy indicated by red circle) by species with strategies lying to its left. To this end, we choose a nutrient supply and perform model serial dilutions until steady state is reached. For a particular finite bolus size, we find that for all supplies within the hatched region an infinitesimal inoculum of any species lying to the left of R will increase more than R during a batch, and therefore can invade R. Similarly, we determine the invasibility of species B (strategy indicated by blue circle) by any species with a strategy lying to its right, and find the second hatched region. The intersection of these hatched regions for which (1) B can invade R and (2) R can invade B is the supply interval of mutual invasibility where these two species will stably coexist. The coexistence interval is bounded by the red and blue triangles, and each of these coexistence boundaries is a unique property of its corresponding species. We call these species-specific boundaries <italic>remapped</italic> because they generally lie at different locations on the simplex than the strategies they originated from, with the extent of remapping depending on the nutrient bolus size. At a more technical level, the remapped boundary for a given species and bolus size is the nutrient supply for which, over the course of a batch, all nutrients are equally valuable and so, a species with any strategy can neutrally invade and persist. This equality of nutrient value is defined in terms of the Monod function integrals for each nutrient (for details see Appendix 3).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The nutrient bolus size <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> affects the relative abundance of species and even their coexistence at steady state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the mutual invasibility condition for two species and two nutrients.

In this example, the nutrient supply now lies outside the convex hull. This results in one winner species (the dark blue one nearest the supply), with all others decreasing exponentially from batch to batch. This loss of coexistence with increasing nutrient bolus size is reminiscent of Rosenzweig’s ‘paradox of enrichment’ in predator-prey systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenzweig, 1971</xref>). Strikingly, however, as bolus size is further increased to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf47"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the coexistence boundaries are remapped back to their original positions, so that the nutrient supply once again lies within the convex hull, and so steady-state coexistence of all species is recovered.</p><p>What causes the remapping of the coexistence boundaries inwards as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>? Let us consider a single species growing on two nutrients supplied in the same proportion as its strategy (i.e. the fraction of Nutrient 1 is equal to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>).

The balance is achieved because the nutrient with a higher initial abundance is more rapidly exhausted, while the nutrient with lower initial abundance is consumed more slowly and is therefore available for a longer span of time. At small <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf51"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the more rapid initial consumption of the more abundant nutrient does not influence the consumption rate of the less abundant nutrient because the bolus size is small relative to the initial population size, so the population does not grow substantially during the batch. This changes as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf52"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> increases: the rapid initial consumption of the more abundant nutrient leads to a substantial increase in the total population. The remaining low initial abundance nutrient is now consumed more quickly and is less available to an invader with a more balanced enzyme strategy. The nutrients are no longer equally valuable on average, and remedying this requires a more equally balanced nutrient bolus. Thus, the remapped coexistence boundary moves inwards (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app7fig3">Appendix 7—figure 3</xref>).

For the case of two nutrients (e.g., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), if there is only a single species present then if the supply lies anywhere to the left of its strategy, at some time during the batch there will be some of Nutrient 2 remaining after the bulk of Nutrient 1 has been consumed. Thus a single species can be invaded by any strategy to its left, provided the supply also lies to its left. Similarly, a species can be invaded by any strategy to its right if the supply lies to its right. This is exactly the condition for the coexistence boundary of a species to coincide with its actual strategy (details in <italic>Appendix</italic> 5).</p><p>We have rationalized coexistence in our serial dilution model in terms of mutual invasibility, but have not explicitly stated the condition for an arbitrary number of species to coexist in steady state. In the chemostat, all species coexist when the concentrations of all nutrients are equal, implying the same growth rate for all strategies. However, for serial dilutions the nutrient concentrations are generally not equal and are not even constant in time. Instead, it is the integrated growth contribution of every nutrient that must be equal to allow for arbitrary coexistence.

This loss of diversity is due to the dramatically lowered steady-state abundances of strategies that favor Nutrient 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom). Two different effects underlie this change in community structure. The first is the early-bird effect described above: species specializing in more abundant nutrients gain a population advantage that allows them to rapidly consume less abundant nutrients that would otherwise support species with different enzyme specializations. The second effect is a well-known property of single nutrient competition and can be viewed as a ‘single-nutrient’ early-bird effect. In this case, species that are superior competitors for a nutrient gain an exponential population advantage over inferior competitors, increasing their share of total nutrient beyond the ratio of initial consumption rates. Both of these effects increase in strength with larger bolus size because the early-bird advantage increases as growth proceeds. The combination of these effects results in the species specialized in consuming the most abundant nutrients consuming a larger fraction of all nutrients. However, for very large bolus sizes, saturation of nutrient uptake rates mitigates these two effects, leading to a lack of remapping for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf84"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and diversity returning to its chemostat-limit.

In a model with equal <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the identity of the early bird is determined by which nutrient is more abundant: if the two nutrients have equal <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, a species can gain an early-bird advantage by preferentially consuming the more abundant nutrient. This changes if one nutrient has a much lower <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> than the other. In this case it may be advantageous to preferentially consume the nutrient with the lower <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, even if it is the less abundant nutrient. If the nutrient with the lower <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is also the more abundant nutrient, this will intensify the early-bird advantage. Why does this change in the early bird’s identity change the form of the nutrient-diversity relationship? This change arises from a clash between optimal feeding behavior in the chemostat and seasonal regimes. In the chemostat, it is advantageous to focus on the most abundant nutrient, regardless of the value of <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Thus, in the chemostat limit, species focusing on the more abundant nutrient have an advantage. In the case of equal <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (or <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> favoring the more abundant nutrient), this advantage is intensified by the early-bird effect, increasing the biomass of already abundant species and lowering diversity. By contrast, if the low abundance nutrient has a low <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the early-bird effect will have the opposite effect on diversity. Now the early-bird effect benefits species that were disadvantaged in the chemostat limit, leading to more equal abundances and higher diversity. This shift in abundances is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. The change in the identity of the early bird can also explain more complex relationships between diversity and bolus size (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app7fig6">Appendix 7—figure 6</xref>).</p><p>In addition to unequal enzyme affinities, it is possible for different nutrients to have different yields, <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> we show the relationship between bolus and diversity for a system with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf107"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf108"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. As expected, at low <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> the diversity is similar to that in the case of equal <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. As <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf109"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> increases, the diversity decreases initially and the symmetry-related bolus-composition cases (e.g. [0.2,0.8] and [0.8,0.2]) eventually diverge, with one’s diversity rising and the other’s continuing to fall. This behavior is explainable by the same logic as in the variable <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> case: diversity rises or falls depending on whether the early-bird species was also favored in the chemostat limit. However, unlike the case of variable <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the diversity curves do not eventually return to the chemostat limit. Regardless of which nutrient the <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> favor, the diversity eventually begins decreasing monotonically as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf110"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> increases. This difference between the variable <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and variable <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> cases can be understood by considering what occurs when both nutrients are saturating. In the variable <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> case, saturating nutrients are equal in value, implying a return to the chemostat limit as the early-bird effect weakens. In contrast, for variable <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, there remains a difference in the value of the two nutrients in the saturated regime, meaning that the early-bird effect will grow stronger and the early bird will take over the population. The beginning of this takeover can be seen at high bolus sizes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Note that for both variable <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and variable <italic>Y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, these trends are also reflected in the remapping (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app7fig7">Appendix 7—figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Despite the large variation in relationships between diversity and bolus size, these phenomena can all be understood as consequences of the early-bird effect. As the model becomes more complex there are additional factors to consider in determining which nutrient will provide an early-bird advantage, but the fundamental mechanism of exploiting early growth advantages remains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cross-feeding</title><p>It is possible to extend <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2 equ3">Equations 2 and 3</xref> beyond a single trophic layer, allowing for consumption of metabolic byproducts.

More broadly, when species compete for multiple resources that are supplied in batches, a species’ survival depends on more than its ability to efficiently consume nutrients. An early-bird species, being more specialized in consuming the nutrients that are initially more abundant, gains a population advantage early in the batch. This population advantage may allow the early-bird species to out-compete other species even when consuming nutrients it is not specialized to consume. Despite its consumption inefficiencies, through sheer numbers the early-bird species can consume more of the remaining nutrients than its more specialized competitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Population bottlenecks</title><p>So far we have considered deterministic dynamics, which is appropriate for large populations. In natural settings, however, there are often small semi-isolated communities. For these communities, fluctuations can play an important role. In particular, population bottlenecks can lead to large demographic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2015</xref>). In our model, how does the nutrient supply affect diversity in such communities? To address this question, we applied discrete sampling of a finite population when diluting from one batch to the next (see Appendix 1). With this protocol, an ‘extinction’ occurs when sampling yields zero individuals of a species. For a long enough series of dilutions such extinctions would ultimately lead to near-complete loss of diversity. For small real-world populations, however, diversity may be maintained by migration. To model such migration we augmented the population at each dilution with a ‘spike-in’ from a global pool of species, in the spirit of MacArthur’s theory of island biogeography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">MacArthur and Wilson, 2001</xref>). Specifically, in the spike-in procedure, to prevent extinctions caused by sampling fluctuations, every new batch is inoculated with a small number of the original, founder species.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> we show results of spike-in serial dilutions for a population bottleneck of 1008 cells. 95% of these cells are sampled from the previous batch, while 5% are sampled from a global pool, with equal abundances of 21 equally spaced strategies (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

As expected, for a balanced nutrient supply at any <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, all species have the same average abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> top). By contrast, when Nutrient 1’s fraction is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> cyan and 6<italic>B</italic> bottom), increasing <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> increases the abundance gaps between the species, reflecting the uneven competition for Nutrient 2. Overall, the spike-in protocol leads to higher diversity at low <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> than the deterministic case (starting from equal species abundances but with no spike-in, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). For large <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, the <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> vs. <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> curves for these two protocols are indistinguishable.

For the serial dilution protocol with spike-ins, diversity is maintained by migration and so it is possible to relax the constraint of exact trade-offs. How does diversity depend on the nutrient supply if we allow species to have different enzyme budgets? We implemented random differences in species enzyme budgets by setting <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf141"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, that is, a standard deviation of 10%, and plotted effective number of species <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.

Raising <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> leads to a drop in <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> (albeit still above the competitive-exclusion limit). Examining the species abundances in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, we note that differences in enzyme budget establish a fitness hierarchy even when nutrient fractions are equal (top), with those species with the highest budgets increasing in relative abundance as <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> increases. The asterisk (*) marks the species with the highest total enzyme budget, which becomes the most abundant for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf143"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Reducing Nutrient 1’s fraction to 0.05 results in a shifting abundance hierarchy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, bottom): at low <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> the highest abundance species is the one that consumes only Nutrient 2, as in the equivalent <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf144"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> case. However, increasing <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> results in increased abundance for the species with the highest enzyme budget – which would ultimately lead to its domination for sufficiently large <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>. This increasing dominance of the species with the highest enzyme budget is another manifestation of the early-bird effect: as the amount of growth in a batch increases, the advantage of a larger enzyme budget further compounds. In short, for spike-in serial dilutions the influence of unequal enzyme budgets depends on the nutrient supply, such that the species with the largest budgets dominate for large, unbiased supplies.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Natural ecosystems experience variations in the timing and magnitude of nutrient supply, and the impact of these variations on species diversity is not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 2007</xref>). To explore the impact of variable nutrient supply, we modeled resource competition in a serial dilution framework and analyzed the model’s steady states. We found that variable nutrient supply still allows for the high diversity seen in the continuous supply (‘chemostat’) version of the model. Indeed, the serial dilution steady state mimics that of a chemostat when the amount of nutrients supplied in each batch is small. Surprisingly, however, supplying the nutrients as a bolus led to a dependence of diversity on the amount of supplied nutrients.</p><p>In contrast to existing literature on seasonality, we find that environmental fluctuations can both weaken and strengthen coexistence in this model. This occurs as the result of an ‘early-bird’ effect associated with supplying nutrients as large seasonal boluses instead of continuously. Some species can capitalize on rapid initial growth on an abundant nutrient to reach a large population size, which then allows them to deplete the remaining nutrients at the expense of their competitors. This early-bird effect can both restrict and expand the range of environments in which communities can self-organize to a neutral state. We show that even when metabolic trade-offs are combined with stabilizing mechanisms, the impact of the early-bird effect remains. For example, in the case of cross-feeding, the community diversity falls as a function of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf145"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> due to the early-bird advantages gained by species at higher trophic levels.</p><p>While the idea of species gaining early advantages has been explored, such as in the literature on founder effects and speciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barton and Charlesworth, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown,, 1957</xref>), to the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the influence of the early-bird effect on the diversity of seasonal ecosystems. We believe that this effect will occur in a variety of such ecosystems, as its only fundamental requirement is competition for multiple nutrients that are supplied in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, while the early-bird effect plays a large role in our model, it is not the only bolus-dependent effect that influences diversity. We also observe another effect that can be viewed as a ‘single-nutrient’ version of the early-bird effect. This effect arises from a well-studied property of competition: as growth proceeds, a superior competitor for a nutrient gains an exponential advantage over inferior competitors for that nutrient. Like the early-bird effect, this shifts the system’s biomass towards species more specialized in initially abundant nutrients, particularly for large but non-saturating nutrient bolus sizes. This single-nutrient effect can co-occur with the early-bird effect, for example in competition for an abundant nutrient between two early-bird species.</p><p>The form of seasonality we explore in this manuscript, where mixed boluses are supplied periodically, is only one possible form of seasonal nutrient supply. The impact of the early-bird effect and single-nutrient competition will likely differ between different forms of seasonality. For example, we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app7fig1">Appendix 7—figure 1</xref> that supplying cycles of single nutrient boluses that approach an equal distribution of nutrients results in lower diversity than supplying mixed equal nutrient boluses. While this form of seasonality differs from the one we characterized, we can still understand the loss of diversity as arising from the single-nutrient competition effect initially observed in our mixed-bolus models. We expect the principles gleaned from our models to be of use in understanding diversity in a variety of seasonal ecosystems.</p><p>Finding a general relation between the amount of nutrient supplied to a community and its diversity is a long-standing goal of theoretical ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tilman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrams, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leibold, 1996</xref>). We found that in our model the form of the nutrient-diversity relation (NDR) can change based on model details. The model has two regimes: a low diversity and a high diversity regime. The former satisfies competitive exclusion (no more species coexisting than resources), whereas the latter exceeds competitive exclusion and occurs when the nutrient supply lies within the convex hull of the remapped metabolic strategies present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>). At the bifurcation point between the two regimes, we observe critical slowing down in that the number of dilutions required to reach steady state diverges.</p><p>In the high diversity regime, the NDR can take several forms, resulting from the interplay of the early-bird effect and other mechanisms. Even with a single trophic layer, the NDR can be U-shaped, hump-shaped, monotonically decreasing, or have multiple peaks. These trends can then be further modified by the addition of more trophic layers, differences in enzyme budgets, etc.</p><p>Experimental studies that characterize the NDRs of microbial ecosystems have reached similarly variable conclusions. For example, one work studying bacterial communities in Arctic deep-sea sediments found an increasing trend between energy input and richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bienhold et al., 2012</xref>), while a study on photosynthetic microbial mats found a negative relationship between energy input and richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 2017</xref>). A meta-analysis of aquatic microbial ecosystems found examples of both monotonic and non-monotonic NDRs, with no single form dominating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith, 2007</xref>). Our theoretical results, together with these experimental findings, indicate that there may be no single universal NDR in microbial ecosystems. This conclusion suggests that the best approach for characterizing the NDR of a given ecosystem is not to apply a one-size-fits-all theory, but to analyze the role of different factors such as cross-feeding, trade-offs, and immigration in determining that particular ecosystem’s NDR. While we have focused on microbial systems, the absence of a universal NDR is consistent with results from recent work in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We found that the stringency of metabolic trade-offs has a large impact on community diversity. We imposed a metabolic enzyme budget on each species to reflect the reality that microbial cells have a finite capacity to synthesize proteins and must carefully apportion their proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basan et al., 2015</xref>). However, while it is true that microbes have limited biosynthetic capacity, it is unclear how strict are the resulting trade-offs. For this reason, we characterized versions of the model with both exact and inexact trade-offs. Our results show that the form of an ecosystem’s NDR can depend on the stringency of metabolic trade-offs. This finding is not exclusive to the serial dilution model. The stringency of trade-offs was also important in the original chemostat setting: in a birth-death-immigration framework, small violations of the enzyme budget still allowed for high levels of coexistence, but large violations disrupted coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that an experimental characterization of the stringency of metabolic trade-offs among microbes would provide a valuable ecological parameter. Note that metabolic trade-offs are only one of the many types of trade-offs microbes are subject to; other types of trade-offs, such as constraints between biomass yield and growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wortel et al., 2018</xref>), may also shape a community’s NDR.</p><p>In constructing a model, we made a number of assumptions about the way in which microbes consume and utilize nutrients. Some of these assumptions do not apply to all microbial communities, and the impact of relaxing these assumptions can affect the NDR. For example, we mostly focused on communities where all nutrients are equally valuable (i.e. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf146"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mpadded width="+5.7pt"><mml:msub><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mpadded><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∀</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). However, biomass yields can vary between nutrients and between species, which we explored in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>. Notably, unequal yields create differences between nutrients even in the saturating regime (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf147"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), leading to a departure from the chemostat limit at large nutrient boluses. Coexistence in the serial dilution model is robust to varying yield, as long as all species have the same yield on a given nutrient. The scenario where species have different biomass yields on the same nutrient is conceptually similar to the case of inexact trade-offs, since some species will have a strict advantage over others. Thus, it is likely that these unequal yields between species will lead to a reduction in community diversity. However, varying the yield in this manner also allows for the inclusion of new trade-offs that may impact diversity, such as the aforementioned trade-off between yield and growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wortel et al., 2018</xref>). We also explored the effects of unequal Monod constants for different nutrients (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). We found that if a low-abundance nutrient also has a low <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, the early-bird effect favors species that were disadvantaged in the chemostat limit, thus reversing the equal-<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> NDR and leading to hump-shaped NDR curves. Indeed, large differences in <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> values can lead to a multi-peaked NDR as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app7fig6">Appendix 7—figure 6</xref>.</p><p>Our model assumes that all nutrients are substitutable (i.e. only one of the multiple nutrients is required for growth). In real ecosystems, microbes can require multiple complementary nutrients to grow, e.g. sources of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. In cases where one class of complementary nutrient is strongly limiting, a model with both complementary and substitutable resources would essentially reduce to the current model of only substitutable resources. This case is likely the more common one, e.g. as many soils are carbon limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aldén et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Demoling et al., 2007</xref>). However, in cases where no single nutrient is strongly limiting, the presence of complementary nutrients would possibly lead to different NDRs, which will be an interesting direction for future study.</p><p>Our modeling predictions, e.g. the convex hull condition and the changes in diversity due to the early-bird effect, are in principle testable. To connect our modeling assumptions to real microbial systems, we compare our growth model of substitutable and simultaneous nutrient consumption to previously published experimental data from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> growing in batch and chemostat conditions. We find that our modeling assumptions are consistent with both datasets and outline potential future experiments to test the model’s multispecies predictions, detailed in <italic>Appendix</italic> 6. As is apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app6fig1">Appendix 6—figure 1</xref>, the growth dynamics of <italic>E. coli</italic> at low nutrient levels is well described by our modeling framework. The experiments we compared were performed with the same strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>, meaning that inclusion of different microbes would be needed to test the multispecies predictions. To determine the strategies of other microbes, including other strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the most practical approach would likely be batch culturing. Once strains with different strategies have been identified, nutrient-diversity relationships could then be obtained by competing strains in serial dilution culture and measuring the community diversity (e.g. via fluorescent tags or by 16S rRNA sequencing) as a function of the total concentration of multiple, substitutable nutrients provided at the start of each batch.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-57790-transrepform-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>No datasets were generated in this work.

For example, understanding the conditions for unlimited coexistence in two nutrient competition requires us to examine the conditions that allow two species to coexist.

Species 1 can invade Species 2 if the nutrient supply is to the left of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf182"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Therefore, the two species can mutually invade and coexist if and only if the nutrient supply lies between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf183"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf184"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. This is precisely the convex hull condition, with no remapping.</p><p>For the same pair of species, how do we determine the nutrient supplies for which Species 1 can be invaded by Species 2 in the serial dilution version of the model? The fitness of a species in this model is the growth exponent <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf185"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mo largeop="true" symmetric="true">∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, meaning that Species 2 can invade Species 1 at nutrient supplies where Species 1 creates an environment such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf186"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The nutrient supply at which Species 1 creates an environment where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf187"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> therefore bounds the region of nutrient supplies for which Species 2 can invade. By the same logic, the border for the region where Species 1 can invade Species 2 is the nutrient supply at which Species 2 creates an environment where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf188"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Therefore, the mutual invasibility region is now defined by the nutrient supplies where each species growing in isolation creates an environment where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf189"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. These points are what we refer to as the ”remapped coexistence boundaries’ and, unlike in the chemostat version of the model, these generally do not correspond to the species’ strategies.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-4"><title>Appendix 4</title><boxed-text><sec id="s12" sec-type="appendix"><title>Perturbation theory for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf190"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≪</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></title><p>In the main text, we provide an explanation why in the limit of small nutrient bolus size <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf191"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the serial dilution model effectively becomes a chemostat.

The reduction in diversity in the system can be explained by the early-bird effect. In a batch where complete nutrient depletion occurs, the early bird gains an early advantage by rapidly depleting the more abundant nutrient, and then is able to consume a larger share of the non-abundant nutrient. Therefore, if the batch is terminated early, the amount of non-abundant nutrient consumed within the batch becomes smaller. While this makes the early bird less able to consume the non-abundant nutrient, it more severely impacts non-early-bird species, as their growth is more reliant on the non-abundant nutrient. As the batch terminates earlier and earlier, the system effectively becomes competition for a single nutrient (the more abundant one). Thus, the most fit early bird (the specialist for the more abundant nutrient) completely takes over the population.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57790-app7-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app7fig3" position="float"><label>Appendix 7—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cumulative growth function integrals at different values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf327"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for a species with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf328"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> growing with nutrient supplied with proportion <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf329"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.8</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.2</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and initial population <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf330"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative growth integrals with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf331"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The more abundant nutrient is consumed faster (since the strategy is matched to nutrient proportions) and the majority of it is consumed quickly. The less abundant nutrient is consumed more slowly and a significant portion of it remains after the more abundant nutrient is almost completely depleted. In this way, the growth timecourse integrals are balanced to be equal.

The more abundant nutrient will still be depleted quickly. However, now that <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> is larger this initial consumption results in an increased abundance of the consumer. This means that the less abundant nutrient is depleted more quickly, leading a smaller growth timecourse integral for this nutrient relative to the more abundant nutrient. Thus, in this regime, the difference between the growth timecourse integrals increases with <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>. Restoring them to equality requires more equal starting distributions of nutrients. Once <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> increases such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf340"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf341"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, the increase in <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub> now drives the growth timecourse integrals towards equality. The growth function is now almost always saturated and this neutralizes the effect of one nutrient starting at a much larger concentration. There will now be a significant buildup of biomass before the nutrients are exhausted, meaning that the growth timecourses will subsequently drop very quickly. As the growth function becomes more and more saturated, the nutrients will be consumed in proportion to their strategy. Thus, the growth timecourse integrals will once again be equal since the strategies match the nutrient proportions and the 'crash' times will therefore be similar for both nutrients.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57790-app7-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app7fig4" position="float"><label>Appendix 7—figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dependence of coexistence boundary remapping on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf342"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</title><p>As a further exposition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> in the main text, shown here is the difference between the remapped coexistence boundaries and the corresponding metabolic strategies as a function of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf343"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and metabolic strategy with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf344"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57790-app7-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="app7fig5" position="float"><label>Appendix 7—figure 5.</label><caption><title>Serial dilution model with three nutrients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of remapping on the three-nutrient simplex, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> from the main text.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Antonella Succurro (Reviewer #1); Lei Dai (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers liked the work, and they all agreed that this is an insightful paper that should be suitable for publication if the authors address a few issues, none of which requires additional experimentation. Notably, all reviewers thought that the manuscript was a bit difficult to read at times, and they agreed that it would be substantially improved if the authors could shorten the paper and provide a more streamlined narrative, with a focus on its central results. Finally, the reviewers were skeptical of the comparison to experiments and indicated that it should be removed from the Abstract and re-framed as suggested below.</p><p>The authors set out to understand the conditions in which n (n &gt; 1) species can coexist on m &lt; n resources. This is important because such coexistence on few resources appears common in nature. Yet, some simple competition models suggest it is impossible (hence the name of the conundrum as &quot;the paradox of the plankton&quot;). They seek to understand the conditions leading to stable diversity in a specific environmental mode: seasonal batch-cultures with bottle-necks, a la serially culturing microbial communities, as they rightfully claim that theory here is less developed than in chemostat.</p><p>The most interesting finding in the paper is that nutrient abundance (&quot;bolus&quot;) at the onset of each &quot;season&quot; is an important determinant of diversity, whereas reservoir concentrations are less important in a chemostat. The reason is what they call an &quot;early-bird&quot; effect: medium nutrient boluses tend to favor species whose consumption vectors are most similar to the bolus vector, allowing these species to rapidly outpace other species and then pre-empt those other species from resources. In contrast, with lower or much higher nutrient boluses, and especially, when the bolus size is small enough that the model is akin to a chemostat, the fixed energy budget among species causes them to equalize and allows for coexistence. A second finding is that there is a simple mechanism (using their pictorial simplexes) to predict diversity among a set of species, given an understanding of their nutrient consumption vectors and the vector of the nutrient supply. The non-monotonic relation between nutrient bolus size and remapping of strategies, which determines species co-existence at steady state, is a novel and interesting result that can be tested by experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agreed that the two central and most insightful results are (i) the relationship between the bolus size and diversity and the associated remapping of metabolic strategies and (ii) the connection between serial passaging and chemostat modes. The paper would benefit by making it shorter and with a more clear focus on those two results. In particular the second result ((ii) above) could be highlighted in the Abstract / Introduction / Discussion. The authors clearly show that under certain conditions (notably, c<sub>0</sub> &lt;&lt; K), a chemostat model is a special case of a serial dilution model. This is a fascinating result. However, more effort could be taken to detail some of the important assumptions in this result. The main one is that batch culture is allowed to reach steady-state and full nutrient depletion. While this is reasonable from the goal of mathematically connecting the two environmental regimes, it is difficult to consider whether it is ecologically reasonable without some discussion of the amount of time required for that to be reached. For example, are there any batch culture simulations that would require an unreasonably long time to reach steady-state, such that it is unlikely to occur, and therefore unlikely to be equivalent to chemostat steady-state conditions?</p><p>2) Many of the other results besides the two highlighted above could be organized in the appendix, or as subsections of a final Results section, where the authors examine how relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions made in the model (e.g. the exploration of a softer trade-off imposed by unequal enzyme budgets, the regulation of enzyme expression, the possibility of cross-feeding, the case of unequal K<sub>i</sub> and Y<sub>i</sub>, or the effect of including the stochastic nature of dilutions) affect their conclusions. If the authors prefer to include it as a Results section in the main text, they should introduce this section by explicitly alerting the reader that its purpose is to check the effect of relaxing the simplifying assumptions they previously made on the main results of the paper, listing them before going into details. That will help the reader understand the connection of the various subsections to the main results.</p><p>3) Reviewers appreciated the Mutation/Selection section, but they all agreed that it does not add much to the narrative. Cutting it off the paper would help to maintain the focus and streamline the narrative. The authors could develop it further in a separate paper, as it is an interesting and relevant topic</p><p>4) The comparison to experimental results should be revised. The analysis performed (only one species, not an ecosystem) in Figure 7 does not work as much as a &quot;validation&quot; of the main predictions of the paper, but rather as &quot;support of the model assumptions&quot;. The authors described this as: &quot;Qualitatively, the data support the assumptions of substitutable and simultaneous nutrient consumption, while the strong quantitative fit to our model supports the assumption that enzyme strategies do not vary significantly within a batch.&quot; The reviewers concurred that validation experiments of the model in this paper would require testing the predictions of remapping: e.g. how co-existing species change as a function of nutrient bolus size. The paper is valid and interesting as it is and without an experimental validation of this prediction, so the current discussion on experiments should be either eliminated or moved to the appendix and changed in tone to reflect its value as a check of some of the model assumptions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57790.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers liked the work, and they all agreed that this is an insightful paper that should be suitable for publication if the authors address a few issues, none of which requires additional experimentation.
