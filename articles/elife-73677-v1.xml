efficacy correlates with the level of CD47 expression. However, CD47, upon ligation, also transmits signals leading to cell dysfunction or death, raising a concern that overexpressing CD47 could be harmful. Here, we unveiled an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We showed that extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, released from normal or tumor cells overexpressing CD47 (transgenic or native) can induce efficient CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. Like the autogenous CD47, CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is capable of interacting with SIRPα to inhibit phagocytosis. However, ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death. Thus, CD47 cross-dressing provides an alternative source of cell surface CD47 that may elicit its anti-phagocytic function without transmitting harmful signals to the cells. CD47 cross-dressing also suggests a previously unidentified mechanism for tumor-induced immunosuppression. Our findings should help to further optimize the CD47 transgenic approach that may improve outcomes by minimizing the harmful effects of CD47 overexpression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD47</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>xenotransplantation</kwd><kwd>tumor cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI045897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sykes</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017585</institution-id><institution>The First Hospital of Jilin University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yong-Guang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PO1 AI045897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sykes</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>NIH Shared Instrumentation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10RR027050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sykes</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Extracellular vesicles released from cells overexpressing CD47 mediate CD47 cross-dressing on surrounding cells, leading to protection against phagocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD47 is ubiquitously expressed and acts as a ligand of signaling regulatory protein (SIRP)α, a critical inhibitory receptor on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Emerging evidence indicates that the CD47-SIRPα signaling pathway plays an important role in regulation of macrophage and DC activation, offering a promising intervention target for immunological disorders. CD47KO cells are vigorously rejected by macrophages after infusion into syngeneic wild-type (WT) mice, demonstrating that CD47 provides a ‘don’t eat me’ signal to macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oldenborg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2007a</xref>). Xenotransplantation using pigs as the transplant source has the potential to resolve the severe shortage of human organ donors, a major limiting factor in clinical transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang and Sykes, 2007</xref>). We reported that the strong rejection of xenogeneic cells by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2002</xref>) is largely caused by the lack of functional interaction between donor CD47 and recipient SIRPα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ide et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Navarro-Alvarez and Yang, 2014</xref>). These findings led to the development of human CD47 transgenic pigs that have achieved encouraging results in pig-to-nonhuman primate xenotransplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tena et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nomura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to macrophages, a sub-population of DCs also expresses SIRPα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guilliams et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, CD47-SIRPα signaling also inhibits DC activation and their ability to prime T cells, and plays an important role in induction of T cell tolerance by donor-specific transfusion (DST) and hepatocyte transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, transgenic expression of human CD47 in pigs may also attenuate xenoimmune responses by ameliorating DC activation and antigen presentation. More recently, transgenic overexpression of CD47 was also applied for reducing allogenicity and generating hypoimmunogenic pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deuse et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>It has become increasingly evident that the CD47-SIRPα pathway plays a critical role in containing anti-tumor immune responses. CD47 upregulation was detected in various cancer cells, serving a powerful mechanism of evading macrophage killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, treatment with CD47 blockade could inhibit tumor growth via macrophage-mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Willingham et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weiskopf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2015a</xref>). More recently, the antitumor activity of CD47 blockade was found to be associated with CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC activation and largely T cell-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these studies revealed clearly that the CD47-SIRPα pathway provides a powerful negative regulation for both innate and adaptive immune responses and is increasingly considered as an effective intervention target for protecting against transplant rejection and unleashing immune responses to cancer.</p><p>Although negative regulation of immune responses is predominantly mediated by inhibitory CD47-SIRPα signaling in macrophages and DCs, it remains largely unknown how transgenic CD47 on pig or human pluripotent stem cells and upregulated CD47 on tumor cells interact with its receptor and ligands. In the present study, we identified an alternative source of cell surface CD47. We found that extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (Exos) from cells transgenically overexpressing CD47 or tumor cells overexpressing endogenous CD47, could induce CD47 cross-dressing on pig or human cells. CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces can interact with SIRPα to inhibit phagocytosis. However, unlike the autogenous CD47 that, upon ligation, induces cell apoptosis and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mateo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meijles et al., 2017</xref>), ligation of CD47 cross-dressed on cell surfaces is not harmful to cells. This study provides deeper insight into the effect of CD47 overexpression, which needs to be considered when designing strategies for gene-editing in pigs for xenotransplantation or in human pluripotent stem cells for cell replacement therapy, and for developing CD47 blockade-based cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transgenic hCD47 cross-dressing in pig cells</title><p>CD47 cross-dressing was first identified by detecting hCD47 on pig cells that was cocultured with pig cells expressing transgenic hCD47. Two different hCD47 isoforms were used to ensure that findings are not isoform-specific. In these experiments, cell cocultures were performed using cell line cells derived from porcine aortic cells (PAOC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, we cocultured parental PAOCs (expressing pig CD47; referred to as PAOC/CD47<sup>p</sup>) with PAOCs that were genetically modified to express hCD47 isoform 2 (referred to as PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h2</sup>) or isoform 4 (referred to as PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h4</sup>). Two different CD47 isoforms were used to confirm the findings are not isoform-specific. Flow cytometry analysis using anti-CD47 antibodies recognizing both human and pig CD47 revealed that PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h2</sup> or PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h4</sup> cells expressed a markedly increased level of CD47 compared to PAOC/CD47<sup>p</sup> cells, and that PAOC/CD47<sup>p</sup> cells showed significantly increased CD47 staining after coculture with PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h2</sup> or PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results suggest that PAOC/CD47<sup>p</sup> cells were cross-dressed by CD47, likely transgenic hCD47, from PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h</sup> cells during cultures. To confirm this possibility, we made CD47-defficient PAOC cells (via targeted deletion using CRISPR-Cas9- technology; referred to as PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup>) and PAOC47<sup>null</sup> cells that express transgenic hCD47 isoform 2 (PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup>) or isoform 4 (PAOC/CD47<sup>h4</sup>). When the PAOC cell line cells were cocultured for 24 hr, we found that PAOC47<sup>null</sup> cells became positively stained by both anti-h/pCD47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref><bold>, top</bold>) and anti-hCD47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref><bold>, bottom</bold>) antibodies. To rule out the possibility that, during the coculture, the CD47<sup>null</sup> cells did not become CD47<sup>+</sup>, but PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> cells reduced hCD47 expression, we labeled PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref><bold>, Left</bold>) or PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref><bold>, Right</bold>) cells with florescence Celltrace violet and then cocultured the labeled cells with unlabeled PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> or PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup> cells, respectively. This experiment, in which fluorescence-labeling allowed for better distinguishing between the two cell populations in the cocultures, further confirmed that PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup> cells can be cross-dressed by CD47 after coculture with PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transgenic hCD47 cross-dressing on pig cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Porcine aortic cell (PAOC)/CD47<sup>p</sup> cells and PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h2</sup> or PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h4</sup> cells were cultured alone or cocultured for 24 hr, and hCD47 cross-dressing on gated PAOC/CD47<sup>p</sup> cells was assessed by flow cytometry using anti-h/pCD47-PE mAb (clone CC2C6, reacting with both human and pig CD47).

Furthermore, previous studies have shown that CD47-lentiviruses are more effective in transducing SIRPα<sup>+</sup> non-phagocytic tumor cells, suggesting that the interaction of CD47 with SIRPα may facilitate lentiviral engulfment by target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sosale et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, to determine whether hCD47 cross-dressing is mediated by binding of hCD47 to pig SIRPα, we performed cocultures with pig lymphoma cell line (LCL) cells that do not express SIRPα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref><bold>, right</bold>).

CD47 cross-dressing was performed on GFP<sup>+</sup> CD47KO Jurkat cells by incubation for 2 hr with PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> EVs.

Here we found that EVs and Exos released from pig cells transgenically overexpressing hCD47 can mediate hCD47 cross-dressing on surrounding pig cells. Furthermore, hCD47 cross-dressed on pig cells can interact with human SIRPα and inhibit phagocytosis by human macrophages. Such CD47 cross-dressing occurs not only in the pig-to-pig combination, but also in the human-to-human, pig-to-human, and human-to-pig directions. These results provide a new mechanism for the inhibition of phagocytosis by the approach of transgenically expressing CD47.</p><p>In both xenogeneic and allogeneic settings, a high level of transgenic CD47 expression was found to be essential for its immune inhibitory effect.

Using a pig-to-baboon kidney xenotransplantation model, a recent study suggested that widespread expression of hCD47 in the pig kidney was associated with increased vascular permeability and systemic edema, presumably due to upregulated TSP-1, and hence, TSP-1-CD47 signaling in the graft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takeuchi et al., 2021</xref>). Our study showed that, although CD47 cross-dressed on cells may bind CD47 ligands, the ligand engagement does not induce CD47 signaling to cause apoptosis. We found that ligation of hSIRPα-Fc proteins with autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 on Jurkat cells induces cell death. This study suggests that using a pig vascularized organ with hCD47 overexpression in some cells, which are more sensitive to macrophage attack but relatively resistant to CD47 signaling-induced deleterious effects, may improve the outcomes of xenotransplantation.</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates that CD47-SIRPα signaling plays an important role in regulating DC activation, and hence, T cell priming. The initial evidence for a role of CD47 in controlling DC activation was obtained in a mouse model of DST, in which DST using WT cells induces donor-specific tolerance, but DST using CD47-deficient cells paradoxically induces SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC activation and augments anti-donor T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). A similar finding was made in a mouse model of hepatocyte allotransplantation where WT hepatocytes promote allograft survival, but CD47KO hepatocytes exacerbated rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Although it was not tested directly, it is conceivable that CD47 cross-dressed on cells, which induces sufficient SIRPα signaling to inhibit macrophages, may suppress SIRPα<sup>+</sup> DC activation. Thus, in addition to inhibition of phagocytosis, CD47 cross-dressing may also attenuate anti-donor T cell responses when transplants are performed using CD47-overexpressing donors.</p><p>CD47-SIRPα signaling is an important component of the tumor immune microenvironment. CD47 upregulation was found in many types of cancer cells, in which CD47 provides an important mechanism to evade macrophage killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2009</xref>). CD47 upregulation in tumors also significantly contributes to tumor-induced T cell suppression, as the antitumor activity of CD47 blocking treatment is associated with CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC activation and is largely T cell-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, CD47 cross-dressing was found in human T-cell leukemia Jurkat and pig B-lymphoma LCL cells, suggesting a possible involvement of CD47 cross-dressing in the formation of a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. In addition, CD47 on EVs and CD47 cross-dressed on tumor cells may also neutralize CD47 ligands, such as TSP-1 that has been shown to induce CD47 activation leading to apoptosis in tumor and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martinez-Torres et al., 2015</xref>), hence, favoring tumor growth.</p><p>While the mechanisms of EV-mediated exchange of biological information and materials between cells remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Raposo and Stahl, 2019</xref>), EV-induced antigen cross-dressing has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of immune responses, including alloantigen recognition and allograft rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeng and Morelli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez-Nolasco et al., 2018</xref>). Earlier studies have shown that CD47, as a ‘don’t eat me’ signal, is essential for EVs to elicit biological function by preventing their clearance by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kamerkar et al., 2017</xref>). Here we report that EV-induced CD47 cross-dressing possesses partial activity of the autogenous CD47, such as the ability to initiate inhibitory SIRPα signaling, and therefore offers means of separating the desired and harmful effects of CD47.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Jurkat (J.RT3-T3.5) cell line was purchased from ATCC (named WT Jurkat to distinguish from CD47KO Jurkat cells) and the identity has been authenticated by STR profiling provided by China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC).

Congenic marker, cell tracker? 1C is the right way to do it as surface markers/ membrane stains can't be relied upon. The histograms may be misleading as the shifted curves can include both the acceptor cells that capture CD47h and donor cells that had reduced CD47h. 1D: It's not possible to say that it's fully SIRP-a independent as the increase in the CD47 cross-dressing looks more modest compared to 1-A,B,C. However, this may be due to an intrinsic difference between the starting levels of CD47 on tg LCL and PAOC. Yet, this reviewer recommends changing the statement at line 131 as such: &quot;…., indicating that hCD47 cross-dressing can occur in a SIRPα-independent manner.&quot;</p><p>2) Figure 2</p><p>In Figure 2 Please address labelling and gating the cells in the coculture (see comments 1c).</p><p>3) Figure 3</p><p>The titration of EVs/Exos should be performed to highlight the efficiency of the cross-dressing process.</p><p>The yield of EV/Exos production is explained in order to get an idea if the concentration/quantity of EVs correspond to a reasonable amount of cells and how this number compares to the number of cross-dressed &quot;recipient&quot; cells.</p><p>Does membrane acquisition upon EV/Exos involve membrane fusion?</p><p>(this can be addressed using fluorescent membrane probes).</p><p>In Figure 3C: Why did the authors cocultured cells for 18 and 42 hours?

Specifically, they need to quantify 'cross-dressing' by non-phagocytic cells that express a suitable hSIRPa in the presence or absence of SIRPa blocking Ab.</p><p>7) While Figure S5 nicely shows that SIRPa-Fc causes apoptosis on the cells that express CD47 in a dose-dependent manner, the actual Figure 5 fails to support the claim that EV-based crossdressing protects the cells from apoptosis. Crossdressing doesn't seem to cause a notable increase in hCD47 expression on R1 cells, so the difference in apoptosis between R1 and R2 is likely due to the comparably low expression of CD47 in R1 despite the EV treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73677.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1</p><p>The rationale for the use of CD47 isoforms 2 and 4 requires further detail a full explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>There are 4 alternatively spliced CD47 isoforms that differ from each other at their intracytoplasmic carboxy termini (Reinhold et al., 1995). Among these isoforms, isoform 2 is most widely expressed in all cells, including both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells, and isoform 4 is the isoform with longest intracellular domain. Because the difference among 4 CD47 isoforms is at the intracytoplasmic carboxy termini, these isoforms are all capable of interacting with SIRPα to inhibit phagocytosis. The purpose to test two isoforms was to rule out the possibility that our findings are isoform-specific, and choosing isoforms 2 and 4 were because of their relatively unique features (most wide expression for isoform 2 and longest intracytoplasmic tail for isoform 4), and both were used for making transgenic expression of human CD47 to prevent rejection (Ide et al., 2007, Hosny et al., 2021). We have now pointed this in the revised manuscript (in the Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide kinetics or the dynamic of CD47 acquisition in recipient cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The data presented in the previous manuscript (Figure 3A and 3B) showed that the level of CD47 cross-dressing on recipient cells remained unchanged from 2 to 6 hours. New experiments were performed to further determine the kinetics of CD47 acquisition, in which pig LCL cells were cultured with EVs from hCD47-transgenic LCL cells or WT Jurkat cells. We found that the process of CD47 cross-dressing is fast, significant CD47 acquisition was detected 1 hour, and the levels remained stable or increased at 24 hours after culturing with EVs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is cross-dressing blocked at 4deg?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed a new experiment to compare CD47 crossdressing on pig LCL cells that were incubated with EVs of hCD47-LCL cells at 37°C or 4°C, and the results showed clearly that CD47 cross-dressing was significantly blocked at 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>CD47 cross-dressing is significantly blocked at 4 °C.

We found that CD47 cross-dressing was clearly detected on cells pre-treated with Cytochalasin D, but to lower levels compared to untreated cells. The results indicate that a functional cytoskeleton is not absolutely required for, but may facilitate CD47 cross-dressing. We have now presented these new data in the revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do other membrane proteins get transferred as well or is it a peculiarity of CD47h2/h4 to be embedded in cross-dressing vesicles released from donor cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Other membrane proteins on EVs should be detected on recipient cells cross-dressed by EVs, and it is unlikely that EVs express only CD47. In support of this possibility, our new data showed that, not only hCD47, but also hCD45, hCD90 and HLA-ABC proteins were detected on pig LCL cells after incubated with WT Jurkat cells. We have now pointed this out in the revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does cross-dressed CD47 resist to EDTA washes (one might anticipate that tethered CD47 would not resist while CD47 actually transferred by membrane fusion would)?</p></disp-quote><p>New experiments were performed to address this question, in which donor and recipient cells that were labeled with different fluorescence dyes and cultured for 24 hours, following by washing with PBS buffer or PBS buffer containing trypsin/EDTA, then analyzed gated recipient cells for fluorescence acquired from the donor cells. We found that treatment with trypsin/EDTA did not reduce the fluorescence intensity, indicating that membrane fusion is involved in CD47 cross-dressing. We have now included these data and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the persistence of crossdressed CD47 on recipient cells (post-separation from donor cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, CD47-transgenic LCL or WT Jurkat cells were labeled with PHK26 and co-cultured with PKH67 labeled pig LCL cells for 1 day, then recipient cells (PKH67+) are sorted and treated with mitomycin C (2ug/ml) for 30min (to prevent dilution of cross-dressed proteins by cell division), and cultured in media to determine the persistence of cross-dressed hCD47. Although the level (MFI) of hCD47 on recipient LCL cells gradually decreased, &gt;50% remained 3 days after culturing, indicating that CD47 cross-dressing is quite stable and may persist for several days. We have now pointed this out in the revised manuscript (Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) i) Why &quot;ligation of the autogenous, but not cross-dressed, CD47 induced cell death.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Autogenous CD47 contains transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains that are required for transferring death signals. Although this study does not tell the structure of hCD47 cross-dressed on the recipient cells, the failure of cross-dressed CD47 to induce apoptosis indicates that cross-dressed CD47 cannot effectively deliver the intracytoplasmic signaling, leading to activation of apoptotic signal cascades.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Please show the extracellular vesicles and/or exosomes, do or do not transfer hCD47 mRNA or even DNA (e.g. plasmid, even episomal).</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed and found that the EVs contain hCD47 DNA and RNA, as well as housekeeping gene GAPDH RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Although we do not have direct evidence, these data suggest that DNA and RNA within EVs might also be transferred to the recipient cells. Indeed, unlike protein delivery that can be tracked by fluorescent dye labeling, progress on understanding DNA and RNA cargo delivery by EVs has been hampered by the lack of efficient and specific tracking methods(O’Brien et al., 2020). We agree that elucidating this issue, including the efficacy of DNA and RNA transfer, their persistence and functional significance, will be helpful in understanding the insights into EV cross-dressing, and would like to perform these studies in the future. Nonetheless, colocalization of CD47 staining and cell-tracker dye fluorescence on the recipient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>) confirmed that the majority of CD47 on the recipient cells were cross-dressed CD47 proteins and not derived from DNA or RNA cargo conveyed in EVs.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>EVs from pig LCL/CD47<sup>p/h</sup> cells contain both hCD47 DNA and RNA, and GAPDH RNA.</title><p>DNA and total RNA are extracted from hCD47 transgenic pig LCL and their MVs, and WT pig LCL cells respectively, then cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a reverse transcription kit, and hCD47 and GAPDH sequences are amplified by PCR.

However, different patterns were seen in some experiments (Figure 1E; Figure 3). While we do not fully understand the reasons, the difference may possibly be due to variable hCD47 on the donor cells for the experiment in Figure 1E, in which primary hCD47-tg pig BM cells that express highly variable levels of hCD47 were used as the donor cells; and for the experiments shown in Figure 3, insufficient EVs or Exos in cultures might be attributable to it. Furthermore, functional heterogeneity in proliferation and senescence may also affect the efficacy of crossdressing. Nonetheless, we agree that the level of CD47 cross-dressing should have an impact on the degree of protection against phagocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) Show whether &quot;florescence Celltrace violet&quot; transfers from labelled cells to unlabeled cells (Figure 1c).</p></disp-quote><p>It is expected that fluorescence dye that labeling membrane proteins should also be transferred with EVs from labeled cells to unlabeled cells, but it was difficult to see it in Figure 1C, in which no negative controls (i.e., uncultured cells) were analyzed at the same time. To clarify this, we performed a new experiment, in which we used the cells that were mixed before flow cytometry analysis as the negative control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>, fluorescence dye transfer was clearly detected in co-cultured cells compared to the controls (i.e., a mixture of labeled and unlabeled cells that were mixed before flow cytometric analysis), but the labeled cells could be easily separated from cross-dressed unlabeled cells on flow cytometric plots. In these experiments, we also stained the cells with anti-hCD47 antibody, and the results confirmed that both fluorescence dye and anti-hCD47 staining can clearly separate the donor cells from cross-dressed recipient cells, and the results obtained by these methods are identical (this also address the reviewer’s comment #1c below). Furthermore, anti-CD47 staining and fluorescence dye used are in different channels (i.e., different colors), so fluorescence dye-crossdressing is not a confounding factor for the experiments in which cells were also stained by anti-hCD47 antibody.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Florescence dye cross-dressing.</title><p>PKH26-labeled hCD47-LCL (A) or PKH26labeled WT Jurkat (B) as donor cells were co-cultured, respectively, with PKH67-labeled pig LCL for 24h, and then analyzed for fluorescent dye cross-dressing by flow cytometry using anti-hCD47AF647 mAb.

In Figure 1A, the donor cells were PAOCs that were genetically modified to express hCD47 isoform 2 (i.e., expressed both pig and human isoform 2 CD47 and referred to as PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h2</sup>) or isoform 4 (i.e., i.e., expressed both pig and human isoform 4 CD47 and referred to as PAOC/CD47<sup>p/h4</sup>). However, in Figure 1B, the donor cells were CD47defficient PAOC (PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup>) cells that were genetically modified to express transgenic hCD47 isoform 2 (PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup>) or isoform 4 (PAOC/CD47<sup>h4</sup>), which express only human CD47 (isoform 2 or isoform 4) but no pig CD47. It is perceivable that different transgenic cell lines may express different levels of the transgene. Indeed, the results for each cell line were considerably stable throughout the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In Figure 1A-B: How did the authors gate on the PAOCp in the coculture?

As we discussed in the manuscript (line 106-112 in the revised manuscript), “To rule out the possibility that, during the co-culture, the CD47<sup>null</sup> cells did not become CD47+, but PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> cells reduced hCD47 expression, we labeled PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup> (Figure 1C, top) or PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> (Figure 1C, bottom) cells with florescence Celltrace violet, and then cocultured the labeled cells with unlabeled PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> or PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup> cells, respectively. This experiment, in which fluorescence-labeling allowed for better distinguishing between the two cell populations in the cocultures, further confirmed that PAOC/CD47<sup>null</sup> cells can be cross-dressed by CD47 after coculture with PAOC/CD47<sup>h2</sup> cells (Figure 1C).” The results from the experiment in Figure 1C confirmed that PAOC<sup>null</sup> and PAOC<sup>h2/h4</sup> cells can be clearly separated by anti-hCD47 antibody staining. This conclusion is also supported by the results of our new experiments that were performed to address the reviewer’s comments on fluorescence dye transfer (Comment #1b-iv).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data cannot rule out the possibility of SIRPα-mediated crossdressing, and therefore, as the reviewer suggested, revised our statement to “Although we cannot rule out of the role of SIRPα in hCD47 cross-dressing, our data indicate that hCD47 cross-dressing can occur in a SIRPα-independent manner” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2</p><p>In Figure 2 Please address labelling and gating the cells in the coculture (see comments 1c).</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiments shown in Figure 2, CD47KO Jurkat and pig LCL recipient cells were gated by anti-hCD47 staining.

In our study, we used a simple centrifugation method to prepare EVs and Exos, which may not efficiently recover entire and pure EVs or Exos, so the results may not be very helpful in addressing the reviewer’s question. However, in the cell co-culture experiments, the donor to recipient cell ratios ranged from 1:1 to 1:3, which are considered reasonable and can be expected to occur in real in vivo situation, as for both organ/cell transplantation and cancer conditions, the numbers of graft- or tumor-infiltrating recipient cells are expected to be less than the numbers of graft or tumor cells. Thus, our results are of clinical significance.</p><p>The results of our new experiments indicate that membrane fusion is involved in membrane acquisition of EVs/Exos. We found that treatment with Trypsin/EDTA did not reduce crossdressed fluorescence dye in the recipient cells. We have now included these new data and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3C: Why did the authors cocultured cells for 18 and 42 hours?

We found that EV acquisition by POAC cells is slower than Jurkat and LCL cells, assumably due to their different properties (for example the adherent property) and therefore, these cells were cultured for a longer period than Jurkat and LCL cells. The relatively lower hCD47 staining at 42 hours than 18 hours may be, at least partially, attributed to dilution by cell proliferation, as pointed out by the reviewer. Nonetheless, hCD47 cross-dressing was clearly detected in POAC cells in our experiments, and the data support our conclusion.

In this experiment, two types of cells were cocultured for only 1h in the presence of SIRPa-Fc proteins, so there should be very minimal cross-dressing during the culture period. For determining whether hCD47+ EV cross-dressing may induce apoptosis, CD47KO cells were pre-exposed to hCD47+ EVs before mixed with WT cells for induction of apoptosis by SIRPa-Fc (Figure 5E, 5F) and the results showed that CD47 cross-dressing does not transmit death signaling induced by SIRPα-Fc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Complementation of CD47ko clones with CD47 would provide a nice control ruling out possible artefacts of CRISPR targeting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestion. To address this comment, we transfected CD47KO Jurkat cells with CD47, and found that CD47KO Jurkat cells transfected with CD47 became susceptible to apoptosis induced by SIRPα-Fc.

In our study, hCD47 cross-dressing occurred in cells that do not express SIRPα, indicating cross-dressing can occur independent of SIRPα. However, our data cannot rule out the role of SIRPα in hCD47 crossdressing, and therefore, we have revised our statement of &quot;hCD47 cross-dressing is SIRPαindependent&quot; to “hCD47 cross-dressing can occur in a SIRPα-independent manner.&quot; (Please refer to our response to a similar comment raised by another reviewer (see Comment #1c above)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) While Figure S5 nicely shows that SIRPa-Fc causes apoptosis on the cells that express CD47 in a dose-dependent manner, the actual Figure 5 fails to support the claim that EV-based crossdressing protects the cells from apoptosis. Crossdressing doesn't seem to cause a notable increase in hCD47 expression on R1 cells, so the difference in apoptosis between R1 and R2 is likely due to the comparably low expression of CD47 in R1 despite the EV treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>As we explained in the manuscript that the low staining of hCD47 in Figure 5 was due to the fact that prior incubation with hSIRPα-Fc proteins can block subsequent staining by antihCD47 mAb (data are presented in the previous Figure S5, which is Figure 5—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). Please see page 15 of the manuscript, where we point out that “Of note, binding of hSIRPα-Fc proteins to cell surface CD47 (either native or cross-dressed) could block subsequent staining with anti-hCD47 antibodies and thus, the cells cultured with hSIRPα-Fc showed relatively lower hCD47 staining than those cultured without (previous Figure S5, which is Figure 5—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript, Figure 5).” Data in Figure 4A also showed that EV treatment resulted in a significant hCD47 cross-dressing.</p><p>References</p><p>Hosny, N., Matson, A.
