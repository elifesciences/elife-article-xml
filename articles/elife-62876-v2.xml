form an immunological synapse, rapid dynein-driven translocation of the centrosome toward the contact site leads to reorganization of microtubules and associated organelles. Currently, little is known about how the regulation of microtubule dynamics contributes to this process. Here, we show that the knockout of KIF21B, a kinesin-4 linked to autoimmune disorders, causes microtubule overgrowth and perturbs centrosome translocation. KIF21B restricts microtubule length by inducing microtubule pausing typically followed by catastrophe. Catastrophe induction with vinblastine prevented microtubule overgrowth and was sufficient to rescue centrosome polarization in KIF21B-knockout cells. Biophysical simulations showed that a relatively small number of KIF21B molecules can restrict mirotubule length and promote an imbalance of dynein-mediated pulling forces that allows the centrosome to translocate past the nucleus. We conclude that proper control of microtubule length is important for allowing rapid remodeling of the cytoskeleton and efficient T cell polarization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system is composed of many types of cells that can recognize foreign molecules and pathogens so they can eliminate them. When cells in the body become infected with a pathogen, they can process the pathogen’s proteins and present them on their own surface. Specialized immune cells can then recognize infected cells and interact with them, forming an ‘immunological synapse’. These synapses play an important role in immune response: they activate the immune system and allow it to kill harmful cells.</p><p>To form an immunological synapse, an immune cell must reorganize its internal contents, including an aster-shaped scaffold made of tiny protein tubes called microtubules. The center of this scaffold moves towards the immunological synapse as it forms. This re-orientation of the microtubules towards the immunological synapse is known as 'polarization' and it happens very rapidly, but it is not yet clear how it works.</p><p>One molecule involved in the polarization process is called KIF21B, a protein that can walk along microtubules, building up at the ends and affecting their growth. Whether KIF21B makes microtubules grow more quickly, or more slowly, is a matter of debate, and the impact microtubule length has on immunological synapse formation is unknown.</p><p>Here, Hooikaas, Damstra et al. deleted the gene for KIF21B from human immune cells called T cells to find out how it affected their ability to form an immunological synapse. Without KIF21B, the T cells grew microtubules that were longer than normal, and had trouble forming immunological synapses. When the T cells were treated with a drug that stops microtubule growth, their ability to form immunological synapses was restored, suggesting a role for KIF21B. To explore this further, Hooikaas, Damstra et al. replaced the missing KIF21B gene with a gene that coded for a version of the protein that could be seen using microscopy. This revealed that, when KIF21B reaches the ends of microtubules, it stops their growth and triggers their disassembly. Computational modelling showed that cells find it hard to reorient their microtubule scaffolding when the individual tubes are too long. It only takes a small number of KIF21B molecules to shorten the microtubules enough to allow the center of the scaffold to move.</p><p>Research has linked the KIF21B gene to autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis. Microtubules also play an important role in cell division, a critical process driving all types of cancer. Drugs that affect microtubule growth are already available, and a deeper understanding of KIF21B and microtubule regulation in immune cells could help to improve treatments in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>immunological synapse</kwd><kwd>polarization</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>609822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>819219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapitein</surname><given-names>Lukas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>824.15.017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhmanova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kinesin-4 KIF21B promotes rapid reorientation of the microtubule network during formation of immunological synapse in T cells by acting as a pausing and catastrophe-inducing factor that keeps microtubules short.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Large-scale reorganization of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is essential for a variety of processes, such as cell division, differentiation and polarization. In dividing cells, a balance of dynein-dependent pulling forces and MT pushing forces determines the positioning of the MT-based mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howard and Garzon-Coral, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kotak and Gönczy, 2013</xref>). In interphase cells with dense, non-centrosomal MT arrays, such as epithelial or neuronal cells, polarization is a slow process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, interphase cells with sparse centrosome-based networks can rapidly switch polarity and reposition their MTs. For example, when a T cell encounters an antigen-presenting cell (APC), it translocates its centrosome and associated MTs toward the APC-contact side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geiger et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kupfer et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yi et al., 2013</xref>) and forms an immunological synapse (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dustin et al., 2010</xref>), a highly specialized compartment encircled by an actin-rich ring. The immunological synapse facilitates T-cell signaling and polarized secretion of cytokines or lytic molecules toward the APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The process of centrosome repositioning takes only a few minutes and is driven by membrane-associated dynein that pulls MTs with the attached centrosome toward the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Combs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martín-Cófreces et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nath et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immunological synapse formation is impaired in KIF21B-KO Jurkat T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Schematic representation of T cells forming an immunological synapse upon target recognition.

Among them, MT-associated protein MAP4 was shown to be required for centrosome translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bustos-Morán et al., 2017</xref>), potentially due to its ability to regulate dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Samora et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Semenova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seo et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, both acetylation and detyrosination of MTs and a complex of casein kinase Iδ with EB1 were suggested to be important for efficient centrosome polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrés-Delgado et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Serrador et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zyss et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, a study describing the knockout of stathmin/OP18, a MT-destabilizing protein, in mouse cytotoxic T cells showed decreased centrosome polarization efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Filbert et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, how these cytoskeletal perturbations affect the MT network of T cells as a whole and how this would consequently hinder centrosome translocation is poorly understood.</p><p>An interesting candidate to regulate MT dynamics in immune cells is kinesin-4 KIF21B.

At the cellular level, KIF21B has been reported to be a processive kinesin involved in neuronal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gromova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Labonté et al., 2014</xref>) and Rac1 inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morikawa et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, similar to all other kinesin-4 family members, KIF21B acts as a MT growth regulator both in vitro and in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muhia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). However, the activity of this kinesin is a matter of controversy, because one study reported that it acts as a positive regulator of MT dynamicity by increasing MT growth rate and catastrophe frequency; in these assays, KIF21B was present at relatively high concentrations (50–300 nM) and was mainly observed to bind to depolymerizing MT ends and lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, our own work showed that KIF21B walks to MT plus ends where it slows down MT growth and potently induces MT pausing already at low nanomolar concentrations, with only one or two KIF21B molecules being sufficient to block elongation of a MT plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). Somewhat conflicting results have also been reported on the effects of the loss of KIF21B on MT plus-end growth in neurons: two different studies found opposite effects on MT growth rates, although they agreed that KIF21B reduces MT growth processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muhia et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, further analyses of KIF21B behavior and function are required to elucidate its role in regulating MT dynamics.</p><p>Here, we have investigated the role of KIF21B in regulating MT organization and dynamics in T cells. We generated KIF21B knockout (KIF21B-KO) Jurkat T cell lines, which displayed defects during immunological synapse formation, particularly in translocating their centrosome toward the synapse. These defects were rescued by KIF21B-GFP re-expression, and live-cell imaging of single KIF21B-GFP motors showed that they walked to MT plus ends and often induced MT pausing followed by depolymerization, very similar to our previous in vitro observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). Using expansion microscopy, we visualized three-dimensional MT organization in Jurkat T cells and found that MTs were longer in KIF21B-KO cells. Interestingly, we could rescue centrosome polarization defects in KIF21B-KO cells by mildly increasing MT catastrophe frequency with a low dose of vinblastine, a MT-depolymerizing drug. These results were recapitulated in a two-dimensional computational model demonstrating that long MTs impaired centrosome polarization by altering the balance of dynein-driven pulling forcing in a way that prevents symmetry breaking, which could be restored by introducing more frequent catastrophes that limit MT length. We conclude that proper control of MT growth plays a critical role in T cell polarization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KIF21B knockout T cells are defective in centrosome polarization after activation</title><p>To study MT reorganization during immune synapse formation, we used Jurkat T lymphocyte cells. We mimicked in vivo T-cell activation by exposing these cells to anti-CD3 coated surfaces, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunnell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Parsey and Lewis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We confirmed KIF21B protein expression in these cells by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology we generated KIF21B knockout cells and selected two clones (#1 and #2) that were analyzed further. To perform rescue experiments, these two knockout cell lines were infected with a lentivirus expressing full-length KIF21B-GFP and the obtained polyclonal cell lines were sorted for GFP-positive cells and analyzed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). KIF21B expression was lost in both knockout lines, whereas KIF21B-GFP expression mildly exceeded endogenous KIF21B. Expression of α-tubulin was not affected in these lines. In addition, we established that these Jurkat T cell lines were responsive to stimulus by first confirming the presence of CD3ε, a subunit of the T cell receptor (TCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we stimulated control and KIF21B-KO cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, which increase the downstream intermediates of TCR signaling, protein kinase C activity, and intracellular calcium levels, respectively. This stimulation regime upregulates Interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA expression, a hallmark of T cell activation, and we found that our knockout cell lines responded similarly to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>To monitor immunological synapse formation, we added Jurkat cells to anti-CD3 coated coverslips, fixed the cells 10 min later and stained them with phalloidin to visualize the peripheral actin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). We measured synapse size and noticed that KIF21B-KO cell lines formed 28.4% (KO #1) and 27.3% (KO #2) smaller synapses compared to control cells and that this phenotype could be partially rescued by re-expression of KIF21B-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The reduction in the size of immunological synapses in KIF21B-KO cells was not due to smaller overall size of these cells, as their volume was the same as that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Live-cell imaging using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy showed that synapse formation was slower in KIF21B-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the overall MT organization in these cells by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, which visualizes a thin optical section located above the coverslip. In fully polarized cells, the centrosome-centered MT aster was visible in the TIRF focal plane, whereas in cells that failed to polarize properly, the centrosome was not visible by TIRF, and MTs located in the vicinity of the coverslip appeared disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In this experiment, the centrosome was located in the plane of the synapse in the majority of control (76%) and KIF21B-GFP-expressing cells (74.3% and 63.3%), whereas this was the case only in 45.5% (KO #1) and 43.6% (KO #2) of KIF21B-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>During T cell activation, lysosomes cluster around the centrosome and relocate together with it toward the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Immunostaining of non-activated Jurkat cells on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips showed that lysosomes were scattered throughout the cytoplasm. We note that although it has been reported that cationic surfaces are sufficient to initiate T cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santos et al., 2018</xref>), in our hands, exposure to poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips did not trigger centrosome polarization or lysosome clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H,I</xref>). In contrast, after activation on anti-CD3-coated coverslips, both control and knockout cells showed lysosome clustering, indicating that KIF21B knockout does not affect the minus-end-directed transport of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). We then analyzed the position of the lysosome cluster relative to the coverslip using z-projections of these cells and found that only 52.4% KIF21B-KO #1% and 50.4% KIF21B-KO #2 cells contained a polarized lysosome cluster compared to 71% of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Again, we could rescue this phenotype by re-expressing KIF21B-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J,K</xref>). These data suggest that KIF21B-KO Jurkat cells exhibit defects in immunological synapse formation: they are less efficient in polarizing their centrosome and the associated lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MT organization is altered in KIF21B knockout T cells</title><p>We next examined the organization of the MT network of control and KIF21B-KO T cells in more detail using Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy.

With ExM, samples are physically magnified by embedding fixed cells in a isotropically swellable polymer, giving an approximate 4.5x-fold increase in resolution in x, y, and z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jurriens et al., 2020</xref>). To understand how the state of the MT network before T cell activation may affect centrosome translocation, we looked at the very early stage of immunological synapse formation. T cells were fixed after 2 min of activation, when the majority of control cells did not yet fully polarize. We noticed that the MT network appeared to be denser in KIF21B-KO cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). To exclude that this was caused by increased levels of MT nucleation, we counted the number of MTs originating from the centrosome by analyzing the number of filaments passing through a 1-µm-thick spherical shell with an inner radius of 5 µm generated around the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">3</xref>). We found that MT number was slightly reduced in KIF21B-KO cells, by 21.7% in KO #1% and 19% in KO #2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Since T cells have highly centrosome-focused MT arrays, we assumed that all MTs are anchored to the centrosome and that these numbers thus represent the total number of MTs per cell. Next, we estimated an average MT length per cell. We generated surface masks based on the colocalization of the MTs and the 1-µm-thick spherical shell around the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, red surfaces). Since MTs cross through the shell orthogonally to its surface, the mean intensity corresponding to 1 µm MT was determined by averaging the fluorescence intensity per surface adjusted for the number of MTs in each surface. We then used a surface mask to determine the total fluorescence intensity corresponding to the complete MT network and divided it by the MT intensity per micron and by the number of MTs. We found that KIF21B-KO cells contain fewer MTs but they are on average longer than those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Since the overall MT mass is higher in KIF21B-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), the concentration of free tubulin in these cells might be lower; this would affect MT nucleation at the centrosome, causing a reduction in MT number.</p><p>We furthermore examined the geometry of MTs in polarizing control and KIF21B-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Considering the immunological synapse as the basal side of the cell, with nucleus located above it, the centrosome could be positioned on top or on the side of the nucleus, or between the nucleus and the synapse. In agreement with the previously described observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yi et al., 2013</xref>), a MT bundle directed from the centrosome to the synapse (‘stalk’) could be found in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We note that it was not obvious from our images that all MTs in such a stalk terminated at synapse; rather it appeared that many of them made side contacts with the membrane. In other cases, a single basally directed MT bundle could not be distinguished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), possibly because these cells were at an earlier stage of centrosome polarization. In cells with apically located centrosomes, MTs appeared to embrace the nucleus from all sides and then make lateral contacts with the synapse surface. In KIF21B-KO cells, such MTs formed a dense network in the basal half of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, T cells that lack KIF21B show MT overgrowth at the immunological synapse.

We imaged dual chamber slides that contained purified monomeric GFP in one chamber and activated KIF21B-GFP-expressing T cells in the other chamber. Intracellular KIF21B-GFP motors were detected using DoM software (see Materials and methods for details) and the detected signals were filtered for molecules belonging to tracks ≥ 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that their signal was ~1.5 times brighter than that of monomeric GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that the evanescent field used for excitation decays exponentially and the KIF21B-GFP motors observed were localized intracellularly, one should take into account the distance between the coverslip and fluorescent molecules. Although we could not measure this distance precisely, we assumed that the thickness of the plasma membrane, cortical actin, cytoplasm and the 25 nm width of a MT would result, on average, in at least 50 nm spacing. Given the penetration depth <italic>d</italic> in these imaged cells was calibrated at 180 nm, we estimated that the corrected the KIF21B-GFP fluorescence signal intensity was ~2 times brighter than that of monomeric GFP (~1.8 times assuming 50 nm distance from the coverslip or ~2.1 times assuming 75 nm distance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Most of the motile KIF21B-GFP puncta in Jurkat cells thus likely corresponded to single kinesin dimers, which did not form any clear accumulations.</p><p>Our previous in vitro work showed that single KIF21B molecules walked toward a growing plus end and induced transient pauses ultimately followed by a catastrophe, whereas multiple KIF21B molecules accumulated at a MT plus end induced prolonged pauses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, we asked whether KIF21B behaves similarly in T cells to regulate MT dynamics. To observe the interactions of KIF21B-GFP with MT plus ends in Jurkat cells, we transfected them with EB3-mCherry, which labels growing MT ends and shows some MT lattice decoration, and imaged these cells on a TIRF microscope. We traced processive KIF21B-GFP motors and quantified events where the motor reached the tip of an EB3-mCherry comet. Most of KIF21B-GFP molecules (56.7%) transitioned to a paused state upon reaching the plus end; some motors (29.5%) dissociated from the MT and in a few cases KIF21B tracked the MT tip and then either transitioned to a paused state (9.8%) or dissociated from the MT (4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>). It should be noted that even in cases where KIF21B motor rapidly dissociated from the MT tip, we sometimes could observe a reduction in EB3 comet intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting a transient MT growth perturbation. A pausing KIF21B-GFP motor typically did affect MT plus-end growth, and the events where a MT first paused and ultimately switched to depolymerization were most frequent (55.7%). In other cases, a MT first paused but then switched back to growth after the paused KIF21B-GFP motor dissociated from the plus end (19.5%). In a few cases (9.4%), a growing plus end kept growing after a KIF21B-GFP motor transitioned to pausing; often, such events coincided with a reduced EB3 comet intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,G,H</xref>). On average, KIF21B-GFP motors were paused for 3.0 ± 2.7 s (mean ± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), whereas MT plus-end pause durations measured with EB3-mCherry were somewhat longer, 4.2 ± 4.4 s (mean ± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). This can be explained either by photobleaching of the GFP or by participation of additional cellular factors that could stabilize paused MT ends after KIF21B dissociates. In some cases, growing MT plus end appeared to be static; these events likely corresponded to MTs growing against an obstacle, where MT tip remained stationary while the growing MT shaft buckled and formed a loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Events where KIF21B-GFP directly dissociated from a MT end upon arrival affected the growing MT plus end much less compared to KIF21B-GFP pausing events; only a few of such events coincided with the initiation of a MT pause or a direct catastrophe event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). All these data represent events where KIF21B-GFP was observed to arrive to the MT tip by walking along the MT shaft. We also occasionally observed events where KIF21B-GFP directly bound to the MT plus end and affected MT growth, but such events were infrequent and were therefore were not quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We conclude that KIF21B is a fast and processive kinesin in T cells and that its activity at the plus ends limits growth by inducing MT pausing and catastrophes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MTs grow faster and more processively in cells lacking KIF21B</title><p>Since we directly observed MT growth perturbation by KIF21B-GFP, we next set out to perform a more global analysis of MT plus-end dynamics in Jurkat cells either expressing or lacking this motor. To this end, we used lentiviral transduction to introduce EB3-GFP as a MT plus-end marker into control and KIF21B-KO cell lines. We used these cells for live imaging of growing MT plus ends in cells that were polarized after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that the MT growth rate was on average increased by 18% (KO #1) and 15% (KO #2) compared to control Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). These observations were in line with previous work showing that overexpression of KIF21B-GFP in COS-7 cells, which do not have endogenous KIF21B, reduced MT growth rates by ~1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). These data are also consistent with the observation of increased MT growth rate after transient KIF21B depletion in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>), but contradict the analysis of MT growth speed in <italic>Kif21b</italic> knockout neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muhia et al., 2016</xref>).

These cells were imaged on a TIRF microscope, and we quantified events where the plus end of a radially growing MT reached the cell periphery. In control cells, a small minority (9.8%) of MTs underwent a catastrophe or continued to grow by sliding along the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). However, most MTs paused in this region (44.2%) or continued their growth and this led to MT buckling, because the MT plus end remained stationary, whereas the increasingly long MT shaft was pushed backwards and formed a loop (40.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). In KIF21B-KO cells, MTs displayed less pausing at the cell periphery, whereas buckling became more frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). A closer examination of MT pauses revealed that these events in control cells were significantly more long-lived: 8.3 ± 5.6 s (mean ± SD) compared to those in KIF21B-KO cells: 4.1 ± 2.2 s (KO #1, mean ± SD) and 4.3 ± 2.4 s (KO #2, mean ± SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We note that these pause durations are longer than those observed with EB3-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), because the latter labels growing MTs, and its signal is gradually lost when MT plus ends switch to pausing and lose the GTP cap that EB3 labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roostalu et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, these data indicate that in T cells, KIF21B acts as a factor that inhibits MT growth and induces pausing and catastrophes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>MT growth inhibition with vinblastine rescues the defects in KIF21B knockout cells</title><p>To establish a causal connection between MT overgrowth and defects in immune synapse formation, we sought for a way to mildly inhibit MT growth in KIF21B-KO cells. Our previous work has shown that a low dose of vinblastine mildly perturbs growth and promotes catastrophes but does not induce MT depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouchet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mohan et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, at a low (0.5 nM) vinblastine concentration, MT network was preserved and was similar to that in control cells but different from KIF21B-KO cells, as no circular MT bundles were present at the cell periphery (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). MT organization in KIF21B-KO cells treated with 0.5 nM vinblastine was similar to that of KIF21B-KO cells rescued with KIF21B-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In vinblastine-treated KIF21B-KO cells, MT growth events visualized with EB3-GFP were less continuous, and the growth rates were reduced approximately to the level seen in control Jurkat cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). We also examined the effect of 0.5 nM vinblastine on the dynamics of MTs labeled with GFP-β-tubulin and found that vinblastine application resulted in an increased catastrophe frequency, while long-lived MT pauses were not restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether such a mild vinblastine-induced MT growth inhibition would rescue the ability of the KIF21B-KO cells to polarize their centrosome. Jurkat cells were added to anti-CD3-coated coverslips and stained for CEP135, a centriole marker, to analyze polarization using z-projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We scored polarization events as successful when the centrosome was located within 2 µm from the coverslip and found that most control cells (87.2%) were polarized, contrary to knockout cells (36.7% and 42.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This phenotype could be partially rescued by reexpressing KIF21B-GFP in these cells (58.9% and 51.7%), and an even slightly better rescue was observed after applying 0.5 nM vinblastine to both KIF21B-KO cell lines (65.4% and 66.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Altogether, we found that KIF21B depletion alters MT growth dynamics and that centrosome polarization defects in KIF21B-depleted cells can be rescued by the application of a drug, vinblastine, that inhibits MT growth. This indicates that cell polarization defects caused by the absence of KIF21B are due to its effect on MT dynamics rather than potential perturbation of transport or signaling processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Biophysical simulation of MT dynamics suggests that a small number of KIF21B molecules can limit MT overgrowth</title><p>To gain more insight into the regulatory effects of KIF21B and to explore possible mechanisms explaining how overly long MTs hinder centrosome polarization, we constructed a biophysical model based on <italic>Cytosim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nedelec and Foethke, 2007</xref>).

The exponential fit (rate = mean pause time<sup>−1</sup>) corresponds to a catastrophe rate of 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup> in the KIF21B-KO and 0.15 s<sup>−1</sup> in the control. From the assumption that all pausing in the KIF21B-KO cells is from antagonistic force, the stalled catastrophe rate k<sub>cat,stall</sub> can be set to 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup>. From this rate follows a characteristic time of 3.33 s (shaded area). (<bold>B</bold>) To match the parametrization of the MT dynamics to the experimental data, a <italic>Cytosim</italic> model is introduced that describes the fully spread synapse for the KO condition. The space is meant to model the TIRF data of KIF21B-KO synapses after they have spread, thus the cell has a radius of 9.57 µm and no nucleus. For ease of measurement, the centrosome is fixed in the center of the cell. From the stalled catastrophe rate of 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup> follows that 63% of all catastrophe events happen in the first 3.33 s. From the experimental data, it is known that only approximately 30% of the counted paused KIF21B-KO MTs (under force) do not buckle or slide, but they are counted into the fraction of catastrophe events. Taking 30% of the 63% gives us 19%: the percentage of catastrophe in 3.33 s. Therefore, we can use the constraint that 81% of MTs survive under force for 3.33 s in our synapse model to match the two-state model to our KIF21B-KO pause times.

In the growth state, fibers elongate with a force-dependent growth speed. In the shrinkage state, fibers shorten with a constant shrinkage speed. The growth speed decreases exponentially with the force exerted on the fiber’s tip, termed antagonistic force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dogterom and Yurke, 1997</xref>). To describe the transition from growth to shrinkage, we distinguished two models: a basic ‘non-pausing’ model with a force-independent catastrophe rate, and a ‘KIF21B-pausing’ model with a force-dependent catastrophe rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janson et al., 2003</xref>) and KIF21B molecules that induce a paused state before the MT shrinks. To model control or KIF21B-KO cells, the number of KIF21B molecules can be changed. In our simulations, KIF21B motors freely diffuse in the cytosol, can bind to MTs and walk along them toward the plus end. When the motor arrives at a growing plus end, it pauses the MT dynamics until it unbinds. After a KIF21B motor has detached from the tip of a MT, the MT switches to the shrinkage state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>To estimate numerical values for the parameters describing MT dynamics in our system, we used the experimental data for the KIF21B-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). In this condition, it is reasonable to assume that every catastrophe and pause is triggered by force exerted on the MT tip, and not by KIF21B because it is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Additionally, the KIF21B-induced mean pause time of a MT tip was set to 8.3 s, as experimentally determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For the remaining parameters of our simulation that were unrelated to MT growth dynamics, we used numerical values found in the literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).</p><p>Simulations of the non-pausing model with the force-independent catastrophe rate implied that increasing the catastrophe rate decreased the mean length of the MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The mean MT length is a measure for MT density in the simulations, as we kept the cell volume and number of MTs constant. The mean MT length reached a steady state within 300 s and decreased more than threefold in the range of values for the catastrophe rate we chose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In the KIF21B-pausing model the fibers grew to a dense MT network in the absence of KIF21B with the force-dependent catastrophe rate matched to the KIF21B-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). When we added KIF21B motors to mimic the control condition, MT length decreased with an increasing number of KIF21B motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This decrease was approximately twofold between the KIF21B-KO-like and the control-like simulations between 0 and 10 KIF21B motors.</p><p>These simulations confirmed that by changing the catastrophe rate either directly or by explicitly modeling the behavior of the pause-inducing KIF21B motor, the average length of the MTs can be regulated.

They can bind to a MT in their vicinity and walk along them toward the centrosome. Their walking and unbinding dynamics were calculated in a force-dependent manner. Because dynein motors are anchored, walking along a MT generates a pulling force.

Some KIF21B-KO-like cells without KIF21B and some cells with a fixed catastrophe rate smaller than 0.03 s<sup>−1</sup> did not polarize at the end of the simulation (800 s modeled time that we simulated after the MT network reached steady state).</p><p>We next analyzed the relation between MT length and polarization dynamics in the KIF21B-pausing model, as this model describes our experimental data. Tracking the time evolution of the centrosome-synapse distance for multiple runs provided insight into the dynamics of centrosome translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The centrosomes of late polarizing cells did not travel more slowly, but rather were localized at the far opposite side of the synapse for most of the time. Once these centrosomes left this position, they quickly moved toward the synapse. This rapid polarization movement seemed independent of the number of KIF21B molecules. However, the trapped localization before the rapid repositioning indicated that the system can be relatively stable in an unpolarized state. This state can apparently be destabilized by decreasing MT length through an increasing number of KIF21B molecules.</p><p>For our simulated cells to successfully polarize, the centrosome must travel past the nucleus on either the left or the right side. A possible explanation for the stable unpolarized state may be that the forces that dynein exerts to the left and the right are equal, thus causing a mechanical equilibrium by force balance. To trigger polarization, this equilibrium needs to be broken. We quantified force imbalance by determining all forces exerted by dynein projected on the horizontal axis and sorting them according to their direction. We calculated the sum of forces pointing to the right and the sum of forces pointing to the left. For any timestep, the absolute difference of these two sums, normalized by the total sum of these forces indicates the force imbalance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, the non-normalized sum of force per timestep is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resulting data revealed that dynein forces were more balanced in the simulations with low KIF21B numbers and impaired polarization than in the simulations where the number of KIF21B molecules was high and polarization occurred rapidly.</p><p>To understand the underlying mechanism, we counted the number of MTs that pass the nucleus on either the right (MT<sub>R</sub>) or the left side (MT<sub>L</sub>) and are bound by dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We only assessed the first 10 s after initiation of polarization to limit the situation to a period when none of the runs are already actively polarizing. This analysis indicated that with increasing number of KIF21B molecules, the mean number of MTs bound on the left or on right decreases, while the difference between the two fractions averaged over time increases. Tracking this difference as a function of time indicated that it changed together with the centrosome position, and an increased fluctuation in this number seemed necessary to trigger polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Note that the dynamics of KIF21B together with the MTs and the spatial restriction by the nucleus can lead to enrichment of KIF21B on one side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This specific localization could increase the difference between the number of MTs on the left and right side of the nucleus that reach the synapse and enhance the force imbalance.</p><p>We conclude that by effectively increasing catastrophe frequency and restricting MT length, KIF21B reduces the overall number of MTs reaching the synapse from different sides of the nucleus. A smaller number of long MTs leads to larger fluctuations in the number of MTs coming from opposing sides, which enables the force asymmetry that is necessary to trigger polarization when the centrosome is positioned behind the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we set out to investigate which aspects of the regulation of MT organization and dynamics are important during the formation of the immunological synapse and elucidate the role of kinesin-4 KIF21B in this process. MTs are typically quite short and sparse in immune cells, and we found that this property is functionally important, as MT overgrowth inhibited efficient centrosome translocation to the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, our data strongly support the notion that KIF21B acts as a factor that prevents excessive MT elongation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Overview of the experimental results and a model of centrosome polarization in T cells.</title><p>Centrosome polarization in T cells is driven by dynein attached to the immunological synapse. KIF21B is a pausing and catastrophe-promoting factor that limits MT growth in T cells; its depletion results in MT overgrowth. Cells with overly long MTs experience difficulties in centrosome polarization. Reexpression of KIF21B-GFP or the application of a low-dose of MT-targeting agent vinblastine restores the centrosome polarization. Computational modeling suggests that an imbalance in MT pulling forces drives the centrosome movement along the nucleus. Overly long MTs create additional connections to the synapse, resulting in a balance of pulling forces on the two sides of the nucleus, thereby hindering centrosome translocation. Overly long MTs may also directly inhibit force generation by dynein at the synapse.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62876-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Previous in vitro studies reported contradictory results regarding the activity of KIF21B on MT ends. One study found that KIF21B promotes MT growth and catastrophe at relatively high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, our own work indicated that KIF21B transiently blocks MT elongation and induces subsequent catastrophes at low levels, when only one or two KIF21B molecules are present at the MT tip, and causes prolonged MT pausing when present at a higher concentration, when multiple KIF21B motors accumulate at the plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we showed that the function of KIF21B in knockout cells can be rescued by KIF21B-GFP expressed at levels that were mildly exceeding endogenous. Importantly, imaging of KIF21B-GFP in these cells did not reveal any clear accumulations of the motor at MT plus ends. KIF21B behavior in Jurkat T cells was very similar to that observed at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>): single KIF21B-GFP kinesin dimers walked processively along MTs, reached their ends and perturbed MT plus-end growth by triggering transient pauses followed by catastrophes. Therefore, we conclude that although biochemically KIF21B can be described as a MT pausing factor, in T cells, it acts at concentrations that are insufficient to induce prolonged pausing and effectively functions as a catastrophe inducer. This is likely explained by our previous observation that a single KIF21B-GFP molecule can arrest dynamics of a few protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Riel et al., 2017</xref>). Blocking of even one MT protofilament can already perturb growth of the remaining ones, and this can lead to the loss of the GTP cap and trigger catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doodhi et al., 2016</xref>). To induce a pause, blocking MT elongation must be accompanied by inhibition of depolymerization of protofilaments lacking a GTP cap. Since a single KIF21B dimer is unlikely to be able to stably block depolymerization of all MT protofilaments, a catastrophe eventually ensues.</p><p>While KIF21B is a potent MT regulator, it has also been implicated in other functions, such as MT-based transport and regulation of signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gromova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Labonté et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morikawa et al., 2018</xref>). While our study certainly does not exclude that KIF21B engages in such functions in T cells, we show that centrosome polarization defects observed in KIF21B knockout cells can be rescued by mildly perturbing MT growth with a MT-destabilizing drug. These data strongly suggest that the primary defect induced by the lack of KIF21B is excessive MT elongation. These data also argue against direct participation of KIF21B in dynein-driven capture and shrinkage of MT ends that was proposed to drive centrosome movement in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yi et al., 2013</xref>), although they do not exclude indirect effects of overly long MTs on this process. Furthermore, since KIF21B is a highly processive motor, it can be expected that it would target longer MTs more effectively, like it has been previously shown for kinesin-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Varga et al., 2006</xref>). This would make KIF21B even more efficient in preventing excessive MT growth in T cells. The finding that KIF21B acts as an inhibitor of MT growth is in agreement with the studies in neurons, which showed that KIF21B reduces MT growth processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghiretti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muhia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To further substantiate the idea that KIF21B affects centrosome repositioning in T cells by controlling MT length, we turned to modeling. Our simulations predict that a relatively small number of KIF21B molecules is sufficient to restrict MT length. The attachment of a KIF21B molecule to the tip of a MT induces a MT pause. After this pause, the MT switches to shrinkage, and the KIF21B motor detaches. While the MT shrinks, the KIF21B molecule can bind to the next growing MT. Because of this dynamic process of binding to, inducing shrinkage of, and unbinding from MTs, 10 KIF21B motors can, in principle, induce shrinkage of 100 MTs within 100 s. In the model, we assumed that all KIF21B molecules induce a catastrophe, which differs from our experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). However, even if only half of the KIF21B molecules induce catastrophe, as in our experimental data, the total number of KIF21B molecules needed to significantly inhibit MT overelongation would still be relatively small, and this would also likely be true even in a three-dimensional system, where the diffusional space for the KIF21B molecules would be larger and the probability to bind to a MT lower. This length regulation by only a small number of KIF21B molecules could be validated experimentally by different labeling strategies or in a reconstituted system in vitro.</p><p>Furthermore, the simulations provided a possible mechanistic explanation for the impairment of centrosome polarization by MT overgrowth. In cells where the nucleus is located between the centrosome and the synapse, as would often be the case in T cells migrating toward a chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roig-Martinez et al., 2019</xref>), the centrosome needs to pass it along one side to move to the synapse. This movement would require a force only on one side and thus an asymmetric organization of MTs reaching the synapse from the different sides of the nucleus. Such asymmetries likely originate from fluctuations in the number of MTs contacting the synapse from different sides that occur more readily when the number of MTs is low. The fluctuation-based mechanism of asymmetry generation could explain why some KIF21B knockout cells do polarize and some fail to do so within the observation period.</p><p>Although this mechanism for the impaired centrosome polarization in the absence of KIF21B appears plausible, its generalization could be limited by our model assumptions. To reduce complexity, we based our simulations on the force generation by dynein through MT sliding rather than through a MT end-on capture-shrinkage mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Our model suggests that movement of the centrosome during polarization is a direct effect of a non-zero force along the MT network on one side of the nucleus. The mechanism of how this force is generated does not change the reliance on the force imbalance along the nucleus. It is possible that the precise trajectory of the centrosome depends on the molecular mechanism of how dynein generates the force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hornak and Rieger, 2020</xref>). A comparison between experimentally determined centrosome trajectories and simulation results is beyond the scope of this study, and thus we cannot resolve the precise force generation mechanism of dynein. Our simulations suggest that when centrosome translocation is impaired, the MT network is experiencing balanced forces. As a consequence, we predict that in these situations one would observe major deformations of the nucleus, because it is trapped in a contracting cage of MTs spanning between the centrosome and the synapse. These deformations could also allow the centrosome to be located half-way between an apical and a basal position of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In our simulations, we assume a relatively stiff nucleus and therefore we only find the centrosome in an apical or basal position. It could be also possible that nuclear deformations push MTs toward the synapse, where they form dense peripheral MT bundles to accommodate the least curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>A necessary assumption to set up a computable <italic>Cytosim</italic> simulation was the description of a T cell as a two-dimensional system. Because of this dimensionality reduction, it is not possible to quantitatively compare all experimental results to the results of our simulations. For example, the average MT length as experimentally determined in the 3D system exceeds by approximately twofold the average MT length determined in our 2D simulations. Constraining the average MT lengths from the experiments in our 2D simulations would lead to an overcrowded system that is difficult to solve computationally. Therefore, our approach to calibrate the model to the measured MT dynamics seems the most reasonable. It is possible that in a three-dimensional system, the locked centrosome state is more unstable than we conclude from our two-dimensional simulations, because the third dimension provides an additional degree of freedom to break the force balance. However, a previous computational model in three dimensions suggested that in a T cell with a static overgrown MT network the centrosome can be trapped behind the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Maly, 2009</xref>), and in our ExM data we do observe KIF21B-KO cells with an apically located centrosome and symmetric MT bundles extending to the synapse from different sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It is important to note that in other cells in our ExM samples the centrosome is located on the side of the nucleus, a situation that would lead to rapid polarization in our simulations. Since a significant proportion of cells shows a polarization delay in our experiments, it is unlikely that trapping of the centrosome behind the nucleus is the sole explanation of the polarization defect. It is possible that also in situations where the centrosome is positioned on the side of the nucleus, MT overgrowth leads to force balance and prevents efficient centrosome translocation. Furthermore, other mechanisms that are not included in the simulations likely contribute to the inhibition of centrosome repositioning by overgrown MTs. Excessively long MTs could slow down centrosome translocation by directly affecting dynein-mediated force generation, for example, by reducing the number of MT ends contacting the synapse and perturbing MT end capture by dynein. Long MTs could also make MT depolymerization-driven ‘reeling in’ of the centrosome less efficient or create pushing forces and friction that would inhibit repositioning of the MT network. We further note that even in cells that did relocate their centrosome, the immunological synapses formed slower and were smaller, suggesting that the presence of circular MT bundles might perturb synapse formation in some additional ways, for example, by affecting signaling-based cross-talk between MTs and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dogterom and Koenderink, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data show that the typical features of MT network organization in T cells, with relatively short and sparse MTs, is functionally important and that its maintenance depends on a dedicated regulatory factor, KIF21B, which restricts MT growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The information on key resources can be found in Appendix 1 - Key Resources Table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, spreading assays, and drug treatment</title><p>Jurkat T cells (clone E6.1; ATCC TIB-152) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium w/L Glutamine (Lonza) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

A CEP135-stained centrosome was quantified as ‘polarized’ when it was localized within 2 µm distance from the anti-CD3-stained coverslip.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>STED microscopy</title><p>STED images of fluorescently labeled MTs were analyzed using ImageJ. Images were background subtracted using the Background Subtraction tool with a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels and were separated into radial and non-radial components using a customized ImageJ macro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katrukha, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). In short, we used the ‘Cubic Spline Gradient’ method and Tensor Sigma parameter of 8 pixels to calculate a radial and a non-radial map image that illustrate the separated radial and non-radial components of the original picture. For both the original image and images showing the separated components, radial intensity profiles were made from the centrosome to the farthest removed portion of the cell periphery using the Radial Profile Angle plugin at a 45° integration angle. To quantify the non-radiality of the MT organization per cell, the areas under the curve (AUC) of the radial intensity profiles of the original image (total intensity) and of the non-radial map images were calculated using Excel. The non-radial intensity as percentage of the total intensity was calculated using: (AUC<sub>non-radial</sub>/AUC<sub>Total intensity</sub>)*100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-6"><title>Expansion microscopy</title><p>For the ExM analyses and all 3D renders Imaris (Bitplane/Oxford instruments, version 9.5.1) was used. Using the Automatic Spot Detection algorithm (set to 10 µm), the centrosome was localized in the 3D renderings as the brightest spot present; and a sphere was generated around the centrosome with a radius of 5 µm. A second sphere was generated with a radius of 6 µm using the Automatic Spot Detection (set to 11 µm). From these two spheres, a spherical shell was generated with an inner spacing thickness of 1 µm using the following steps: all voxels outside the surface of the smaller sphere and all voxels inside the surface of the bigger sphere were set to the maximum intensity value (255). Using the Colocalization function, a colocalization channel of both masks was made which generated the spherical shell used for all further quantifications.</p><p>To analyze MTs within this spherical shell, a colocalization channel was generated for the tubulin channel using the Colocalization function. Thresholds were adjusted to include all MTs. Based on this colocalization channel, surface masks were generated for the tubulin signal using the Surfaces tool with Split Touching Objects enabled (seed points diameter set at 0.45 µm). Seed points and generated surfaces were visually filtered so that all MTs were included. To count the number of MTs, all generated surfaces were checked and the number of MTs were counted manually per spherical shell. The mean intensity corresponding to 1 µm MT was determined from the fluorescence intensity per surface (using the Statistics feature of the Imaris software) corrected for the manually counted number of MTs in each surface. To determine the total fluorescence intensity corresponding to the complete MT network, the Surfaces tool was used to generate a surface mask covering the entire MT network (Split Touching Objects setting disabled) and used an automatic threshold to discard very small nonspecific surfaces. To estimate the average MT length, the total intensity as found (using the Statistics feature of the Imaris software) was divided by the MT intensity per micron and by the number of MTs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-7"><title>Quantification of live-cell imaging</title><p>The duration of synapse formation imaged using DIC microscopy was quantified using kymographs. Kymographs were generated using the ImageJ plugin KymoResliceWide v.0.4. along a line from the center of the cell to the cell periphery showing least irregular cell spreading. Cells that exhibited drift on the coverslip during spreading were not used for quantification. The initiation of synapse formation was determined as the moment where the cell started to spread sideways. The synapse was at maximum size when sideway spreading became static (velocity &lt;0.5 µm/min). The duration of synapse formation was determined as the duration at which the Jurkat cell exhibited sideward spreading at a minimum mean velocity of 1 µm/min.</p><p>EB3-GFP growth rates were quantified using kymographs that were generated using the ImageJ plugin KymoResliceWide v.0.4. The slope of EB3-GFP growth events in these kymographs were used to calculate growth rates corrected for acquisition settings. Catastrophe rates were quantified by determining the inverse value of growth time of EB3-GFP growth events.</p><p>Single-molecule KIF21B velocities were quantified from TIRF-imaged KIF21B-GFP expressing T cells using kymographs that were generated using the ImageJ plugin KymoResliceWide v.0.4. The slope of motile KIF21B-GFP events in these kymographs were used to calculate kinesin velocities corrected for acquisition settings. These values were fitted to a Gaussian curve to determine mean KIF21B velocity.</p><p>Single kinesin events at MT plus ends were quantified using TIRF-imaged KIF21B-GFP expressing T cells that were transfected with EB3-mCherry as a marker of growing MT plus ends. Events were quantified when a motile KIF21B-GFP molecule (&gt;0.1 µm/s velocity) reached the end of a growing EB3-mCherry-positive MT. KIF21B-GFP behavior after a MT plus-end encounter was categorized as ‘pausing’, ‘tip-tracking’ or ‘dissociation’. The ‘tip-tracking’ events, where KIF21B tracked a growing plus end at the same velocity as EB3 signal, were subsequently sub-categorized into ‘tip-tracking + pausing’ and ‘tip-tracking + dissociation’ events. The state of the EB3-mCherry-positive plus end was defined as ‘growing’ (&gt;0.05 µm/s growth velocity) or ‘static’ (&lt;0.05 µm/s growth velocity) for KIF21B-GFP events that went into a paused state, regardless whether there was tip-tracking or not. The fate of EB3-mCherry plus ends after encountering a pausing KIF21B-GFP molecule was divided into four categories: ‘pausing + catastrophe’, ‘pausing + growth reinitiation’, ‘growth continuation without pausing’ or ‘not determined’ for the events that were unclear or took place beyond acquisition time. The fate of EB3-mCherry plus ends after encountering a KIF21B-GFP molecule that directly dissociated upon reaching the plus end was divided into three categories: ‘no effect’, ‘coincided with MT pausing’ or ‘coincided with MT catastrophe’. Pause times were quantified for KIF21B-GFP molecules that that appeared static (&lt;0.1 µm/s velocity and ≥0.5 s duration) and underwent pausing at an EB3-mCherry-positive MT plus end. Pause times were quantified for growing EB3-mCherry MT plus ends that appeared static (&lt;0.05 µm/s growth velocity and ≥0.5 s duration) and transitioned into a paused state after an encounter with a KIF21B-GFP molecule. The end time of a pause coincided with either a catastrophe or a growth re-initiation event.</p><p>For analysis of β-tubulin-GFP imaging, we scored the fate of growing MTs reaching the plasma membrane into four categories: catastrophe, sliding along the cortex, MT buckling, and pausing. Quantified events had to meet the following criteria: (1) events at the MT plus end had to be preceded by a phase of growth before reaching the plasma membrane; (2) the acquisition time had to include a complete pausing event or, in the case of a catastrophe, sliding or buckling event, the initiation of the event. Pause events and pause times were quantified for MT plus ends that appeared static (&lt;0.05 µm/s growth velocity and ≥0.5 s duration). For determining pause duration of a MT reaching the plasma membrane, a kymograph was generated for the growing MT using the ImageJ plugin KymoResliceWide v.0.4 and the length of the pause was determined by the number of vertical pixels in the kymograph multiplied by the exposure time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-8"><title>Single-molecule intensity analysis</title><p>Single-molecule fluorescence histograms of monomeric GFP (control) or kinesins moving on MTs intracellularly were built from acquisitions made on a TIRF microscope. To ensure identical imaging conditions, a single imaging slide (with a plasma cleaned coverslip) was used containing two flow chambers to image GFP (control) and KIF21B-GFP expressing T cells. For purified GFP, we used cell lysates from HEK293T cells overexpressing monomeric GFP. The GFP protein was diluted in PBS and added to an imaging flow chamber; chambers were subsequently washed with PBS, leaving a fraction of the GFP proteins immobilized on the coverslip. Protein dilution was optimized to provide images of ∼0.05 fluorophores/µm<sup>2</sup> for GFP control conditions. For T cells expressing KIF21B-GFP, the imaging chamber was incubated overnight at 4°C with 10 μg/mL of a mouse monoclonal anti-CD3 (clone UCHT1, StemCell Technologies, #60011) in PBS. The chamber was washed three times with PBS and one time with RPMI 1640 medium. T cells expressing KIF21B-GFP were concentrated in RPMI 1640 medium and added to the chamber 2 min before imaging. After sealing the chambers with vacuum grease to prevent evaporation, samples were imaged on a TIRF microscope at 37°C. For monomeric GFP, ∼40 images were acquired at 100 ms exposure time at different positions on the coverslip to avoid pre-bleaching. For moving kinesins, ∼5–10 cells were imaged using stream acquisition at a 100 ms exposure time per frame. All acquisitions were obtained under identical laser power and a TIRF angle with a calibrated penetration depth <italic>d</italic> of 180 nm.</p><p>ImageJ plugin DoM_Utrecht v.1.1.6 was used to for detection and fitting of single molecule fluorescent spots as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). In short, individual spots were fitted with 2D Gaussian and the amplitude of the fitted Gaussian function was used as a measure of the fluorescence intensity value of an individual spot. For moving KIF21B-GFP molecules in T cells, ImageJ plugin DoM_Utrecht v.1.1.9 was used for detection and fitting of single molecule fluorescent spots. Using this plugin, these particles were linked to tracks with a maximum distance to search over one frame of 3 pixels and a maximum linking gap of 2 pixels. Tracks were filtered for a duration of ≥1 s. The histograms were fitted to lognormal distributions using GraphPad Prism 8. A correction factor (c) was calculated for KIF21B-GFP fitted peak intensities (i) for a series (0–100 nm) of hypothetical distances (h) between the coverslip and KIF21B molecule using the formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>180</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title><italic>Cytosim</italic> modeling</title><p>The T cell model was made in the agent-based modeling structure <italic>Cytosim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nedelec and Foethke, 2007</xref>), which solves overdamped Langevin equations to calculate the movement of the cytoskeleton and associated proteins. We choose <italic>Cytosim</italic> to be able to explicitly model the dynamics of KIF21B and dynein and to ensure an easy reproducibility of our results. <italic>Cytosim</italic> is open-source and together with our configuration file easy to run. For generating plots and figures, we used Python with Seaborn, NumPy, and Pandas libraries.</p><p>To set up a simulation of the MT network and the associated proteins of a T cell, we used the following features and elements.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Shape</title><p>The shape of the T cell is encoded as SpaceHemisphere. This space definition makes a circular (2D) or spherical (3D) space, where a plane intersects the space at arbitrary height. In the T cell, this is at 0.9 of the full height. In the space, we use to confine the centrosome during initialization this is at 0.2 of the full height of the cell. The corners of the plane are curved, to avoid infinitesimal corners. The curved corners are calculated by finding a smaller circle that interpolates continuously between the synapse and the (circular) cell shape. Any interaction with the shape is calculated by finding the closest point on the space surface and applying a linear force in this direction. If objects are outside of the space, they are pushed inwards.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Steric interactions</title><p>Because we simplified our T cell to a two-dimensional object, we needed to adjust the steric interactions. Fibers in the simulations cannot enter the nucleus, but can cross one another to effectively mimic the third dimension. This behavior is achieved by the‘ad-hoc’ steric interactions within <italic>Cytosim,</italic> in which we compare the position of each fiber segment with the nucleus, and if the fiber segment is within the nucleus, a linear force is applied to push the fiber out, similar to cell shape confinement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Dynein</title><p>Dynein motors are uniformly distributed and anchored at the synapse. They bind to MT in their vicinity and walk along them. The walking speed is characterized by a linear force-velocity relation as typically modeled in <italic>Cytosim</italic>. This definition describes a cortically anchored dynein that slides MTs, which is different from the end-on capture mechanism proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yi et al., 2013</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>KIF21B</title><p>The KIF21B units are modeled as a new form of binding Hand in <italic>Cytosim</italic>: the Capper hand. They are able to bind and walk on the fiber. When they reach a fiber’s tip, the fiber is set to a paused state, neither growing or shrinking. The waiting time for the motor at a fiber’s tip is redrawn from a distribution to ensure that the pause length is correctly implemented, regardless of how long the Capper has already walked on the fiber. If a Capper unbinds, it sets the MT to the shrinkage state. Subsequently, any other bound Cappers unbind.</p><p>As KIF21B is localized in the cytosol, we extended the ad-hoc steric interactions to Singles. Because Singles are modeled as molecules with a negligible inertia displaying a random walk, we cannot easily apply elastic forces to these objects. Thus, we model the KIF21B units to bounce off the nucleus, similar to its interaction with the shape. If a good bounce location cannot be found after 1000 attempts (i.e. the molecule is in a tight corner between nucleus and cell shape), the molecule is set to the edge of the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Fitting KIF21B-KO MT dynamics</title><p>To match the parameterization of our model to the MT dynamics in the KIF21B-KO system we used a separate <italic>Cytosim</italic> simulation to mimic the experimental data from the TIRF imaging of the MT dynamics at the synapse. Ultimately, this approach suggested a linear relation between the free growing catastrophe rate and the growing force, which is the characteristic force of the MT polymerization. This relation fulfills the constraint that 81% of the MT in the TIRF data did not initiate catastrophe within 3.3 s, while satisfying the 0.3 s<sup>−1</sup> stalled catastrophe rate. More details are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>.</p><p>In all simulations outside of fitting the KIF21B-KO MT dynamics, MTs are initialized with slightly different lengths, pulled from an exponential distribution with the mean of 1 µm. This was done so that even with very small catastrophe rates, MT lengths would not be equal. Simulations were run in a slightly altered version of <italic>Cytosim</italic> to be able to immobilize the centrosome in the center of the synapse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

Specifically, the work demonstrates the contribution of KIF21B for the control of the T cell microtubule (MT) network required for T cell polarization during immunological synapse formation. The authors use a variety of microscopy techniques, including expansion microscopy, controlled perturbations of the cell, and computer simulations to generate their results. The authors show that knockout of KIF21B results in longer MTs that result in an inability to polarise the MT network by a mechanism consistent with dynein motor function at the immunological synapse to capture long MTs and center the MT aster at the synapse. They use the Jurkat cell line, which is a classical model for this step in immune synapse function and fully appropriate. They show that KIF21B-GFP can rescue the knockout phenotype and then use this as a way to follow KIF12B dynamics in the Jurkat cells. KIF21B works by inducing pausing and catastrophe, thus, more MTs are shorter when present. They also rescue the defect in the KIF21B KOs with 0.5 nM vinblastine, that directly increases catastrophes, shortens the MTs and restores MT network polarization to the synapse. As a functional surrogate they investigate lysosome positioning at the synapse, which is one of the proposed functions of this cytoskeletal polarization. The use of expansion microscopy in this system is relatively new and clearly very powerful. The modelling component adds to the story and supports the sliding model proposed by Poenie and colleagues in 2006, but cannot say that there is no component of end capture and shrinkage as proposed by Hammer and colleagues more recently. Experiments and modelling are performed to a high standard and the results advance the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The author use poly-D-lysine (PDL) to attach the Jurkat cells to the coverslip as a &quot;control&quot; condition. Do the authors also observe polarization of the MT cytoskeleton in these experiments? The intention is probably to have a random orientation, but it has been found that charge-based adhesion zones can activate T cells due to differential exclusion of CD45 and TCR or other effects (see PMID: 29476188). Please always state when PDL + anti-CD3 is used PDL or was a control antibody used? This should be stated in each case as its not necessarily neutral for these sensitive cells. If the authors have data on polarization on PDL they should report this in supplementary figures. If there is potential activation in this condition based on some non-random polarization then it would be useful to briefly discuss this as the questions being asked don't really rely on the cells being &quot;resting&quot; or &quot;activated&quot;, although things like Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux might affect the function of KIF21B.</p><p>2) The authors use a mathematical model and this theoretical part was well performed. The authors have done a good job of discussing the earlier work from Poenie with polarization microscopy that favoured the sliding model and the recent work from Hammer that suggested the end capture/shrinkage model might better fit direct observations, but neither study provided relevant perturbations to test the models. Another recent modelling study in Biophys J seems to support a mix of the two mechanisms being relevant – PMID: 31084903. It seems intuitive that the sliding model works if all the circumferential MTs are &lt;πr in length but becomes problematic when MTs are in the πr-&gt;2πr length range, where a &quot;tug of war&quot; can happen. It seems like there are lots of MTs &gt;πr length in the KIF21B KO based on data in Figure 2G. Probably this has been corrected for the expansion and relates to lengths in the native cells. The model doesn't seem to fully capture this as even without any KIF21B the length is 12 µm- which is similar to wildtype/no perturbation rather than the estimated values for the KIR21B KO of ~ 30 µm. What happens if parameters are adjusted to allow longer MTs to form in the model in both WT and KIF21K KO setting? This could be explored by additional simulations or by a discussion if deemed beyond scope.</p><p>3) The model nicely integrates and explains the data, but is it predictive? A detailed model like the one here clearly can generate some nontrivial prediction that could either be experimentally tested here or proposed to be tested in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62876.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The author use poly-D-lysine (PDL) to attach the Jurkat cells to the coverslip as a &quot;control&quot; condition.

To clarify that in all other figure panels involving immunofluorescence techniques we made use of PDL-coating + anti-CD3 we have added this information to all relevant figure legends. In addition, we have performed immunofluorescence experiments to quantify centrosome polarization on three different surface conditions: “PDL only”, “PDL + anti-CD3” and “PDL + anti-HA (control antibody)”. In this experiment, we found that whereas the combination of PDL and anti-CD3 potently induced centrosome polarization in Jurkat cells, neither PDL alone nor PDL + control antibody were sufficient to trigger such an effect. The results of this experiment are included in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2H-I. We think that the 27.4% (PDL only) and 24.9% (PDL + anti-HA) of cells with the centrosome visible in the TIRF plane correspond to random orientations of cells attached to the glass surface. Since these cells were fixed with methanol, which compacts cells in the z-dimension, the percentage of cells with centrosomes close to de imaging plane would likely have been even smaller before fixation. In contrast, the experimental condition that included an anti-CD3 antibody showed robust polarization with 79.3 % of cells having a centrosome visible at the imaging plane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use a mathematical model and this theoretical part was well performed.

However, the connection between MT length and MT capture by dynein at the synapse cannot be reduced purely to MT length. The relative positions of the centrosome and nucleus, together with the centrosomal angle of a single MT define how the MT conforms to the space, and thus defines how likely the capture is. A fiber directing straight towards the synapse needs a much shorter MT length for capture than a fiber curving under the plasma membrane and surrounding the nucleus. These individual properties are all integrated into the measured values of capture, which we report in Figure 6F-H. Furthermore, as we discuss in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion, fluctuations are important to break the symmetry to allow microtubules to connect to the synapse along only one side of the nucleus. This mechanism is not well described by intuitive argument to compare the average length of the MTs to the circumference of the cell.</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, we did not match the MT lengths of our simulations to the lengths determined in our experiments for two reasons. First, we found it problematic to use the MT lengths from a three-dimensional system for a two-dimensional simulation. Obviously, in a 2D system with long MTs, estimated from a 3D system, the ratio of MT occupied space to empty space is drastically changed. The second reason is that such a distribution of lengths will be exponential. The long fibers in the tail of the exponential distribution with about ~30 µm length are very difficult to compute. We ran a few simulations on a high-performance computer cluster, but the numerical solution per time step (0.04 modeled seconds) increased to hundreds of seconds, which resulted in lengthy simulations which we terminated after 30 hours, out of concerns over computing time. Further investigations into these systems are beyond our possibilities and resources. In conclusion, we believe that using the measurements of the dynamics of MT to calibrate our simulations is the most internally consistent way to model the system. To fully clarify this important point raised by the reviewer, we added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>“Because of this dimensionality reduction, it is not possible to quantitatively compare all experimental results to the results of our simulations. […] Therefore, our approach to calibrate the model to the measured MT dynamics seems the most reasonable.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The model nicely integrates and explains the data, but is it predictive? A detailed model like the one here clearly can generate some nontrivial prediction that could either be experimentally tested here or proposed to be tested in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>As recognized by the reviewer, the main focus of our model was to “integrate and explain the data”. Nonetheless, we can draw at least two nontrivial predictions from the model. A strong prediction with important consequences is the length regulation of MTs by only a small number of KIF21B molecules. This length regulation mechanism could be tested in a reconstituted in vitro system in which the dependence on the number of KIF21B molecules can be systematically changed, or by exact quantification of KIF21B units through fluorescent labeling. This prediction could also potentially be tested in vivo, by the rescue of KIF21B knockout with KIF21B-GFP at different expression levels. However, these experimental validations of the small number of involved KIF21B molecules are very laborious and beyond the scope of this study. The second prediction is related to the KIF21B knockout system. In such a system the centrosome is not repositioned to the synapse. Our simulations suggest that in this case, the MT network is under constant force, but not able to rearrange. Therefore, we predict strong deformations of the nucleus by the MT network. However, we did not directly investigate such deformations in our simulations in which the nucleus is a rather stiff object. To emphasize the predictions from our model, we added the following text in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“Our simulations predict that a relatively small number of KIF21B molecules is sufficient to restrict MT length. […] This length regulation by only a small number of KIF21B molecules could be validated experimentally by different labeling strategies or in a reconstituted system in vitro.”</p><p>We also added a text in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“Our simulations suggest that when centrosome translocation is impaired, the MT network is experiencing balanced forces. […] It could be also possible that nuclear deformations push MTs towards the synapse, where they form dense peripheral MT bundles to accommodate the least curvature (Figure 2A and B).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
