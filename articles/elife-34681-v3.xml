sympathetic nervous system and carotid body (CB). Interactions between differing forms of adaptive response to hypoxia, including transcriptional responses orchestrated by the Hypoxia Inducible transcription Factors (HIFs), are complex and clearly synergistic. We show here that there is an absolute developmental requirement for HIF-2α, one of the HIF isoforms, for growth and survival of oxygen sensitive glomus cells of the carotid body. The loss of these cells renders mice incapable of ventilatory responses to hypoxia, and this has striking effects on processes as diverse as arterial pressure regulation, exercise performance, and glucose homeostasis. We show that the expansion of the glomus cells is correlated with mTORC1 activation, and is functionally inhibited by rapamycin treatment. These findings demonstrate the central role played by HIF-2α in carotid body development, growth and function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>carotid body</kwd><kwd>sympathetic nerves</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT092738</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and physiological analyses demonstrate the essential role of the transcription factor HIF-2alpha in the sympathetic nervous system control of the ventilatory response to hypoxia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Detecting and responding to shifts in oxygen availability is essential for animal survival. Responding to changes in oxygenation occurs in cells, tissues, and at the level of the whole organism. Although many of responses to oxygen flux are regulated at the transcriptional level by the hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF), at tissue and organismal levels there are even more dimensions to the adaptive process. In vertebrates, the actors in adaptation are found in different peripheral chemoreceptors, including the neuroepithelial cells of the gills in teleosts, and in the carotid body (CB) of mammals. The CB regulates many responses to changes in oxygenation, including alterations in ventilation and heart rates.</p><p>The carotid body is located at the carotid artery bifurcation, and contains glomeruli that contain O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive, neuron-like tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive glomus cells (type I cells). These glomus cells are responsible for a rapid compensatory hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) when a drop in arterial O<sub>2</sub> tension (PO<sub>2</sub>) occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">López-Barneo et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teppema and Dahan, 2010</xref>). In addition to this acute reflex, the CB plays an important role in acclimatization to sustained hypoxia, and is commonly enlarged in people living at high altitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Stella and Valcarcel, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Bisgard, 2002</xref>) and in patients with chronic respiratory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heath and Edwards, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heath et al., 1982</xref>). This enlargement is induced through a proliferative response of CB stem cells (type II cells)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Platero-Luengo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During embryogenesis, the initiating event in CB organogenesis occurs when multipotent neural crest cells migrate toward the dorsal aorta, to give rise to the sympathoadrenal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Douarin, 1986</xref>). Segregation of sympathetic progenitors from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) then creates the CB parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kameda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kameda et al., 2008</xref>). This structure is comprised of O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive glomus cells (type-I cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pearse et al., 1973</xref>), glia-like sustentacular cells (type-II cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>) and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annese et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The cellular response to low oxygen is in part modulated by two isoforms of the HIF-α transcription factor, each with differing roles in cellular and organismal response to oxygen flux: HIF-1α and HIF-2α. At the organismal level, mouse models hemizygous for HIFs-α (<italic>Hif1a<sup>+/- </sup></italic>and <italic>Epas1<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) or where HIF inactivation was induced in adults showed contrasting effects on CB function, without in either case affecting CB development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hodson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kline et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2011</xref>).

This suggests a specific role of HIF-2α in the development of the CB glomus cells, and argues against a global role for the gene in late development of catecholaminergic tissues. Further evidence for this comes from phenotypic characterization of adrenal medulla (AM) TH<sup>+</sup> chromaffin cells.

Spontaneous urination was collected from control and experimental mice (8–12 weeks old) at similar daytime (9:00am). HIF-2α<sup>WT</sup>and TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> or HIF-1α<sup>WT</sup>, TH-HIF-1α<sup>KO</sup> samples were collected and assayed in different days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tunel assay</title><p>Cell death was determined on CB sections using Click-iT TUNEL Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific), following manufacture’s indications. TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells across the whole CB parenchyma were counted and normalized by area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Plethysmography</title><p>Respiratory parameters were measured by unrestrained whole-body plethysmography (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN US). Mice were maintained in a hermetic chamber with controlled normoxic airflow (1.1 l/min) of 21% O<sub>2</sub> (N<sub>2</sub> balanced, 5000ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, BOC Healthcare, Manchester, UK) until they were calm (30–40 min). Mice were then exposed to pre-mixed hypoxic air (1.1 l/min) of 10% O<sub>2</sub> (N<sub>2</sub> balanced, 5000ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, BOC Healthcare) or 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (21% O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> balanced, BOC, Healthcare) for 30 min (time-course experiments) or 10 min (VAH and hypercapnia experiments). Real-time data were recorded and analyzed using Ponemah software (Data Sciences International). Each mouse was monitored throughout the experiment and periods of movements and/or grooming were noted and subsequently removed from the analysis. The transition periods between normoxia and hypoxia (2–3 min) were also removed from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Oxygen saturation</title><p>Oxygen saturation was measured using MouseOx Pulse Oximeter (Starr Life Sciences Corp, Oakmont, PA US) on anaesthetised (isofluorane) mice. Anaesthetic was vaporized with 2 l/min of 100% O<sub>2</sub> gas flow (BOC Healthcare) and then shift to 2 l/min of pre-mixed 10% O<sub>2</sub> flow (N<sub>2</sub> balanced, 5000ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, BOC Healthcare) for 5 min. Subsequently, gas flow was switched back to 100% O<sub>2</sub>. For oxygen saturation in normoxia anaesthetic was vaporized with 2 l/min of 21% O<sub>2</sub> gas flow.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Whole-body metabolic assessments</title><p>Energy expenditure was measured and recorded using the Columbus Instruments Oxymax system (Columbus, OH US) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice were randomly allocated to the chambers and they had free access to food and water throughout the experiment with the exception of fasting experiments. An initial 18–24 hr acclimation period was disregarded for all the experiments. Once mice were acclimated to the chamber, the composition of the influx gas was switched from 21% O<sub>2</sub> to 10% O<sub>2</sub> using a PEGAS mixer (Columbus Instruments). For maximum exertion testing, mice were allowed to acclimatize to the enclosed treadmill environment for 15 min before running. The treadmill was initiated at five meters/min and the mice warmed up for 5 min. The speed was increased up to 27 meters/min or exhaustion at 2.5 min intervals on a 15° incline. Exhaustion was defined as the third time the mouse refused to run for more than 3–5 s or when was unable to stay on the treadmill. Blood glucose and lactate levels were measured before and after exertion using a StatStrip Xpress (nova biomedical, Street-Waltham, MA US) glucose and lactate meters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Chronic hypoxia exposure and in vivo CB proliferation</title><p>Mice were exposed to a normobaric 10% O<sub>2</sub> atmosphere in an enclosed chamber with controlled O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels for up to 21 days. Humidity and CO<sub>2</sub> levels were quenched throughout the experiments by using silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and spherasorb soda lime (Intersurgical, Wokingham, UK), respectively. Haematocrit was measured in a bench-top haematocrit centrifuge. Haemoglobin levels and blood cell counts were analyzed with a Vet abc analyzer (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) according to the manufacture’s instructions. Heart, spleen tissues were removed and their wet weights measured. Right ventricular systolic pressures were assessed using a pressure-volume loop system (Millar, Houston, TX US) as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowburn et al., 2016</xref>). Mice were anaesthetized (isoflurane) and right-sided heart catheterization was performed through the right jugular vein. Lungs were processed for histology as describe above. Analogous procedures were followed for mice maintained in normoxia.</p><p>For hypoxia-induced in vivo CB proliferation studies, mice were injected intraperitoneally once a week with 50 mg/kg of BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and constantly supplied in their drinking water (1 mg/ml) as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>). In vivo mTORC inhibition was achieved by intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (6 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>). Tissues were collected for histology after 14 days at 10% O<sub>2</sub> as described above. VAH was recorded in vehicle control and rapamycin-injected C57BL/6J mice after 7 days in chronic hypoxia by plethysmography as explained above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Blood pressure measurement by radio-telemetry</title><p>All radio-telemetry hardware and software was purchased from Data Science</p><p>International. Surgical implantation of radio-telemetry device was performed following University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body’s (AWERB) recommendations and according to manufacturer’s instructions. After surgery, mice were allowed to recover for at least 10 days. All baseline telemetry data were collected over a 72 hr period in a designated quiet room to ensure accurate and repeatable results. Blood pressure monitoring during hypoxia challenge was conducted in combination with Columbus Instruments Oxymax system and PEGAS mixer. Mice were placed in metabolic chambers and allowed to acclimate for 24 hr before the oxygen content of the flow gas was reduced to 10%. Mice were kept for 48 hr at 10% O<sub>2</sub> before being returned to normal atmospheric oxygen for a further 24 hr. For hypertension studies, mice were subsequently implanted with a micro osmotic pump (Alzet, Cupertino, CA; 1002 model) for Ang II (Sigma-Aldrich) infusion (490 ng min<sup>−1</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>) for 2 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and activity were monitored for a 48 hr period after 7, 14 and 21 days after osmotic pump implantation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Glucose, insulin and lactate tolerant tests</title><p>All the blood glucose and lactate measurements were carried out with a StatStrip Xpress (nova biomedical) glucose and lactate meters. Blood was sampled from the tail vein. For glucose tolerance test (GTT), mice were placed in clean cages and fasted for 14–15 hr (overnight) with free access to water. Baseline glucose level (0 time point) was measured and then a glucose bolus (Sigma-Aldrich) of 2 g/kg in PBS was intraperitoneally injected. Glucose was monitored after 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min. For insulin tolerance test, mice were fasted for 4 hr and baseline glucose was measured (0 time point). Next, insulin (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) was intraperitoneally injected (0.75 U/kg) and blood glucose content recorded after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. For lactate tolerance test, mice were injected with a bolus of 2 g/kg of sodium lactate (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS and blood lactate measured after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Particular statistic tests and sample size can be found in the figures and figure legends. Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to determine Gaussian data distribution. Statistical significance between two groups was assessed by un-paired <italic>t</italic>-test in cases of normal distribution with a Welch’s correction if standard deviations were different. In cases of non-normal distribution (or low sample size for normality test) the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. For multiple comparisons we used two-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD test. Non-linear regression (one-phase association) curve fitting, using a least squares method, was used to model the time course data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Extra sum-of-squares F test was used to compare fittings, and determine whether the data were best represented by a single curve, or by separate ones. Individual area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the circadian time-courses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, followed by un-paired t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test as explained above. Statistical significance was considered if p≤0.05. Analysis was carried out using Prism6.0f (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA US) for Mac OS X.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is funded by the

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HIF-2α is essential for carotid body development and function&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Ratcliffe (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Macias et al. describe novel mouse lines that lack specifically HIF1α of HIF2α in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing cells, and show using these mice that HIF2α is an absolute requirement for the growth and development of the oxygen sensing glomus cells of the carotid body (CB) increased apoptosis being the reason for the lack of CB cell loss. TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup> mice have impaired ventilation response to hypoxia, decreased survival under hypoxia, increased erythropoietic response to hypoxia and extramedullary erythropoiesis. Moreover, their blood pressure (BP) is impaired at baseline and in response to hypoxia and they are susceptible to a severe BP impairment in an angiotensin-induced hypertension model. Yet, these mice show some alteration in their VO<sub>2</sub> max during exercise and in their glucose tolerance. The authors identify defective mTORC1 activation as the reason for defective CB development.</p><p>All three reviewers found the data interesting, and although critical comments were raised, no major problems were identified. The overall conclusion based on the reviews was to encourage submission of a revised version, where the very detailed comments of the reviewers have been addressed. In particular, several suggestions were made to clarify the conclusions based on the massive data, and on their relationship with previously published data. A schematic figure illustrating the major conclusions would be an excellent addition to the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the discussion after the reviews were completed, reviewer #1 offered the following specific advice:</p><p>I agree with reviewer 2 that a number of the findings lack a clear mechanism but am comfortable as long as this is clearly pointed out. More specifically it is important to distinguish as far as is possible which/whether aspects of the systemic phenotype derive indirectly from disturbances of systemic oxygenation as opposed to carotid body function itself and whether (as pointed out by reviewer) recombination in other organs might contribute to the phenotypes. If, after reasonable efforts, this is not possible then it is important that such caveats to the data interpretation are made overt.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes a critical role for the integrity of HIF-2α, but not HIF-1α in the development of the carotid body. In mice where HIF-α genes are inactivated by TH-driven expression of Cre, the adrenal medulla and superior cervical ganglion apparently develop and function normally, whereas the carotid body is vestigial. The authors go on to report on a wide range of physiological testing in the mice, which have essentially non-functional carotid bodies.</p><p>As an entry to mechanistic analysis of the role of HIF-2α in carotid body development, they also show that in pre-natal (18.5dpc) mice there is reduced staining of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, which is expressed strongly at this stage in wild-type embryos. It is also shown that during adaptation to hypoxia in the adult mouse (when a proliferative enlargement of the carotid body is seen) there is also an increase in phospho-S6 staining, which is blocked by rapamycin. This is associated with reduced proliferation of TH<sup>+</sup> (type 1) cells.</p><p>Given the importance of the carotid body to the physiology of hypoxia, these findings are of interest. Some points however require clarification.</p><p>i) As the authors outline (Discussion, first paragraph), the original descriptions of constitutive HIF-α inactivation phenotypes included the association of HIF-2α inactivation with failure of sympatho-adrenal development. The authors then state that the current findings argue against a 'global role for the (HIF-2α) gene in development of catecholamine tissues'. The most obvious difference between this and the earlier reports is the use of TH-IRES-Cre 'driver' versus constitutive inactivation. What do the authors know of the timing of Cre activation using this strain of mouse? Is it possible that the TH promoter used in the driver-strain only becomes active during later stages of sympatho-adrenal development, and that the current (carotid body – restricted) phenotype reflects this i.e. a more extensive phenotype might have been generated if the deletion of HIF-2α had occurred earlier in the sympatho-adrenal lineage? Further discussion of this is required to set the work in the context of that earlier literature.</p><p>ii) The authors describe extensive (and interesting) physiological differences between wild type mice and the TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> animals. Some of these differences occur in normoxic animals and some (e.g. pulmonary vascular responses) are seen only in response to hypoxia. If possible it would be important to distinguish those effects which are directly due to abnormal carotid body function (i.e. altered neurogenic responses) from those are secondary to increased hypoxia. For example, it is stated that 'pulmonary adaption to chronic hypoxia is highly reliant on a normally functioning CB'. For the general reader it would be important to make it clear that such a connection may well be indirect, (due to increased hypoxia) rather implying a direct role of the carotid body. Along similar lines, what is known of the oxygen saturation of the TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> animals in normoxia? Are they always fully saturated – or do they manifest desaturation at any stage? Even transient desaturation could have important effects on the parameters that are being described. Ideally data on this, or at least clear discussion as to whether this has or has not been excluded, is important.</p><p>iii) In the first paragraph of the subsection “CB development and proliferation in response to hypoxia require mTORC1 activation” the authors argue that hypoxia is an mTORC1 activator. Greater clarity on both the background literature and interpretation of the current work is required – particularly as hypoxia can also be an mTORC1 inhibitor due to metabolic effects. Specifically it would be helpful if the authors could discuss briefly what connections between HIF-2α and mTORC1 have been established previously and what (direct or indirect connections) they are proposing on the basis of the current work.</p><p>iv) Although early work apparently implicated HIF-1α as a key factor in carotid body regulation, the current work builds on a body on more recent data indicating the importance of HIF-2α rather than HIF-1α in carotid body physiology. In the Introduction the authors state 'mouse models hemizygous for HIFs-α or where HIF inactivation was induced in adults showed contrasting effects on CB function without in either case affecting CB morphogenesis'. In fact the paper by Hodson et al. examined both hemizygous animals and biallelic inactivation in the adult. It reported that in both settings HIF-2α (not HIF-1α) inactivation had major effects on functional responses to sustained hypoxia and that the proliferative (i.e. morphological) response of the carotid bodies to sustained hypoxia was entirely ablated after HIF-2α but not HIF-1α<sup>KO</sup>. These findings are closely relevant to (and consistent with) the current work and should be described more clearly in the introduction. Notwithstanding this, I do consider that the current work is an important advance as outlined above.</p><p>v) Subsection “Sympathoadrenal Hif-2α loss blocks carotid body glomus cell development”, last paragraph. I am not sure that the greater number of TUNEL+ cells in HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> animals indicates an essential function in differentiation (as opposed to survival). Could the authors clarify or modify?</p><p>vi) Can the authors comment on potential reasons why the hypoxic HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> animals suffered haemorrhages?</p><p>vii) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A please clarify designation of upper and lower panels i.e. TH-Cre = (activated tDTomato).</p><p>viii) Figure 3—figure supplement 1 – is there a greater response to CO<sub>2</sub> in the TH-HID-2α adrenal medulla or is this appearance due to different scales – could the authors comment?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Macias et al. describe novel mouse lines that lack specifically HIF1α of HIF2α in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing cells, and show using these mice that HIF2α is an absolute requirement for the growth and development of the oxygen sensing glomus cells of the carotid body (CB) increased apoptosis being the reason for the lack of CB cell loss. TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup> mice, unlike TH-HIF1α<sup>KO</sup> mice, have impaired ventilation response to hypoxia, decreased survival under hypoxia, increased erythropoietic response to hypoxia and extramedullary erythropoiesis. Moreover, their blood pressure (BP) is impaired at baseline and in response to hypoxia and they are susceptible to a severe BP impairment in an angiotensin-induced hypertension model. Yet, these mice show some alteration in their VO<sub>2</sub> max during exercise and in their glucose tolerance. Finally, the authors identify defective mTORC1 activation as the reason for defective CB development.</p><p>The manuscript contains a very large amount of high quality data from demanding experimental set ups and is well written. However, it lacks coherence and a clear conclusion. The amount of data provided is overwhelming and some reduction should be considered to make the manuscript more coherent. The manuscript would certainly benefit from a conclusive figure (schematic).</p><p>I have several concerns that warrant my enthusiasm for the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1) What is the deletion efficiency of HIF1α and HIF2α in the corresponding CB KO cells? In adult TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup>s it may not be measurable but at P0 or E18.5 CB cells are still available for HIF2α<sup>KO</sup>s.</p><p>2) The conclusion that mTORC1 activation is required for CB expansion in a HIF2α-dependent manner cannot be drawn from the experiments performed. In order to draw such a conclusion for example the rapamycin experiment should be repeated with TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup>s. Regarding the mechanism, did rapamycin induce apoptosis of CB cells?</p><p>3) As both, VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> change after hypoxia (Figure 3J and K) – please show RER.</p><p>4) In the Angiotensin II-induced hypertension model the difference in TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup> BP is only seen at 7 day (not at 14 or 21 days). What might be the reasons for this?</p><p>5) Statement on increased extramedullary hematopoiesis cannot rely on increased spleen weight only. E.g. spleen histology must be studied for it. Moreover, are there differences is the number of other than erythroid blood cells?</p><p>6) The results in Figure 6I and 6N are somewhat conflicting. Enhanced lactate clearance does not suggest impaired lactate tolerance. Please, comment.</p><p>7) Moreover, the data presented in Figure 6L and 6M is not very convincing and rather irrelevant for the topic. Why would HIF-2α loss in CB cells impair glucose tolerance?</p><p>8) The authors should prepare a conclusion illustration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors present experimental evidence indicating that HIF-2α expression is required for the survival (in newborn) and/or proliferation (in adult) of carotid body (CB) glomus cells, which in turn are required for CB-mediated responses to hypoxia.</p><p>1) Since Cre expression is directed by TH promoter, it would be helpful to analyze another marker to demonstrate loss of glomus cells in the KO mice.</p><p>2) Are neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla or nucleus tractus solitarius that receive input from the CB affected by HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> in TH-expressing cells?</p><p>3) Subsection “Sympathoadrenal Hif-2α loss blocks carotid body glomus cell development”, last paragraph – the authors show an effect of HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> on glomus cell survival, not differentiation.</p><p>4) Subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, first paragraph – do the authors really believe that GFAP expression is sufficient to identify stem cells?</p><p>5) Subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, second paragraph – histology data is needed here.</p><p>6) Subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, last paragraph – authors' conclusion is puzzling. The changes in the lungs seem to explained by greater hypoxemia and polycythemia in the KO mice, rather than any change intrinsic to the lungs.</p><p>7) Subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, first paragraph – statistical analysis is needed here.</p><p>8) Please delete &quot;the time to exhaustion trended lower in mutants&quot;.</p><p>9) Subsection “Adaptive responses to exercise and high glucose are affected in mice with CB dysfunction”, first paragraph – lactate findings are curious since the KO mice are more hypoxemic and therefore should produce more lactate; in addition, lactate is thought to cause muscle exhaustion. Some discussion of these results would be helpful.</p><p>10) Please delete &quot;TH expression trended lower in both CB and SCG TH<sup>+</sup> cells…&quot;</p><p>11) What is the mechanism by which HIF-2α regulates mTorC1 activity?</p><p>12) Many studies of cultured cells have demonstrated that mTorC1 activity is inhibited by hypoxia. Please discuss.</p><p>13) Do the HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice show normal responses to hypercarbia, which are also mediated by the CB?</p><p>14) What is the phenotype of mice with loss of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α in TH-expressing cells?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34681.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] i) As the authors outline (Discussion, first paragraph), the original descriptions of constitutive HIF-α inactivation phenotypes included the association of HIF-2α inactivation with failure of sympatho-adrenal development.

Gene deletion thus occurs in all TH-expressing cells. CB primordium is first seen at E13 in the mouse embryo (Kameda, 2005; Kameda, Nishimaki, Takeichi, and Chisaka, 2002; Kondo, 1975). At that embryonic stage, when the CB is still not developed, there are abundant numbers of TH<sup>+</sup> cells both in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and in the adrenal medulla (Huber et al., 2002; Kameda, 2005). However, our findings show that these tissues are essentially unaffected by HIF-2α deletion. We have amended the sentence ‘specific role of HIF-2α in the development of the CB glomus cells, and argues against a global role for the gene in development of catecholaminergic tissues’ to specify ‘<underline>late</underline> development of catecholaminergic tissues’. Additionally, we have now clarified this issue in the Discussion (second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The authors describe extensive (and interesting) physiological differences between wild type mice and the TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> animals.

The sentence was misleading and has been amended (subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, last paragraph). Also, as suggested by the reviewing editor and reviewer 2, we have added a summary figure (Figure 8) that we hope will clarify this point.</p><p>The reviewer has suggested monitoring oxygen saturation of the TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice, as fluctuations in normoxia might be important for the physiological parameters studied. Although we cannot monitor O<sub>2</sub> saturation for 24 hours, due to stringent UK legal and ethical concerns that limit repeated or prolonged procedures in experimental animals, we have now measured peripheral oxygen saturation in anaesthetized TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice breathing 21% O<sub>2</sub> for a period of 20 minutes. This data has been added to Figure 3 (Figure 3H) and described in the text (subsection “Impaired ventilatory response and whole-body metabolic activity in Th-Epas1<sup>KO</sup> mice exposed to hypoxia”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) In the first paragraph of the subsection “CB development and proliferation in response to hypoxia require mTORC1 activation” the authors argue that hypoxia is an mTORC1 activator.

We have now clarified the contrasting effects of hypoxia in regulating cell proliferation (subsection “CB development and proliferation in response to hypoxia require mTORC1 activation”, first paragraph) and altered the sentence (last paragraph). Also, we have added some examples from the literature citing evidence for HIFα regulation of mTORC1 activation (Discussion, seventh paragraph).</p><p>With that said, there are not many examples in the literature that link HIF-2α and mTORC1 activity under physiological conditions. Elorza, et al., reported in 2012 that HIF-2α transcriptionally regulates the expression of the amino acid transporter <italic>Slc7a5,</italic> and that this in turn activates mTORC1 activity (Elorza et al., 2012). We have tried to reproduce this observation a number of times now, unfortunately without success. Analysis of this amino acid transporter in the CB of TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice by immunohistochemistry was not able to be done in a convincing manner. The small size of the CB and the fact that the CB glomus cells were dying during development hampered further molecular characterization in our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Although early work apparently implicated HIF-1α as a key factor in carotid body regulation, the current work builds on a body on more recent data indicating the importance of HIF-2α rather than HIF-1α in carotid body physiology.

As a result, aberrant polycythemia and pulmonary vasoconstriction occur; these can lead to failure of the pulmonary cardiovascular circuit. A closer look to TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice after hypoxia exposure revealed ascites and congestive hepatomegaly, which indicates a potential right ventricular failure. Internal haemorrhages in the gut were observed only in mice found dead in the chamber.

However, it lacks coherence and a clear conclusion. The amount of data provided is overwhelming and some reduction should be considered to make the manuscript more coherent. The manuscript would certainly benefit from a conclusive figure (schematic).</p><p>I have several concerns that warrant my enthusiasm for the publication of the manuscript.</p><p>1) What is the deletion efficiency of HIF1α and HIF2α in the corresponding CB KO cells? In adult TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup>s it may not be measurable but at P0 or E18.5 CB cells are still available for HIF2α<sup>KO</sup>s.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that deletion efficiency should be quantified in CB glomus cells of TH-HIF-1α<sup>KO</sup> and TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice. Unfortunately, the tiny size of the CB at those stages hamper a clean dissection to some extent. Our genetic approach shows a clear activation of the tdTomato reporter in the CB upon TH-IRESCre recombination (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Since we observed a noticeable phenotype in the CB TH<sup>+</sup> cells we felt that it was important to determine the deletion efficiency in TH<sup>+</sup> tissues without a phenotype, such as the SCG and the AM (Figure1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Additionally, we do have extensive experience with this mouse strain (THIRES-Cre) and we have previously seen highly tissue-specific phenotypes in CB glomus cells (Diaz-Castro, Pintado, Garcia-Flores, Lopez-Barneo, and Piruat, 2012; Fernandez-Aguera et al., 2015; Macias, Fernandez-Aguera, Bonilla-Henao, and Lopez-Barneo, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that mTORC1 activation is required for CB expansion in a HIF2α-dependent manner cannot be drawn from the experiments performed. In order to draw such a conclusion for example the rapamycin experiment should be repeated with TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup>s. Regarding the mechanism, did rapamycin induce apoptosis of CB cells?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this concern, we have now performed experiments in TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup> mice injected with rapamycin. New data have been added to Figure 7E-I and commented on in the text (subsection “CB development and proliferation in response to hypoxia require mTORC1 activation”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that testing whether or not rapamycin induces apoptosis would be a great addition to the mechanism. We have tried on a number of occasions to perform this experiment using a similar approach to that used for embryonic tissue (i.e., TUNEL staining on carotid bifurcation slices). However, in these cases, we either see no TUNEL+ cells in the CB of adult mice (with/without rapamycin).</p><p>We have also performed histological quantification of CB volume and TH<sup>+</sup> cell numbers of wild type mice with or without rapamycin, and did not see significant changes. These data have been added to figure 7—figure supplement 1G and H and described in the manuscript (subsection “CB development and proliferation in response to hypoxia require mTORC1 activation”, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As both, VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> change after hypoxia (Figure 3J and K) – please show RER.</p></disp-quote><p>This data have been included in Figure 3K and N and a comment added to the text (subsection “Impaired ventilatory response and whole-body metabolic activity in Th-Epas1<sup>KO</sup> mice exposed to hypoxia”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Angiotensin II-induced hypertension model the difference in TH-HIF2α<sup>KO</sup> BP is only seen at 7 day (not at 14 or 21 days). What might be the reasons for this?</p></disp-quote><p>Angiotensin II increases arterial pressure by a number of actions, including vasoconstriction, sympathetic stimulation and renal actions via releasing aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone. Eventually, chronic infusion of Ang II also induces vascular and renal damage (Casare et al., 2016; Griffin et al., 1991). The modest but significant effects on baseline blood pressure observed in our TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mouse model are likely due to a decreased sympathetic tone in the absence of CB stimulation. In the Ang II-induced hypertension model, this absence of CB-driven sympathetic stimulation can only partially counteract the effects of Ang II in the short term and delay the emergence of hypertension. However, ultimately, Ang II actions that are independent of the sympathoadrenal system, along with classically described hypertension-induced vascular and renal injuries, do give rise to an uncontrolled hypertension in the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Statement on increased extramedullary hematopoiesis cannot rely on increased spleen weight only. E.g. spleen histology must be studied for it. Moreover, are there differences is the number of other than erythroid blood cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have now performed histology of the spleen and this data has been added to Figure 4G. Also, we have quantified other blood cells after hypoxia treatment and the new data are included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-H. This data are also commented on (subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The results in Figure 6I and 6N are somewhat conflicting. Enhanced lactate clearance does not suggest impaired lactate tolerance. Please, comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Blood lactate concentration is one of the most commonly measured parameters during clinical exercise testing. A rise in blood lactate levels upon incremental exertion is well documented in the literature (Owles, 1930). THHIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice show poorer exercise performance, consistent with the VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> rates described here. This decreased metabolic activity during exertion leads to a decrease in lactate accumulation at exhaustion (Figure 6I).</p><p>It has been reported in one recent, high profile publication that CB glomus cells are able to monitor plasma lactate levels (Chang, Ortega, Riegler, Madison, and Krasnow, 2015). Thus, we thought it important to test the validity of that observation by our challenge of TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice with an intraperitoneal lactate bolus, in order to follow its clearance over time (Figure 6N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Moreover, the data presented in Figure 6L and 6M is not very convincing and rather irrelevant for the topic. Why would HIF-2α loss in CB cells impair glucose tolerance?</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. CB has been reported to be sensitive to glucose levels through a number of different experimental approaches (Gao et al., 2014; Garcia-Fernandez, Ortega-Saenz, Pardal, and Lopez-Barneo, 2003; Pardal and Lopez-Barneo, 2002). Given the importance of the sympathoadrenal system in glucose homeostasis (Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011), we thought that it would be important to document whether CB loss indirectly regulates glucose levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should prepare a conclusion illustration.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been added to the manuscript (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors present experimental evidence indicating that HIF-2α expression is required for the survival (in newborn) and/or proliferation (in adult) of carotid body (CB) glomus cells, which in turn are required for CB-mediated responses to hypoxia.</p><p>1) Since Cre expression is directed by TH promoter, it would be helpful to analyze another marker to demonstrate loss of glomus cells in the KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a valid concern. We have performed immunohistochemistry to detect serotonin (5-HT) and TH on CB bifurcations at E18.5 embryo stage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Serotonin expression was restricted to CB TH<sup>+</sup> cells and vice versa.</p><p>TH is considered by workers in the field to be a reliable marker for catecholaminergic cells, and CB glomus cells in particular. The TH-IRES-Cre mouse strain is a transgenic knock-in which does not appear to affect the expression of the endogenous <italic>Th</italic> gene (Lindeberg et al., 2004). Our histological analysis shows that TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice have normal TH expression in the adult SCG and embryonic CB glomus cells. It should be noted as well that we see that adult TH-<underline>HIF-1α</underline><sup>KO</sup> mice do not show defects in the CB at any detectable level. This is itself a control that Cre expression does not interfere with <italic>Th</italic> gene. This is consistent with previous work of ours using this model in CB glomus cells (Fernandez-Aguera et al., 2015).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34681.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CB glomus cells identification by serotonin expression.</title><p>Double serotonin (5-HT, red) and TH (green) immunofluorescence on carotid bifurcations from HIF-2α<sup>WT</sup> and TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice at E18.5.

This is an interesting question that certainly has to be explored in the future. Our plethysmograh experiments, however, suggest that this is not occuring here, as TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice show normal respiratory parameters at 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, and as suggested by the reviewer (see comment 13 below), we have now performed plethysmograph recordings in response to hypercapnia (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and observed normal responses (Figure 3B and C). Although the CB is sensitive to hypercapnia, up to 80% of the response is due to central chemoreceptors of the respiratory center (Guyenet, Stornetta, and Bayliss, 2010; Heeringa, Berkenbosch, de Goede, and Olievier, 1979). Therefore, it is very unlikely that the lack of response to hypoxia in TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice is due to defects in the central chemoreceptors. Nonetheless, we have performed a basic histological analysis of the nucleus of the solitary tract as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response Image 2</xref>.

We note that we referred to a particular set of stem cells, the type II or sustentacular cells of the carotid bodies. These cells (GFAP+) have been identified as resident adult stem cells responsible for the CB proliferation and growth in response to hypoxia giving rise to both glomus and endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo (Annese, NavarroGuerrero, Rodriguez-Prieto, and Pardal, 2017; Navarro-Guerrero et al., 2016; Pardal, Ortega-Saenz, Duran, and Lopez-Barneo, 2007; Platero-Luengo et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Deficient acclimatization to chronic hypoxia in mice with CBs loss”, second paragraph – histology data is needed here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

A raise in blood lactate levels upon incremental exertion is classically described (Owles, 1930). This increase in plasma lactate levels is to a great extent a result of muscle metabolism. Exercise in rodents has a mild impact on arterial pO<sub>2</sub> (Dempsey and Wagner, 1999). Therefore, we believe the results seen after running of TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice is an indirect effect of CB loss on sympathetic tone, one that ultimately impacts on exercise performance, rather than an exercise-induced hypoxemia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Please delete &quot;TH expression trended lower in both CB and SCG TH<sup>+</sup> cells…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has now been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) What is the mechanism by which HIF-2α regulates mTorC1 activity?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, there are not many examples in the literature that link HIF-2α and mTORC1 activity under physiological conditions. Elorza, et al., reported in 2012 that HIF-2α transcriptionally regulates the expression of the amino acid transporter <italic>Slc7a5</italic> and that this in turn activates mTORC1 activity (Elorza et al., 2012). We have tried to reproduce this observation a number of times now, unfortunately without success. Analysis of this amino acid transporter in the CB of TH-HIF-2α<sup>KO</sup> mice by immunohistochemistry was not able to be done in a convincing manner. The small size of the CB and the fact that the CB glomus cells were dying during development hampered further molecular characterization in our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Many studies of cultured cells have demonstrated that mTorC1 activity is inhibited by hypoxia.
