Here, we aim to uncover clinical relevance and cellular roles of NK cells in colon cancer liver metastasis (CCLM). Here, we integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets to investigate NK cells’ biological properties and functions in the microenvironment of primary and liver metastatic tumors. Results were validated through an in vitro co-culture experiment based on bioinformatics analysis. Useing single-cell RNA-sequencing and ST, we mapped the immune cellular landscape of colon cancer and well-matched liver metastatic cancer. We discovered that GZMK+ resting NK cells increased significantly in tumor tissues and were enriched in the tumor regions of both diseases. After combining bulk RNA and clinical data, we observed that these NK cell subsets contributed to a worse prognosis. Meanwhile, KIR2DL4+ activated NK cells exhibited the opposite position and relevance. Pseudotime cell trajectory analysis revealed the evolution of activated to resting NK cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that tumor-cell-co-cultured NK cells exhibited a decidual-like status, as evidenced by remarkable increasing CD9 expression. Functional experiments finally revealed that NK cells exhibited tumor-activating characteristics by promoting the dissociation of SCF (stem cell factor) on the tumor cells membrane depending on cell-to-cell interaction, as the supernatant of the co-culture system enhanced tumor progression. In summary, our findings revealed resting NK cells exhibited a clinical relevance with CCLM, which may be exploited for novel strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with CCLM.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>colon cancer liver metastasis</kwd><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Xian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100022963</institution-id><institution>Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020C03029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Xiangyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100022963</institution-id><institution>Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021C03120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Xian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Q24H160147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wangkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GZC20231956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wangkai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007194</institution-id><institution>The Wenzhou Municipal Science and Technology Bureau Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Y2020215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>Dan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Clinical Medicine Plus X - Scholars Project of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Mingdong</given-names></name><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Xiangyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Resting natural killer cells promote the progress of colon cancer liver metastasis (CCLM), which may be exploited for novel strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with CCLM.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies, with more than 1 million new cases and 500 thousand deaths reported globally in 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Approximately 19–26% of patients with colon cancer present with synchronous metastatic diseases at the first diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>), among which 14.5–17.5% develop liver metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Although progress in the treatment of metastatic disease, including improved diagnosis and treatment strategies for liver metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zampino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruers et al., 2017</xref>), increased cancer-directed surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wancata et al., 2016</xref>), and the development of targeted therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piawah and Venook, 2019</xref>), has greatly improved the survival of these patients in recent decades, the 2-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with distant-stage disease was 36% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>), significantly lower than those without metastasis. Thus, colon cancer-derived liver metastasis (CCLM) is a clinical challenge that requires urgent development of novel treatment methods.</p><p>The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic environment that governs tumor behavior and is required for tumor cell survival, growth, proliferation, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yao et al., 2023</xref>). Unlike previous understanding, it has recently been proposed that certain immune cells present in the TME [such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2023</xref>)], macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ngambenjawong et al., 2017</xref>), neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>), and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiberti et al., 2022</xref>) favor tumor progression. Thus, the contradictory findings of the pro- and anti-tumor effects of tumor-infiltrating immune cells require a better understanding of the immune features and profile heterogeneity of colon cancer liver metastasis (CCLM) for the future development of immune-modulatory strategies to stratify and target immune cells.</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells, an important component of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, are cytotoxic lymphocytes that play a key role in recognizing and eliminating malignant cells and are therefore considered the early responders against tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maskalenko et al., 2022</xref>). Among various immune cells, tumor-infiltrating NK cells are associated with prognosis in various cancers, such as colorectal cancer (CRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>), lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Villegas et al., 2002</xref>), and gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishigami et al., 2000</xref>). Recently, based on their anti-tumor potential, NK cells were exploited for treating malignancies and have proven to be highly promising for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamb et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) but have limited efficacy for treating solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, intratumor NK cells differ phenotypically or functionally from peripheral NK cells in several malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrega et al., 2008</xref>); a specific subset of tumor-infiltrating NK cells (CD11b<sup>−</sup> and CD27<sup>−</sup>) as well as decidual-like NK (CD9<sup>+</sup> and cd49a<sup>+</sup>) was associated with tumor progression in lung and hepatocellular cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albini and Noonan, 2021</xref>). Notably, the tumor-promoting transformation of NK cells may be educated by cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huergo-Zapico et al., 2018</xref>). However, their function remains elusive. In particular, the presence of specific NK cell subsets within colon cancer and their potential relationship to CCLM progression have not been fully characterized to date.</p><p>In this study, we combined previously published single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics (ST), and bulk RNA-sequencing data from public datasets, aiming to comprehensively chart the cellular landscape of TME in primary colon cancer and matched liver metastasis.

Since the genomic divergence between primary and metastatic CRC cells is relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yaeger et al., 2018</xref>) and accumulating evidence has highlighted the key role of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in dictating the fate of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hanahan and Coussens, 2012</xref>), we presented a comprehensive cellular and spatial immune landscape of the primary and liver metastatic tumors of CRC by using previously published scRNA-seq and ST data. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2022</xref>), we observed that the immune microenvironment of primary and liver metastasis lesions of colon cancer had undergone extensive remodeling with a significantly decreased proportion of NK cells and a strong enrichment of T cells. However, the contrast between the decreased proportion of NK cells in tumor tissue and the enrichment of NK cells in tumor regions may indicate the specific effects of NK cells in CCLM.</p><p>Traditionally, NK cells within the TME were known as potential suppressors for tumor growth by directly killing cells and secreting proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freud and Caligiuri, 2006</xref>). However, the function of NK cells highly depends on their maturation status and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>). The peripheral blood CD56<sup>dim</sup>CD16<sup>high</sup> NK cell population predominantly mediates the killing of target cells by secreting perforin and granzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs et al., 2001</xref>), whereas the CD56<sup>bright</sup>CD16<sup>low</sup> NK cells that reside in secondary lymphoid tissues are immature and have reduced cytotoxic capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moretta, 2010</xref>). Recently, tumor-associated NK cells, which are enriched in tumors with impaired anti-tumor functions, were discovered to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis and resistance to immunotherapy in multiple solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2023</xref>), such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and esophageal cancer. The potential impact of NK cells on CCML progression is still poorly investigated.</p><p>In this study, the proportion of NK cells was higher than in past cognition, similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xia et al., 2022</xref>) in that NK cells occupied the largest immune cell compartment of nearly 50% in cholangiocarcinoma. In contrast, NK cells may not be well distinguished during automatic annotation using SingleR. Consistent with the study that revealed that treatment responders are associated with TME remodeling, including NK cell recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2022</xref>), the proportions of NK cells in PR patients were significantly higher among the LiverP and LiverT groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>), which also increased the overall proportion of NK cells to some extent. Additionally, we observed that NK cells are decreased in primary colon cancer and liver metastatic using scRNA-seq, consistent with previous findings supporting that NK cells play a crucial role in anticancer immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laskowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Myers and Miller, 2021</xref>). However, we further subdivided NK cells considering the conflicting result, in which NK cells were significantly enriched in the tumor area when using ST. Since this is the first study to comprehensively explore the heterogeneity of NK cells, no previous NK cell subpopulation markers were available; resting and activated NK cell markers in CIBERSORT were thus used to annotate NK cells. Consistent with a recent study that reported that mature and immature NK cells serve different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thacker et al., 2023</xref>), our results also provide evidence that resting NK cells in the colon cancer TME possess a potential tumor-promoting activity, whereas activated NK cells play an anti-tumor role as conventional cognition. Bulk RNA-sequencing and the corresponding clinical data further indicated that higher infiltration of resting NK cells and lower infiltration of activated NK cells were correlated with a worse prognosis in patients with CRC. However, since the resting and activated NK cells we identified were only the aggregation of multiple NK cell subpopulations, further studies are required to investigate the key NK cell subpopulations that play a crucial role in CCLM.</p><p>Further analysis of NK cell subtypes revealed a dramatic change in KIR2DL4+ activated NK cells and GZMK+ resting NK cells, whereas no other NK cell subpopulations differed in colon cancer progression. KIR2DL4, also known as CD158d, is an unusual member of the killer cell Ig-like receptor family expressed in all NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">André et al., 2001</xref>). Studies revealed that KIR2DL4 activates the cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Faure and Long, 2002</xref>), and NK-92 cells stimulated with KIR2DL4 had higher cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilic et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we also observed that the expression of the KIR2DL4+ activated NK cell subtype was decreased during CCLM progression, possibly reflecting the anti-tumor activity of this population. However, the GZMK+ resting NK cell subsets were first identified as potential tumor promoters. Moreover, it has been proven that GZMK<sup>high</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T effector memory cells, a cell subset that is particularly similar to GZMK+ NK cells, were associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal tumors. Our results also showed that GZMK+ resting NK cells highly infiltrate the cancer region, and this predicts a worse prognosis in patients with colon cancer. However, despite the interesting and gratifying clinical relevance, the mechanism remains unknown.</p><p>Considering the evolutionary trajectory and the characteristic distribution of these metastasis-associated NK cell subtypes, we predicted that activated NK cells might differentiate into resting NK cells under the action of tumor cells. Consistent with a recent study that indicated that exposure to cancer cells causes NK cells to lose their cytotoxic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>), we identified the tendency of NK cells to differentiate to an resting state with decreasing expression of activated marker KIR2DL4 as well as increasing expression of decidual-like NK cells markers: CD9, CD49a, and PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albini and Noonan, 2021</xref>), which are only triggered by cell-to-cell interactions as validated by FACS. It is worth mentioning that decidual-like NK cells were the newly identified subset of NK cells that promote tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albini and Noonan, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, NK-mediated tumor cell editing appears to partly depend on the release of cytokines in in vitro co-culture experiments. SCF, the natural ligand of c-Kit with membrane-bound (mSCF) and soluble forms (sSCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 1997</xref>), enhances the growth and migration of cancer cells such as cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 2014</xref>), Ewing’s sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landuzzi et al., 2000</xref>), and CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yasuda et al., 2007</xref>). Although the dimeric mSCF is remarkably more active and induces a more persistent activation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langley et al., 1993</xref>), the tumor-promoting effect of the supernatant from the co-culture system in the current study and the reversion effect of imatinib for the co-culture supernatant induced pro-oncogenic effects suggests an important role of sSCF on colon cancer cells. However, no up-regulation of KITLG (the SCF encoding gene) was found in HCT-116 after co-culturing with NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, when using DLD-1, a colon cancer cell with a nearly 15 times lower expression of KITLG than HCT-116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we also did not observe co-cultured supernatant induced tumor-promoting effects. We thus hypothesized that in our experimental system, NK cells may promote the cleavage and release of the extracellular part of SCF on the tumor cell surface after direct contact with tumor cells, and thus increase the concentration of sSCF, which induces the malignant phenotype of colon cancer cells in a paracrine manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, the detailed mechanism still needs to be further studied.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram.</title><p>Colon cancer cells (HCT-116 cells) educate natural killer (NK) cells as resting status depends on cell-to-cell interaction.

The SCTransform method was used to normalize the data. After selecting 2000 highly variable genes using the Find Variable Features function in Seurat, principal component analysis was performed using these genes to reduce the data dimensions. Based on the ElbowPlot function in Seurat, we chose the top 30 principal components to run the FindNeighbors function. Next, the cells were clustered using the FindClusters function with a resolution of 0.1 for clustering immune cells. A uniform manifold approximation and projection algorithm was used for data visualization, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peng et al., 2023</xref>).

R packages survival (v3.2–10) and survminer (v0.4.9) were used for survival analysis. The Youden index was selected as the cutoff value to differentiate patients into distinct groups (high or low). The Kaplan–Meier survival curve was modeled using the survfit function. Subsequently, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was established to determine the independent risk factors. DEGs between the metastasis and non-metastasis groups were determined with the filtering condition of log2|fold change| &gt; 1 and p-value &lt;0.05, using the R package limma.

They did not present any preclinical (animal model) or clinical data suggesting a causal relationship between NK cells and tumour growth. Thus, while a correlation may exist between the presence of GZMK+ NK cells and poorer tumour prognosis, causation cannot be claimed based on the available evidence.

Figures display spatial data with expression scores, but the method for calculating the score and determining NK cell presence in tumor tissue is ambiguous. Clarification is needed on whether the identification relied solely on visual inspection or if quantitative analyses using other criteria were conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. We removed the background and made the accordingly modifications according to your demand. We used the AddModuleScore function in Seurat to quantify the main immune subpopulations in spatial-seq using the gene sets identified in single-cell-seq. Additionally, the tumor and non-tumor region was identified by immunohistochemistry as well as cell clusters in spatial-seq, it is rough that we can't quantify the NK cell presence in each region precisely. The consolation is that the differences of NK cell presence in tumor and non-tumor region is observable by visual inspection. The methodology has been supplemented in the revised manuscript (line 190-193).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #2: The authors do not provide a clear definition of &quot;resting&quot; NK cells. It remains unclear whether they refer to a senescent state or a non-matured NK cell population. Furthermore, the criteria used to define resting and activated cells based on the expression of KIR2DL4, GPR183, GRP171, CD69, IFNG, GZMK, TTC38, CD160, and PLEKNF1 in Figure 4 are not well-defined. The expression patterns of these genes in Figure 4D are not distinct, and it is unclear which combination of genes was used to classify the populations. Clarification is needed on whether the presence of GZMK alone defines resting NK cells, or if the presence of any of the described genes (GZMK, TTC38, or CD160) is sufficient. Additionally, the method used for this classification, whether visual or algorithm-based, should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. The resting and activated NK cells was defined by the preferential expression of the described resting genes (AZU, BPI, CAMP, CD160,CD2, CDHR1, CEACAM8, DEFA4, ELANE, GFI1, GZMK, KLRC4, MGAM, MS4A3, NME8, PLEKHF1, TEP1, TRBC1, TTC38, ZNF135) and activated NK genes (APOBEC3G, APOL6, CCL4, CCND2, CD69, CDK6, CSF2, DPP4, FASLG, GPR171, GPR18, GRAP2, IFNG, KIR2DL4, KIR2DS4, LTA, LTB, NCR3, OSM, PTGER2, SOCS1, TNFSF14) in CIBERSORT. Actually, these marker genes were not specifically expressed in a single NK cells subset. On the other hand, combined with further flow cytometric analysis verification, the resting NK cell tend to be a decidual-like NK cells and tumor- infiltrated NK cells with higher expression of CD9, CD49a and PD-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #3: Criteria used to define high or low NK cell presence/infiltration in Figure 5 are not described in the main text or figure legend. Since, the claim that the presence of the resting or activated NK cells predicts cancer prognosis is based on this figure, this needs to be clearly described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. The activated and resting NK cell percentage in TCGA and GSE29623 was determined by CIBERSORT. Additionally, the infiltration of activated and resting NK cell was also determined by the AddModuleScore function using the gene sets of activated and resting NK cell identified in single-cell-seq, the differences of activated and resting NK cell presence in tumor and non-tumor region is also determined by visual inspection. We have amended in the main text and figure legend in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #4: The absence of FMO controls for KIR2DL4 or GZMK and the lack of increase in GZMK expression during co-culture with tumour lines raises concerns since GZMK was used as a defining feature of resting NK cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions.

In the absence of a non-tumour cell line, it is very difficult to draw any conclusions. Furthermore, to claim that resting or activated NK cells are responsible for tumour migration or proliferation, it is important to at least isolate resting and activated NK cells ex vivo and culture with tumour lines, instead of NK cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. According to your suggestion, NK cells were co-cultured with human foreskin fibroblasts, the phenotype was identified by Flow cytometry. When co-cultured with HFF in direct contact (CN group), NK cells were also tending towards tissue infiltration state (high expression of CD9). However, the domestication effect is significantly reduced compared to co-culturing with tumor cells. Additionally, unlike supernatant of CNS group (NK and HCT were in contact) from NK and HCT co-culture system could significantly increase the migration of fresh HCT, fresh HCT underwent a limited increase (no statistical significance was found) in migration when cultured in the supernatant from the co-culture system in which NK and HFF were in contact (CNS group), but not when co-cultures were performed in the cell supernatant (SNS group) and fresh medium (MNS group). Finally, we tried to isolate resting and activated NK cells from fresh colon cancer surgical specimen. Unfortunately, the NK cells were too few to perform further functional experiments such as migration and proliferation.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Phenotype switch of NK cells in different co-cultured system and the corresponding NK cell-mediated effect on cell migration of fresh colon cancer cell (HCT-116).</title><p>A-B: NK cells underwent phenotype switch (high expression of CD9) when cocultured with HCT and HFF, the phenotype switch was more obvious when co-cultured with HCT.

For GZMK, which known as the secretory protein, flow cytometric analyses were performed both with (Fig.3) and without cell fixation and permeabilization, no significant differences were found among each group.

Conditions of flow cytometry analyses for GZMK may need further optimization or GZMK may not be a suitable flow cytometric marker for resting NK cells.

The single-cell sequencing data enrolled in this study are CD45 positive immune cells and do not involve tumor cells, cellular communication analysis between NK cells and tumor cells cannot be conducted. The change process of NK can only be predicted through pseudotime trajectory analysis. Our hypothesis is that tumor cells domesticate NK cells into a tumor- infiltrated NK cells through direct contact, and flow cytometry experiments have also confirmed that tumor cells can only have such domestication through direct contact with NK cells (with prominent high expression of CD9). However, the detailed mechanism remained unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #2: A small number of patients are analyzed in this study.

We will expand the sample size to further verify the current conclusion in subsequent experiments. In addition, the marker genes of different NK groups used in this study refer to the CIBERSORT's classification of activated NK cells and resting NK cells, which is a widely recognized indicator.

The marker genes displayed in the Figure.3C were the highly variable genes of each cell group as well as the marker genes of each immune cells, such as T cells (CD3D, CD3E), NK cells (NKG7, KLRD1), monocytes (LYZ, S100A8, S100A9), B cells (CD79A), plasma cells (JCHAIN, IGHA1, IGHA2), Neutrophils (CXCL8, FCGR3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #4: Figure 1E. P and T have not been defined. Lines should not connect the datasets as they are independent assessments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. P and T means paratumor normal tissues and tumor tissues, respectively. Which have been added in the caption of Figure 1E. Additionally, the single cell sequencing samples included in the study were paired, with primary colon cancer tissues, paired normal tissues adjacent to colon cancer, paired liver metastatic cancer tissue, and paired normal liver tissues from 20 colon cancer patients with liver metastasis, paired test analysis was thus performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #5: Figure 2C. It is unclear what ST-P1 means. This is not a particularly informative figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. We are sorry that it was our annotation error. Actually, it is the spatial transcriptome of the primary colon cancer tissue and liver metastasis tissue of four patients. We have made the modifications in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #6: Multiple figures - abbreviations are used but not provided in the legend. They occur in the text but are not directly related to the figures where they are used to label axes or groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. We have rechecked and made corresponding modifications in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment #6: Patients: it is not clear what other drugs patients have been exposed to or basic data (sex, age, underlying conditions etc)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. The baseline data of the patient of SC dataset and ST dataset were showed in the Table.1 and Table.2 followed, respectively. They were not presented before as no patients characteristics related analysis was performed in the current study.</p><table-wrap id="sa3table1" position="float"><label>Author response table
