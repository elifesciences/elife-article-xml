white-matter (WM) atrophy plays an important role in fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) pathophysiology. However, these studies often overlook the fact that WM tracts bridging different brain regions may have different vulnerabilities to the disease and the relative contribution of grey-matter (GM) atrophy to this WM model, resulting in a less comprehensive understanding of the relationship between clinical symptoms and pathology. Using a common factor analysis to extract a semantic and an executive factor, we aimed to test the relative contribution of WM and GM of specific tracts in predicting cognition in the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI). We found that semantic symptoms were mainly dependent on short-range WM fibre disruption, while damage to long-range WM fibres was preferentially associated to executive dysfunction with the GM contribution to cognition being predominant for local processing. These results support the importance of the disruption of specific WM tracts to the core cognitive symptoms associated with FTD. As large-scale WM tracts, which are particularly vulnerable to vascular disease, were highly associated with executive dysfunction, our findings highlight the importance of controlling for risk factors associated with deep WM disease, such as vascular risk factors, in patients with FTD in order not to potentiate underlying executive dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DTI</kwd><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>FTD</kwd><kwd>MRI</kwd><kwd>white matter</kwd><kwd>grey matter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG032306</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosa-Neto</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While semantic symptoms in fronto-temporal dementia patients were mainly dependent on short-range white-matter fibre disruption, long-range white-matter fibres damage was the major contributor to executive dysfunction, highlighting the importance of controlling for risk factors associated with deep white-matter disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) is the second most prevalent form of early onset dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cairns et al., 2007</xref>). The misfolding and aggregation of proteins such as tau, TDP-43, FUS, or ubiquitin-positive proteins encompass nearly all cases of FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seelaar et al., 2011</xref>). FTD clinical phenotype includes behavioural, executive, and language dysfunction without primary amnesia. The initial clinical manifestation of the disease characterizes FTD cases into three common variants: the behavioural (BV) and two distinct forms of primary progressive aphasias, the semantic (SV) and the progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA). As the disease progresses, both language and behavioural dysfunction may appear in all variants.</p><p>While FTD has long been considered a grey-matter (GM) disease, recent advance in diffusion MRI (dMRI) research has revealed that white matter (WM) is also much involved in the pathophysiology of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKenna et al., 2021</xref>). GM atrophy is typically observed in the insula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muhtadie et al., 2021</xref>) (all variants), the bilateral anterior cingulate and frontal lobe (BV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lanata and Miller, 2016</xref>), left anterior temporal lobe (SV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2005</xref>), and left premotor and inferior frontal cortex (PNFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McMillan et al., 2004</xref>). Widespread WM abnormalities have been observed in the uncinate fasciculus, superior frontal, inferior frontal and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, the corpus callosum and the cingulum bundle, with a large overlap amongst participants; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greaves and Rohrer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meeter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rohrer et al., 2010</xref>, for recent reviews of MRI findings in FTD. In some mutation carriers, WM changes are detectable up to 30 years before symptoms onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiskoot et al., 2018</xref>), strengthening the importance of considering WM alteration as part of the pathophysiology of FTD.</p><p>Although often studied separately, WM and GM impairments are not occurring in isolation from one another. Alteration from GM may propagate to WM and, reciprocally, WM damage may propagate to GM via Wallerian degeneration or retrograde degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Villain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Villain et al., 2010</xref>). The aforementioned constructs suggest a dynamical and interdependent relationship between GM and WM as determinants of cognitive symptoms in neurodegenerative conditions such as FTD. Despite strong evidence of isolated effects of both WM and GM disruptions on FTD, their relative contribution to the impairment of the different cognitive domains typically affected in patients with FTD is unknown. Nonetheless, a number of studies have related both GM and WM atrophy to discrete aspects of cognition in BV and SD including disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piguet et al., 2011</xref>), moral reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strikwerda-Brown et al., 2021</xref>), and WM changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lam et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we aim to clarify the relative contribution of different properties of WM fibres and GM to the cognitive impairment (semantic and executive) in FTD patients. Specifically, we used a WM fixel-based analysis (FBA) combined with a structural connectivity and GM voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses to (1) provide an improved characterization of the whole brain fibre density (FD) and fibre cross-section (FC) impairment across the variants, (2) investigate the relationship between the WM metrics and GM volume, (3) evaluate the relationship between WM metrics and cognition domains in patients, and (4) test the relative contribution of WM and GM of specific tracts in predicting cognition. We studied these associations across different WM tracts under the assumption that these associations vary depending on specific WM tracts characteristics. We found that semantic symptoms were mainly dependent on short-range WM fibre disruption, while damage to long-range WM fibres was preferentially associated to executive dysfunction with the GM contribution to cognition being predominant for local processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fibre loss in FTD variants</title><p>Variants of FTD all had extensive WM impairments compared to normal controls after correction for age, sex, and intracranial volume (ICV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref> shows the streamline segments associated to significantly reduced FC and FD (FWE-corrected p-value &lt; 0.05; colour coded by direction) for the BV, PNFA, and SV, respectively.

For the white matter (WM) (upper panels), native diffusion-weighted MRIs were first preprocessed to obtain individual normalized WM FODs (<bold>a</bold>). WM FODs were non-linearly registered to a study-specific WM FOD template (<bold>b</bold>), to obtain the fibre density (FD), and fibre cross-section metrics (FC), later used in whole brain fixel-based analysis. The template space WM FODs were then used to generate individual probabilistic tractograms (<bold>c</bold>). For the grey matter (GM) (lower panels), native space GM probability maps were warped to a study specific GM template in MNI space to obtain individual template space GM volume (<bold>e</bold>). An affine transform was estimated between MNI template and the diffusion template space which was subsequently applied to the Desikan-Killiany (DKT) GM atlas to bring the DKT atlas in diffusion space (<bold>f</bold>). Individual structural connectivity matrices were then obtained by counting the amount of fibres connecting each pair of GM regions within the DKT atlas (<bold>g</bold>). Significant difference in connectivity for a given dependant variable (Y) was then tested using the network-based statistic enhanced (<bold>h</bold>). Significant predictors (connections) were selected to access the relative importance of GM volume and WM (FD and FC) within each connection in predicting Y (<bold>h</bold>), where mean FD and FC were obtained in fixels belonging to the connection streamlines and GM was the average of both GM regions volume for each subject.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73510-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fibre loss in fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) variants.</title><p>Streamlines (colour coded by direction) associated to significantly reduced fibre cross-section (FC) and fibre density (FD) (FWE-corrected p-value) are shown for behavioural variants (BV) vs. normal elderly control (CN) (<bold>a</bold>), progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) vs. CN (<bold>b</bold>) and semantic variant (SV) vs. CN (<bold>c</bold>).

Therefore, in order to assess the relationship between impaired cognition and WM FD and FC, in the first step we performed a three common factor analysis across eight cognitive scores in patients only to represent these scores by three principal factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). According to the loadings of this analysis, the first factor (Factor 1) was mainly related to semantic processing and comprised naming, category fluency, and verbal learning scores (delayed and immediate recall). The second factor (Factor 2) was mainly related to executive processing and comprised digit span, trail making, and letter fluency scores. The third factor (Factor 3) was only related to verbal fluency (category and letter). Although SV patients had on average a lower semantic factor score compared to BV (p = 0.034) and PNFA (p &lt; 0.001) and a higher executive factor score (p &lt; 0.001; vs. BV and PNFA), a large within-group variability can be noted for all factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Patients factor scores were used to investigate the relationship between each cognitive domain and structural connectivity as well as WM metrics FD and FC. After correction for age, sex, ICV, and multiple comparisons, the first (semantic) factor was significantly associated to FC in the uncinate fasciculus, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; upper panel). The semantic factor was also associated to reduced connectivity between the left GM temporal regions amongst themselves but also with the supramarginal, lateral orbitofrontal gyrus, and with the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The second (executive) factor was significantly associated with a reduced FC in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior corona radiata, body of the corpus callosum, inferior frontal and precentral WM, and in fibres corresponding to the aslant tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>; lower panel). Reduced structural connectivity was predominantly observed between the left superior frontal gyrus and other GM frontal regions (pars orbitalis, pars triangularis, lateral orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and precentral gyrus), accompanied by a reduced connectivity between left superior frontal gyrus and other cortices (insula, the superior temporal gyrus, and between the inferior parietal cortex) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

Furthermore, these WM abnormalities were linked to patterns of GM atrophy and cognitive decline across FTD variants. The differential contributions of WM and GM on cognition depended on the length of WM fibre.

Our structural connectivity results were in agreement with the fixel-based results suggesting that both techniques were able to detect WM impairments in FTD. In addition, we found that one of the largest reductions in structural connectivity was between thalamo-frontal regions, supporting the finding that thalamic atrophy is a prominent feature of FTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diehl-Schmid et al., 2019</xref>) and that it is common across episodic and genetic mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bocchetta et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cognitive factor across variants</title><p>Across the FTD spectrum, we found that a common semantic factor explained the variance of scores in the immediate and delayed verbal memory test, picture naming, and categorical verbal fluency. This is in line with several studies showing poorer lexical retrieval of semantically degraded words vs. semantically intact words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jefferies et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patterson et al., 1994</xref>), suggesting that semantic information contributes significantly in (phonological) lexical activation. The second cognitive factor (executive) explained the variance of scores in the modified trail making processing time, digit span (forward and backward), and phonemic, but not categorical, verbal fluency. TMT measures multiple executive functions, including attention, processing speed, set-shifting, and digit span (forward and backward), and is typically used as an attentional/working memory measure, while phonemic verbal fluency contains both a working memory/executive and a language component. A third factor grouped the two verbal fluency tests together, however this factor only partly explains the variance of each test as they also weighed on semantic processing (for category fluency) and executive functioning (letter fluency), supporting the dual nature of the verbal fluency test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whiteside et al., 2016</xref>) even in non-demented individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>WM and cognition in FTD</title><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Semantic processing</title><p>In the present study, we found evidence of the relationship between semantic deficits and WM impairment in the left uncinate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, across all variants. The uncinate fasciculus (connecting the orbitofrontal cortex to the temporal pole) has been associated with semantic processing in many studies; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Papagno, 2011</xref>, for a review. Brain stimulation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duffau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffau et al., 2005</xref>) and post-mortem fibre dissection studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martino et al., 2010</xref> have linked the ventral subcomponent of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (connecting the frontal lobe to occipital associative <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy3.library.mcgill.ca/topics/neuroscience/extrastriate-cortex">extrastriate cortex</ext-link> and the temporo-basal region) and semantic processing. Prior studies led to inconsistent results regarding the involvement of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, connecting the ventro-anterior temporal lobes, to several occipital regions (fusiform gyrus, lingual gyrus, and dorsolateral occipital cortex); see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocquyt et al., 2020</xref>, for a recent review. Our structural connectivity analysis revealed that the connectivity between the left inferior temporal cortex and the thalamus may also be involved in semantic processing. In general, our findings support the so-called hub model for the semantic processing where the anterior temporal pole represents a unique trans-modal hub receiving and assembling information from different modality specificity brain regions via specific WM connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patterson et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, it was also proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ralph et al., 2017</xref>) that graded deficit in semantic processing is dependent on the WM fasciculi connecting the anterior temporal lobe to the cortex, where the uncinate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus would convey either social, verbal, or visual semantic processing, respectively. Altogether, our findings support the hub hypothesis and suggest that it could be expanded further by considering subcortical contribution to the model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>Executive processing</title><p>Executive processing is a prominent frontal function and not surprisingly it is severely affected in the FTD clinical spectrum. We found that the executive function impairment was associated with disruption of WM tracts in the frontal lobe, specifically in superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior corona radiata, the body of the corpus callosum, inferior frontal and supplementary motor WM, and the aslant tract. The superior longitudinal fasciculus (connecting the frontal lobe to temporal and parietal cortices) has previously been associated to processing speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turken et al., 2008</xref>) and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizio and Diaz, 2016</xref>) and impairment of the corona radiata (connecting the prefrontal cortex to the basal ganglia and thalamus) has also been associated to executive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hua et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moeller et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the aslant tract (connecting the SMA with the inferior frontal cortex) has been associated with the self-initiated movement and speech production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kinoshita et al., 2015</xref>) and its integrity correlated with the amount of distortion errors that PNFA patients made in spontaneous speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mandelli et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, our results suggest that the contribution of WM to executive deficits increases with the length of these WM tracts. Reduced WM integrity in large-scale WM tracts was the major player of executive dysfunction in the FTD population. Interestingly, large-scale WM tracts are also particularly vulnerable to WM vascular disease, as observed in post-mortem studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Brien et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, chronic ischemic microvascular lesions, depicted as diffuse WM hyperintensities in brain MRI scans, are independently associated with impairment of executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Young et al., 2008</xref>). Our results could thus suggest that patients with FTD and compromised large-scale WM fibres might be particularly vulnerable to additional vascular pathology. Thus, our findings highlight the importance for controlling vascular risk factors in FTD patients in order not to potentiate the underlining executive dysfunction. Alternatively, given that the majority of FTD patients are younger and less likely to have significant vascular disease, it is possible that the tract is more vulnerable to a degree of degenerative pathology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Relationship between GM, WM, and cognition</title><p>As WM and GM impairment are too often considered in isolation, one of the goals of our study was to investigate their relative contribution to neurodegeneration. We found that the magnitude of GM atrophy was strongly related to the impairment of WM networks. This was also observed in both AD and FTD using canonical correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avants et al., 2010</xref>). Modeling the combined contribution of GM and WM to cognition is not straightforward because of the lack of spatial overlap between these modalities. To overcome this challenge, we took advantage of a common connectivity space that encompasses both structural connectivity and fibre-specific WM pathways. This construct allowed us to select anatomically relevant connections, to extract their average regional GM volume and streamlines-based respective FC and FD for predicting their respective contribution on the cognitive domain. Interestingly, within short connections, the contribution of GM atrophy was dominant, while WM FD gained in importance as a function of fibre length. This finding supports a framework in which cognitive functions involving short-range circuits are mostly affected by local GM atrophy, while cognitive processes mediated by long-range fibres are more vulnerable to WM impairment. Thus, our results support the critical importance of considering both GM and WM alterations for a better understanding of distinctively spatially distributed cognitive alterations in neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>FBA applied to FTD</title><p>To assess WM FD and FC, we used a novel fixel-based approach where individual fibre populations, even within the same voxel, can be assessed independently. Older diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques, although historically invaluable in offering the earliest opportunities to non-invasively investigate some microstructural properties of WM and their alteration in aging and disease, suffered from the inability to resolve crossing fibres. It was shown that traditional DTI may lead to artefactual findings in neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tournier et al., 2008</xref>), both false positive and false negative. This severely limits the extent to which such DTI findings can be interpreted or even safely relied upon. Novel techniques, such as constrained spherical deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tournier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tournier et al., 2004</xref>) and FBA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raffelt et al., 2015</xref> have greatly improved the accuracy of dMRI processing and whole brain statistical analysis. The associated metrics, FD and FC, were recently proposed to capture different properties of the WM fibre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raffelt et al., 2017</xref>). FD is considered a measure of WM microstructure, while FC is related to macroscopic fibre bundle morphometric change. Although these measures are typically not independent, they can provide insight on different types of WM impairment and have successfully been applied to Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mito et al., 2018</xref>). In the context of FTD, we found that both FD and FC were reduced in similar WM regions, which suggest that both fibre atrophy and axonal depletion that are part of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying an FBA to analyse WM impairments across FTD phenotypes, thus broadening the biological interpretation of WM alterations in the pathophysiology of this disease. There is a growing body of evidence describing WM degeneration in several cortical diseases. However, most studies did not investigate the relationship between specific cognitive domains, whole brain WM properties, and structural connectivity. Therefore, our study provided a more complete picture of specific WM tracts involved in core FTD cognitive impairment. Finally, the use of an innovative connection-based framework, allowing for the quantification of the simultaneous contribution of WM and GM abnormalities on cognitive deficits in FTD, also expanded the knowledge about multimodal contribution to cognition. The main limitations are due to a limited number of subjects and the lack of longitudinal data. Although patients were clinically assessed with the highest standards, the lack of genetic or pathological information precludes any association between the proteins involved in the etiology of FTD, such as tau and TDP-43, and WM fibres. Furthermore, as the data obtained from Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI) are the result of a multicentric collaboration, differences in scanners, protocols, and center-specific differences could impact our findings. Nonetheless, before the release of the data, a quality control was conducted. In addition, while the number of diffusion gradient directions (60) and the b-value (2000) are suitable to obtain a good overall quality of the WM FODs, the spatial resolution was limited to 2.2 mm isotropic voxels. Since some bundles of white fibres are only a few mm wide, significant group differences in these bundles are difficult to detect at the resolution of the data used in the present study. This, however, was the maximum resolution that could be obtained for this signal while still maintaining a good signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, although our imaging analyses controlled for age, sex, and ICV but not for clinically relevant variables including disease duration and symptom severity, as these would be artificial and could potentially bias the results of a study with such a diverse clinical population, this imposes a limitation on the interpretation of the results presented in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results support the importance of WM tract disruption to the core cognitive symptoms associated with FTD. While semantic symptoms were mainly dependent on short-range WM fibre disruption, long-range WM fibres damage was the major contributor to executive dysfunction. As large-scale WM tracts, which are particularly vulnerable to vascular disease, were highly associated with executive dysfunction, our findings highlight the importance of controlling for risk factors associated with deep WM disease, such as vascular risk factors, in patients with FTD in order not to potentiate underlying executive dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study sample</title><p>All data were obtained from the FTLDNI, through the LONI portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu">http://adni.loni.usc.edu</ext-link>).

A two common factor hypothesis was first rejected (approximate chi-squared test; p &lt; 0.05) while a three-factor model fails to reject the null hypothesis (approximate chi-squared test; p &lt; 0.42), suggesting that the latter model provides a satisfactory explanation of the covariation in these data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> for the factor loadings results). The factor scores were calculated using a weighted least score estimate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Tract of interest analysis</title><p>Using a matrix of regions, pairs of GM regions were made, based on the significance of their connectivity. These selected connectivity-based pairs of GM regions were used to extract the tracts connecting them, which allows to investigate the tract-specific relations between GM volume, FD, and FC and cognition. Using the template filtered tractogram (2 M streamlines), we extracted the streamlines assigned to the pair of selected GM regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). The resulting streamlines were then automatically thresholded into a binary fixel mask using an automated optimal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ridgway et al., 2009</xref>). The connectivity-based FC and FD values were then averaged in the mask. The GM volume was assessed by calculating the average GM VBM values of the connecting regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–b</xref> for a graphical representation). To investigate all the selected connections as a whole, we standardized GM, FC, and FD across all connections and used repeated GLM to obtain the prediction estimate for their respective cognitive factors adjusted for age, sex, and ICV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Finally, we calculated the average streamline length for each tract, which best represents the overall length of the tract.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Fixel-wise whole brain characterization of the relationship between FC, FD, diagnosis, and cognition was carried out using the connectivity-based fixel enhancement method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raffelt et al., 2015</xref>). For the structural connectivity analysis, a common connectivity mask was generated for the top 20% connections of the population template. Relationship between the connectivity, diagnosis, and cognition was calculated using the network-based statistical enhancement method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vinokur et al., 2015</xref>). For both methods, family-wise-corrected p-values were obtained via permutation testing (n = 1000). VBM analyses were performed using VoxelStats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathotaarachchi et al., 2016</xref>). Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using random field theory with a cluster threshold (after correction) of p &lt; 0.01. Analyses of cognition were performed in patient groups only. All statistical models were corrected for age, sex, and ICV.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All data were obtained from the Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Neuroimaging Initiative (FTLDNI), through the LONI portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://adni.loni.usc.edu">http://adni.loni.usc.edu</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeannie Chin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy Rittman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The Introduction offers an incomplete picture of grey and white matter contributions to cognition in FTD. A number of studies have related both grey and white matter atrophy to discrete aspects of cognition in bvFTD and SD including disinhibition (Hornberger et al., 2011), moral reasoning (Strikwerda-Brown et al., 2021) and white matter changes over time (Lam et al., 2014) across the syndromes of interest here. A more balanced and comprehensive picture of previous work should be presented.</p><p>2. Participants: Table 1 provides a very limited overview of participant demographics and clinical characteristics. I would like to see much more information provided regarding these cases. For example, are the semantic dementia cases left- or right-predominant? What expressive language dysfunction tests were conducted to confirm the PNFA diagnosis? Was any cognitive testing conducted for Control participants? Are these groups matched for age, education, sex, etc? Were any tests of social cognition, semantic comprehension, or verbal repetition conducted? These are crucial for the differential diagnoses of the FTD subtypes.</p><p>3. Factor analysis: More information regarding the criteria used to extract the factors is required. Importantly, there is no clear separation between the 3 groups using these factors. This raises concerns regarding the suitability of the factors to take forward into the imaging, compounded by the fact that there is marked overlap in grey matter atrophy between the three patient groups. A clear demonstration of the specificity of the brain-behaviour associations either to a particular variant or cognitive domain is needed.</p><p>4. Imaging: As previously reported, FTD patients frequently show the presence of white matter lesions in variable locations and of different etiology, size, and severity. What is the impact of white matter lesions on the accuracy and precision of image registration and fiber estimation in this study? Did the authors assess the lesion load and/or use a lesion mask?</p><p>5. Imaging acquisition: The FTLDNI dataset includes DTI scans acquired with similar but not identical acquisition protocols (e.g., TR 6600 or 8200). Did the authors check if the 155 scans included in the study were all acquired using an identical acquisition protocol?</p><p>6. DTI: While the number of diffusion gradient directions (60) and the b-value (2000) are suitable to obtain a good overall quality of the WM FODs, I am concerned about the spatial resolution (2.2 mm isotropic voxels). Since some bundles of white fibers are only a few mm wide, significant group differences in these bundles are difficult to detect at the resolution of the data used in the present study. The authors should clarify this aspect and interpret the results carefully.</p><p>7. Head motion: Previous investigations have shown the impact of head motion on estimated diffusion values. Even with a rigorous quality check and eddy current correction, head motion can significantly influence diffusion values. Have the authors assessed and controlled for head motion?</p><p>8. On page: 9, it was not clear how the pairs of GM regions were defined/selected.</p><p>9. The imaging analyses controlled for age, sex and ICV but not for clinically relevant variables including disease duration, symptom severity, which limits the ability to interpret the results.</p><p>10. Discussion: Finally, the discussion of vulnerability of the aslant tract to vascular pathology contributing to FTD pathology seems unsupported. This seems unlikely given that the majority of FTD patients are younger and less likely to have significant vascular disease. Could it be that the tract is vulnerable to any form of degenerative pathology?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73510.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

A clear demonstration of the specificity of the brain-behaviour associations either to a particular variant or cognitive domain is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is indeed a crucial part of our manuscript. We therefore further clarified this as follows:</p><p>“As highlighted earlier, our 3 factor model failed to reject the null hypothesis suggesting that this model provides a satisfactory explanation for the variation in this data. Therefore, in order to assess the relationship between impaired cognition and WM fiber density (FD) and fiber cross-section (FC), in a first step we performed a 3 common factor analysis across eight cognitive scores in patients only to represent these scores by 3 principal factors (Figure 5a). According to the loadings of this analysis, the first factor (F1) was mainly related to semantic processing and comprised naming, category fluency and verbal learning scores (delayed and immediate recall). The second factor (F2) was mainly related to executive processing and comprised digit span, trail making and letter fluency scores. The third factor (F3) was only related to verbal fluency (category and letter). Although SV patients had on average a lower semantic factor score compared to BV (p=0.034) and PNFA (p &lt; 0.001) and a higher executive factor score (p &lt; 0.001; vs BV and PNFA), a large within group variability can be noted for all factors (Figure 5b). Patients factor scores were used to investigate the relationship between each cognitive domain and structural connectivity as well as WM metrics FD and FC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Imaging: As previously reported, FTD patients frequently show the presence of white matter lesions in variable locations and of different etiology, size, and severity. What is the impact of white matter lesions on the accuracy and precision of image registration and fiber estimation in this study? Did the authors assess the lesion load and/or use a lesion mask?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to address these points brought forward by the reviewer in multiple parts. Firstly, the fiber orientation density (FOD) estimation can cope with the presence of WM lesions due to the 3-tissue spherical deconvolution approach: non-axonal diffusion signal contributions are captured in the other (non-WM) compartments of the model. Put differently, these non-axonal signals are thus “filtered out” of the WM FOD that is used for the subsequent image registration (and further analysis). Within lesions, we usually still see entirely intact WM FODs that are simply a bit smaller in size (but not distorted in “shape”), proportional to the remaining intact axons in these lesions.</p><p>Secondly, the image registration is directly guided by the WM FODs themselves. As the WM FODs in lesions still reflect the underlying fibre orientations via their undistorted shape, the image registration has no issues relying on these FODs to match them between subjects with and without lesions in any given WM area. This is quite common in fixel-based analyses, even in cohorts with much larger lesions (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease or even stroke; see Dhollander et al., 2021 for various examples).</p><p>Finally, when it comes to registration, as these lesions are less than 10cc, there is no noticeable effect in our registration quality (DeCarli et al., 1995).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Imaging acquisition: The FTLDNI dataset includes DTI scans acquired with similar but not identical acquisition protocols (e.g., TR 6600 or 8200). Did the authors check if the 155 scans included in the study were all acquired using an identical acquisition protocol?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for noticing this. This is a multicentric study with an imaging core located at the Center for Imaging of Neurogenerative Diseases located at the Sandler Neuroscience Building on the Mission Bay Campus, San Francisco with a quality control that was conducted before the data release. Like any multicentric study there are differences due to different scanners, protocols and center specific differences. We therefore now acknowledge this limitation in our results:</p><p>“Furthermore, as the data obtained from FTLDNI are the result of a multicentric collaboration, differences in scanners, protocols and center specific differences could impact our findings. Nonetheless, before the release of the data, a quality control was conducted.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. DTI: While the number of diffusion gradient directions (60) and the b-value (2000) are suitable to obtain a good overall quality of the WM FODs, I am concerned about the spatial resolution (2.2 mm isotropic voxels). Since some bundles of white fibers are only a few mm wide, significant group differences in these bundles are difficult to detect at the resolution of the data used in the present study. The authors should clarify this aspect and interpret the results carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the concerns of the reviewer. However, 2.5 mm was the max resolution that we could obtain for this signal to obtain a good STN ratio. We will therefore address the spatial resolution as one of the limitations of our study. We would like to note that this resolution is very common for diffusion MRI studies with higher b-values (in order to keep the signal-to-noise ratio under control). This can be seen in the fixel-based analysis review that was done by one of the co-authors of this manuscript (Dhollander et al., 2021) available here:</p><p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921006923.</p><p>In addition, while the number of diffusion gradient directions (60) and the b-value (2000) are suitable to obtain a good overall quality of the WM FODs, the spatial resolution was limited to 2.2 mm isotropic voxels. Since some bundles of white fibers are only a few mm wide, significant group differences in these bundles are difficult to detect at the resolution of the data used in the present study. This, however, was the maximum resolution that could be obtained for this signal while still maintaining a good signal-to-noise ratio.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Head motion: Previous investigations have shown the impact of head motion on estimated diffusion values. Even with a rigorous quality check and eddy current correction, head motion can significantly influence diffusion values. Have the authors assessed and controlled for head motion?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that motion can significantly impact our results. We therefore excluded any individual that moved more than 2 mm from this study. In addition, we corrected for motion and described the used procedure in the dMRI processing section:</p><p>“All dMRI data were preprocessed using MRtrix3 (J. D. Tournier et al., 2019). Preprocessing steps included denoising (Veraart et al., 2016), Gibbs ringing correction (Kellner, Dhital, Kiselev, and Reisert, 2016), eddy-current and motion correction (Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016) and bias field correction (Tustison et al., 2010).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. On page: 9, it was not clear how the pairs of GM regions were defined/selected.</p></disp-quote><p>This was based on the significance of their connectivity. Using a matrix of regions, we selected the most significant gray matter regions as pairs. We have now clarified this further in the appropriate section:</p><p>“Using a matrix of regions, pairs of GM regions were made, based on the significance of their connectivity. These selected connectivity-based pairs of GM regions were used to extract the tracts connecting them, which allows to investigate the tract specific relations between GM volume, FD and FC and cognition. Using the template filtered tractogram (2M streamlines), we extracted the streamlines assigned to the pair of selected GM regions (Figure 1i). The resulting streamlines were then automatically thresholded into a binary fixel mask using an automated optimal threshold (Ridgway et al., 2009). The connectivity-based FC and FD values were then averaged in the mask.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The imaging analyses controlled for age, sex and ICV but not for clinically relevant variables including disease duration, symptom severity, which limits the ability to interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding this point. All these patients had the diagnosis of dementia due to FTD. Furthermore, all these patients had CDR = 1, and were still able to consent and to remain still within the scanning timeframe. A common metric of disease severity in such a clinically diverse population would be artificial and could potentially bias the results of the study. We recognize that the lack of this metric, imposes limitations on the interpretation of the results, and therefore now addressed this in the limitations of the study:</p><p>“Finally, although our imaging analyses controlled for age, sex and ICV but not for clinically relevant variables including disease duration and symptom severity, as these would be artificial and could potentially bias the results of a study with such a diverse clinical population, this imposes a limitation on the interpretation of the results presented in this study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Discussion: Finally, the discussion of vulnerability of the aslant tract to vascular pathology contributing to FTD pathology seems unsupported. This seems unlikely given that the majority of FTD patients are younger and less likely to have significant vascular disease. Could it be that the tract is vulnerable to any form of degenerative pathology?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a possibility for this to be the case. We would therefore like to thank the reviewer for this valuable contribution and added this as a separate hypothesis in the relevant section:</p><p>“Alternatively, given that the majority of FTD patients are younger and less likely to have significant vascular disease, it is possible that the tract is more vulnerable to a degree of degenerative pathology.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
