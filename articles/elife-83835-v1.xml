Little is known about the transcriptional and signaling factors that drive pulmonary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and subsequent regeneration of pulmonary capillaries, as well as their response to stress. Here, we show that the transcription factor Atf3 is essential for the regenerative response of the mouse pulmonary endothelium after influenza infection. <italic>Atf3</italic> expression defines a subpopulation of capillary ECs enriched in genes involved in endothelial development, differentiation, and migration. During lung alveolar regeneration, this EC population expands and increases the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, blood vessel development, and cellular response to stress. Importantly, endothelial cell-specific loss of Atf3 results in defective alveolar regeneration, in part through increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation in the endothelium. This leads to the general loss of alveolar endothelium and persistent morphological changes to the alveolar niche, including an emphysema-like phenotype with enlarged alveolar airspaces lined with regions that lack vascular investment. Taken together, these data implicate Atf3 as an essential component of the vascular response to acute lung injury that is required for successful lung alveolar regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pulmonary endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>endothelial cell fate</kwd><kwd>lung regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HL152664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niethamer</surname><given-names>Terren K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HL164960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Niethamer</surname><given-names>Terren K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL152194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrisey</surname><given-names>Edward E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL132999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrisey</surname><given-names>Edward E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01HL134745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrisey</surname><given-names>Edward E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01HL148857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrisey</surname><given-names>Edward E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014780</institution-id><institution>Longfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BREATH Consortium</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrisey</surname><given-names>Edward E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>After acute lung injury, the transcription factor Atf3 is essential for regeneration of the capillary endothelium, which is critical for restoring the structure of the lung alveolus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cardinal function of the mammalian lung is gas exchange with the cardiovascular system, which requires the close interface of pulmonary capillary ECs and alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zepp and Morrisey, 2019</xref>). The functional unit of gas exchange in the distal lung is the alveolus, where large, flat AT1 cells stretch across a network of capillaries to mediate this process. Although the capillary-AT1 interface is essential for respiration and has been beautifully imaged in three dimensions at the macroscopic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weibel, 2017</xref>), how it is formed and maintained at a molecular level remains poorly understood. Upon acute injury, the gas exchange interface must be rapidly repaired to restore lung function, a process that requires regeneration of cell types lost to injury, orchestration of proper communication between them to initiate an exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide and reestablishment of the functional architecture. Given the central role that capillary endothelium plays in lung function, it represents an attractive target for regenerative therapies. However, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of EC regeneration is needed to develop such targeted therapies.</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that the lung endothelium is heterogeneous and that pulmonary capillary EC subtypes likely play different roles in progenitor function, signaling, and gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jambusaria et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>). The CAP1 (<italic>Plvap</italic> cell or general capillary) EC population is the primary contributor to EC proliferation during the response to elastase injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>), while the CAP2 (<italic>Car4</italic> cell or aerocyte) is generated late in embryonic lung development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>) and is larger and more complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>). CAP2s also express genes that suggest they may possess a specialized function in gas exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular drivers that enable progenitor function in CAP1s remain elusive, and the factors that promote proliferation in these cells are unknown. Furthermore, if CAP1 proliferation is required to regenerate the entire capillary vasculature after acute lung injury, then a switch between CAP1 proliferation and CAP1-to-CAP2 differentiation may also be necessary. However, to date, no candidate mediators of proliferation or differentiation in CAP1s have been identified.</p><p>During lung development and regeneration, transcription factor (TF) expression within the alveolar epithelium regulates cell lineage commitment to maintain a balance between the proliferation of surviving cells and differentiation to replace cells that have been lost to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khattar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liberti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Little et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Penkala et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>). Differential expression of TFs in the pulmonary vascular endothelium is also likely to play key roles in maintaining progenitor function, driving the proliferation of one pulmonary EC subtype while maintaining another in a differentiated state. Temporal changes in TF expression may also alter the choice to proliferate or differentiate within a certain cell population. Specific TFs also differentially regulate the activation of signaling pathways in the lung known to affect progenitor function, including Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkauskas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frank et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liberti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nabhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zacharias et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that the TF activating transcription factor 3, or <italic>Atf3</italic> is differentially expressed between CAP1 and CAP2 ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>) and could represent a key regulator of proliferation and CAP1-CAP2 differentiation. <italic>Atf3</italic> is an immediate early gene known to play essential roles in the maintenance of homeostasis, regeneration, and the response to cellular stress. Loss of <italic>Atf3</italic> expression is associated with increased tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wolford et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Atf3</italic> expression can also be protective in situations of cellular stress. It is transcribed in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2003</xref>), after which it can inhibit apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hamdi et al., 2008</xref>). Atf3 exhibits this protective role in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoshida et al., 2008</xref>), the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), and the airway in asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gilchrist et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to its role in stress response, Atf3 is also known to drive regeneration directly. In the nervous system, <italic>Atf3</italic> expression regulates axon sprouting and regeneration after nerve injury (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Katz et al., 2022</xref>). Mice lacking <italic>Atf3</italic> have reduced induction of regeneration-associated genes after injury to the peripheral nerves and are unable to appropriately regenerate their axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gey et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, Atf3 has been shown to drive regeneration of the infra-renal aorta after mechanical pressure injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Atf3</italic> forms part of a group of genes induced upon injury, including <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>, and <italic>Klf4</italic>, and is required for endothelial proliferation to repair the aorta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>). The role of Atf3 in tissue protection and induction of regeneration in other contexts, including the lung vasculature, remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that the expression of <italic>Atf3</italic> defines a subset of CAP1s that contribute to regeneration in the distal lung after acute influenza infection. Atf3-expressing CAP1s proliferate and increase in number after influenza infection, and endothelial-specific loss of Atf3 results in the persistent dysmorphic alveolar structure during the tissue repair process. Analysis of the transcriptional changes caused by loss of Atf3 reveals that it regulates alveolar regeneration by controlling the response both to the stress of tissue injury and to regenerative cues. Loss of Atf3 results in increased endothelial apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and an overall persistent loss of ECs in Atf3-knockout animals. Loss of ECs and failure to regenerate the lung vasculature results in decreased density of alveolar epithelial cells and CAP2s, and a persistent emphysema-like phenotype characterized by enlarged alveolar airspaces. These data demonstrate that endothelial repair is critical to the structural integrity of regenerated lung tissue after influenza and that this process is regulated by Atf3.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of <italic>Atf3</italic> defines a subset of pulmonary capillary endothelial cells</title><p>CAP1 ECs in the distal lung alveolus proliferate after acute viral or elastase injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>), but the mechanisms that induce CAP1 proliferation, as well as the role of CAP1 proliferation in the regeneration of the overall lung tissue structure, remain incompletely understood. To determine factors that promote CAP1 response to acute lung injury, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from non-immune (CD45-negative) cells of the whole mouse lung at homeostasis and 14 days post-H1N1 PR8 influenza injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>). We subclustered endothelial populations expressing the pan-EC marker <italic>Pecam1</italic> (CD31) and observed endothelial populations previously described both at homeostasis and after injury, including lymphatic, arterial, and venous ECs as well as CAP1 and CAP2 ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-H</xref>). Of note, subclustering of <italic>Pecam1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells within this dataset revealed two subpopulations of CAP1s (CAP1_A and CAP1_B) present both at homeostasis and after H1N1, with differing proportions of each CAP1 subcluster in the uninjured and injured lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). CAP1_As demonstrated a more general gene expression profile shared by both CAP1_As and CAP1_Bs and were defined by expression of <italic>Gpihbp1</italic> and <italic>Sema3c</italic>, while CAP1_Bs possessed a more distinct gene expression profile defined by expression of <italic>Atf3</italic> and <italic>Hes1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B, G, H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B, H, I</xref>). <italic>Atf3</italic> expression was highest in CAP1_Bs both at homeostasis and after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’–A’’ and B’–B’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>).

Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we identified the transcription factor Atf3 as a putative marker of a previously unrecognized CAP1 endothelial subpopulation whose gene expression suggests that it is a critical regulator of the regenerative response by pulmonary ECs. We show that loss of <italic>Atf3</italic> expression in the endothelium diminished the regenerative capacity of the distal lung, resulting in a persistent emphysema-like phenotype and decreasing the activity of several signaling pathways known to be important for angiogenesis while increasing cytokine expression. Endothelial Atf3 knockout mice had decreased numbers of pulmonary ECs caused by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, diminishing the ability of pulmonary ECs to respond to stress and impairing their ability to mount a regenerative response. This loss of pulmonary ECs resulted in a concomitant loss of alveolar AT1 and AT2 cells, leading to long-term architectural defects in endothelial Atf3 null mice. These results reveal the necessity of proper lung capillary regeneration after acute injury and the essential role that Atf3 plays in this process.</p><p>After viral lung injury, a delicate balance in inflammatory response must be maintained to clear the virus without causing severe tissue damage. Our data suggest that Atf3 may be one factor that maintains this balance in the lung after an influenza infection. The differential gene expression analysis from our scRNA-seq data suggests that <italic>Atf3</italic>-expressing CAP1_Bs are involved in cellular stress response, while our in vivo data suggests that Atf3-positive CAP1s increase in number after flu injury and that loss of Atf3 leads to structural defects in the alveolus. Further, our RNA-seq data indicate that when Atf3 is lost, multiple signaling molecules that may be important for the CAP1 injury response are downregulated, while cytokine expression is upregulated. Loss of Atf3 in the lung has been found to increase susceptibility to injury in a mouse model of ventilator-induced lung injury through increased inflammatory response, suggesting that Atf3 may normally protect against inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akram et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, loss of Atf3 in either myeloid cells or parenchymal cells in mouse bone marrow chimeras resulted in increased inflammatory response, with Atf3 loss in parenchymal cells causing increased cell permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shan et al., 2015</xref>). Our work indicates that the protective role of Atf3 in the lung extends outside ventilator-induced lung injury to encompass inflammatory injury caused by a viral infection, and we show that the lung endothelium is an essential Atf3-expressing cell that helps to promote alveolar regeneration after infectious injury.</p><p>Our data indicate that Atf3 expression is important for both pulmonary EC survival and the CAP1 proliferative response. A previous report suggests that Atf3 can play a dual role in controlling inflammatory response and promoting repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akram et al., 2010</xref>), and the dual increase in apoptosis and loss of proliferation we observe in Atf3-KO ECs suggests that perhaps these cells are both more sensitive to cytokine signaling and less responsive to proliferative cues. These effects may be mediated by one or several signaling pathways downstream of Atf3. Our RNA-seq data indicate that loss of Atf3 results in a decrease in <italic>Notch4</italic> expression, and impaired Notch4 signaling in endothelial cells has been shown to result in EC ‘activation’ and increases in several inflammatory cytokines in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacKenzie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quillard et al., 2008</xref>). Notch4 has also been suggested to inhibit endothelial apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">MacKenzie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Quillard et al., 2008</xref>), and its loss in Atf3<sup>EC-KO</sup> mice is one possible mechanism for the increase in apoptosis we observe in these animals after H1N1 infection. Our RNA-seq data also demonstrate a decrease in <italic>Fgfr1</italic> expression in Atf3<sup>EC-KO</sup> animals; Fgfr1 signaling has been implicated in neovascularization in the skin and eye, where this pathway plays a role in injury response but not in the maintenance of homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oladipupo et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that Fgfr1 signaling may act downstream of Atf3 to activate lung EC proliferation and the formation of new vessels after acute lung injury. Notch4 and Fgfr1 represent only two of several putative candidates that may regulate lung endothelial apoptosis and proliferation after H1N1 infection, and the role of these and other pathways in the EC response to influenza merit further evaluation in future studies. In combination, these data suggest that Atf3 is essential for the pulmonary EC regenerative response and that loss of expression causes persistent defects in the alveolar structure after acute injury. The role of Atf3 in regulating inflammatory response suggests that immune-endothelial signaling may play an important role in vascular regeneration after influenza. Future experiments to identify and characterize these potential interactions will help to further elucidate the role of Atf3 in the distal lung.</p><p>This work identifies Atf3 as a critical regulator of the pulmonary EC response to acute injury and suggests that this transcription factor may play multiple roles within the endothelium during this response. Our data identify an additional context in which Atf3 acts protectively in cellular stress response, namely, the capillary vasculature in the lung after H1N1 influenza infection. In addition to this function, we find that endothelial expression of <italic>Atf3</italic> is also associated with increasing regenerative response, possibly through promoting angiogenesis after vessels are lost to injury. Finally, Atf3 may act to repair the damaged capillary structure itself through the mediation of pulmonary EC migration or adhesion of epithelial and endothelial cells. With this critical knowledge in hand, identifying and studying the downstream pathways that mediate these separate functions will be essential. Future therapies that target Atf3 or its downstream pathways in pulmonary ECs after viral lung injury may assist in increasing tissue protection from inflammation while permitting appropriate inflammatory response to the virus as well as essential repairs to the capillary vascular structure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

All other statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software. Unpaired t-tests (parametric) and Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests (nonparametric) were used to assess differences between the two groups. If more than two groups were analyzed, a Kruskal-Wallace test was used to determine if differences between groups were statistically significant, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests to compare individual groups. Graphs are displayed as bar plots indicating mean and standard deviation. For data quantification purposes, each dot on a graph represents a single mouse, i.e., a biological replicate. p-values are indicated in figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania under the protocol #806345.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Paul Noble as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please define the extent of H1N1-mediated inflammation in Atf3-deficient mice, and clarify why the aberrant induction of metaplastic Krt5+&quot;pods&quot; by influenza infection is not seen in these mice and how preventing expansion of the CAP1B population would not reveal this feature of the H1N1 lung phenotype.</p><p>2. Please consider integrating the scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation that have been performed separately for the control lung and H1N1 infected lung, reanalyzing the data, and determining the differential gene expression between these two groups.</p><p>3. Please verify and quantify the deletion of Atf3 in the mutant mouse.</p><p>4. Please clarify how exactly were the regions of viral damage selected</p><p>5. In Figure 1S2, Atf3+ CAP1_B is mostly negative for proliferative gene Mki67. The discrepancy between this data and the EdU results needs to be explained. Also, in Figure 1A&amp;B, Atf3 is expressed by the population of venous ECs that seems to increase after injury. Please clarify if these cells may contribute to the increased CD31+/EdU+ population.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have only a few comments for clarification and improvement of the manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors point to several reports implicating Atf3 in controlling the inflammatory response post-injury and they find an increase in cytokine expression in Atf3 null lungs post-influenza. However, it is not clear from the lung sections (H&amp;E and IF) the extent to which H1N1-mediated inflammation is present in Atf3-deficient mice.</p><p>2. Please clarify why the aberrant induction of metaplastic Krt5+&quot;pods&quot; by influenza infection is not seen in Atf3-deficient mice (which show abnormal alveolar repair). It is unclear how preventing the expansion of the CAP1B population would not reveal this feature of the H1N1 lung phenotype.</p><p>3. Although ATf3 is enriched in CAP1B ECs, the U-Map representation of Atf3 (Figure 1.S1B) shows still a sizable population of CAP1A cells expressing this transcription factor (also: dot plot in S1H ~60% compared to ~80% of CAP1B cells). Moreover, Atf3 is also increased in the venous EC population of H1N1-infected lungs. Can the authors better define the contribution of the non-CAP1B cells to the alveolar regeneration described here given that the Atf3 reporter line will label collectively these cells?</p><p>4. In Figure 2F-G: please provide a higher resolution picture for both PBS and H1N1 panels including EndoM1 staining shown in a separate channel to illustrate more clearly the expansion of the ATF3 lineage labeled ECs.</p><p>5. iI Figure 3D, G the authors use alveolar area (umm2) as a parameter to assess alveolar destruction or inability to repair, however in separate experiments (Figure 3, S2E) Mean Linear Intercept was used, instead. Was there any specific reason for that, since both are intended to detect integrity/ enlargement of alveolar spaces?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>– The authors should reanalyze their scRNA-seq data after integration of both datasets, and clarify their cluster annotations, specifically how Cap1_A and Cap1_B were identified. Differential gene expression between these two populations would be informative for the readers.</p><p>– It is of extreme importance that the authors verify the deletion of Atf3 in their mutant mouse and quantify it.</p><p>– It would benefit the field and strengthen the impact of the manuscript if the authors assessed the alveolar changes in their model considering other cell types, specifically endothelial cells.</p><p>– It is crucial that more clarification is provided as to how the regions of viral damage were selected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are several points that need to be considered:</p><p>1. Based on feature plots in Figure 1S2, Atf3+ CAP1_B is mostly negative for proliferative gene Mki67. The discrepancy between this data and the EdU results needs to be explained.</p><p>2. In Figures 1A and B, Atf3 is also expressed by venous ECs, and the venous population seems to increase after injury. These cells may contribute to the increased CD31+/EdU+ population as well.</p><p>3. Some validation of signaling or downstream genes in mouse lungs is required in Figure 4.</p><p>4. The underlying mechanism of Atf3-medicated apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in lung ECs is unclear.</p><p>5. In Figure 1, control and H1N1-infected lung datasets were analyzed separately. The annotation may need to be done after the integration of the two datasets first to keep things consistent.</p><p>6. Flow cytometry plots are lacking in Figure 2C-E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83835.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Our results show that Atf3 wild-type and knockout mice have similar levels of tissue damage, and we have added a supplemental figure demonstrating these data (new Figure 3 —figure supplement 2).

Please clarify how exactly were the regions of viral damage selected</p></disp-quote><p>H1N1 influenza injury in mice is heterogeneous, with regions of severe alveolar destruction marked by densely packed immune cells, adjacent regions of damaged tissue, and regions of tissue that appear to have normal tissue structure, as we and others have previously described (Zacharias, Frank et al., <italic>Nature</italic> 2018; Liberti et al., <italic>Cell Reports</italic> 2021; Niethamer et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). However, it has become increasingly apparent that these regions where tissue structure appears normal are actually regions of active regeneration, and endothelial cell proliferation is increased in these regions (Niethamer et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020). We therefore selected 20X fields in these areas to use for quantifying alveolar area, as these are actively regenerating regions where alveolar structures are present for quantification. Because of the changes to tissue structure seen in damaged or destroyed tissue areas, we did not select these regions for quantification, although they were present at similar frequency in Atf3 wild-type and knockout animals (point #1 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1S2, Atf3+ CAP1_B is mostly negative for proliferative gene Mki67. The discrepancy between this data and the EdU results needs to be explained. Also, in Figure 1A&amp;B, Atf3 is expressed by the population of venous ECs that seems to increase after injury. Please clarify if these cells may contribute to the increased CD31+/EdU+ population.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference between the expression of the gene <italic>Mki67</italic> in our scRNA-seq data and the EdU incorporation in vivo can be explained by the differences in methodology. Our scRNA-seq data is collected at a single time point of 14 days post infection (dpi), whereas animals treated with EdU received it in their drinking water over the course of one week from 7-14 dpi or from 14-21 dpi. These time windows were chosen based on the increases in endothelial proliferation seen during these time periods in Niethamer et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020. In addition, the proliferating endothelial cells cluster separately in the scRNA-seq analysis and also express <italic>Atf3</italic>. To further clarify the relative expression of <italic>Atf3</italic> in different endothelial subtypes, we have also added violin plots to Figure 1 demonstrating relative <italic>Atf3</italic> expression in each endothelial cell cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have only a few comments for clarification and improvement of the manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors point to several reports implicating Atf3 in controlling the inflammatory response post-injury and they find an increase in cytokine expression in Atf3 null lungs post-influenza. However, it is not clear from the lung sections (H&amp;E and IF) the extent to which H1N1-mediated inflammation is present in Atf3-deficient mice.</p><p>2. Please clarify why the aberrant induction of metaplastic Krt5+&quot;pods&quot; by influenza infection is not seen in Atf3-deficient mice (which show abnormal alveolar repair). It is unclear how preventing the expansion of the CAP1B population would not reveal this feature of the H1N1 lung phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the point #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Although ATf3 is enriched in CAP1B ECs, the U-Map representation of Atf3 (Figure 1.S1B) shows still a sizable population of CAP1A cells expressing this transcription factor (also: dot plot in S1H ~60% compared to ~80% of CAP1B cells). Moreover, Atf3 is also increased in the venous EC population of H1N1-infected lungs. Can the authors better define the contribution of the non-CAP1B cells to the alveolar regeneration described here given that the Atf3 reporter line will label collectively these cells?</p><p>4. In Figure 2F-G: please provide a higher resolution picture for both PBS and H1N1 panels including EndoM1 staining shown in a separate channel to illustrate more clearly the expansion of the ATF3 lineage labeled ECs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added violin plots to Figure 1, which we feel will better represent the greater <italic>Atf3</italic> expression in CAP1_Bs relative to other endothelial cell subtypes. The reviewer is correct that Atf3-expressing cells are found in large vessels, but they are also numerous in the alveolar capillary space and increase with influenza in these regions. We have added lower-magnification, higher-resolution images of <italic>Atf3<sup>CreER</sup>; ROSA26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> animals, both control and influenza-infected, to illustrate this expansion in a new Figure 2 —figure supplement 3. This increase is also quantified in Figure 2C. We have also clarified this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. iI Figure 3D, G the authors use alveolar area (umm2) as a parameter to assess alveolar destruction or inability to repair, however in separate experiments (Figure 3, S2E) Mean Linear Intercept was used, instead. Was there any specific reason for that, since both are intended to detect integrity/ enlargement of alveolar spaces?</p></disp-quote><p>The mean linear intercept algorithm used in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2 does not perform well on influenza-infected tissue because of the heterogeneity in tissue structure seen in the H1N1-infected animals. We therefore used it for the homeostasis experiment shown in this figure. For the sake of consistency, we have repeated our analysis of these animals using alveolar area quantification and have added this analysis to the existing figure. We have added to the text to clarify this point and have also clarified our choice of regions for both types of analysis (please see point #4 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are several points that need to be considered:</p><p>1.
