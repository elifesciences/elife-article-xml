To comprehensively identify IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, we assembled a CRISPR sgRNA library of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) into a modified lentiviral vector that allows for packaging of sgRNA-encoding genomes <italic>in trans</italic> into budding HIV-1 particles. We observed that knockout of Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) improved the performance of the screen due to ZAP-mediated inhibition of the vector. A small panel of IFN-induced HIV restriction factors, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin/BST2 and TRIM5alpha together explain the inhibitory effects of IFN on the CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 strain, HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>, in THP-1 cells. A second screen with a CCR5-tropic primary strain, HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub>, described an overlapping, but non-identical, panel of restriction factors. Further, this screen also identifies HIV dependency factors. The ability of IFN-induced restriction factors to inhibit HIV strains to replicate in human cells suggests that these human restriction factors are incompletely antagonized.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

The method allowed Ohainle et al. to make precise, targeted changes to thousands of genes that are turned on by interferon, and deactivate them. The experiments revealed that HIV multiplied better in human cells in which several specific genes had been neutralized. This suggests that these genes encode restriction factors that are activated by interferon to combat HIV. The combined action of a few of these proteins can fight the virus, even if it cannot completely eradicate it. Further experiments found that a different, but overlapping set of restriction factors defended cells against a different strain of HIV.</p><p>The method developed by Ohainle et al. is a useful tool to identify new restriction factors. By dissecting the role of these proteins in keeping different HIV strains under control, we may understand how the virus has become dangerous for humans by evading some of these defenses.

Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) transmission from African Old World primates to chimpanzees yielded the recombinant virus SIVcpz, which ultimately crossed into humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>). Successful replication of lentiviruses in a new host species required adaptation to restriction factors in the new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Etienne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Etienne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kirmaier et al., 2010</xref>). Restriction factors that target primate lentiviruses include TRIM5alpha, MxB, Tetherin, SAMHD1, the APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malim and Bieniasz, 2012</xref>) and more recently described factors such as SERINC3/5, Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP), GBP5, SLFN11, LGALS3BP (90K), the HUSH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chougui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krapp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lodermeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Takata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Usami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yurkovetskiy et al., 2018</xref>), as well as nearly 200 other proposed factors (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gélinas et al., 2018</xref>). HIV-1 has evolved accessory proteins that degrade many host restriction factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duggal and Emerman, 2012</xref>). Further, mutations preventing recognition by restriction factors, such as evolution of low CG dinucleotide content in the HIV-1 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Takata et al., 2017</xref>) or mutations in capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kirmaier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wu et al., 2013</xref>), represent another mechanism of escape.</p><p>Many restriction factors that target HIV-1 are induced by type I Interferon (IFN) and are therefore Interferon-Stimulated Genes (ISGs). Interferon has been implicated in at least partial control of HIV replication in chronically-infected individuals treated with IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asmuth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Azzoni et al., 2013</xref>) as well as in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sandler et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, IFN levels have also been correlated with higher viral load and decreased CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hardy et al., 2013</xref>). Further, it appears that ISG expression exerts changing selective pressure on HIV evolution in vivo since transmitted/founder (T/F) strains are relatively resistant to IFN compared to viruses isolated later in infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fenton-May et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Iyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Parrish et al., 2013</xref>). It remains to be determined if one dominant ISG mediates all or most of the IFN inhibition, or if a multitude of antiviral ISGs together limit viral replication in response to IFN.</p><p>The HIV-1 LAI strain (HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>) was isolated from a chronically-infected individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wain-Hobson et al., 1991</xref>) and is sensitive to type I IFN. Specifically, potent IFNα inhibition of HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> can be observed in the THP-1 monocytic cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goujon and Malim, 2010</xref>). MxB, an interferon-induced GTPase that binds to and blocks lentiviral capsids, was identified as an IFNα-induced factor in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), although the role of MxB in the IFNα-induced inhibition of HIV infection in these cells has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Opp et al., 2015</xref>). Restriction factors have previously been discovered through cDNA library screening or by comparing expression of transcript levels in permissive versus non-permissive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sheehy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stremlau et al., 2004</xref>). More high-throughput approaches to find HIV restriction factors have focused on either overexpression screens to identify broad antiviral ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>) or HIV-specific antiviral ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kane et al., 2016</xref>). Further, one screen for HIV restriction factors was also performed by transfection of siRNA pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). However, a more complete understanding of the constellation of restriction factors that inhibit HIV in human cells and a more tractable, high-throughput method to discover restriction factors remains to be described.</p><p>Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout functional screening method in which lentiviral genomes encoding CRISPR sgRNAs are packaged into budding HIV virions, allowing robust identification of HIV restriction factors and dependency factors in a high-throughput manner. Cas9 endonuclease and sgRNA are delivered to cells in a vector that is modified to be transcribed and subsequently packaged in trans by the infecting HIV virus. Deep sequencing of packaged HIV-CRISPR RNA in nascent HIV virions released from pooled KO cells serves to proxy the efficiency of HIV replication in each genetic knockout. Thereby, our approach allows for targeted gene knockout and a functional assay simultaneously across thousands of genes in a heterogeneous population of cells. Furthermore, as read-out of the functional assay is done of at the level of newly budded viruses, the approach allows for screening of restrictions factors affecting the full HIV life cycle. We find a small panel of ISGs to mediate IFN inhibition of HIV-1 in THP-1 cells, including MxB, TRIM5alpha, IFITM1 and Tetherin. We find that restriction factor sensitivity is, in part, strain-dependent. Further, this approach can as be used to identify HIV dependency factors as we identify CD169, SEC62 and TLR2 as host factors in THP-1 cells. The results presented here suggest that adaptation of primate lentiviruses to humans is incomplete as the same host restriction factors that block cross-species transmission also play a role in limiting the replication of highly-adapted HIV-1 in IFN-stimulated cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An ISG-specific knockout screen that packages sgRNA-encoding lentiviral genomes into HIV virions</title><p>IFNα inhibits HIV<sub>LAI</sub> replication in THP-1 cells 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>). To identify the factor(s) mediating the IFNα-induced inhibition of HIV, we designed a novel HIV-based CRISPR screen in which the virus itself serves as a reporter. Cells which lack a dependency factor due to CRISPR-mediated gene knockout will release less virus, whereas cells which lack a restriction factor will produce more virus as compared to control cells which containing single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences that do not target any human genes, Non-Targeting Controls (NTCs). We engineered a Cas9 and sgRNA-encoding lentiviral vector such that sgRNA-encoding genomic RNA can be packaged in trans by budding HIV virions. Therefore, the normalized abundance of Cas9/sgRNA-encoding genomes themselves are the direct readout for the functional activity of each gene knockout on viral replication. Importantly, this approach allows for assay of effects of gene knockout on a complete round of viral replication.</p><p>Standard Self-Inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors contain a deletion in the Long-Terminal Repeat (LTR) sequence that encodes transcription factor binding sites in wild type HIV sequences. The lentiCRISPRv2 lentiviral vector contains a SIN LTR and, therefore, full-length genomic lentiviral RNA is not transcribed after integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shalem et al., 2014a</xref>). To create a version of the lentiCRISPR vector that can be mobilized after HIV infection, we repaired the 3’ LTR with a complete HIV-1 LTR. Thus, the HIV-CRISPR vector maintains complete HIV-1 LTR sequences on integration. We call this transcription- and packaging-competent construct HIV-CRISPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Importantly, in addition to internal promoters driving Cas9 and sgRNA transcription, full-length HIV-CRISPR genomic RNA is also produced after transcription from the LTR. More robust replication will occur specifically in cells that have been deleted of an antiviral factor. The enhanced release of antiviral factor-targeting HIV-CRISPR genomes occurs at a higher frequency than control sgRNAs or most sgRNAs in the library that target genes with no effect on HIV replication. Therefore, any sgRNA that targets a gene that inhibits viral replication will be enriched in the virions. Infecting HIV viruses serve to readout efficiency of HIV replication in each knockout cell through deep sequencing of packaged HIV-CRISPR RNA in secreted HIV virions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39823.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The HIV-CRISPR screen identifies gene knockouts that increase and decrease HIV infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The deletion in the U3 region of the SIN LTR vector (lentiCRISPRv2) was repaired by inserting the full-length HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> LTR sequence to create the HIV-CRISPR construct.

Thus, the library is also enriched in genes that are specifically expressed in HIV target cells. For each of the 1905 ISGs present in our library, we selected a total of 8 sgRNA sequences from existing human whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doench et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sanjana et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shalem et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shalem et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). 200 Non-Targeting Control (NTC) sgRNA sequences that are not predicted to target any loci in the human genome were also included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shalem et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

The enrichment or depletion of sgRNA sequences in the viral RNA (vRNA) as compared to the genomic DNA (gDNA) of the cells is quantified through sequencing of sgRNA sequences both in released HIV particles and integrated into the cellular genomic DNA. sgRNAs that target antiviral genes (restriction factors) are overrepresented in viral supernatants due to more robust viral replication specifically in these KO cells. Conversely, sgRNAs that target dependency factors are depleted in viral supernatants due to decreased viral replication specifically in these KO cells.</p><p>To perform the screen, 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> THP-1 cells were transduced with the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> library at an MOI &lt;1 (MOI = 0.6) to create a population of cells with single HIV-CRISPR integrations at &gt;500X coverage. THP-1/PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> cells were split in two independent replicates and left untreated or treated with IFNα overnight. Each replicate was then infected with HIV-1 at a dose that infects 50% of cells without IFNα treatment. Secreted virus was collected 3 days after infection, and sgRNA sequences encoded by HIV-CRISPR genomic RNA packaged into budding HIV virions were amplified by RT-PCR and quantitated through deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). THP-1/PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> cells were collected in parallel at the time of viral supernatant harvest and the genomic DNA (gDNA) was also deep sequenced. We compared the relative enrichment of HIV-CRISPR sgRNA sequences in the viral RNA (vRNA) to the genomic DNA (gDNA) to find enriched and depleted sgRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). Relative to the NTCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, gray circles), there were a number of sgRNA sequences that were either enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and 500 most enriched sgRNAs in cyan) or depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and 500 most depleted sgRNAs in orange) in the viral supernatant as compared to the NTCs. Since each gene in the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> library is targeted by eight individual sgRNAs, we analyzed the enrichment across all sgRNAs for a gene using the MAGeCK package across both duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2014</xref>). We identified the type I IFN pathway genes, STAT1, IFNAR1, STAT2 and IRF9 as the highest-scoring hits (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>). Therefore, the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen functioned as designed: cells in which IFN signaling is compromised exhibited increased viral production and, therefore, enriched HIV-CRISPR representation of sgRNAs in the secreted HIV virions. After the IFN pathway genes, the Zinc Antiviral Protein (ZAP) and its modifier TRIM25 were the next to highest scoring hits. ZAP is an antiviral effector that has potent activity against alphaviruses as well as moderate activity against retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kerns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Takata et al., 2017</xref>). TRIM25 is a gene known to modify ZAP’s antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, it was shown that ZAP blocks virus replication by degrading transcripts with a high CG dinucleotide content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Takata et al., 2017</xref>). We also find NEDD4 Binding Protein 1 (N4BP1), a poorly-characterized inhibitor of the E3 ligase ITCH in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Oberst et al., 2007</xref>) that has not been previously known for antiretroviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; cyan). N4BP1 encodes RNA binding domains and is proposed to have RNase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anantharaman and Aravind, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An iterative PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen in ZAP-KO cells identifies a panel of ISGs that inhibit HIV in THP-1 cells</title><p>To ask if ZAP or N4BP1 inhibit HIV replication we generated ZAP and N4BP1 knockout (KO) cell lines by electroporating crRNA/Cas9 complexes (crRNPs) into THP-1 cells followed by single-cell cloning. Knockout of either gene only very modestly increased infection by HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Therefore, the IFN-induced restriction factors that potently inhibit HIV in THP-1 cells were not identified in this initial screen. Analysis of the CG dinucleotide content across the HIV-CRISPR genome shows high levels of CG dinucleotides, particularly in the Cas9 and Puromycin resistance ORFs, that are potential targets for ZAP-mediated RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Given its role in degradation of RNA with high CG content, we hypothesized that ZAP could inhibit the full-length HIV-CRISPR genomic RNA that is packaged into budding virions rather than the wt HIV genome. Thus, we determined whether or not ZAP KO allows for increased packaging of the HIV-CRISPR vector in viral particles released from cells by measuring both wild type HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> genomes (HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>; black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and HIV-CRISPR genomes (HIV-CRISPR; gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) with a ddPCR assay.

As expected for a screen in ZAP-KO cells, ZAP was no longer a significantly-scoring hit in the screen (rank # 1647/3812 in combined ZAP-KO screen data; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In addition, there was also no enrichment of N4BP1 or TRIM25 in the ZAP-KO screens (rank # 3789/3812 and 3090/3812 in combined ZAP-KO screen data; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitory activity of N4BP1 and TRIM25 in the HIV-CRISPR screen are ZAP-dependent. To ask if N4BP1 is a novel modifier of ZAP antiviral activity we screened ZAP-KO and N4BP1-KO cell lines for changes in susceptibility to Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) infection. SFV is an alphavirus that is highly-susceptible to ZAP-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bick et al., 2003</xref>). While ZAP KO rescued SFV replication significantly, we saw no effect of N4BP1 KO on SFV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, N4BP1 may be a novel modifier of ZAP antiviral activity against lentiviruses. However, it does not appear to play a role in ZAP inhibition of alphaviruses.</p><p>Without ZAP-mediated inhibition of the HIV-CRISPR vector in ZAP-KO THP-1 cells we would expect the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen to more efficiently identify ISGs inhibiting HIV infection. Since ZAP-KO results in increased HIV-CRISPR expression and/or packaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) we would expect increased HIV-CRISPR representation in viral supernatants and, therefore, better sampling and therefore better correlation in read counts across duplicate infections. We assessed whether or not ZAP knockout improves performance of the HIV-CRISPR screen by analyzing read counts across duplicates in the two independent ZAP-KO THP-1 clonal lines and compared the results to the screen performed in wild-type THP-1 cells. Indeed, there was better correlation in sgRNA representation across replicates performed in ZAP-KO THP-1 cells as compared to control THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 and 0.94 for the ZAP-KO screens as compared to r<sup>2</sup> = 0.87 for the screen in wild type THP-1 cells). Further, an analysis specifically across the four genes that are well-described components of the type I IFN pathway also showed increased Gene Scores in the ZAP-KO THP-1 clonal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).Therefore, deletion of ZAP-mediated inhibition from THP-1 cells improves performance of the HIV-CRISPR screen.</p><p>By multiplying gene scores from both ZAP-KO screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; MAGeCK score on x-axis) we identified a list of candidate hits. To ask which genes are most likely to contribute specifically to the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1, we calculated the level of IFN induction of each of the top hits from an existing THP-1 microarray dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; IFN log<sub>2</sub>FC on y-axis and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). No hit scored as highly as the type I IFN pathway genes (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, multiple genes, rather than a single ISG, are responsible for the IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV infection in THP-1 cells. Further, a small subset of genes, including MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin, TRIM5alpha, UBE2L6, LGALS3BP/90K and SAMD9L, are candidate restriction factors mediating the IFN inhibition of HIV-1 in THP-1 cells. MxB, IFITM1, Tetherin and TRIM5alpha are the most significantly-scoring hits in the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen that are also highly-induced by IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). All have well-described anti-lentiviral functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malim and Bieniasz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stremlau et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen identified IFN-induced restriction factors in a massively-parallel approach assaying all gene targets simultaneously in pools of knockout cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MxB is a dominant mediator of the IFN inhibition of HIV-1 in THP-1 cells but its activity depends on the route of viral entry</title><p>To determine the relative importance of MxB to the IFN-induced block to infection, we created MxB KO THP-1 cells.

However, in that study restriction against VSV-G pseudotyped HIV was measured rather than against a virus with a wildtype HIV envelope. Viral entry is a key target of potent IFN-mediated restriction, specifically by ISGs such as IFITMs, a family of 5 membrane-resident antiviral genes in humans with broad antiviral effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). IFITMs restrict viruses that enter cells by fusion at the plasma membrane or in the endosome. We hypothesized that sensitivity to MxB restriction may be dependent on the viral envelope since our previous work has shown that restriction of lentiviruses using distinct entry pathways are differentially affected by ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Roesch et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we tested the MxB-KO cells for IFN-mediated restriction of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1. We found that while the IFN inhibition in the MxB-KO clonal lines is significantly lower than that of control clonal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; p = 0.014 unpaired t test), there is still a large inhibition of replication of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 by IFNα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; 53-Fold). Thus, one or more ISGs induced by IFNα potently block VSV-G mediated entry in THP-1 cells independent of MxB. To ask what factors mediate this block, we repeated the HIV-CRISPR screen with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 in THP-1 cells that were knocked out for ZAP. In contrast to the screen with wildtype virus, the antiviral proteins IFITM3 is the most significantly-scoring hit, along with IFITM1, IFITM2, TRIM5alpha and Tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). MxB ranks as hit #74 in this screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) suggesting that MxB does still inhibit VSV-G pseudotyped virus but that its effect is largely masked by more potent inhibition of the VSV-G envelope by IFITM3 and other ISGs. This suggests that IFITMs are the dominant IFN-induced blocks to replication when HIV-1 is pseudotyped with the VSV-G envelope. Significant overlap in sequence across IFITM orthologues complicates interpretation of the screen data in terms of which IFITMs are most important, as some sgRNAs in our library likely target multiple IFITM loci. However, these results show that while MxB does play a role in the IFN-mediated inhibition of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses (compare MxB-KO cells to NTCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), this effect is masked by dominant IFITM inhibition of these VSV-G pseudotyped viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similar results have been reported recently elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, viral entry route impacts restriction factor sensitivity and the role of MxB in IFN inhibition of HIV-1 in THP-1s is partially-masked by other ISGs when HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> is pseudotyped by VSV-G.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TRIM5alpha, IFITM1 and Tetherin are additional ISGs that contribute to the IFN block</title><p>We were surprised to find TRIM5alpha and Tetherin in this screen as HIV-1 is thought to be highly-adapted to these human restriction factors.

CD169 is upregulated by IFNα in THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> – gray = untreated, purple =+IFN, left panel). Our screen only assays cell-autonomous effects suggesting that CD169 also plays a role in cis-infection of monocytic cells, consistent with recent work showing enhanced infection of THP-1 cells by CD169, specifically in the presence of IFNα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, when CD169 expression is knocked-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right panel) these cells are less susceptible to infection both in the presence and absence of IFN pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), although this effect is stronger in presence of IFNα (6.5-fold vs 4.7-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, we find that Siglec-1/CD169 is an IFN-induced, HIV dependency factor in THP-1 cells.</p><p>TLR2, a toll-like receptor characterized to recognize bacterial PAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira et al., 2006</xref>) is the next highest-scoring hit in our dependency factor analysis. We generated TLR2-KO and CXCR4-KO THP-1 cell pools by transduction with lentiCRISPRv2 sgRNA constructs and verified KO through ICE analysis of the CXCR4 genomic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, top) or cell surface staining of TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom; NTCs in gray and TLR2-KO pools in green). Infection of these cells with wildtype HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> demonstrates lower infection as compared to the controls, although this effect is not as extreme as for CXCR4 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> left panel; 31-fold decreased infection for CXCR4-KO lines in orange, 3-fold for TLR2-KO lines in green). Of note, infection with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 shows a loss of infectivity similar to wild-type HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> bottom right panel). Therefore the effect of TLR2 on enhanced infection is independent of viral entry. Conversely, the CXCR4-KO lines are efficiently infected by VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 (orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, right panel) as entry occurs independent of the CXCR4 co-receptor.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the effect of SEC62, on HIV replication. SEC62 is a component of the protein translocation machinery in the ER membrane. Knockdown of SEC62 by transducing THP-1 cells with two lentiviral shRNA constructs targeting SEC62 showed significant loss of expression as measured by Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Infection of these cells with wildtype HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> showed decreased levels of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, left panel). Therefore, SEC62 is a dependency factor for HIV replication in THP-1 cells. As SEC62 is a component of the machinery that mediates translocation of transmembrane proteins into the ER membrane for targeting to the cell surface, we reasoned that SEC62 knockdown may be affecting cell-surface expression of HIV receptors, co-receptors or other cell-surface markers mediating attachment and/or entry of HIV. Consistent with this hypothesis, infection via an alternative entry pathway via pseudotyping HIV-1 particles with VSV-G, demonstrates equivalent infection in control and SEC62 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, right panel). Analysis of the cell surface expression of the HIV-1 receptor, CD4, shows that levels of CD4 on the cell surface are decreased in SEC62 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, we do not observe decreased cell-surface expression of CXCR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, right panel), suggesting that the effect of SEC62 knockdown on cell surface proteins is not global but specific to certain transmembrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PIKA<sub>HIV</sub>screen with an R5-tropic HIV-1 subtype A virus</title><p>To ask if the same restriction factor and dependency factor genes are important for replication of a primary HIV isolate, we repeated the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screening with a CCR5-tropic Clade A HIV-1 virus derived from a molecular clone containing sequences of two primary HIV isolate,HIV-1<sub>Q23</sub> and HIV-1<sub>BG505</sub>, here called HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haddox et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Poss and Overbaugh, 1999</xref>).

Such incomplete antagonism may be due to conflicting evolutionary pressures acting on the HIV genome.

Consistent with a role for TRIM5alpha in humans, TRIM5alpha is active against HIV in Langerhans cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ribeiro et al., 2016</xref>) and TRIM5alpha polymorphisms are associated with the clinical course of HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van Manen et al., 2008</xref>). Further, CA mutations in HIV-infected individuals have been associated with sensitivity to TRIM5alpha restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Battivelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Onyango et al., 2010</xref>). Also of note, most studies of HIV have not been done in the context of IFN despite evidence that TRIM5alpha is highly-IFN upregulated in HIV target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carthagena et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, our finding of IFN-mediated TRIM5alpha inhibition of HIV represents a potentially-important role of TRIM5alpha particularly during acute infection when IFN levels are high. More stable artificial variants of human TRIM5alpha can inhibit HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that increased TRIM5alpha levels, such as after IFN induction, may play a role in restricting HIV replication. Evasion of TRIM5alpha restriction may come at the cost of loss of fitness due to other requirements for capsid function within host cells such as uncoating, nuclear import and integration. Further, capsid sequences also mediate evasion of other restriction factors, including MxB, or escape from host CTL responses. Primary isolates of HIV-1 have increased sensitivity to TRIM5alpha that is proposed to be driven by CTL escape variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Battivelli et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that this TRIM5alpha sensitivity may underscore the requirement of HIV proteins to balance multiple functions simultaneously to infect human cells. Like TRIM5alpha, escape from IFITMs also appears to be subject to conflicting evolutionary pressures. IFITMs may exert significant selective pressure in vivo as HIV evolves increased susceptibility to IFITMs over the course of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foster et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to basic required functions of HIV proteins, we further propose that further adaptation of HIV for efficient replication in human cells may not be possible due to constraints on viral evolution imposed simultaneously by multiple, independent restriction factor barriers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Comparison of restriction factors against different viral strains using HIV-CRISPR screens</title><p>MxB, TRIM5alpha, UBE2L6 and IFITM1 are strong hits in both the HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> and the HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub> screens (cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) suggesting that these ISGs inhibit a range of HIV isolates. UBE2L6 has recently been shown to inhibit HIV in an overexpression assay and is antagonized by Vpu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jain et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, several other ISGs scored highly in the HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen but not the HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub> screen including LGALS3BP (also known as 90K or M2BP), SAMD9L and Tetherin/BST2 (dark blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). UBE2L6 and 90K inhibit HIV in over-expression assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lodermeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and SAMD9L was recently shown to be an IFN-induced restriction factor for poxviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Meng et al., 2018</xref>). Tetherin/BST2, LGALS3BP/90K/M2BP and SAMD9L therefore show differential, strain-dependent restriction. Finally, the HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub> screen reveals one factor, IFI16, that is a strong hit in the HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub> screen but not the HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> screen (Green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). IFI16 is a dsDNA sensor that has been implicated in sensing and inhibition of HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jakobsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Monroe et al., 2014</xref>). Our results here suggest that IFI16 restricts HIV-1 in THP-1 cells in a strain-dependent manner.</p><p>Similar to TRIM5alpha, our finding of inhibition of wt HIV by Tetherin despite intact Vpu expression may suggest a functional tradeoff in which HIV Vpu is unable to completely antagonize host cell Tetherin activity. It has previously been shown that primary HIV isolates better antagonize Tetherin as compared to HIV-1 NL4-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pickering et al., 2014</xref>) which may explain why Tetherin is a hit in the screen using HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub>, but not HIV-1 <sub>Q23.BG505</sub>. Adaptation HIV-1 group M to the unique form of human Tetherin allele required evolution of the viral protein Vpu to antagonize Tetherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kmiec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sauter et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with conflicting evolutionary constraints, IFN treatment in HCV- and HIV- coinfected patients resulted in evolution of Vpu variants with stronger Tetherin antagonism when ISGs are expressed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>). Perhaps more complete antagonism of Tetherin by Vpu would compromise some of the other functions of Vpu in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Apps et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Margottin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schubert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shah et al., 2010</xref>). Further, a moderate level of Tetherin antagonism could be selected for if cell-to-cell transmission is enhanced by Tetherin restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gummuluru et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>), such as is observed for MoMLV in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liberatore et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, Vpu counteracts UBE2L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jain et al., 2018</xref>) which we describe as an inhibitor of both HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> and HIV-1<sub>Q23.BG505</sub> suggesting that Vpu from both viruses are unable to fully counteract UBE2L6 in IFN-treated THP-1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ZAP inhibition of a lentiviral vector</title><p>We found that ZAP mediates a small, but detectable inhibition of HIV replication as we find enhanced infection of ZAP-KO cells both in the presence and absence of IFN pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 - Supplemental Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Similar to the effect of ZAP, N4BP1 (Nedd4-binding protein 1) also has a modest effect on HIV replication both after IFN pretreatment and when constitutively-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 - Supplemental Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). In our screen, the anti-lentiviral function of N4BP1 appears to be genetically linked to ZAP activity as N4BP1 is no longer a hit in the ZAP-KO screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – Supplemental Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, N4BP1 may modify or enhance ZAP-mediated antiviral activity similar to the modification of ZAP activity described for TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, we did not find a role for N4BP1 in ZAP-mediated inhibition of SFV (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2 – Supplemental Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, the role of N4BP1 in ZAP’s antiviral activity varies depending on the viral target.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The HIV-CRISPR screening approach</title><p>Other high-throughput screens with siRNA pools have focused on identifying dependency factors that the virus takes advantage of to infect cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brass et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">König et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, all of these high-throughput approaches still require individual gene knockdowns or overexpression in individual wells. The HIV-CRISPR screening approach represents a significant advance in screening for host factors that affect HIV replication in several ways, including: (1) we can simultaneously screen thousands of gene targets in a single experiment, (2) we can use any virus strain, (3) we do not need any type of reporter to assay infections as virus replication itself provides the assay readout and (4) we can capture host factors that affect all stages of the HIV life-cycle including entry, nuclear import, integration, transcription, nuclear export, translation, packaging, budding and release. After finding ZAP-mediated inhibition of the HIV-CRISPR vector used in our screening approach, we modified our PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screen to avoid this inhibition by specific KO of ZAP expression and rescreening in ZAP-KO THP-1 clonal lines. Genetic deletion of ZAP resulted in enhanced performance of the HIV-CRISPR screen and allowed for our identification of ISGs contributing to the IFN block in THP-1 cells. Further the data presented here demonstrates that the screen is sensitive enough to find key factors in just a single round of viral replication, even when multiple factors together mediate potent inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>HIV-CRISPR screening can identify HIV dependency factors</title><p>Despite targeting less than 10% of the genes in the human genome by our PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> library, we were able to identify and validate a small panel of HIV dependency factors that HIV usurps to enhance infection in THP-1 cells. We demonstrate that the HIV attachment factor, SIGLEC1/CD169, plays a role in enhancing infection in THP-1 cells in cis rather than the more fully described role of SIGLEC1 to mediate infection from dendritic cells to T cells in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Izquierdo-Useros et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Puryear et al., 2013</xref>). Further, we find that TLR2 mediates enhanced infection of THP-1 cells by HIV-1 regardless of viral entry pathway used, as it impacted infection through both the HIV envelope and the VSV-G glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Recent work in CD4 +T cells has similarly demonstrated enhanced infection and/or viral production in T cells on stimulation of TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolduc et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ding and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Equils et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Henrick et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, MYD88, a downstream effector for TLR2 activation of transcription, is also a strong hit in our dependency factor screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) suggesting that it is the downstream signaling functions of TLR2 that enhance infection. In addition to CD169 and TLR2, our identification of SEC62 as a novel HIV dependency factor that correlates with CD4 receptor cell surface expression highlights the ability of the HIV-CRISPR screening approach to find genes that function in pathways (such as CD4 receptor expression) important for HIV infection. Finally, as would be expected, NFKB1 is a dependency factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) as it is a precursor to a downstream activator of the HIV LTR that is important for HIV infection, although somewhat surprisingly NFKB2 is a restriction factor in the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, HIV-CRISPR screens have the capability of identifying pathways of both positive and negative HIV regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Comparison with other HIV CRISPR screens</title><p>A recent CRISPR knockout screen demonstrated that a pooled CRISPR approach to gene knockout could identify HIV dependency factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Park et al., 2017</xref>). The Park <italic>et al.</italic> study differs from our study in several key aspects. The screen by Park <italic>et al.</italic> relied on Tat-driven LTR-GFP reporter gene expression as well as many rounds of spreading infection across multiple weeks in culture in a T cell line. In contrast, PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screening is performed over a single round of infection in three days in the THP-1 monocytic cell line with the screen relying on virus replication itself to enrich for gene targets of interest rather than selecting on a reporter gene. Further, Park et al screened with a whole-genome library while our screening has been performed with an ISG-specific sgRNA library (PIKA<sub>HIV</sub>). Moreover, we screened in the presence of IFN with a specific focus on finding HIV restriction factors, whereas Park et al. specifically screened for HIV dependency factors. Both screens do identify the appropriate HIV co-receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5 in our study and CCR5 in the Park et al. study). Of note, 3 of the five genes identified by Park et al. (TPST2, SLC35B2 and CD4) are not represented in the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> library and, therefore, could not be identified in our screen. The final gene identified by Park et al., ALCAM, is not found as a hit in our screening and may reflect important differences in cell type or other technical aspects of the screening approaches. For example, the genes identified by Park et al. are the HIV receptor or co-receptor (CD4, CCR5), genes that affect CCR5 expression (TPST2 and SLC35B2) or genes that affect the ability of cells to complex with other cells (ALCAM). It is possible that the Park et al. screen may, therefore, reflect the loss of the ability of these KO cells to support syncytia formation rather than a loss of HIV infection per se. Some hits identified in our PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screening were not found in the Park et al. study, including SEC62, TLR2 and SIGLEC1/CD169. We hypothesize that differences in cell type, viral strains and screening approach likely explain these differences. Further studies using a whole genome HIV-CRISPR library should more comprehensively identify further HIV dependency factors that are not present in the PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> library.</p><p>In summary, here we describe a novel screen that is highly sensitive to detect restriction factors for HIV-1. This new tool shows that the IFN inhibition of HIV-1 in a monocytic cell line is due the combined function of fewer than eight different genes. Our results demonstrate that IFN-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 in THP-1 cells is mediated by restriction factors for which HIV has described mechanisms of antagonism and/or escape. The increased IFN sensitivity of specific HIV strains, such as those isolated during chronic HIV infection, may be due to relaxation of constraints on the virus that would otherwise limit virus replication during transmission events. We propose that conflicting functional constraints acting on HIV may result in incomplete antagonism or escape from host ISGs during chronic infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

For the GSE46599 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goujon et al., 2013</xref>), raw probe-level signal intensities from Illumina HumanHT-12 V4.0 expression BeadChip data were retrieved from GEO, then background-corrected, quantile-normalized and log<sub>2</sub>-transformed using the Bioconductor package lumi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Du et al., 2008</xref>). Fold changes (FC) in expression between type I IFN-treated and untreated samples were calculated for untreated and PMA-treated THP-1 cells, primary CD4+ T cells and primary macrophages. For THP-1 cells, genes with FC ≥2 were selected. For primary cells, genes with a donor-specific FC ≥2 in at least 2 out of 3 donors were selected. For the GSE60424 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Linsley et al., 2014</xref>), TMM normalized RNA-seq read count data (Illumina HiScan) were retrieved from GEO. FC in expression in whole blood, isolated CD4 +T cells and monocytes of a Multiple Sclerosis patient, pre- and post-treatment with AVONEX (IFNβ), were calculated and genes with FC ≥2 were selected. For the GSE72502 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hung et al., 2015</xref>), de novo identification of differentially-expressed genes in IFNα treated PBMCs was performed from the raw RNA sequencing data (Illumina Genome Analyzer). SRA files were retrieved from GEO and converted to FASTQ format using NCBI’s SRA toolkit. Reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using GSNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wu et al., 2016</xref>) and quantified using HTSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Differentially-expressed (DE) genes were identified using the Bioconductor edgeR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). DE genes were defined at an FDR threshold of 0.05. The glmTreat function was used to detect genes with a FC significantly greater than one between the IFN-treated and control samples. Finally, non-coding RNAs and pseudogenes were removed from the list. Inspection of the curated list of genes showed that overlap between the different datasets was limited and many genes (&gt;2000) were only present in 1 of the 10 datasets/libraries. As such, a second selection round was performed in which the expression threshold for genes present in only one of the datasets was raised to FC ≥3. For genes present in at least two datasets, the initial cut-off of FC ≥2 was kept. Finally, 35 additional genes identified through RNA sequencing gene expression analysis as being responsive to both type I/type III IFN and IL-1β were also included (M. Gale, personal communication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). For analysis of IFN induction specific to THP-1 cells, raw signal intensities were downloaded from GEO (GSE46599) and the data was quantile normalized using the Bioconductor package lumi. For a given probe, both samples from at one least condition were required to have a detection p-value&lt;=0.05. The Bioconductor package limma was used to identify significantly differentially expressed probes.

A total of 15,348 unique sgRNA sequences were synthesized. The sgRNAs were split in two pools (Zhang and Brunello sgRNAs) for synthesis (four per gene in each pool) and two independent sets of 200 Non-Targeting Control (NTC) sgRNAs obtained from the GeCKOv2 library were added in duplicate to each pool.

To ensure adequate representation, sufficient parallel transformations were performed and plated onto ampicillin containing LB agarose 245 mm x 245 mm plates (Thermo Fisher) at 200-times the total number of oligos of each library pool. After overnight growth at 37°C, colonies were scraped off, pelleted, and used for plasmid DNA preps using the Endotoxin-Free Nucleobond Plasmid Midiprep kit (Takara Bio #740422.10).

The screen's design is clever, based on modified HIV-based sgRNA lentivectors that allow them to track, using deep sequencing, sgRNAs encapsidated into virus particles after infection of the knock-out pool with replication-competent HIV-1. As the CRISPR vector can be mobilized by replication-competent HIV-1 replication in the same cell, sgRNA-CAS9 vectors that target putative antiviral genes will be overrepresented in the supernatant of infected cells pretreated with IFN. The screen includes key controls that should be screened out (e.g., HIV entry factors and those involved in the transduction of IFN signaling), and, importantly, they were. The screen revealed a number of ISGs previously shown to inhibit retroviral replication. Of these, ZAP, TRIM25 and N4BP1 appear to be targeting the CRISPR vector rather than HIV itself, most likely owing to the high CpG content of the CAS9-P2A-PuroR mRNA/vector genome RNA. For the other ISGs identified, the authors show that hTRIM5, tetherin, MxB and several IFITMs contribute to the IFN-induced inhibition of HIV replication. The screening strategy was validated by studying the effects of interferon in conferring antiviral phenotypes in THP-1 monocytes. Finally, by examining sgRNAs that are under-represented, the authors identified SEC62 and TLR2 as putative viral cofactors in THP-1 cells. Given that the sgRNA library did not cover the whole genome, it seems likely that many more host cofactors could be identified using this experimental approach.</p><p>Overall, this is a fascinating project, very nicely performed, and the majority of paper is clearly laid out and well-written. While the major contribution is the derivation and optimization of a powerful new screening method for identifying HIV-host interactions, validation of the screen also yields interesting new restriction and host dependency factors impacting the HIV life cycle and insights regarding the multi-layer nature of cellular antiviral immunity. A particularly intriguing finding is the demonstration that human versions of antiviral host proteins typically thought to be circumvented by HIV-1 (e.g., TRIM5a and BST2/Tetherin) retain a significant level of anti-HIV activity in IFN-treated THP-1 cells. However, the new HIV biology could be enhanced by increased focus on their mechanisms, at least in the Discussion (e.g., the identification of human TRIM5alpha in this screen was unexpected, but no attempt was made to clarify how it functions, which is of interest given that it has largely been regarded by the field as an ineffective inhibitor of HIV-1). Nevertheless, most of the paper's weaknesses are minor and largely pertain to clarifications that could be made to the description and interpretation of a subset of experiments.</p><p>Major Issue:</p><p>At least a subset of the knock-out populations should be validated experimentally (e.g., by western blot, endonuclease or sequencing assays). Similarly, in no instances were the KO gene activities rescued to confirm KO specificity. The authors might at least comment on why they felt this was unnecessary.</p><p>Minor Issues:</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the rationale for repairing the LTR to generate packageable RNA species could be more clearly described for a general audience. Also, is there potential for promoter interference in this context?</p><p>2) Why was cellular gDNA was sequenced and not cell-associated RNA? While gDNA would give a representation of each guide RNA as integrated into the cell pool, it does not confirm that the guide RNAs are expressed. Could this cloud the analysis? A related question is whether essential genes that may be involved in the viral life cycle can be detected in this screen based on loss of sequences? Finally, how was ZAP still identified as a mid-level hit even in ZAP KO cells (subsection “An iterative PIKAHIV screen in ZAP-KO cells identifies a panel of ISGs that inhibit HIV in THP-1 cells”, second paragraph)?</p><p>3) N4BP1 could be highlighted more strongly (e.g., in Abstract) considering that it appears to be a new potential regulator of the ZAP pathway.</p><p>4) For Figure 2C, it could be better explained why it makes sense that gene correlations are stronger for the ZAP-KO cells than for wild-type cells.</p><p>5) For Figure 3 results, please clarify the rationale for testing entry pathways (as laid out in the context of MxB). As noted, the authors have already published that VSV-G is more sensitive to IFITM proteins. The data seem to indicate that the MxB restriction is 5 to 10-fold for either context, so it is unclear how the entry pathway was relevant to MxB restriction.</p><p>6) For Figure 4E results, for a general audience, the authors need to define in the text what Vpu does (e.g., subsection “TRIM5alpha, IFITM1 and Tetherin are additional ISGs that contribute to the IFN block”, last paragraph).</p><p>7) The authors mention &quot;genetic conflicts&quot; on several occasions as a possible explanation for why the virus is unable to completely antagonize human RFs such as TRIM5alpha and BST2, without always explaining this concept very clearly. For example, a major conclusion is that T5alpha, etc. affects &quot;well-adapted&quot; HIV-1-LAI (Discussion, first paragraph), but what does &quot;well-adapted&quot; mean? They mention &quot;conflicting evolutionary pressures&quot; acting on the genome but only much later in the Discussion do they begin to explain what they mean by this (e.g., that evasion might come at a cost for other viral functions). They also mention &quot;concurrently-acting RF barriers&quot;, but this potential explanation should be clarified.</p><p>8) For the Discussion, we suggest addressing the question of how much ZAP might limit the application of this screening strategy for primary cells wherein it would be difficult and perhaps less-than-ideal to inactivate ZAP directly. Instead, would it be feasible to remove CpG dinucleotides from the library? As noted above, there could also be more emphasis on the data that nicely implicates both TRIM25 and N4BP1 as downstream regulators of ZAP restriction.</p><p>9) The comparison of this screen to that of Park et al. should be a separate paragraph in the Discussion, and more could be said here, both to explain the Park screen better and articulate the pros and cons of either screen and their findings.</p><p>10) APOBECs are brought up in the Discussion and are apparently not detected in this screen due to its &quot;single-round&quot; nature. Would it be possible to modify the screen wherein it could detect APOBEC-like activities (i.e., impacting RT, integrase, or some other aspect of multi-round replication)? This could be discussed.</p><p>11) The screen in THP-1 is limited to X4-using or VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1, using the lab-adapted prototypic strain LAI. It would be interesting to see whether the same genes are identified if a primary HIV-1 isolate was used instead. This would either require challenging the cells with a VSV-G pseudotype or making the THP-1 ZAP-KO cells CCR5 positive. The authors touch on the idea that the lab-adapted strain may be have residual sensitivity to certain ISGs, and there is good evidence of a spectrum of IFN sensitivities amongst primary HIV isolates. The system the authors have developed gives them the opportunity to do interesting comparative studies which will yield further novel observations. The authors should at least discuss this more fully if they feel re-running the screen with a different virus/virus mutant is beyond the scope.</p><p>12) Similarly, the relative impact of MxB vs. IFITM restrictions depending on route of entry would be strengthened by comparing other HIV-1 envelopes, given other publications in the field. Of note, a very closely related molecular clone derived from NL/HxB, but not an Env-deleted VSV pseudoype of the same virus, has been shown to be completely insensitive to IFNa in the THP-1 cells despite robust Mx2 induction (Rihn et al., JVI 2017).</p><p>13) Note that the identification of tetherin in the screen could be because the Vpu encoded LAI/IIIB lineage is a sub-optimal tetherin antagonist. While the authors allude to compromised Vpu function in the Discussion, they should refer to Pickering et al., 2014, where essentially the same Vpu allele (NL4.3) was specifically shown to be an inferior tetherin antagonist compared to most primary isolates tested.</p><p>14) As noted above, the manuscript would benefit from additional mechanistic information (or at least increased discussion) for several of the more interesting &quot;hits&quot;. In particular, identification of human TRIM5 is somewhat surprising considering that HIV-1 is supposed to be largely resistant. How much does TRIM5 contribute to the enhanced IFN-sensitivity of certain capsid mutants? Is TRIM5 contributing to IFN sensitivity of other HIV-1 isolates in the same system? It is suggested that the TRIM5 effects could reflect induced expression as an ISG, but this was not addressed. Similarly, TRIM5alpha restriction was bypassed by VSVg pseudotyping (Figure 3E): is this a general feature of TRIM5 restriction, or is it a characteristic of this experimental set-up and/or THP cells? Likewise, there is preliminary evidence that N4BP1 could be a ZAP cofactor, but this is not further characterized. Finally, the identified novel dependency factors could be characterized more fully. The identification of TLR2 and (to a lesser extent) its adaptor MyD88 as dependency factors suggests downstream signaling. Do the authors have any theories regarding TLR2 as a dependency factor? Do they believe this effect is via signaling, and if it is, what the agonist may be? Can this phenotype be explained by knockout affecting NFkB activity and therefore the activity of the viral LTR (of note NFkB1 is also a hit)? As there is no TLR2 ligand added to the culture, what could be stimulating the system here? SEC62 appears to be affecting CD4, but not CXCR4, surface expression and this correlates with sensitivity of LAIwt but not LAI(VSV). Are other HIV-1 envelopes that require different cell densities if CD4 more or less sensitive to SEC62 knockout?</p><p>15) Did the authors undertake a deep sequencing analysis of the PIKA-HIV library prior to generating the transducing virus stock in 293T cells? It would be useful to know if the transduced THP population already carried some bias in its sgRNA content (for instance, it might be anticipated that guides recognizing dependency factors affecting the late stage of virus replication would be under represented).</p><p>Text edits:</p><p>1) Much of the paper is written in present tense.</p><p>2).

Because the CRISPR vector can be mobilized by replication competent HIV-1 replication in the same cell, sgRNA-CAS9 vectors targeting putative antiviral genes will be overrepresented in the supernatant of infected cells pretreated with IFN. Conversely, putative cofactors will be underrepresented under control conditions. In-built into the screen were key controls that should be screened out under both conditions (HIV entry factors and those involved in the transduction of IFN signalling), which, importantly, they were. The screen revealed a number of ISGs previously shown to inhibit retroviral replication. Of these, ZAP, TRIM25 and N4BP1 appear to be targeting the CRISPR vector rather than HIV itself, most likely because of the high CpG content of the CAS9-P2A-PuroR mRNA/vector genome RNA. For the other ISGs identified, the authors show that hTRIM5, tetherin, MxB and several IFITMs contribute to the IFN-induced inhibition of HIV replication. The relative sensitivity of HIV-1 to different IFITMs vs MxB depends largely on whether viral entry is mediated via VSV-G or the native CXCR4-using LAI envelope. Finally, by examining sgRNAs that are under-represented, they identified SEC62 and TLR2 as putative cofactors in THP-1 cells.</p><p>This an interesting and well-written study. The screen itself is elegant, and very well controlled, and as such represents a useful resource for the field and a powerful strategy to identify novel HIV-associated cellular factors. In THP-1, the screen has not identified any novel HIV-1 restriction factors. This maybe because there are no new major ones to be found, but there are also some limitations in the screen as presented. Moreover, while the authors have confirmed the importance of MxB and tetherin in the IFN-induced resistance to HIV-1 replication, novel aspects of some of the other factors could be developed further.</p><p>I would encourage the authors to consider some of the following:</p><p>The screen in THP-1 is limited to X4-using or VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1 for which they use the lab-adapted prototypic strain LAI.

In addition, the effects of ZAP registered in the assay owing to CG-high vector sequences, and the screen was modified accordingly.

However, this is complicated by the fact that guide RNAs are expressed from the pol III promoter in the vector but these sequences are also present in the full-length HIV-CRISPR RNA produced from transcription off the LTR. Thus, we could not easily distinguish cellular RNA that contained in the viral genome versus the subgenomic RNA that would lead to knockout. In addition, LTR-driven expression could be affected by gene knockouts. The library was introduced into the THP cells at 500X coverage. Therefore, differences in expression levels between integration sites should be averaged out. We therefore believe that sequencing of integrated constructs in the genomic DNA as a read out of the frequency of each guide RNA that is present in the cell population serves as a sufficient denominator for comparing the enrichment or depletion of HIV-CRISPR viral genomes in the supernatant.</p><p>Yes, the reviewer is correct that genes essential for the cell would likely not be read out in this screen.

The data that N4BP1 co-segregates in the HIV-CRISPR screen with ZAP is shown in the manuscript. However, we have now added additional data in the current manuscript that shows that N4BP1 is not an essential co-factor for ZAP inhibition of alphaviruses (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Thus, our data suggests that ZAP may have different requirements for inhibition of different targets. However, our attempts at further determining the mechanism of N4BP1 mechanism have not yielded satisfactory answer. As we do not have further data to support a model of how this might occur we prefer not to highlight this aspect of the study in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For Figure 2C, it could be better explained why it makes sense that gene correlations are stronger for the ZAP-KO cells than for wild-type cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to further explain the logic of why the gene correlations should improve in the absence of ZAP (which our data suggests inhibits our vector, but not HIV itself).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For Figure 3 results, please clarify the rationale for testing entry pathways (as laid out in the context of MxB). As noted, the authors have already published that VSV-G is more sensitive to IFITM proteins. The data seem to indicate that the MxB restriction is 5 to 10-fold for either context, so it is unclear how the entry pathway was relevant to MxB restriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explaining the logic better. A previous paper suggested that MxB is not a restriction factor for HIV (Opp et al., 2015). However, the authors of that study measured restriction of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV in contrast to wildtype HIV infections. Our results now provide an explanation for the lack of detectable restriction by MxB as there is a more dominant inhibitor of the VSV-G pseudotype, namely IFITM3, which masks the effect of MxB. We now state this more clearly in the Results. Further we have replaced the VSV-G pseudotype screen data with a newer VSV-G pseudotype screen performed in ZAP-KO THP-1 cells that more clearly shows these phenomena (Figure 3E and Figure 6—figure supplement 1: the figure legend, Results and Materials and methods have been updated accordingly). In addition, a recent paper that comes to the same conclusion that the degree of the IFN response due to MXB depends on the mode of viral entry is now cited (Xu, Pan, and Liang, 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For Figure 4E results, for a general audience, the authors need to define in the text what Vpu does (e.g., subsection “TRIM5alpha, IFITM1 and Tetherin are additional ISGs that contribute to the IFN block”, last paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this information in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors mention &quot;genetic conflicts&quot; on several occasions as a possible explanation for why the virus is unable to completely antagonize human RFs such as TRIM5alpha and BST2, without always explaining this concept very clearly. For example, a major conclusion is that T5alpha, etc. affects &quot;well-adapted&quot; HIV-1-LAI (Discussion, first paragraph), but what does &quot;well-adapted&quot; mean? They mention &quot;conflicting evolutionary pressures&quot; acting on the genome but only much later in the Discussion do they begin to explain what they mean by this (e.g., that evasion might come at a cost for other viral functions). They also mention &quot;concurrently-acting RF barriers&quot;, but this potential explanation should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these concepts were not sufficiently explained. We now expand the Discussion to better explain what we mean by these genetic conflicts, conflicting evolutionary pressures and concurrently-acting RF barriers. We have moved up our discussion on this to come before discussion of more technical aspects of the screen. By “well-adapted”, we mean an HIV strain that was isolated from a person with chronic infection and high viral load.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) For the Discussion, we suggest addressing the question of how much ZAP might limit the application of this screening strategy for primary cells wherein it would be difficult and perhaps less-than-ideal to inactivate ZAP directly. Instead, would it be feasible to remove CpG dinucleotides from the library? As noted above, there could also be more emphasis on the data that nicely implicates both TRIM25 and N4BP1 as downstream regulators of ZAP restriction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been trying very hard to adapt this screen to primary cells. Besides the CpG problem, we have identified other technical problems that need to be resolved before it is successful. We prefer not the address this extensively in the Discussion until we have more answers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The comparison of this screen to that of Park et al. should be a separate paragraph in the Discussion, and more could be said here, both to explain the Park screen better and articulate the pros and cons of either screen and their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded this part of the Discussion to better compare the Park et al. screen with our screen (both the methodology and the results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) APOBECs are brought up in the Discussion and are apparently not detected in this screen due to its &quot;single-round&quot; nature. Would it be possible to modify the screen wherein it could detect APOBEC-like activities (i.e., impacting RT, integrase, or some other aspect of multi-round replication)? This could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are working on this, but prefer not to expand the discussion on this extension of HIV-CRISPR screening until we have some data to support this additional approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The screen in THP-1 is limited to X4-using or VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1, using the lab-adapted prototypic strain LAI. It would be interesting to see whether the same genes are identified if a primary HIV-1 isolate was used instead. This would either require challenging the cells with a VSV-G pseudotype or making the THP-1 ZAP-KO cells CCR5 positive. The authors touch on the idea that the lab-adapted strain may be have residual sensitivity to certain ISGs, and there is good evidence of a spectrum of IFN sensitivities amongst primary HIV isolates. The system the authors have developed gives them the opportunity to do interesting comparative studies which will yield further novel observations. The authors should at least discuss this more fully if they feel re-running the screen with a different virus/virus mutant is beyond the scope.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that interesting comparisons can be made by screening more viruses and have now repeated PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> screening with an R5-tropic virus derived from a primary isolate. We introduced CCR5 into the THP-1 ZAP-KO cells, introduced the PIKA library into the cells, and then challenged them with HIV-<sub>1Q23.BG505</sub>, a clade A R5-tropic molecular clone (the Q23 molecular clone with envelope from BG505). This data is now shown in a new Figure 6 (6A, 6B and 6C). A comparison of the screens now forms a major part of the Discussion. In short, the major conclusions of important factors are in many ways similar for all three viruses, but there are also some interesting differences that we can now highlight.</p><p>In addition, we have now challenged these same ZAP-KO PIKA<sub>HIV</sub> THP-1 cells with the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> virus and are now able to detect a set of significantly-scoring HIV dependency factors in the VSV-G screen. This data is shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. As above, the comparison of the results of these additional screens now serves as major basis of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Similarly, the relative impact of MxB vs. IFITM restrictions depending on route of entry would be strengthened by comparing other HIV-1 envelopes, given other publications in the field. Of note, a very closely related molecular clone derived from NL/HxB, but not an Env-deleted VSV pseudoype of the same virus, has been shown to be completely insensitive to IFNa in the THP-1 cells despite robust Mx2 induction (Rihn et al., JVI 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>As described to point 11, we have now repeated the entire screen with both a recombinant of R5-tropic primary isolates and in the ZAP-KO cells with VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> virus. These new screens now more completely explain the relative impacts of MXB and IFITM on restriction that is dependent on the mode of entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Note that the identification of tetherin in the screen could be because the Vpu encoded LAI/IIIB lineage is a sub-optimal tetherin antagonist. While the authors allude to compromised Vpu function in the Discussion, they should refer to Pickering et al., 2014, where essentially the same Vpu allele (NL4.3) was specifically shown to be an inferior tetherin antagonist compared to most primary isolates tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this point. In our new screen with an R5-tropic virus (HIV-1<sub>Q23/BG505</sub>), Tetherin is now much further down on the list and does not appear to be a restriction factor. Therefore, the reviewer is likely correct that the Vpu of HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> is sub-optimal. This data is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that viruses from chronic infections become more interferon-sensitive—possibly because of differences in potency between the viral antagonists. We now highlight this difference in the screens and also include the reference pointed out by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) As noted above, the manuscript would benefit from additional mechanistic information (or at least increased discussion) for several of the more interesting &quot;hits&quot;. In particular, identification of human TRIM5 is somewhat surprising considering that HIV-1 is supposed to be largely resistant. How much does TRIM5 contribute to the enhanced IFN-sensitivity of certain capsid mutants? Is TRIM5 contributing to IFN sensitivity of other HIV-1 isolates in the same system? It is suggested that the TRIM5 effects could reflect induced expression as an ISG, but this was not addressed. Similarly, TRIM5alpha restriction was bypassed by VSVg pseudotyping (Figure 3E): is this a general feature of TRIM5 restriction, or is it a characteristic of this experimental set-up and/or THP cells? Likewise, there is preliminary evidence that N4BP1 could be a ZAP cofactor, but this is not further characterized. Finally, the identified novel dependency factors could be characterized more fully. The identification of TLR2 and (to a lesser extent) its adaptor MyD88 as dependency factors suggests downstream signaling. Do the authors have any theories regarding TLR2 as a dependency factor? Do they believe this effect is via signaling, and if it is, what the agonist may be? Can this phenotype be explained by knockout affecting NFkB activity and therefore the activity of the viral LTR (of note NFkB1 is also a hit)? As there is no TLR2 ligand added to the culture, what could be stimulating the system here? SEC62 appears to be affecting CD4, but not CXCR4, surface expression and this correlates with sensitivity of LAIwt but not LAI(VSV). Are other HIV-1 envelopes that require different cell densities if CD4 more or less sensitive to SEC62 knockout?</p></disp-quote><p>These are all interesting points. We now show TRIM5 to also be a hit in the additional screen using the R5-tropic clade A HIV-1<sub>Q23/BG505</sub> virus. As we show in the paper, the effect of TRIM5 in IFN-treated THP cells is still relatively modest in the knockout cells—about 4-fold IFN inhibition as compared to 7-fold in control cells (compare NTC with TRIM5_1 and TRIM5_2 in Figure 4B and 4C). While this is much less than the amount of restriction of HIV by over-expression of the rhesus TRIM5, careful examination of published results (including our own), substantiate small effects of human TRIM5 on HIV-1 (reproducible across different labs using different methods). Further we now show TRIM5 inhibition of the VSV-G pseudotyped virus screened in the ZAP-KO THP-1 cells (Figure 3E), highlighting its ability to inhibit HIV entering via different envelopes. TRIM5 is induced by IFN (Figure 2E and Figure 2—source data 1), so yes, its effect would be expected to be greater in the presence of IFN. We are in the process of screening CA mutants, but believe that data better fits in a different manuscript. A reference (van Manen et al., 2008) suggesting a correlation of TRIM5 polymorphisms with HIV clinical course has been added.</p><p>As described above, we now add data that N4BP1 is not a co-factor for ZAP’s role in inhibiting alphaviruses (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). However, despite our considerable efforts, we do not have further mechanistic data on the role of N4BP1 in inhibition of the viral vector. As the emphasis of this manuscript is on factors that inhibit HIV itself, we would prefer to leave that work to others.</p><p>We do not have further data on the role of TLR2 and MyD88 as dependency factors. However, as the reviewer points out NFKB1 is also a dependency factor, so it is possible that signaling through NFKB1 is occurring in the absence of added exogenous ligand. Further we did find mycoplasma in some THP-1 cultures tested after the completion of experiments which could be serving as a TLR2 agonist (Heidegger et al., 2015). There is also evidence that HIV infection itself can agonize TLR2 (Henrick, Yao, Rosenthal, and team, 2015). We now cite more papers that support this interpretation in the Discussion but do not have further data on this point.</p><p>SEC62 comes up as a dependency factor for both the HIV-1<sub>LAI</sub> (X4-tropic) and HIV-1<sub>Q23/BG505</sub> (R5-tropic) viruses we’ve screened, but does not come up as a dependency factor in the VSV-G pseudotype virus screen. This data supports the interpretation that the target of SEC62 is CD4 as the requirement for CD4 is shared by both the X4- and R5-tropic viruses but not VSV/G-pseudotyped virus. Further the two wild type HIV viruses we’ve tested likely require different CD4 levels to infect cells (Humes and Overbaugh, 2011), suggesting that the effect of SEC62 is independent of efficiency of CD4 usage. It is formally possible that the effect of SEC62 on CD4 correlates with infection efficiency but is not causative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Did the authors undertake a deep sequencing analysis of the PIKA-HIV library prior to generating the transducing virus stock in 293T cells? It would be useful to know if the transduced THP population already carried some bias in its sgRNA content (for instance, it might be anticipated that guides recognizing dependency factors affecting the late stage of virus replication would be under represented).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we did sequence the PIKA-HIV library prior to transduction.
