Among gap junction subunits, gap junction protein α1 (GJA1) is the most commonly expressed subunit. A recent study showed that GJA1 is necessary for the maintenance of motile cilia; however, the molecular mechanism and function of GJA1 in ciliogenesis remain unknown. Here, we examined the functions of GJA1 during ciliogenesis in human retinal pigment epithelium-1 and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryonic multiciliated-cells. GJA1 localizes to the motile ciliary axonemes or pericentriolar regions beneath the primary cilium. GJA1 depletion caused malformation of both the primary cilium and motile cilia. Further study revealed that GJA1 depletion affected several ciliary proteins such as BBS4, CP110, and Rab11 in the pericentriolar region and basal body. Interestingly, CP110 removal from the mother centriole was significantly reduced by GJA1 depletion. Importantly, Rab11, a key regulator during ciliogenesis, was immunoprecipitated with GJA1 and GJA1 knockdown caused the mislocalization of Rab11. These findings suggest that GJA1 regulates ciliogenesis by interacting with the Rab11-Rab8 ciliary trafficking pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>GJA1</kwd><kwd>Rab11</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A2B5B02002285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Tae Joo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBS-R001-D1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Taejoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ciliogenesis requires a gap junction protein (GJA1) mediated ciliary vesicle deposition and CP110 removal.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A gap junction, which is also known as a connexon, is a transmembrane (TM) protein complex that plays an important role as a channel and transports low-molecular-weight compounds, nutrients, and ions laterally across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodenough et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodenough and Paul, 2009</xref>).

The human homolog of <italic>GJA1</italic> is located at human chromosome 6q22-q23. The <italic>GJA1</italic> gene was identified after discovering the putative genes for human oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boyadjiev et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paznekas et al., 2003</xref>). Among all gap junction protein families, GJA1 is the most common and is a major subunit. It is expressed in many tissues, such as the eyes, ears, brain, and especially the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oyamada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans and Martin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ruangvoravat and Lo, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willecke et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The GJA1 protein has four TM domains with five linked subdomain loops. Among these loops, two loops are extracellular subdomains, and three loops, including the N- and C-terminal domains, are in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beyer et al., 1990</xref>). In the cytoplasm, the C-terminal domain of GJA1 regulates the cytoskeletal network (actin and tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leithe et al., 2018</xref>]) and cell extension, migration, and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuuchi and Naus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kameritsch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rhee et al., 2009</xref>). A recent study reported that GJA1 also regulates the maintenance of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), which are microtubule-based cellular organelles that play crucial roles in the physiological maintenance of the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerdes et al., 2009</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms and roles of GJA1 in the formation and function of cilia have not been determined.</p><p>Cilia exist in most types of vertebrate cells and are involved in various developmental processes and physiological responses from embryos to adults. For example, cilia are involved in cell cycle control, cell-to-cell signal transduction, fertilization, early embryonic development, extracellular environment sensing, and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Malicki and Johnson, 2017</xref>). Mutations in essential genes for cilia formation disrupt ciliary structures or their functions and lead to ‘ciliopathy’, which is an innate genetic and syndromic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waters and Beales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we show that GJA1 regulates ciliogenesis by affecting ciliary trafficking and thereby promoting uncapping of the mother centriole. GJA1 is localized not only at the gap junction but also in the pericentriolar regions beneath the primary cilium of retinal pigment epithelium-1 (RPE1) cells and the ciliary axonemes of multiple/motile cilia.</p><p>Using immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis, we identified Rab11 and Rab8a as putative GJA1-binding partners. Rab11 was previously shown to accumulate around the basal body and is involved in the early steps of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>). Further analysis showed that Rab11 immunoprecipitated with GJA1, and knockdown of GJA1 in RPE1 cells resulted in the mislocalization of Rab11. These data suggest that GJA1 contributes to proper ciliogenesis by regulating Rab11 trafficking to basal bodies and facilitating ciliary axoneme formation and assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GJA1 is localized at the ciliary axonemes and near the basal bodies in multiciliated cells</title><p>GJA1, which is a major component of the gap junction complex, consists of four TM domains (TM1–4), interdomain loops between each TM domain, and intracellular N- and C-terminus domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the biological effects of GJA1 on ciliogenesis in vertebrates, we cloned the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> homolog of human <italic>GJA1</italic> based on a sequence from the Xenbase database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">James-Zorn et al., 2013</xref>). Next, we analyzed GJA1 localization in multiciliated cells in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos expressing GJA1-Flag or HA-tagged protein by immunofluorescence staining. We observed that GJA1-Flag strongly accumulated at the cell-cell junction as a gap junction complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, white arrowhead). Unexpectedly, we also observed that GJA1 was localized near the apical surface as puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and B’</xref>, yellow arrow) and in ciliary axonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and C’</xref>, white arrow), in addition to gap junctions in <italic>Xenopus</italic> multiciliated epithelial cells. We further analyzed apical localization of GJA1 puncta by co-immunostaining with a basal body marker, centrin. Interestingly, GJA1-HA signals did not overlap with centrin signals. Instead, GJA1-HA was localized below or above the basal bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we examined the endogenous GJA1 location in multiciliated cells in the mouse branchial epithelium and found that endogenous GJA1 localizes to the ciliary axonemes as puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that GJA1 may be involved in ciliogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dominant-negative mutant-mediated dysfunction of GJA1 causes severe ciliary malformation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic epithelial tissue</title><p>To determine the function of GJA1 during cilia formation, we exploited dominant-negative mutants of GJA1 (dnGJA1). Two known dominant-negative mutants have been identified and were used in recent studies. The T154A point mutation mimics the closed-channel status of the gap junction complex but does not inhibit gap junction formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beahm et al., 2006</xref>). The Δ130–136 deletion mutation consists of a seven-amino acid deletion in the intracellular loop between TM2 and 3 that blocks gap junction permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Last, we designed the Δ234–243 mutant, which consists of a 10-amino acid deletion in the putative tubulin-binding sequence of the C-terminus. This sequence only exists in GJA1 and is not conserved in other gap junction protein families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giepmans et al., 2001</xref>). Microinjection of each dominant-negative mutant at ventral-animal regions of two-cell stage embryos caused severe defects in cilia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis using an acetylated tubulin antibody showed severely shortened and fewer ciliary axonemes in the dnGJA1-injected embryos compared with those of control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In particular, the number of cilia on ciliated cells was notably decreased in Δ234–243 mutant-injected embryos, although it would be challenging to quantitatively analyze the phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the basal bodies, which are the organizing center of ciliary axonemes, did not have noticeable defects, and the number of basal bodies and their apical localization were comparable to those of controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green). Next, we measured the number of ciliated cells by counting acetylated tubulin-positive cells, and indeed the number of ciliated cells was significantly reduced in the dnGJA1-expressing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We next isolated cilia from wild-type embryos or dnGJA1-injected embryos and analyzed the average length of isolated cilia.

Then, we performed gene ontology term analysis with 232 detected proteins and identified two major clusters of interest, regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A recent study revealed that gap junctions, especially those containing GJA1, mediate intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and regulate ependymal multicilia maintenance through the Wnt-GJA1-Ca<sup>2+</sup> axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we determined whether GJA1 depletion compromises cilia formation by affecting the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in RPE1 cells. GJA1 depletion or overexpression resulted in similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the resting state and slightly affected Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry compared with that in control RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>, B). However, the difference in Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was not as significant as that in previously reported studies. Next, we focused on the clusters of ciliogenesis. Among dozens of interacting ciliary proteins, we selected Rab8a and Rab11a as candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both Rab8 and Rab11 have previously been reported to be involved in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knödler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacque et al., 2018</xref>). Rab8 is localized in the primary cilium and regulates ciliary membrane extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacque et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies have also shown that Rab8 interacts with CP110 and BBS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). Rab11 is enriched at the basal part of the primary cilium and recruits Rab8 to the basal body by interacting with Rabin8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blacque et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, during basal body maturation, Rab11-positive membrane vesicles are transported to the distal appendages of basal bodies and form large ciliary vesicles. This distal appendage vesicle assembly that forms ciliary vesicles is a prerequisite for CP110 removal and promotes the uncapping of the mother centrioles, which is followed by the recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins and transition zone proteins for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sánchez and Dynlacht, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We first confirmed the interaction between GJA1 and Rab8a or Rab11a by performing co-immunoprecipitation, followed by a western blot assay. Consistent with the IP-MS data, GJA1 was successfully immunoprecipitated with Rab8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>) or Rab11a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas the rabbit IgG negative control did not show any signals. Next, we confirmed the localization of GJA1 and Rab11 during ciliogenesis. As expected, GJA1 and Rab11 were partially co-localized around the pericentriolar region and acetylated tubulin network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In particular, GJA1 surrounded the Rab11 cluster, which was accumulated around the basal bodies. Furthermore, we observed decreased Rab8a and Rab11 protein levels in GJA1-depleted RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Additionally, the accumulation of Rab11 at the base of the primary cilium was absent upon GJA1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–F</xref>). These phenotypes were partially rescued with <italic>GJA1</italic>-cloned plasmid co-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). We further confirmed the presence of Rab11-positive ciliary vesicles using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). At higher resolutions, SIM analysis showed that Rab11-positive vesicles encircled the base of the ciliary axoneme. In contrast, GJA1-depleted cells showed scattered Rab11 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). We next investigated how dnGJA1 mutants may disturb ciliogenesis by performing co-immunoprecipitation with dnGJA1 proteins and Rab11a.

In this publication, Zhang et al., argued that GJA1 mediates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave and signaling in the Wnt-PLC-IP3 cascade to maintain motile cilia.</p><p>In this study, we confirmed GJA1 localization around the pericentriolar region and ciliary axonemes for the first time, suggesting a direct function of GJA1 in ciliogenesis. Moreover, we confirmed that GJA1 depletion specifically affected CP110 removal from the mother centrioles and caused delocalization and BBS4-positive vesicle around the pericentriolar region; however, several other key ciliary and PCM molecules, such as Arl13b, IFT20, IFT88, and TTBK2, were not significantly affected. These data suggest that GJA1 may perform specific functions in general ciliogenesis, in addition to functioning as a mediator of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave, for the maintenance of motile cilia.</p><p>Furthermore, in IP-MS assays, we found that Rab11 interacted with GJA1, which can explain how GJA1 controls CP110 removal from the mother centriole for ciliogenesis. Rab11 is a major regulator of ciliary vesicle trafficking and is necessary for ciliary vesicle accumulation on the mother centriole, which is suggested to be a prerequisite for removal of CP110 from the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sánchez and Dynlacht, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, we showed that the dnGJA1 mutant proteins in this study failed to interact with Rab11a, which may explain how GJA1 controls cilia formation. Our findings strongly support that GJA1 controls trafficking and accumulation to Rab11/8 positive vesicles in the mother centriole and hence facilitates removal of CP110 to initiate cilia formation and this process is probably necessary pericentriolar microtubule networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the possible function of gap junction proteins, such as GJB2 (gap junction protein β2; CX26), GJA1 (CX43), and GJA7 (gap junction protein α7; CX43.4), in determining left-right asymmetry. Most studies on the function of gap junction proteins in determining laterality have indicated that the channel function is critical for mediating leftward signals, which are driven by nodal cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levin and Mercola, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hatler et al., 2009</xref>).

The cytosolic domain of GJA1 contains a microtubule-binding motif that is necessary for trafficking to the gap junction complex. Furthermore, GJA1 seems to exhibit gap junction-independent functions that mainly control the cytoskeleton and provide directional cues for migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giepmans et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Francis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2017</xref>).

Given the complex loss-of-function phenotype of GJA1, it is feasible to hypothesize that some gap-junction-independent functions of GJA1 may be mediated by regulating cilia formation. GJA1 was localized around the pericentriolar region in human RPE1 cells, and GJA1 depletion resulted in reduced acetylated tubulin levels in pericentriolar microtubules.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.

The authors show that GJA1 localizes to motile cilia on the epidermis of frog embryos and that expression of dominant negative constructs or morpholinos against GJA1 reduces the number of cilia present. They further show that loss of GJA1 reduces ciliation in cultured RPE1 cells, which they attribute to Rab11 dysfunction when GJA1 is missing. While all three reviewers found the cilia – gap junction connection exciting and novel, all had concerns about missing controls for critical experiments and none could articulate what function GJA1 might have in ciliogenesis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The localization to frog cilia needs to be better described. The figures need to include panels with only the GJA1 channel so the pattern can be better seen. The images suggest that the label is punctate and possibly at the tip of the cilia. Is this true? What parts of the cilium are labeled? The authors should label the basal bodies (centrin-GFP, chibby-GFP, or anti-γ tubulin antibody) and see if GJA1 co-localizes or not. The figure needs to be labeled as GJA1-Flag to make clear that this is localization of fusion protein rather than endogenous. Does the antibody against mammalian GJA1 cross-react with <italic>Xenopus</italic>? Demonstration of localization of native protein would strengthen the case. Alternatively, the investigators could examine mouse tracheal or ependymal cilia to see if the ciliary localization is conserved in motile cilia.</p><p>The <italic>Xenopus</italic> experiments focus on cilia length, which does not seem to be the major parameter affected by disrupting GJA1. A few experiment quantitate cilia loss, but this needs to be done in each of the experiments.</p><p>The authors state &quot;Moreover, the MO-mediated knockdown of GJA1 resulted in a smaller number of multi-ciliated cells in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic epithelial tissues (Figure 3B middle panel, 3C).&quot; If the authors are stating there are fewer multiciliated cells, they should show this by MCC cell fate (dnah9, foxj1 in situs) rather than cilia staining – the latter cannot distinguish between loss of cilia and loss of MCC cell fate.</p><p>The authors state: &quot;Antisense MO injection effectively reduced the expression level of wild-type GJA1 (Figure 3E, MO + wt-mRNA). In contrast, the translation of mismatch mRNA, which was modified to be mismatched with MO, was not affected as strongly as wild-type GJA1 mRNA by co-injection of GJA1-MO (Figure 3E, MO + mis-mRNA).&quot; This is an unusual way to test MO specificity. First, it is absolutely essential that the authors define whether the MO does or does not have a binding site to the WT-GJA1 that they are injecting for rescue. I must presume that the WT-GJA1-FLAG does indeed have a MO binding site since the expressed protein from this construct is reduced with the MO (Figure 1e). Therefore, the rescue in 1D is meaningless as the injected mRNA is simply binding to the injected MO and does not at all address if the MO is specifically depleting the native protein by binding to the native mRNA. Effectively, there is no real MO controls in this paper. This is unacceptable. The authors much show either phenocopy using a second non-overlapping MO, F0 CRISPR, rescue with an mRNA that does not bind the MO and ideally a combination of all of the above.</p><p>In RPE1 cells, GJA1 does not localize to cilia but rather localizes in a diffuse area around the base of cilia. The authors say this is pericentriolar material. It is hard to tell from the images, but it could just as likely be the Golgi complex. Co stain with peri-centriolar and Golgi markers are needed. Why were the colors changed between 5A and B? Higher mag images of 5B are needed to determine if the &quot;pericentriolar&quot; label is missing in the knockdown. Many of the cells in the center panel still show this label.</p><p>Multiple localization proteins: Studying proteins that have multiple localizations (in this case at the gap junction and possibly at the bases of cilia) is a challenge. The authors suggest that the function of GJ1A is due to its role at the bases of cilia. However, to be able to show that this is in fact the case requires constructs that either localize only to one location (by either adding sub cellular localization sites or deleting localization sites) and showing rescue of a loss of function phenotype. OR they need to test mutant constructs that abrogate subcellular specific function that nonetheless rescue the function of interest in the context of gene depletion. For example, mutant constructs that interfere with gap junction function but RESCUE the loss of cilia in GJA1 depleted cells. Unfortunately, for the author's argument, they have exactly the opposite. Injection of dnGJA1 constructs that interfere with gap junction function also eliminates cilia suggesting that it is in fact the gap junction role that is critical for cilia not any cilia localization. The authors claim that they do not see calcium defects and their mass spec does identify genes that are associated with cilia function. However, this may be true but unrelated. Of course, it is possible that the domains of GJA1 that are relevant for gap junction function are also critical for a function at the ciliary base – however, the simplest explanation is that the GJA1 dominant negative constructs point towards a role at the gap junction. Many experiments could be done to address this. Do the dnGJA1 proteins bind to the cilia proteins identified? Do the dnGJA1 proteins also localize to the cilia bases?</p><p>The model and the discussion need to more clearly state what the authors think GJA1 is doing to regulate ciliogenesis. The model in S7 suggests that it might be doing something with microtubules but this was not developed in the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81016.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

In addition, we included F0 mutagenesis data generated by CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of GJA1 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Overall, we have confirmed the loss-of-function of GJA1 using three different approaches, MO-mediated depletion, siRNA-mediated depletion, and CRISPR/cas9-mediated F0 deletion.

In this revised manuscript, we used the same color in Figure 5A and C. And added the GJA1 signal panels to Figure 5A and C to better illustrate the GJA1 pericentriolar label. Although we observed a significant reduction in the GJA1 signal in most GJA1 siRNA-treated cells, GJA1 signals were still detectable. We believe that these signals were detectable because of the incomplete depletion of GJA1 by siRNA treatment. Nonetheless, our data clearly show an overall and significant reduction of GJA1 expression in siRNA-treated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Multiple localization proteins: Studying proteins that have multiple localizations (in this case at the gap junction and possibly at the bases of cilia) is a challenge. The authors suggest that the function of GJ1A is due to its role at the bases of cilia. However, to be able to show that this is in fact the case requires constructs that either localize only to one location (by either adding sub cellular localization sites or deleting localization sites) and showing rescue of a loss of function phenotype. OR they need to test mutant constructs that abrogate subcellular specific function that nonetheless rescue the function of interest in the context of gene depletion. For example, mutant constructs that interfere with gap junction function but RESCUE the loss of cilia in GJA1 depleted cells. Unfortunately, for the author's argument, they have exactly the opposite. Injection of dnGJA1 constructs that interfere with gap junction function also eliminates cilia suggesting that it is in fact the gap junction role that is critical for cilia not any cilia localization. The authors claim that they do not see calcium defects and their mass spec does identify genes that are associated with cilia function. However, this may be true but unrelated. Of course, it is possible that the domains of GJA1 that are relevant for gap junction function are also critical for a function at the ciliary base – however, the simplest explanation is that the GJA1 dominant negative constructs point towards a role at the gap junction. Many experiments could be done to address this. Do the dnGJA1 proteins bind to the cilia proteins identified? Do the dnGJA1 proteins also localize to the cilia bases?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s critical suggestion for further study to strengthen our main idea and experiments. Indeed, our data showed that all three dnGJA1 mutants failed to recover the ciliary defects in GJA1 morphant embryos. Additionally, overexpression of each GJA1 mutant interfered with normal ciliogenesis, although there seemed to be some differences in the severity of ciliary defects (the Δ234–243 mutant caused relatively severe ciliary defects, although it would be challenging to quantitatively analyze the phenotypes) (Figure 2C, D).</p><p>In this revised manuscript, we included several lines of evidence that suggest how GJA1 mutants interfere with wild-type GJA1(wtGJA1) function on ciliogenesis.</p><p>First, we show differential localization of the dnGJA1 mutants (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), and also show that overexpression of dnGJA1 mutants displaced the ciliary localization of wtGJA1 (Figure 2C, D).</p><p>In addition, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with GJA1 mutants and showed that these mutants failed to interact with Rab11a (Figure 8A, B). These data may explain why all the GJA1 mutants affected cilia formation and were not able to rescue ciliary defects caused by the loss-of-function of GJA1.</p><p>Both Rab8 and Rab11 have been reported to be involved in ciliogenesis [25, 26, 37, 38]. Previous research has also shown that Rab8 interacts with CP110 and BBS4 [34, 35, 37], and Rab11 is enriched at the base of the primary cilium and recruits Rab8 to the basal body by interacting with Rabin8 [26, 38].</p><p>Additionally, during basal body maturation, Rab11-positive membrane vesicles are transported to the distal appendages of basal bodies and form large ciliary vesicles. This distal appendage vesicle assembly that forms ciliary vesicles is a prerequisite for CP110 removal and promotes the uncapping of the mother centrioles, which is followed by the recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins and transition zone proteins for ciliogenesis (Irma Sánchez et al. Nat Cell Biol, 2016; Quanlong Lu et a., Nat Cell Biol. 2015).</p><p>We regret that we were not able to clearly identify which domain of GJA1 may be responsible for the interaction with Rab11/Rab8 and critical for ciliogenesis. However, our data suggest that GJA1 regulates pericentriolar vesicle trafficking, which affects Rab11-positive ciliary vesicle accumulation around the pericentriolar regions. Thus, CP110 removal is attenuated, and consequently, ciliogenesis is inhibited. We believe that this finding is an important discovery and will make a strong impact on research in a broad spectrum of biomedical science.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model and the discussion need to more clearly state what the authors think GJA1 is doing to regulate ciliogenesis.

We suggest that microtubules are essential for the proper localization and function of GJA1 in ciliogenesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
