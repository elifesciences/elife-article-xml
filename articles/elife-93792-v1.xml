The available information about how sperm regulate their motility during the final journey to the fertilization site is extremely limited. In this work, we investigated the structural and functional changes in the sperm flagellum after acrosomal exocytosis (AE) and during the interaction with the eggs. The evidence demonstrates that the double helix actin network surrounding the mitochondrial sheath of the midpiece undergoes structural changes prior to the motility cessation. This structural modification is accompanied by a decrease in diameter of the midpiece and is driven by intracellular calcium changes that occur concomitant with a reorganization of the actin helicoidal cortex. Midpiece contraction occurs in a subset of cells that undergo AE, and live-cell imaging during in vitro fertilization showed that the midpiece contraction is required for motility cessation after fusion is initiated. These findings provide the first evidence of the F-actin network’s role in regulating sperm motility, adapting its function to meet specific cellular requirements during fertilization, and highlighting the broader significance of understanding sperm motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sperm motility is required for arrival at the site of fertilization and to penetrate the different layers surrounding the egg. The temporal regulation of sperm motility involves the concerted action of multiple cell structures to enable fertilization. The initial motility of ejaculated sperm is characterized by a linear progressive movement as the cells traverse a long distance within the female reproductive tract. However, at one point, before reaching the oocyte, this initial progressive motion must be changed to a vigorous non-progressive mode of motility called hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demott and Suarez, 1992</xref>). During that migration, most of mouse sperm undergo acrosomal exocytosis (AE), which takes place in the upper segments of the oviduct, before the sperm directly interact with the egg or its surrounding layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">La Spina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muro et al., 2016</xref>). This exocytic event is critical because proteins involved in this process are rearranged in preparation for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noda et al., 2020</xref>). A second dramatic change in motility is subsequently required for efficient sperm-egg fusion. During this event, which has not been studied in detail so far, sperm completely stop moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaddum-Rosse et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaddum‐Rosse et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ravaux et al., 2016</xref>). The cease in sperm motility is considered as an indicative marker of an effective fusion between gametes, given that it is necessary to complete the attachment and fusion between sperm and eggs. Fusion itself is a complex event mediated by several proteins identified using loss-of-function strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneke and Pauli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siu et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, the available information about how sperm regulate their motility during the final journey to the fertilization site and during the interaction with the female gamete is extremely limited. In this final journey, most sperm cells migrate to the ovulated eggs after AE, and very little is known about the motility state of those sperm and about the molecular mechanism in charge of the motility arrest.</p><p>The regulation of sperm motility is achieved by balancing force transduction and the mechanical properties of the flagellum. Both effects are governed by the flagellum cytoskeleton, which consists of two major components: a microtubule-based axoneme, located at the flagellum axis, and actin filaments around it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Otani et al., 1988</xref>). The midpiece and the principal piece also contain the outer dense fibers (ODFs) and the fibrous sheath that have traditionally been referred to as part of the sperm cytoskeleton. Recently, it was found that the three-dimensional (3D) organization of polymerized actin in the flagellum midpiece of murine sperm forms a unique double helix arrangement accompanying mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervasi et al., 2018</xref>). This spatial distribution does not extend into the principal piece, where actin is uniformly distributed between the axoneme and the plasma membrane. Across all investigated cells, this double helix consisted of exactly 87 gyres with a pitch of 244 ± 1 nm, yielding a total midpiece length in mice of 21.2 ± 0.3 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervasi et al., 2018</xref>). Such accurate control of sizes is not typical in live cells given that reactions are prone to stochastic effects and entropy leads to large cell-to-cell fluctuations. Thus, the precise control of the actin helix comes at a substantial regulatory cost for sperm cells. Nevertheless, the function of this specialized structure of actin filaments is largely unknown.</p><p>In this work, we find definite evidence for the role of the helical actin structure in the final stage of motility regulation, when sperm dramatically shift from being hyperactivated to a practically immotile stage. We have investigated the structural changes in the actin cytoskeleton of the sperm flagellum after AE and during the interaction with the eggs. By using a combination of single-cell imaging and super-resolution microscopy methods, our results demonstrate that the helical structure of polymerized actin undergoes a radical structural change at the time of sperm-egg fusion. Further, we uncover that this process is triggered by a substantial increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). This actin-dependent signaling pathway promotes a decrease of the sperm midpiece diameter and motility arrest, both of which are found to be required to complete the fusion process during fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AE promotes a cessation of motility in a subset of sperm cells</title><p>After AE, sperm need to accomplish migration to the ampulla, reach unfertilized eggs, penetrate the cumulus matrix and the zona pellucida, and finally, undergo fusion with the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yanagimachi, 1994</xref>).

Some of the acrosome reacted sperm moved normally (34.1 ± 3.7%, n = 235), whereas the majority of them remained immotile (65.9 ± 6.2%, n = 2350) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, upper and lower panels, respectively, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>).</p><p>The flagellar beat cycle encompasses a self-regulatory mechanism that receives feedback from molecular and mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inaba and Shiba, 2018</xref>). The complete abortion of flagellar beat cycle observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> might be indicative of a stimulus provided by or occurring concomitant with AE. To comprehend the connection between AE and motility, we hypothesized the existence of a mechanical change in the flagella as a result of the AE. For this reason, AE was studied in the presence of FM4-64 fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sánchez-Cárdenas et al., 2014</xref>) to visualize structural changes at the plasma membrane, which can occur at macroscopic scales observed as an alteration in the shape of the flagellum, or at mesoscopic scales, monitored by local changes in FM4-64 fluorescence occurring at the vicinity or within the plasma membrane. EGFP-DsRed2 sperm were stimulated with progesterone and their ‘motility’ behavior was recorded for 5 min in the presence of FM4-64. The loss of EGFP fluorescence in the acrosome of transgenic mice correlated with a noticeable increase of FM4-64 fluorescence in the head, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (see panels 0´ and 3´, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>). In addition, we noticed that sperm that underwent AE later showed an increase in the FM4-64 fluorescence intensity in the flagellum as well (see panel 14´of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>).</p><p>A more detailed analysis of individual cells demonstrated changes in FM4-64 fluorescence according to their motility (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows a motile acrosome-intact sperm (a control case), where the fluorescence levels of EGFP and FM4-64 remained constant during the entire experiment (Pattern I). Interestingly, sperm that lost their acrosome (no EGFP and high FM4-64 fluorescence in the sperm head) and continued moving, presented low levels of FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, Pattern II). On the other hand, acrosome-reacted sperm that remained immotile showed a significant rise in the FM4-64 midpiece fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, Pattern III). Noteworthy, both subsets of cells (with and without motility) displayed the expected increase in FM4-64 fluorescence in the sperm head.</p><p>To deepen our understanding on how sperm lose motility during AE, we designed a sperm-tracking system that can also monitor changes in fluorescence in moving cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Three parameters were then assessed in real time, namely, the beat frequency of the flagellum (by tracking it on bright field images, or the DsRed2 channel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the status of the acrosome (EGFP signal), and changes occurring at or within the membrane in the midpiece (FM4-64 signal). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows that sperm that did not undergo AE remained motile with a stable beat frequency and low FM4-64 fluorescence over the recording time. In stark contrast, after AE, cells gradually diminished the beating frequency until a complete arrest is observed, while a gradual increase in FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the relationship between FM4-64 and viability, a vital dye Sytox Blue was used in imaging flow cytometry experiments. Fluorescence intensities in non-capacitated sperm stimulated with ionomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) were determined and two populations with Sytox Blue signals were clearly distinguished (Sytox+ and Sytox-), enabling the discernment between live and dead sperm. Interestingly, the upper right panels (Sytox Blue+/FM4-64 high) consistently show a positive correlation between FM4-64 and Sytox Blue. Nonetheless, the lower panels (Sytox Blue-) show no correlation with FM4-64 fluorescence, indicating that this population can exhibit either low or high FM4-64 fluorescence. Single-cell examples are shown, where the four categories are represented: dead sperm with low FM4-64 fluorescence (Sytox Blue+/FM4-64 low), dead sperm with high FM4-64 fluorescence (Sytox Blue+/FM4-64 high), live sperm with low FM4-64 fluorescence (Sytox Blue-/FM4-64 low), and live sperm with high FM4-64 fluorescence (Sytox Blue-/FM4-64 high). Therefore, while the FM4-64 signal alone is not a definitive marker for either AE or cell death, it is crucial to use additional viability assessments, such as Sytox Blue, to accurately differentiate between live and dead sperm in studies of AE and sperm motility. Cell viability was always considered, as any imaged sperm was chosen based on motility, indicated by a beating flagellum. The determination of whether selected sperm die during or after AE remains to be elucidated.

This increased colocalization occurred simultaneously with midpiece contraction.</p><p>Overall, these results confirm that (1) the contraction of the midpiece is linked to the remodeling of the plasma membrane and potentially the F-actin cytoskeleton, and that (2) both structures interact with each other, directly or indirectly, at the nanoscales. We then seek to understand whether the driving force for the contraction of the midpiece emanates from the F-actin network. The following scenarios were envisaged: (1) the plasma membrane moves toward the actin cytoskeleton, (2) the actin cytoskeleton moves toward the plasma membrane, or (3) both structures come closer to the center of the flagellum. To investigate the occurrence of any of these scenarios, the positions of fluorescence peaks of FM4-64 and SiR-actin in super-resolution kymographs were tracked, as proxy of either membrane or actin cytoskeleton localization, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–F</xref> show representative histograms of SiR-actin and FM4-64 over time for ionomycin, progesterone-induced and spontaneous AE, respectively.

In this case, the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton move closer toward the center of the cell (set to 0). The slope calculated from the linear fit denotes the velocity of this change. In this example, the plasma membrane is contracting at a rate of 14 μm/min, whereas the actin cytoskeleton is contracting at a rate of 3 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E and H</xref>).

The number measure indicates the abundance or concentration of SiR-actin molecules bound to F-actin fibers, while the brightness analysis helps reveal dynamic changes in molecular aggregation processes. This analysis is based on the idea that higher-order fluorescent complexes, which are mobile within the sample, will cause an increase in signal variability over time. An increase in brightness suggests the formation or movement of supramolecular structures, such as bundles of actin fibers bearing SiR-actin. AE induction with progesterone and ionomycin resulted in a significant increase in actin number and brightness compared to the control (non-reacted) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

Using a plethora of advanced microscopy methods and single-cell imaging, we provide insight about cellular and molecular events that occur in acrosome-reacted sperm, which, undoubtedly, are the ones capable of fertilizing an oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">La Spina et al., 2016</xref>). At this precise moment of the fertilization process, sperm need to stop moving to complete the fusion between the two gametes. The cease of movement is caused by two concomitant processes that take place in the flagellar midpiece region: a change in the F-actin helical structure and a decrease in the midpiece diameter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a structural modification of the sperm flagellum related to a specific cellular necessity, that is, gamete fusion, is described.</p><p>To arrive at the site of fertilization within the female reproductive tract, sperm motility is required. It is also fundamental to penetrate the different layers surrounding the egg. In this journey, sperm sense the environment and adapt their movement to the different physiological scenarios. In addition, recent evidence also demonstrated that after being released from their site of storage in the oviductal isthmus, mouse sperm undergo AE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">La Spina et al., 2016</xref>). This process occurs in the upper segments of the oviduct before any interaction with the eggs or their surrounding layers. This observation opened a new scenario about the motility of sperm in their last transit to the site of fertilization. Little is known about sperm in that region and how sperm move after AE. In this regard, most of the information about mammalian sperm comes from studies conducted in vitro, using a mixture of acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm. Even if their motility is analyzed in a subjective manner or using cell tracking systems, virtually all the experiments are conducted without discerning the acrosomal status of the cells. Another possible source of artifacts in this analysis is related with the fact that most of the experiments are also performed using epididymal sperm (not ejaculated) in aqueous solutions that support sperm capacitation but do not represent the natural viscous environment present in the female tract.</p><p>By performing in vitro experiments, we detected a strong association between the decrease in the midpiece diameter and the cease of sperm motility. This is observed in a subset of sperm after the occurrence of AE. This may suggest that only sperm that undergo AE in the oviduct and do not experience this midpiece contraction are capable of migrating to the ampulla and penetrate the cumulus and the zona pellucida. Those sperm that undergo this phenomenon earlier in the tract may not be suitable to continue their journey, suggesting that this also may select the gametes during their transit to the ampulla. Previous observations tracking sperm within the female tract have shown the existence of acrosome-reacted sperm within the tract that remain non-motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">La Spina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muro et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Acrosome-reacted sperm that bind and penetrate the zona pellucida are ready to fuse with the egg. During sperm-egg fusion, several authors have reported in different species that sperm stop moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaddum-Rosse et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaddum‐Rosse et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ravaux et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanism behind this behavior is not established. One possible explanation is that fusion promotes ion transport changes in sperm, which significantly alter flagellar movement. In this sense, it was previously demonstrated that certain ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> may diffuse from the oocyte to the sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 1998</xref>). However, a clear technical limitation in our experimental approach is that the probes that monitor ion dynamics may be exchanged between both gametes. If the concentration of a given probe does not remain stable, it is impossible to determine the accurate change that occurs during fusion. Future experiments may take advantage of transgenic models that incorporate a particular sensor to study this process in vivo, such as the one used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cohen et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>Regardless of the precise nature of ion exchange between sperm and eggs, the diameter of the sperm flagellum in the midpiece is reduced. This midpiece diameter reduction is strongly associated with cessation of sperm motility and is apparently needed to complete the fusion process. Our observation clearly supports this notion. Importantly, the sperm flagellum folds back during fusion coincident with the decrease in the midpiece diameter. Interestingly, this was previously observed in mammals as well as in sea urchin sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaddum-Rosse et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darszon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guerrero et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Like other cylindrical biological structures, the sperm flagellum relies on the cytoskeleton for its structural organization and specialized mechanical properties. In addition to the change in midpiece diameter, a significant rearrangement of the F-actin cytoskeleton also occurs. In the midpiece, the polymerized actin is organized in a double helix accompanying the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervasi et al., 2018</xref>). As in many other organisms, the actin cytoskeleton possesses important structural functions, and dynamic changes of F-actin allow the cells to conduct important cellular tasks such as exocytosis. However, less is known about the structural changes undergone by the actin cytoskeletons in cilia and flagella. Remarkably, it has been reported that actin forms helix-like structures in the flagellum of the parasite <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paredez et al., 2011</xref>). These findings open the question of whether, to some extent, flagellar helical structures are conserved among diverse species. Our observations demonstrate that the F-actin double helix undergoes a change in the helical pitch as well as in the radial distance to the axoneme. This is concomitant with the decrease in midpiece diameter. Our single-cell experiments using super-resolution microscopy also revealed that the plasma membrane approached the F-actin network during this change. It is well established that various proteins can function as linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Köster and Mayor, 2016</xref>), but their roles in this specific process remain to be studied. Regardless of how these structures are connected, it is evident that both are associated. However, our experimental data cannot determine whether the plasma membrane is causing the change of the actin network or if the actin network influences the plasma membrane.</p><p>Another observation emerging from our study is that a change in [Ca<sup>2</sup><bold><sup>+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> occurs prior to the midpiece contraction. It is well known that Ca<sup>2</sup><bold><sup>+</sup></bold> is important for AE, and a specific transient rise in [Ca<sup>2</sup><bold><sup>+</sup></bold>]<sub>i</sub> originating in the head can trigger exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romarowski et al., 2016</xref>). Previous observations have demonstrated that the sperm head and tail are not isolated compartments, and that ions and other molecules can move between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Buffone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De La Vega-Beltran et al., 2012</xref>). In our single-cell experiments, we observed that the rise in FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece occurs after the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in that region, suggesting a potential association between these events. This could involve diffusion or active transport processes; further investigation is required to determine the precise mechanism to demonstrate if the structural changes are triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase and/or modification in the midpiece architecture may result in functional changes in the mitochondria such as the status of the mitochondrial membrane potential and the ATP production. This possibility needs to be further explored.</p><p>The same phenomenon was studied in sperm bound to the egg plasma membrane to evaluate if the rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> also occurs at the time of fusion. Remarkably, we noticed that most of the bound sperm that ended up fusing with the eggs displayed high levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in both the head and the flagellum. The midpiece contraction and the immobilization occurred when the levels of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> went down in the midpiece, suggesting a possible connection between both events. However, our experimental approach limits the interpretation of this result. One possible explanation is that as soon as sperm bind to the plasma membrane of the oocyte, there is a rapid increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the sperm. On the other hand, a massive transport of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the egg to the sperm could also occur. These hypotheses, however, are hindered by the technical limitations mentioned above. As the oocyte is not loaded with Fluo4, we cannot rule out that the apparent [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decrease seen in these experiments is due to dye diffusion into the oocyte. Either way, it is clear that the transport of this ion into or out of the sperm is key to cease motility at this fundamental step of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sánchez-Cárdenas et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, these results demonstrate that only sperm with elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> are capable of binding to the eggs. All these possible scenarios need to be determined in future experiments. Thus, regardless of the mechanism, a clear change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> dynamics is observed at the time of midpiece contraction. Future studies will aid to indicate if certain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteins that can modify the actin cytoskeleton are responsible for this change.</p><p>Why sperm stop moving? we propose three possible hypotheses. The cessation of sperm motility can be attributed to the simultaneous or not occurrence of various events. (1) A rapid increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels may trigger the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps within the flagellum. This process consumes local ATP levels, disrupting glycolysis in the process. (2) Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton: alterations in the actin cytoskeleton can lead to changes in the mechanical properties of the flagellum, impacting its ability to move effectively. (3) Midpiece contraction: contraction in the midpiece region can potentially interfere with mitochondrial function, thereby impeding the energy production necessary for sustained motility. In addition, we speculate that the folding of the flagellum during fusion further facilitates sperm immobilization because it makes it more difficult for the flagellum to beat. Such process can enhance stability and increase the probability of fusion success. Mechanistically, the folding may occur as a consequence of the deformation-induced stress that develops during the decrease of midpiece diameter.</p><p>In cilia, apart from the findings presented in this article, nothing is known about the regulation of motility by actin. Actin has been found to participate in ciliogenesis, but its involvement in active motility regulation has not been reported. This highlights a potentially unique role for the actin cytoskeleton in regulating sperm function during fertilization. Our discovery of actin’s dynamic reorganization in sperm suggests it could have a more active role in regulating motility and other functions. Given the conservation of cilia and flagella across various organisms, our discovery could prompt further research on the role of the actin network in these structures.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that sperm undergo a structural reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during key events of fertilization, as summarized in the working model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Our findings introduce a new aspect of study in reproductive biology. Previous research has mainly focused on identifying proteins essential for sperm-egg fusion.

Coverslips were cleaned by immersing them in 70% ethanol, followed by a mixture of 1 M hydrochloric acid and 50% ethanol for 1 hr, and rinsed with Milli-Q water. Subsequently, they were dried and subjected to plasma cleaning in a Plasma Etch Inc PE-25 Ver 1002 oven under specific conditions: vacuum set point of 150 mTorr, atmospheric vent for 45 s, purge vent for 5 s, gas stabilization for 15 s, and a vacuum alarm set to 3 min. Spermatozoa were obtained by dissecting the cauda epididymis from mice and resuspending them in 1 ml of NC TYH medium. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 15 min, after which 400 μl of medium was collected into two separate tubes. One tube was adjusted to a final volume of 800 μl with 2× CAP medium to achieve 1× CAP medium and incubated for 60 min, followed by the induction of the acrosome reaction using 30 μl of ionomycin for 30 min. Both tubes were centrifuged at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 3 min, and the supernatant was carefully removed, leaving 100 μl. For fixation, the samples were diluted with 100 μl of PBS and 600 μl of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and placed on coverslips. After a 10 min incubation, the coverslips were washed three times with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, each involving shaking in a digital rotator at 80 RPM for 10 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of TAGA mix was added to each coverslip for 15 min. Finally, the coverslips were preserved by submerging them in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer within a Petri dish until further analysis using an Auriga-FIB-Zeiss scanning electron microscope.</p><p>To facilitate the quantification of the midpiece diameter of the mouse sperm flagellum, we manually annotated 157 well-focused images. These annotations were used to create a comprehensive image dataset specifically for measuring the midpiece. We employed the ImageJ software for the annotation process. Using the ‘Polygon Selection Tool’, we carefully delineated the midpiece of each flagellum. Each image was consistently aligned so that the sperm head was positioned to the left, ensuring the midpiece was as straight as possible for accurate measurement. A polygon was drawn around the edges of the midpiece to define a region of interest (ROI). These ROIs were then saved in a compressed ZIP format. Subsequently, these saved ROIs were imported into a Python script executed in a Jupyter Notebook. This script enabled us to compute the average diameter of the midpiece across all images in the dataset. By leveraging Python’s image processing libraries, we automated the calculation, ensuring precision and reproducibility in our measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging flow cytometry</title><p>For the analysis of mouse spermatozoa under NC conditions using image cytometry, the viability dye, Sytox Blue, was procured from Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific. Transgenic B6D2F1-Tg (CAG/mt-DsRed2, Acr-EGFP) RBGS002Osb mice were used. Sperm were retrieved by sacrificing mice and dissecting the cauda epididymides, which were incubated in 1 ml of NC TYH medium at 37°C for 15 min (swim-out). After incubation, approximately 800 μl of medium containing the sperm was collected, centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 3 min, and the volume was reduced to 300 μl to concentrate the cells. The samples were kept on ice to preserve viability. For fluorescence labeling, Sytox Blue stock solution (1 mM in DMSO) was diluted to 50 μM in TYH medium, and further adjusted to 1 μM with sperm samples using a final volume of 60 μl, mixing 58.8 μl of sperm suspension with 1.2 μl of Sytox Blue solution. Image acquisition was performed using an AMNIS imaging system with a ×60 objective (NA 0.9) and lasers set at 120 mW (488 nm) and 140 mW (561 nm). Sperm images were captured for 30 min, focusing on cells using Aspect Ratio vs. Area in brightfield and RMS Gradient for in-focus selection. Segmentation and analysis of populations of interest were conducted in IDEAS software, where masks for brightfield and fluorescence images were applied to isolate live and dead populations based on Sytox Blue and acrosome fluorescence intensity (EGFP).

The recording medium (NC medium) containing 0.5 μM FM4-64 was utilized for this process. The midpiece diameter and fluorescence intensity were quantified using ImageJ software version 1.47V (National Institute of Health, USA). For fluorescence intensity measurement, ROIs were designated in the sperm head and midpiece. After subtracting the background, the formula (F-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> was applied, where F<sub>0</sub> represents the baseline calculated by averaging the frames prior to stimulus application.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of diameter and FM4-64 fluorescence intensity using kymographs</title><p>Kymographs were constructed with the ImageJ Kymograph plug-in. For super-resolution kymographs, a cross line was plotted every 2.5 μm along the midpiece in SRRF images. The R language environment (R 3.3.3 GUI 1.69 Mavericks build, 7328) was employed to obtain diameter values. The super-resolution kymographs were processed using the autocorrelation (acf) function to determine the positions of fluorescence maxima on both sides of the midpiece membrane. The distance between the maxima represented the diameter value. These values were then normalized to those obtained prior to the addition of AE stimulants or vehicle. For fluorescence kymographs, a line was drawn along the midpiece in Total Internal Reflection (TIRF) images. The fluorescence values were also acquired using the R language environment. After subtracting the background, the formula (F-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> was applied, where F<sub>0</sub> denotes the baseline, calculated by averaging the frames before stimulus application.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Correlation between FM4-64 midpiece fluorescence and normalized diameter: Data transformation from fluorescence to contraction</title><p>The kymograph analysis provided two main values for each time point evaluated: normalized diameter values every 2.5 μm from the super-resolution kymographs, and normalized fluorescence values for each pixel analyzed (one value every 0.117 µm) from the fluorescence kymographs. To examine the relationship between these values, a graph was created in the R language environment that included all data points, encompassing all analyzed cells, all diameter measurements (every 2.5 μm), and their corresponding fluorescence values for all time points evaluated. In this graph, the x-axis represents the normalized diameter, while the y-axis represents the normalized fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, a linear regression was performed using the general formula <italic>mx + b</italic>, where <italic>m</italic> is the slope with a value of 8.90 ± 0.15, <italic>b</italic> is the y-intercept with a value of –8.05 ± 0.17, and R2 is 0.32. With the parameters of the linear regression, we could approximate the midpiece diameter value based on a given FM4-64 fluorescence value. Despite data dispersion, this method provided an approximate value that could indicate whether the midpiece was contracting or not. It is noteworthy that the observed data dispersion may have biological significance at the cell population level, where heterogeneity among individual spermatozoa may contribute to variability in their physiological responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Live imaging of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> levels and AE</title><p>In this study, both CD1 and hybrid F1 mouse sperm were utilized.

By utilizing the plot_ly function of the R language environment, the 3D kymograph was plotted with time as the x-axis, length along the midpiece as the y-axis, and fluorescence intensity/diameter as the z-axis. While the color code for this dimension is not required, it remains present to facilitate visual interpretation of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Single-cell live imaging of midpiece membrane and F-actin during AE</title><p>Following swim-out, CD1 mouse sperm were incubated with 100 nM SiR-actin for 10 min in NC medium.

By determining the Manders' colocalization coefficients for the super-resolution images of the region of the flagellum’s midpiece where the contraction initiation was observed, we objectively assessed the extent of spatial overlap between FM4-64 and SiR-actin.

Sperm were seeded onto poly-<sc>l</sc>-lysine-coated coverslips (Corning #1.5), air-dried for 10 min, fixed, and permeabilized with 0.3% fresh glutaraldehyde and 0.25% Triton-X100 in cytoskeleton buffer (CB, containing 10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM glucose, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH = 6.1) for 1 min at room temperature. This was followed by three washes with CB (5 min at room temperature). Next, cells were incubated with 2% glutaraldehyde in CB for 15 min at room temperature and washed twice with CB (10 min at room temperature).

Nonspecific staining was determined by incubating sperm in the absence of phalloidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervasi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Images were acquired using Andor IQ 2.3 software on a custom-built microscope equipped with an Olympus PlanApo 100× NA 1.45 objective and a CRISP ASI autofocus system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Campagnola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weigel et al., 2011</xref>). Alexa Fluor 647 was excited with a 642 nm laser (DL640-150-O, CrystaLaser, Reno, NV) under continuous illumination. Initially, the photo-switching rate was sufficient to provide a substantial fluorophore density. However, as fluorophores irreversibly photo-bleached, a 405 nm laser was introduced to enhance photo-switching. The intensity of the 405 nm laser was adjusted within the range of 0.01–0.5 mW to maintain an appropriate density of active fluorophores. Axial localization was achieved through astigmatism using a MicAO 3DSR adaptive optics system (Imagine Optic, Orsay, France), which allowed for both the correction of spherical aberrations and the introduction of astigmatism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izeddin et al., 2012</xref>). Axial localization with adaptive optics enabled 3D reconstruction over a thickness of 1 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gervasi et al., 2018</xref>). A calibration curve for axial localization was generated with 100 nm TetraSpeck microspheres (Invitrogen) immobilized on a coverslip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2008</xref>).

Identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms would provide novel insights into a crucial but mostly overlooked physiological change during the sperm's life cycle. In this publication the authors aim to provide evidence that the helical actin structure surrounding the sperm mitochondria in the midpiece plays a role in regulating sperm motility, specifically the motility arrest during sperm fusion but also during earlier cessation of motility in a subpopulation of sperm post acrosomal exocytosis.</p><p>The main observation the authors make is that in a subpopulation of sperm undergoing acrosomal exocytosis and sperm that fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte display a decrease in midpiece parameter of 30 nm. The authors propose the decrease in midpiece diameter via various microscopy techniques based on membrane dyes and bright-field images. In the revised version of the manuscript, a change in midpiece diameter is now confirmed via electron microscopy, even though the difference is not significant. The authors also propose that the midpiece diameter decrease is driven by changes in sperm intracellular Ca2+ and structural changes of the actin helix network. Future studies are still needed to confirm the casualty of these events and explore the discrepancy between fluorescence microscopy results and SEM. Overall, the authors should further tone down their conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

our understanding of sperm motility regulation during fertilization by uncovering the midpiece/mitochondria contraction associated with motility cessation and structural changes in the midpiece actin network as its mode of action. The evidence supporting the conclusion is solid, with rigorous live cell imaging using state-of-the-art microscopy, although more functional analysis of the midpiece/mitochondria contraction would have further strengthened the study. The work will be of broad interest to cell biologists working on the cytoskeleton, mitochondria, cell fusion, and fertilization. Strengths: The authors demonstrate that structural changes in the flagellar midpiece F-actin network are concomitant to midpiece/mitochondrial contraction and motility arrest during sperm-egg fusion by rigorous live cell imaging using state-of-art microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>Response P1.1: We thank the reviewer for her/his positive assessment of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Many interesting observations are listed as correlated or in time series but do not necessarily demonstrate the causality and it remains to be further tested whether the sperm undergoing midpiece contraction are those that fertilize or those that are not selected. Further elaboration of the function of the midpiece contraction associated with motility cessation (a major key discovery of the manuscript) would benefit from a more mechanistic study.</p></disp-quote><p>Response P1.2: We thank the reviewer for this point. We have toned down some of our statements since some of the observations are indeed temporal correlations. We will explore some of these possible connections in future experiments. In addition, we have now incorporated additional experiments and possible explanations about the function of the midpiece contraction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors used various microscopy techniques, including super-resolution microscopy, to observe the changes that occur in the midpiece of mouse sperm flagella. Previously, it was shown that actin filaments form a double helix in the midpiece. This study reveals that the structure of these actin filaments changes after the acrosome reaction and before sperm-egg fusion, resulting in a thinner midpiece. Furthermore, by combining midpiece structure observation with calcium imaging, the authors show that changes in intracellular calcium concentrations precede structural changes in the midpiece. The cessation of sperm motility by these changes may be important for fusion with the egg. Elucidation of the structural changes in the midpiece could lead to a better understanding of fertilization and the etiology of male infertility. The conclusions of this manuscript are largely supported by the data, but there are several areas for improvement in data analysis and interpretation. Please see the major points below.</p></disp-quote><p>Response P2.1: We thank the reviewer for the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear whether an increased FM4-64 signal in the midpiece precedes the arrest of sperm motility. in or This needs to be clarified to argue that structural changes in the midpiece cause sperm motility arrest. The authors should analyze changes in both motility and FM4-64 signal over time for individual sperm.</p></disp-quote><p>Response P2.2 : We have conducted single cell experiments tracking both FM4-64 and motility as the reviewer suggested (Supplementary Fig S1). We have observed that in all cases, cells gradually diminished the beating frequency and increased FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece until a complete motility arrest is observed. A representative example is shown in this Figure but we will reinforce this concept in the results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is possible that sperm stop moving because they die. Figure 1G shows that the FM464 signal is increased in the midpiece of immotile sperm, but it is necessary to show that the FM4-64 signal is increased in sperm that are not dead and retain plasma membrane integrity by checking sperm viability with propidium iodide or other means.</p></disp-quote><p>Response P2.3: This is a very good point. In our experiments, we always considered sperm that were motile to hypothesize about the relevance of this observation. We have two types of experiments:</p><p>(1) Sperm-egg Fusion: In experiments where sperm and eggs were imaged to observe their fusion, sperm were initially moving and after fusion, the midpiece contraction (increase in FM4-64 fluorescence was observed) indicating that the change in the midpiece (that was observed consistently in all fusing cells analyzed), is part of the process.</p><p>(2) Sperm that underwent acrosomal exocytosis (AE): we have observed two behaviours as shown in Figure 1:</p><p>a) Sperm that underwent AE and they remain motile without midpiece contraction (they are alive for sure);</p><p>b) Sperm that underwent AE and stopped moving with an increase in FM464 fluorescence. We propose that this contraction during AE is not desired because it will impede sperm from moving forward to the fertilization site when they are in the female reproductive tract. In this case, we acknowledge that the cessation of sperm motility may be attributed to cellular death, potentially correlating with the increased FM4-64 signal observed in the midpiece of immotile sperm that have undergone AE. To address this hypothesis, we conducted image-based flow cytometry experiments, which are well-suited for assessing cellular heterogeneity within large populations.</p><p>Author response image 1 illustrates the relationship between cell death and spontaneous AE in noncapacitated mouse sperm, where intact acrosomes are marked by EGFP. Cell death was evaluated using Sytox Blue staining, a dye that is impermeable to live cells and shows affinity for DNA. AE was assessed by the absence of EGFP in the acrosome.</p><p>Author response image 1a indicates a lack of correlation between Sytox and EGFP fluorescence. Two populations of sperm with EGFP signals were found (EGFP+ and EGFP-), each showing a broad distribution of Sytox signal, enabling the distinction between cells that retain plasma membrane integrity (live sperm: Sytox-) and those with compromised membranes (dead cells: Sytox+). The observed bimodal distribution of EGFP signal, regardless of live versus dead cell populations, indicates that the fenestration of the plasma membrane known to occur during AE is a regulated process that does not necessarily compromise the overall plasma membrane integrity.</p><p>These observations are reinforced by the single-cell examples in Author response image 1b, where we were able to identify sperm in four categories: live sperm with intact acrosome (EGFP+/Sytox-), live sperm with acrosomal exocytosis (EGFP-/Sytox-), dead sperm with intact acrosome (EGFP+/Sytox+), and dead sperm with AE (EGFP-/Sytox+). Note the case of AE (lacking EGFP signal) which bears an intact plasma membrane (lacking Sytox Blue signal). Author response image 2 shows single-cell examples of the four categories observed with confocal microscopy to reinforce the observations from Author response image 1a.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Fi Image based flow cytometry analysis (ImageStream Merk II), of non-capacitated mouse sperm, showing the distribution of EGFP signal (acrosome integrity) against Sytox Blue staining (cell viability).</title><p>(A) The quadrants show: Sytox Blue + / EGFP low (17.6%), Sytox Blue + / EGFP high (40.1%), Sytox Blue - / EGFP high (20.2%), and Sytox Blue - / EGFP low (21.7%).

Two populations of sperm with Sytox Blue signals were clearly distinguished (Sytox+ and Sytox-), enabling the discernment between live and dead sperm. Interestingly, the upper right panels of Author response images 3A, 4A, and 5A (Sytox Blue+ / FM4-64 high) consistently show a positive correlation between FM4-64 and Sytox Blue. This observation aligns with the concern raised by Reviewer 2, suggesting that compromised membranes due to cell death provide more binding sites for FM4-64.</p><p>Nonetheless, the lower panels of Author response images 3A, 4A and 5A (Sytox Blue-) show no correlation with FM4-64 fluorescence, indicating that this population can exhibit either low or high FM4-64 fluorescence.

Before reaching a certain threshold, there is no correlation between FM4-64 and Sytox Blue signals, indicating no cell death. However, after crossing this threshold, the FM4-64 signal becomes correlated with Sytox Blue+ cells, indicating cell death (Author response images 4-6).</p><p>(3) The Sytox Blue- population of capacitated sperm is sensitive to AE stimulation with progesterone, leading to the expected increase in FM4-64 fluorescence.</p><p>Therefore, while the FM4-64 signal alone is not a definitive marker for either AE or cell death, it is crucial to use additional viability assessments, such as Sytox Blue, to accurately differentiate between live and dead sperm in studies of acrosome exocytosis and sperm motility. In the present work, we did not use a cell viability marker due to the complex multicolor, multidimensional fluorescence experiments. However, cell viability was always considered, as any imaged sperm was chosen based on motility, indicated by a beating flagellum. The determination of whether selected sperm die during or after AE remains to be elucidated. The results presented in Figure 2 and Supplementary S1 show examples of motile sperm that experience an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence.</p><p>All this information is added to the manuscript (Supplementary Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is unclear how the structural change in the midpiece causes the entire sperm flagellum, including the principal piece, to stop moving.

We propose three possible hypotheses for the cessation of sperm motility, which can be attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of various events:</p><p>(1) Rapid increase in [Ca2+]i levels: A rapid increase in [Ca2+]i levels may trigger the activation of Ca2+ pumps within the flagellum. This process consumes local ATP levels, disrupting glycolysis and thereby depleting the energy required for motility.</p><p>(2) Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton: Alterations in the actin cytoskeleton can lead to changes in the mechanical properties of the flagellum, impacting its ability to move effectively.</p><p>(3) Midpiece contraction: Contraction in the midpiece region can potentially interfere with mitochondrial function, impeding the energy production necessary for sustained motility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The mitochondrial sheath and cell membrane are very close together when observed by transmission electron microscopy. The image in Figure 9A with the large space between the plasma membrane and mitochondria is misleading and should be corrected. The authors state that the distance between the plasma membrane and mitochondria approaches about 100 nm after the acrosome reaction (Line 330 - Line 333), but this is a very long distance and large structural changes may occur in the midpiece. Was there any change in the mitochondria themselves when they were observed with the DsRed2 signal?</p></disp-quote><p>Response P2.5: The authors appreciate the reviewer’s observation regarding the need to correct the image in Figure 9A, as the original depiction conveys a misleading representation of the spatial relationship between the mitochondrial sheath and the plasma membrane. This figure has been corrected to accurately reflect a more realistic proximity, while keeping in mind that it is a cartoonish representation.</p><p>Regarding the comments about the distances mentioned between former lines 330 and 333, the measurement was not intended to describe the gap between the plasma membrane and the mitochondria but rather the distance between F-actin and the plasma membrane.</p><p>Author response image 6 shows high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of two sperm fixed with a protocol tailored to preserve plasma membranes (ref), where the insets clearly show the flagellate architecture in the midpiece with an intact plasma membrane covering the mitochondrial network. A non-capacitated sperm with an intact acrosome is shown in panel A, and a capacitated sperm that has experienced AE is shown in panel B.</p><p>Notably, the results depicted in Author response image 6 demonstrate that, irrespective of the AE status, the distance between the plasma membrane and mitochondria consistently remains less than 20 nm, thus confirming the close proximity of these structures in both physiological states. As Reviewer 2 pointed out, if there is no significant difference in the distance between the plasma membrane and mitochondria, then the observed structural changes in the actin network within the midpiece should somehow alter the actual deposition of mitochondria within the midpiece. Figure 5D-F shows that midpiece contraction is associated with a decrease in the helical pitch of the actin network; the distance between turns of the actin helix decreases from l = 248 nm to l = 159 nm. This implies a net change in the number of turns the helix makes per 1 µm, from 4 to 6 µm-1.</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>SEM image showing the proximity between plasma membrane and mitochondria.</title><p>Scale bar 100 nm.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93792-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, a structural contraction can be observed in Figure 5D-F, where the radius of the helix decreases by about 50 nm. To clarify this point, we sought to measure the deposition of individual DsRed2 mitochondria using computational superresolution microscopy—FF-SRM (SRRF and MSSR), Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), or a combination of both (SIM + MSSR), in 2D. Author response image 7 shows that these three approaches allow the observation of individual DsRed mitochondria; however, the complexity of their 3D arrangement, combined with the limited space between mitochondria (as seen in Author response image 6), precludes a reliable estimation of mitochondrial organization within the midpiece. To overcome these challenges, we decided to study the midpiece architecture via SEM experiments on non-capacitated versus capacitated sperm stimulated with ionomycin to undergo the AE.</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Organization of mitochondria observed via FF-SRM and SIM.</title><p>Scale bar 2 µm.

A significant correlation between the diameter of the flagellum and its curvature was observed (Author response image 9), suggesting a reorganization of the midpiece due to shearing forces.

However, the current research employs a wide array of multidimensional imaging techniques that are not always compatible with, or might be suboptimal for, simultaneous viability assessments. In agreement with the reviewer's concerns, it is recognized that the data presented in Figure 1C may inherently be biased due to cell death. Nonetheless, Author response image 1 demonstrates that the relationship between AE and cell death is more complex than a straightforward all-or-nothing scenario. Specifically, Author response image 1C illustrates a case where the plasma membrane is compromised (Sytox Blue+) yet maintains acrosomal integrity (EGFP+). This observation contradicts Reviewer 1's assertion that &quot;the green fluorescence of the acrosome disappears when sperm die,&quot; as discussed more comprehensively in response P2.3.</p><p>In light of these observations, we have meticulously revisited the entire manuscript to address and clarify potential biases in our results due to cell death.

Identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms would provide novel insights into a crucial but mostly overlooked physiological change during the sperm's life cycle. In this publication, the authors aim to provide evidence that the helical actin structure surrounding the sperm mitochondria in the midpiece plays a role in regulating sperm motility, specifically the motility arrest during sperm fusion but also during earlier cessation of motility in a subpopulation of sperm post acrosomal exocytosis. The main observation the authors make is that in a subpopulation of sperm undergoing acrosomal exocytosis and sperm that fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte display a decrease in midpiece parameter due to a 200 nm shift of the plasma membrane towards the actin helix. The authors show the decrease in midpiece diameter via various microscopy techniques all based on membrane dyes, bright-field images and other orthogonal approaches like electron microscopy would confirm those observations if true but are missing. The lack of additional experimental evidence and the fact that the authors simultaneously observe an increase in membrane dye fluorescence suggests that the membrane dyes instead might be internalized and are now staining intracellular membranes, creating a false-positive result. The authors also propose that the midpiece diameter decrease is driven by changes in sperm intracellular Ca2+ and structural changes of the actin helix network. Important controls and additional experiments are needed to prove that the events observed by the authors are causally dependent and not simply a result of sperm cells dying.</p></disp-quote><p>Response P3.1: We appreciate the reviewer's observations and critiques. In response, we have expanded our experimental approach to include alternative methodologies such as mathematical modeling and electron microscopy, alongside further fluorescence microscopy studies. This diversified approach aims to mitigate potential interpretation artifacts and substantiate the validity of our observations regarding the contraction of the sperm midpiece. Additionally, we have implemented further control experiments to fortify the credibility and robustness of our findings, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable set of results.</p><p>First, we acknowledge the concerns raised by Reviewer 2 regarding the interpretation of the magnitude of the observed contraction of the sperm flagellum's midpiece (see response P2.5). Specifically, we believe that the assertion that &quot;... there is a decrease in midpiece parameter due to a 200 nm shift of the plasma membrane towards the actin helix&quot; stated by reviewer 3 needs careful examination. We recognize that the fluorescence microscopy data provided might not conclusively support such a substantial shift. Our live cell imaging and superresolution microscopy experiments indicate that there is a significant decrease in the diameter of the sperm flagellum associated with AE. This is supported by colocalization experiments where FM4-64-stained structures (fluorescing upon binding to membranes) are observed moving closer to Sir-Actinlabeled structures (binding to F-actin). Quantitatively, Figure S5 describes the spatial shift between FM4-64 and Sir-Actin signals, narrowing from a range of 140-210 nm to 50-110 nm (considering the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of the distributions). The mean separation distance between both signals changes from 180 nm in AI cells to 70 nm in AR cells, a net shift of 110 nm. This observation suggests caution regarding the claim of a &quot;200 nm shift of the plasma membrane towards the actin cortex.&quot;</p><p>Moreover, the concerns raised by Reviewer #3 about the potential internalization of membrane dyes, which might create a false-positive result by staining intracellular membranes, offer an alternative mechanism to explain a shift of up to 100 nm. This perspective is also supported by the critique from Reviewer #2 regarding the substantial distance (about 100 nm) between the plasma membrane and mitochondria post-acrosome reaction: “The authors state that the distance between the plasma membrane and mitochondria approaches about 100 nm after the acrosome reaction (…), but this is a very long distance and large structural changes may occur in the midpiece”. These insights have prompted us to refine our methodology and interpretation of the data to ensure a more accurate representation of the underlying biological processes.</p><p>Author response image 11 shows a first principles approach in two spatial dimensions to explore three scenarios where a membrane dye, such as FM4-64, stains structures at and within the midpiece of a sperm flagellum, but yet does not result in a net change of diameter. Author response image 11A-C illustrates three theoretical arrangements of fluorescent dyes: Model 1 features two rigid, parallel structures that mimic the plasma membrane surrounding the midpiece of the flagellum. Model 2 builds on Model 1 by incorporating the possibility of dye internalization into structures located near the membrane, suggesting a slightly more complex interaction with nearby membranous intracellular structures. Model 3 represents an extreme scenario where the fluorescent dyes stain both the plasma membrane and internal structures, such as mitochondrial membranes, indicating extensive dye penetration and binding. Author response image 11D-F displays the convolution of the theoretical fluorescent signals from Models 1 to 3 with the theoretical point spread function (PSF) of a fluorescent microscope, represented by a Gaussian-like PSF with a sigma of 19 pixels (approximately 300 nm). This process simulates how each model's fluorescence would manifest under microscopic observation, showing subtle differences in the spatial distribution of fluorescence among the models. Author response image 11G-I reveals the superresolution images obtained through Mean Shift Super Resolution (MSSR) processing of the models depicted in Author response image 11D-F.</p><p>By analyzing the three scenarios, it becomes clear that the signals from Models 2 and 3 shift towards the center compared to Model 1, as depicted in Author response image 11J. This shift in fluorescence suggests that the internalization of the dye and its interaction with internal structures might significantly influence the perceived spatial distribution and intensity of fluorescence, thereby impacting the interpretation of structural changes within the midpiece. Consequently, the experimentally observed contraction of up to 100 nm in could represent an actual contraction of the sperm flagellum's midpiece, a relocalization of the FM4-64 membrane dyes to internal structures, or a combination of both scenarios.</p><p>To discern between these possibilities, we implemented a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) approach. The findings presented in Figure 5 and Author response images 7 to 9 conclusively demonstrate that the AE involves a comprehensive reorganization of the midpiece. This reorganization affects its diameter, which changes by approximately 50 nm, as well as the pitch and the organization of both the actin and mitochondrial networks. This data corroborates the structural alterations observed and supports the validity of our interpretations regarding midpiece dynamics during the AE.</p><fig id="sa3fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 11.</label><caption><title>Modeling three scenarios of midpiece staining with membrane fluorescent dyes.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93792-sa3-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Secondly, we wish to clarify that in some of our experiments, we have utilized changes in the intensity of FM4-64 fluorescence as an indirect measure of midpiece contraction. This approach is supported by a linear inverse correlation between these variables, as illustrated in Figure S2D. It is important to note that this observation is correlative and indirect; therefore, our data does not directly substantiate the claim that &quot;in a subpopulation of sperm undergoing AE and sperm that fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte, there is a decrease in midpiece parameter due to a 200 nm shift of the plasma membrane towards the actin helix&quot;. Specifically, we have not directly measured the distance between the plasma membrane and actin cortex in experiments involving gamete fusion.</p><p>All the concerns highlighted in this Response P1.1 have been addressed and incorporated into the manuscript.

Was the block of AE by actin depolymerization observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Response R1.1: We agree with the reviewer but unfortunately, since actin polymerization and or depolymerization in the head are important for exocytosis, we cannot use this experimental approach to dissect both events. Addition of these inhibitors block the occurrence of AE (PMID: 12604633).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please provide the rationale for using FM4-64 to visualize the plasma membrane since it has been reported to selectively stain membranes of vacuolar organelles. What is the principle of increase of FM4-64 dye intensity, other than the correlation with midpiece contraction? For example, in lines 400-402: the authors mentioned that 'some acrosomereacted moving sperm within the perivitelline space had low FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece (Figure 6C). After 20 minutes, these sperm stopped moving and exhibited increased FM4-64 fluorescence, indicating midpiece contraction (Figure 6D).' While recognizing the increase of FM4-64 dye intensity can be an indicator of midpiece contraction, without knowing how and when the intensity of FM4-64 dye changes, it is hard to understand this observation. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Response R1.2: FM4-64 is an amphiphilic styryl fluorescent dye that preferentially binds to the phospholipid components of cell membranes, embedding itself in the lipid bilayer where it interacts with phospholipid head groups. Due to its amphiphilic nature, FM dyes primarily anchor to the outer leaflet of the bilayer, which restricts their internalization. It has been demonstrated that FM4-64 enters cells through endocytic pathways, making these dyes valuable tools for studying endocytosis.</p><p>Upon binding, FM4-64's fluorescence intensifies in a more hydrophobic environment that restricts molecular rotation, thus reducing non-radiative energy loss and enhancing fluorescence. These photophysical properties render FM dyes useful for observing membrane fusion events. When present in the extracellular medium, FM dyes rapidly reach a chemical equilibrium and label the plasma membrane in proportion to the availability of binding sites.</p><p>In wound healing studies, for instance, the fluorescence of FM4-64 is known to increase at the wound site. This increase is attributed to the repair mechanisms that promote the fusion of intracellular membranes at the site of the wound, leading to a rise in FM4-64 fluorescence. Similarly, an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence has been reported in the heads of both human and mouse sperm, coinciding with AE. In this scenario, the fusion between the plasma membrane and the acrosomal vesicle provides additional binding sites for FM4-64, thus increasing the total fluorescence observed in the head. This dynamic response of FM4-64 makes it an excellent marker for studying these cellular processes in real-time.</p><p>This study is the first to report an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece of the sperm flagellum. Figures 5 and Author response images 6 to 9 demonstrate that during the contraction of the sperm flagellum, structural rearrangements occur, including the compaction of the mitochondrial sheath and other membranous structures. Such contraction likely increases the local density of membrane lipids, thereby elevating the local concentration of FM4-64 and enhancing the probability of fluorescence emission. Additionally, changes in the microenvironment such as pH or ionic strength during contraction might further influence FM4-64’s fluorescence properties, as detailed by Smith et al. in the Journal of Membrane Biology (2010). The photophysical behavior of FM4-64, including changes in quantum yield due to tighter membrane packing or alterations in curvature or tension, may also contribute to the increased fluorescence observed. Notably, Figure S2 indicates that other fluorescent dyes like Memglow 700, Bodipy-GM, and FM1-43 also show a dramatic increase in their fluorescence during the midpiece contraction. Investigating whether the compaction of the plasma membrane or other mesoscale processes occur in the midpiece of the sperm flagellum could be a valuable area for future research. The use of fluorescent dyes such as LAURDAN or Nile Red might provide further insights into these membrane dynamics, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the biochemical and structural changes during sperm motility and gamete fusion events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) As the volume of the whole midpiece stays the same while the diameter decreases along the whole midpiece (midpiece contraction), the authors need to describe what changes in the midpiece length they observe during the contraction.

The Fluo4 signal, being diffraction-limited, adheres to a resolution limit of approximately 200-300 nanometers under conventional light microscopy. This limitation causes the fluorescence signal to appear broader and less defined. Conversely, super-resolution microscopy techniques, such as SRRF (Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations), achieve resolutions down to tens of nanometers, allowing FM4-64 to reveal finer details at the plasma membrane and display potentially smaller apparent sizes of stained structures. Although both dyes might localize to the same cellular regions, the higher resolution of the FM4-64 image allows it to show a more precise and smaller diameter of the midpiece of the flagellum compared to the broader, less defined signal of Fluo4. To address this, the legend of Figure 4E has been slightly modified to clarify that the FM4-64 image possesses greater resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 5D-G: the midpiece diameter of AR intact cells was shown ~ 0.8 um or more in Figure 2, while now the radius in Figure 5 is only 300 nm.

This is an excellent point. As suggested by this reviewer as well as the other reviewers, we have performed SEM to observe the changes in the midpiece observed after its contraction for two main reasons. First, to confirm this observation using a different approach that does not involve the use of membrane dyes. As shown in Author response image 6-10, we have observed that in addition to the midpiece diameter, there is a reorganization of the mitochondria sheet that is also suggested by the SIM experiments. These observations will be explored with more experiments to confirm the structural and functional changes that mitochondria undergo during the contraction.

Do the authors mean that a proportion of the sperm was motile prior to acrosomal exocytosis and became immotile after, or were the sperm immotile to begin with? Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Response R3.4: This statement is based on the quantification of the motile sperm after induction of AE within the AR population (Fig. 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors do not provide any experimental evidence supporting the first scenario. In video 1 a lot of sperm do not seem to be moving to begin with, only a few sperm show clear beating in and out of the focal plane. The highlighted sperm that acrosome-reacted upon exposure to progesterone don't seem to be moving prior to the addition of progesterone. In contrast, the sperm that spontaneously acrosome react move the whole time. In video 1 this reviewer was not able to identify one sperm that stopped moving upon acrosomal exocytosis. Similarly in video 3, although the resolution of the video makes it difficult to distinguish motile from non-motile sperm. In video 2 the authors only show sperm that are already acrosome reacted. Please explain and provide additional evidence and statistical analysis supporting that sperm stop moving upon acrosomal exocytosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Response R3.5: In videos 1 and 3, the cells are attached to the glass with concanavalin-A, this lectin makes sperm immotile (if well attached) because both the head and tail stick to the glass. The observed motility of sperm in these videos is likely due to them not being properly attached to the glass, which is completely normal. On the contrary, in videos 2 and 4, sperm are attached to the glass with laminin. This is a glycoprotein that only binds the sperm to the glass through its head, that is why they move freely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Could the authors provide additional information about the FM4-64 fluorescent dye?</p><p>What is the mechanism, and how does it visualize structural changes at the flagellum? Since the whole head lights up, does that mean that the dye is internalized and now stains additional membranes, similar to during wound healing assays (PMID 20442251, 33667528). Or is that an imaging artifact? How do the authors explain the correlation between FM4-64 fluorescence increase in the midpiece and the observed change in diameter? Does FM4-64 have solvatochromatic properties?</p></disp-quote><p>Response R3.6: We appreciate the insightful queries posed by Reviewer 3, which echo the concerns initially brought forward by Reviewer 1. For a detailed explanation of the mechanism of FM4-64 dye, how we interpret it, visualizes structural changes in the flagellum, and its behavior during cellular processes, please refer to our detailed response in Response R1.2. In brief, FM464 is a lipophilic styryl dye that preferentially binds to the outer leaflets of cellular membranes due to its amphiphilic nature. Upon binding, the dye becomes fluorescent, allowing for the visualization of membrane dynamics. The increase in fluorescence in the sperm head or midpiece likely results from the dye’s accumulation in areas where membrane restructuring occurs, such as during AE or in response to changes in the flagellum structure.</p><p>Regarding the specific questions about internalization and whether FM4-64 stains additional membranes similarly to what is observed in wound healing assays, it's important to note that FM4-64 can indeed be internalized through endocytosis and subsequently label internal vesicular structures. Additionally, FM4-64 may experience changes in its fluorescence as a result of fusion events that increase the lipid content of the plasma membrane, as observed in studies cited (PMID 20442251, 33667528). This characteristic makes FM4-64 valuable not only for outlining cell membranes but also for tracking the dynamics of both internal and external membrane systems, particularly during cellular events that involve significant membrane remodeling, such as wound healing or AE.</p><p>Concerning whether the increased fluorescence and observed changes in diameter are artifacts or reflect real biological processes, the correlation observed likely indicates actual changes in the midpiece architecture through molecular mechanisms that remain to be further elucidated. The data presented in Figures 5 and Author response images 6-10 support that this increase in fluorescence is not merely an artifact but a feature of how FM4-64 interacts with its environment.</p><p>Finally, regarding the solvatochromatic properties of FM4-64, while the dye does show changes in its fluorescence intensity in different environments, its solvatochromatic properties are generally less pronounced than those of dyes specifically designed to be solvatochromatic. FM464's fluorescence changes are more a result of membrane interaction dynamics and dye concentration than of solvatochromatic shifts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For the experiment summarized in Figure S1, did the authors detect sperm that acrosome-reacted upon exposure to progesterone and kept moving? This reviewer is wondering how the authors reliably measure FM4-64 fluorescence if the flagellum moves in and out of the focal plane. If the authors observe sperm that keep moving, what was the percentage within a sperm population and how did FM4-64 fluorescence change?</p></disp-quote><p>Response R3.6: We did identify sperm that underwent acrosome reaction upon exposure to progesterone and continued to exhibit movement. However, due to the issue raised by the reviewer regarding the flagellum going out of focus, we opted to quantify the percentage of sperm that were adhered to the slide (using laminin). This approach allows for the observation of flagellar position over time, facilitating an easy assessment of fluorescence changes. The percentage of sperm that maintained movement after AE is depicted in Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figure S1B it doesn't look like the same sperm is shown in all channels or time points, the hook shown in the EGFP channel is not always pointing in the same direction. If FM4-64 is staining the plasma membrane, how do the authors explain that the flagellum seems to be more narrow in the FM4-64 channel than in the brightfield and DsRed2 channel?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.7: It is the same sperm, but due to technical limitations images were sequentially acquired. For example, for time 5 minutes after progesterone, all images in DIC were taken, then all images in the EGFP channel, then DsRed2* and finally FM4-64. The reason for this was to acquire images as fast as possible, particularly in DIC images which were then processed to get the beat frequency.</p><p>Regarding the flagellum that seems to be more narrow in the FM4-64 channel compared to the BF or DsRed2 channel, the explanation is related to the fact that intensity of the DsRed2 signal is stronger than the other two. This higher signal may have increased the amount of photons captured by the detector.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Overall, it would be beneficial to include statistics on how many sperm within a population did change FM4-64 fluorescence during AE and how many did not, in addition to information about motility changes and viability. Did the authors exclude that the addition of FM4-64 causes cell death which could result in immotile sperm or that only dying sperm show an increase in FM4-64 fluorescence?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.8: The relationship between cell death and the increase in FM4-64 fluorescence is widely discussed in Response P2.3. In our experiments, we always considered sperm that were motile to hypothesize about the relevance of this observation. We have two types of experiments:</p><p>(1) Sperm-egg Fusion: In experiments where sperm and eggs were imaged to observe their fusion, sperm were initially moving and after fusion, the midpiece contraction (increase in FM4-64 fluorescence was observed) indicating that the change in the midpiece (that was observed consistently in all fusing cells analyzed), is part of the process.</p><p>(2) Sperm that underwent AE: we have observed two behaviours as shown in Figure 1:</p><p>a) Sperm that underwent AE and they remain motile without midpiece contraction (they are alive for sure);</p><p>b) Sperm that underwent AE and stopped moving with an increase in FM464 fluorescence. We propose that this contraction during AE is not desired because it will impede sperm from moving forward to the fertilization site when they are in the female reproductive tract. In this case, we acknowledge that the cessation of sperm motility may be attributed to cellular death, potentially correlating with the increased FM4-64 signal observed in the midpiece of immotile sperm that have undergone AE. To address this hypothesis, we conducted image-based flow cytometry experiments, which are well-suited for assessing cellular heterogeneity within large populations.</p><p>Regarding the relationship between the increase in FM4-64 and AE, we have always observed that AE is followed by an increase in FM4-64 in the head in mice (PMID: 26819478) as well as in human (PMID: 25100708) sperm. This was originally corroborated with the EGFP sperm. However, not all the cells that undergo AE increase the FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The authors report that a fraction of sperm undergoes AE without a change in FM4-64 fluorescence (Figure 1F). How does the [Ca2+]i change in those cells? Again statistics on the distribution of a certain pattern within a population in addition to showing individual examples would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.9: A recent work shows that an initial increase in [Ca2+]i is required to induce changes in flagellar beating necessary for hyperactivation (Sánchez-Cárdenas et al., 2018). However, when [Ca2+]i increases beyond a certain threshold, flagellar motility ceases. These conclusions are based on single-cell experiments in murine sperm with different concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. The authors reported that complete loss of motility was observed when using ionophore concentrations higher than 1 μM. In contrast, spermatozoa incubated with 0.5 μM A23187 remained motile throughout the experiment. Once the Ca2+ ionophore is removed, the sperm would reduce the concentration of this ion to levels compatible with motility and hyperactivation (Navarrete et al., 2016). However, some of the washed cells did not recover mobility in the recorded time window (Sánchez-Cárdenas et al., 2018). These results would indicate that due to the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by the ionophore, irreversible changes occurred in the sperm flagellum that prevented recovery of mobility, even when the ionophore was not present in the recording medium.</p><p>Taking into account our results, one possible scenario to explain this irreversible change would be the contraction of the midpiece. Our results demonstrate that the increase in [Ca2+]i observed in the midpiece (whether by induction with progesterone, ionomycin or occurring spontaneously) causes the contraction of this section of the flagellum and its subsequent immobilization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) While the authors results show that changes in [Ca2+]i correlate with the observed reduction of the midpiece diameter, they do not provide evidence that the structural changes are triggered by Ca2+i influx. It could just be a coincidence that both events spatially overlap and that they temporarily follow each other. The authors should either provide additional evidence or tone down their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.10: We agree with the reviewer. As suggested, we have toned down our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Are the authors able to detect the changes in the midpiece diameter independent from FM4-64 or other plasma membrane dyes? An alternative explanation could be that the dyes are internalized due to cell death and instead of staining the plasma membrane they are now staining intracellular membranes, resulting in increased fluorescence and giving the illusion that the midpiece diameter decreased. How do the authors explain that the Bodipy-GM1 Signal directly overlaps with DsRed2 and SIR-actin, shouldn't there be some gap? Since the rest of the manuscript is based on that proposed decrease in midpiece diameter the authors should perform orthogonal experiments to confirm their observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.11: As requested by the reviewer, we have not used new methods to visualize the change in sperm diameter in the midpiece. In neither of them, a membrane dye was used. First, we have performed immunofluorescence to detect a membrane protein (GLUT3). Second, we have used scanning electron microscopy. The results are now incorporated in the new Figure 2FG. In both experiments, a change in the midpiece diameter was observed. Please, also visit responses P2.5 and Author response images 8 to 10.</p><p>Regarding the overlap between the signal of Bodipy GM1 (membrane) and the fluorescence of DsRed2 (mitochondria) and Sir-Actin (F-actin), it is only observed in acrosomereacted sperm, not in acrosome-intact sperm (Figure S4). In our view, these structures become closed after midpiece contraction, and the resolution of the images is insufficient to distinguish them clearly. This issue is also evident in Figure 5B. Therefore, we conducted additional experiments using more powerful super-resolution techniques such as STORM (Figures 5D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The proposed gap of 200 nM between the actin helix and the plasma membrane, has been observed by TEM? Considering that the diameter of the mouse sperm midpiece is about 1 um, that is a lot of empty space which leaves only about 600 nm for the rest of the flagellum. The axoneme is 300 nm and there needs to be room for the ODFs and the mitochondria. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.12: Unfortunately, the filament of polymerized actin cannot be observed by TEM. Furthermore, we were discouraged from trying other approaches, such as utilizing phalloidin gold, because for some reason, it does not work properly.</p><p>In our view, the 200 nm gap between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is occupied by the mitochondria (that is the size that it is frequently reported based on TEM; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166869">https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.166869</ext-link>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) The results provided by the authors do not convince this reviewer that the actin helix moves, either closer to the plasma membrane or toward the mitochondria, the observed differences are minor and not confirmed by statistical analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.13: As requested, the title of that section was changed. Moreover, our conclusion is exactly as the reviewer is suggesting: “Since the results of the analysis of SiR-actin slopes were not conclusive, we studied the actin cytoskeleton structure in more detail”. This conclusion is based on the statistical analysis shown in Figure S5D-E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) The fluorescence intensity of all plasma membrane dyes increases in all cells chosen by the authors for further analysis. Could the increase in SiR-Actin fluorescence be explained by a microscopy artifact instead of actin helix remodeling? Alternatively, can the authors exclude that the observed increase in SIR-Actin might be an artifact caused by the increase in FM4-64 fluorescence? Since the brightness in the head similarly increases to the fluorescence in the flagellum the staining pattern looks suspiciously similar. Did the authors perform single-stain controls?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.14: We had similar concerns when we were doing the experiments using SiR-actin. Although we have performed single stain controls to make sure that the actin helix remodelling occurs during the midpiece contraction, we have performed experiments using higher resolution techniques such as STORM using a different probe to stain actin (Phalloidin).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Should actin cytoskeleton remodeling indeed result in a decrease of actin helix diameter, what do the authors propose is the underlying mechanism? Shouldn't that result in changes in mitochondrial structure or location and be visible by TEM? This reviewer is also wondering why the authors focus so much on the actin helix, while the plasma membrane based on the author's results is moving way more dramatically.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.15: This raises an intriguing point. Currently, we lack an understanding of the underlying mechanism driving actin remodeling, and we are eager to conduct further experiments to explore this aspect. For instance, we are investigating the potential role of Cofilin in remodeling the F-actin network. Initial experiments utilizing STORM imaging have revealed the localization of Cofilin in the midpiece region, where the actin helix is situated.</p><p>Regarding mitochondria, thus far, we have not uncovered any evidence suggesting that acrosome reaction or fusion with the egg induces a rearrangement of these organelles within the structure. The rationale for investigating polymerized actin in depth stems from the fact that, alongside the axoneme and other flagellar structures such as the outer dense fibers and fibrous sheet, these are the sole cytoskeletal components present in that particular tail region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) The fact that the authors observe that most sperm passing through the zona pellucida, which requires motility, display high FM4-64 fluorescence, doesn't that contradict the authors' hypothesis that midpiece contraction and motility cessation are connected? Videos confirming sperm motility and information about pattern distribution within the observed sperm population in the perivitelline space should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.14: We believe it is a matter of time, as depicted in Figure 1D, our model shows that first the cells lose the acrosome, present motility and low FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece (pattern II) and after that, they lose motility and increase FM4-64 fluorescence in the midpiece (pattern III). That is why, we think that when sperm pass the zona pellucida they present pattern II and after some time they evolve into pattern III.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) In the experiments summarized in Figure 8, did all sperm stop moving? Considering that 74 % of the observed sperm did not display midpiece contraction upon fusion, again doesn't that contradict the authors' hypothesis that the two events are interdependent? Similarly, in earlier experiments, not all acrosome-reacted sperm display a decrease in midpiece diameter or stop moving, questioning the significance of the event. If some sperm display a decrease in midpiece diameter and some don't, or undergo that change earlier or later, what is the underlying mechanism of regulation? The observed events could similarly be explained by sperm death: Sperm are dying × plasma membrane integrity changes and plasma membrane dyes get internalized × [Ca2+]i simultaneously increases due to cell death × sperm stop moving.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.15: The percentage of sperm that did not exhibit midpiece contraction in Fig.8B is 26%, not 74%, indicating that it does not contradict our hypothesis. However, this still represents a significant portion of sperm that remain unchanged in the midpiece, leaving room for various explanations. For instance, it's possible that: (i) the change in fluorescence was not detected due to the event occurring after the recording concluded, or (ii) in some instances, this alteration simply does not occur. Nevertheless, we did not track subsequent events in the oocyte, such as egg activation, to definitively ascertain the success of fusion. Incorporation of the dye only manifests the initiation of the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) The authors propose changes in Ca2+ as one potential mechanism to regulate midpiece contraction, however, the Ca2+ measurements during fusion are flawed, as the authors write in the discussion, by potential Ca2+ fluorophore dilution. Considering that the authors observe high Ca2+ in all sperm prior to fusion, could that be a measuring artifact? Were acrosome-intact sperm imaged with the same settings to confirm that sperm with low and high Ca2+ can be distinguished? Should [Ca2+]i changes indeed be involved in the regulation of motility cessation during fusion, could the authors speculate on how [Ca2+]i changes can simultaneously be involved in the regulation of sperm hyperactivation?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.16: We agree with the reviewer that our experiments using calcium probes are not conclusive for many technical problems. We have toned down our conclusions in the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) 74: AE takes place for most cells in the upper segment of the oviduct, not all of them.</p><p>Please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.17: Corrected in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) 88: Achieved through, or achieved by, please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.18: Corrected in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) 243: Acrosomal exocytosis initiation by progesterone, please specify.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3.19: Modified in the new version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) 277: &quot;The actin cytoskeleton approaches the plasma membrane during the contraction of the midpiece&quot; is misleading.
