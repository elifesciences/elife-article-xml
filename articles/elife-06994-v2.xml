(Tfh) cells. Here we define conditions specifically enhancing Tfh differentiation and providing protection in a model of influenza infection. Tfh responses were associated with prolonged antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DCs), which maintained T cell/DC interactions into stage 3 (&gt;72 hr) of activation. Blocking stage 3 interactions ablated Tfh generation, demonstrating a causal link between T cell-DC behaviour and functional outcomes. The current data therefore explain how duration of antigen presentation affects the dynamics of T cell-DC interactions and consequently determine Tfh cell differentiation in the developing immune response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06994.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06994.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06994.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects the body from infections, cancer and other diseases. Invading microbes and cancerous cells exhibit proteins that are not normally found in the healthy cells of the body. Fragments of these molecules—known as antigens—may be detected by the immune system, which can then respond by producing antibodies and other responses that try to destroy the threat.</p><p>Antibodies are produced by one type of immune cell (known as B cells) with the help of other cells called follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. During an immune response, Tfh cells form from ‘naïve’ T cells that have not encountered an antigen before. This process has several stages and is activated when the naïve T cells interact with antigens that are displayed on the surface of dendritic cells and other immune cells. However, it is not clear exactly how this process works.</p><p>Here, Benson et al. studied the formation of Tfh cells in mice in response to antigens of different sizes. The experiments show that the dendritic cells displayed larger antigens for longer periods of time than they displayed the smaller antigens. Both the small and large antigens allowed dendritic cells to interact with T cells. However, only the dendritic cells that displayed the larger antigens maintained the interaction with T cells for longer periods of time (into the last stage of Tfh cell formation). This enhanced the production of Tfh cells, which boosted the production of antibodies against the antigens to generate immunity to infection.</p><p>Further experiments found that blocking the interaction between dendritic cells and T cells during the final stage of Tfh cell formation reduced the production of Tfh cells. Benson et al.'s findings show that the length of time that dendritic cells present antigens on their surface affects the production of Tfh cells and subsequent immune responses. Since Tfh cells are critical to the formation of long-lasting immunity against a virus, these findings could aid efforts to develop more effective vaccines against influenza and other diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06994.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06994.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>T follicular helper</kwd><kwd>multiphoton</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>influenza vaccine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT085589MA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garside</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Brewer</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100034/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacLeod</surname><given-names>Megan KL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Temporal availability of antigen presentation by dendritic cells influences the differentiation of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells, which enhances germinal centre responses and induces protective immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Following stimulation via the TcR, selective differentiation of T helper cell subsets is dependent on transcription factors, with Bcl-6 being responsible for T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2011</xref>) and antagonism of other T cell phenotypes (Th1, Th2, Th17). Gene knockout studies in mice have revealed the requirement for CD28 mediated-costimulation in the upstream control of Tfh differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Linterman et al., 2009</xref>), with subsequent signalling through inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) involved in consolidation of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanisms controlling the induction of this differentiation program are less clear, a role for the cytokines IL-6 and IL-21 and subsequent signalling via STAT3 have been implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nurieva et al., 2008</xref>), while other studies indicate that the strength and duration of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal itself is the major factor determining effector cell differentiation to Tfh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11a">Fazilleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>). Using well defined and controlled conditions that preferentially induce Tfh responses in vivo, we have therefore adopted a reductionist approach to determine which of these factors are important in the differentiation of this subset in vivo.</p><p>A variety of particle formulations, including alum, emulsions and liposomes have received sustained interest as vaccine adjuvants for over 80 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brewer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Temmerman et al., 2011</xref>). Their ability to affect the availability of antigen and antigen presentation has frequently been linked to their impact on the development of T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constant and Bottomly, 1997</xref>), but causal evidence has been absent. More recently, studies have suggested that the use of nanoparticles as adjuvants can selectively induce Tfh responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moon et al., 2012</xref>). Clearly selective differentiation of Tfh effector cells has implications in vaccine design and pathogen control as for the majority of vaccines the principal effector mechanism induced is production of high affinity, class switched antibodies by B lymphocytes. Here we employ defined antigen particles to selectively induce Tfh cells and antibody responses and show that increased duration of antigen presentation and subsequent T cell/dendritic cell (DC) interactions are associated with Tfh induction. The functional significance of these late stage (72 hr) interactions in T cell differentiation was demonstrated by blockade of T/DC interactions in vivo. These studies demonstrate that by manipulating the form of antigen delivered late stage antigen presentation by DC and their interaction with T cells can be controlled to drive Tfh differentiation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Antigen size impacts on protective humoral immunity</title><p>In the present study, we employed polystyrene nanoparticles due to their inert nature, defined size, narrow polydispersity, and surface functionalisation allowing covalent linkage of antigen to their surface. Polystyrene nanoparticles do not induce ERK activity or subsequent activation of conventional inflammatory pathways in DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karlson Tde et al., 2013</xref>). Our study focused on polystyrene nanoparticle sizes able to drain freely to the LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manolova et al., 2008</xref>). Carbodiimide-mediated coupling of antigens was highly controlled, such that only particle size and physically dependent parameters (surface area, antigen molecules per particle) varied between immunisation conditions; all other conditions, antigen dose, mass of particles, and antigen density were consistent between 40 nm and 200 nm particle immunisations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Consequently, immunisations with equivalent quantities of protein were not associated with any confounding difference in total antigenic mass and a single variable, particle size could be tested for its impact on antigen specific immune responses. Initial experiments investigating the effect of particle size on antibody responses revealed that immunisation of mice with Ag covalently linked to 200 nm particles induced significantly higher amounts of specific IgG1 and IgG2c than smaller particles or soluble Ag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). 1000 nm particles failed to induce an antibody response, potentially due to a failure in uptake by APCs and/or ability to drain to the LN. Subsequent studies thus focussed on the significance and processes by which the 200 nm particles were able to support this antibody response, in comparison to smaller particles (40 nm) and soluble antigen that did not.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06994.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Comparison of particle conjugates</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06994.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06994.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Particle size</th><th>40 nm</th><th>200 nm</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antigen dose/mouse</td><td>100 μg</td><td>100 μg</td></tr><tr><td>Antigen molecules/mouse</td><td>1.3 × 10<sup>15</sup></td><td>1.3 × 10<sup>15</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Latex dose/mouse</td><td>100 μg</td><td>130 μg</td></tr><tr><td>Number of particles/mouse</td><td>1.4 × 10<sup>12</sup></td><td>2.9 × 10<sup>10</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Antigen molecules/particle</td><td>1000</td><td>20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Surface area/particle</td><td>5024 nm<sup>2</sup></td><td>125,600 nm<sup>2</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Antigen density</td><td>1 per 5 nm<sup>2</sup></td><td>1 per 6 nm<sup>2</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data shows an example of a typical carbodiimide-mediated conjugation of ovalbumin to either 40 or 200 nm.

Protection from infection was determined by weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Antigen specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and B cells were co-transferred into congenic recipients then immunised with 130 μg of ovalbumin (OVA)-hen egg lysozyme (HEL) conjugate alone, in CFA or bound to 40 nm or 200 nm particles. Analysis of serum samples collected 10 days post immunisation revealed OVA-HEL conjugated to 200 nm particles induced significant levels of serum anti-HEL-IgM<sup>a</sup>, whereas antigen conjugated to 40 nm particles did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, antigen conjugated to 200 nm particles induced greater expansion of antigen-specific IgM<sup>a+</sup> MD4 B cells than challenge with 40 nm particles 7 days post immunisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Enhanced expression of germinal centre (GC) markers (GL7 and FAS) following immunisation with 200 nm OVA-HEL particles compared with 40 nm OVA-HEL particles was also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

However, immunisation with OVA-HEL conjugated to either 40 nm or 200 nm particles could equally increase the proportion and number of antigen specific OT-II T cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gengoux and Leclerc, 1995</xref>). This implied that particle size induced a qualitative rather than quantitative difference in T cell response, favouring generation of the Tfh subset of T cells that have been defined as supporting B cell responses and GC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of Tfh markers CXCR5, PD-1, ICOS and SLAM by adoptively transferred OT-II T cells demonstrated the percentage and number of antigen specific cells differentiating into Tfh cells was very low at day 5 post immunisation with soluble antigen or antigen conjugated to 40 nm particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>). However, a significant proportion of OT-II T cells were CXCR5<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> following challenge with OVA-HEL conjugated to 200 nm particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).

Notably, interactions longer than 10 min were seen following 200 nm particle challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), implying that antigen driven cognate recognition was still occurring. This was further supported by the reduced T cell velocity observed in the 200 nm particle group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and again in a lower T cell displacement rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Significantly, the causal link between T cell behaviour and function was subsequently revealed through disrupting TcR/pMHCII interactions with a monoclonal antibody (Y3P), which resulted in of loss long-term T/DC contacts, a return to rapid T cell motility, and a loss of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Celli et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesised that the long-term T/DC interactions we observed at 72 hr post immunisation with 200 nm particles were responsible for selective Tfh differentiation.

Our multiphoton studies further confirmed that T cells were continuing to interact with DCs at this time. However, interactions with antigen presenting B cells could not be ruled out as a contributing factor, especially given their critical role in affirming and maintaining the Tfh phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>).

The functional relevance of longer DC-T cell interactions, associated with antigen conjugated to 200 nm particles, was dissected by specifically blocking later interactions, resulting in reduced Tfh induction, while the overall magnitude of the T cell response was unaffected. Thus, the temporal characteristics of T cell stimulation can determine their functional differentiation towards a Tfh phenotype, and this can be determined by the size of the particle upon which an antigen is delivered.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the impact of particle size on the immune response to antigen using a variety of formulations, for example lipid vesicles entrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moon et al., 2012</xref>) antigens or antigens non-specifically adsorbed to the surface of inert particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mottram et al., 2007</xref>). The inert nature, defined size and surface functionalisation of particles employed in the present study, allowed a single variable, size, to be tested for its impact on antigen immunogenicity. Initial studies simply altering particle size revealed 200 nm particles could induce antibody production following a single immunisation. The functional importance of this observation was startlingly clear, with 200 nm particles able to impart protective anti-HA humoral immunity to influenza infection. Starting with a functional outcome relevant to vaccine design, we sought to dissect the processes by which increasing particle size impacts on the humoral response.</p><p>GC formation is central to development of high affinity antibody. GC structures support somatic hypermutation, selection of high affinity B cells and their differentiation into plasma and memory cells (for a comprehensive review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012</xref>). Immunisation with 200 nm particles enhanced this process, explaining our initial observation of increased antibody responses. Essential in this process is the cognate interaction between Ag-specific B and T cells. The nature of this interaction has been the focus of intense research in recent years, culminating in the identification of Tfh cells and the molecules (surface and soluble) involved in their differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). While both sizes of particle could equally increase antigen specific T cell responses in vivo, we found that larger particles (200 nm) induced greater Tfh differentiation than small (40 nm) particles, consistent with their role in supporting GC responses. Even though the endogenous molecular cues governing the development of Tfh cells are multifactorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2012</xref>), understanding how external stimuli can influence T cell differentiation towards this phenotype is less well understood, yet has clear implications in vaccine design. In this case we have demonstrated that simply changing the size of the Ag can clearly impact on Tfh differentiation.</p><p>A key event in the initiation of any CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response is the recognition of peptide/MHC class II complexes on DCs. The kinetics of presentation are known to influence the consequent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferative, effector and memory responses induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Obst et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Celli et al., 2007</xref>). By covalently linking a trackable antigen to the particles we were able to map temporally in vivo peptide/MHC class II presentation and its relation to particle size. Although 200 nm particle immunisation prolonged the duration of peptide/MHC class II presentation by DCs, significantly this did not impact upon the magnitude of the T cell response compared with the smaller 40 nm particle, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gengoux and Leclerc, 1995</xref>). However, prolonged presentation was associated with the enhanced differentiation of Tfh cells. Antigen availability can dictate the magnitude of a Tfh response, with sustained presentation by B cells maintaining the Tfh phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, immunisation with 200 nm particles resulted in sustained antigen presentation by DCs with cognate interactions with B cells being dispensable for maintenance of a Tfh phenotype. Indeed, sustained antigen presentation associated with Tfh induction has been reported in the absence of cognate interactions with B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>). In the latter study, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells deficient for SAP, and therefore limited in their ability to interact with B cells, still adopted a Tfh phenotype when a second dose of soluble antigen was given 72 hr later. Presentation at this second challenge was attributed to DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>), consistent with our own findings. Indeed, DCs can induce Tfh development in the absence of cognate interactions with B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2011</xref>) and likely represent the first step initiating Tfh differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goenka et al., 2011</xref>). Imaging draining LNs 72 hr post challenge revealed that cognate T cell/DC interactions continued at this time. Importantly the current study adds mechanistic detail to the observational data above; temporal disruption of 72 hr (stage 3) interactions, while not affecting clonal expansion, did inhibit 200 nm particle induced Tfh differentiation. Thus, increasing particle size, and sustaining presentation by DCs and their cognate interactions with T cells underpins the success of the larger particle in driving Tfh differentiation. It is unclear as to how particle size influences temporal availability of pMHCII on DCs. Particulates can impact on the mechanism of antigen uptake and therefore consequent endosomal targeting, processing and dynamics of presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Temmerman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghimire et al., 2012</xref>). Thus the processing of antigen and loading of MHCII and/or its turnover at the cell surface may be contributing factors. In either case, increasing availability of TcR ligand and consequent TcR signal quantity may function in a similar way as increasing TcR dwell time in determining Tfh differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tubo and Jenkins, 2014</xref>).</p><p>New delivery systems are required to generate safe and effective vaccines. This has resulted in increased focus on particle delivery systems.

We have linked T cell behaviour to function, demonstrating the importance of stage 3 T/DC interactions in determining the selective differentiation of T cells towards a Tfh lineage. These late stage interactions could be selectively induced using immunisation with antigen conjugated to 200 nm but not 40 nm particles, rationalising approaches to vaccine design using nanoparticles for induction of Tfh, GC formation and high affinity, class switched protective antibody. Previous studies have demonstrated that in the absence of microbial factors, parameters such as the dose and persistence of antigen can affect T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Constant and Bottomly, 1997</xref>). The current data therefore explain why parameters such as the magnitude and duration of antigen presentation affect subsequent T/DC interactions and consequently determine T cell differentiation in the developing immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>hCD2-DsRed mice (gifted by D Kioussis and A Patel, National Institute for Medical Research, London) were crossed with OVA specific OT-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnden et al., 1998</xref>) TCR Tg mice.

In T cell/DC interaction studies, LNs were imaged 2 hr after antibody treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Single cell suspensions were stained using combinations of anti-CD11c-PE (N418, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), anti-B220-PerCP (RA3-6B2, BD Biosciences), anti-I-A<sup>b</sup>/Ea<sub>52-68</sub>-biotin (YAe, eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD4-eFluor450 (RM4-5, eBioscience), anti-ICOS-alexa-fluor-488 (C398.4A, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-PD-1-PE-Cy7 (J43, eBiosciences), anti-SLAM-APC (TC15-12F12.2, BioLegend), biotinylated anti-CXCR5 (2G8, BD Biosciences), anti-B220-eFluor450 (RA3-6B2, eBioscience), anti-GL-7-FITC (BD Biosciences), anti-FAS-PE (BD Biosciences) and biotinylated anti-IgM<sup>a</sup> (DM-1, BD Biosciences). Biotinylated antibodies were detected by incubation with fluorochrome-conjugated streptavidin (BD Biosciences). Appropriate isotype controls were used throughout. Samples were acquired using a MACSQuant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec, Surrey, UK) and analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Multiphoton imaging</title><p>Multiphoton imaging was carried out using a Zeiss LSM7 MP system equipped with a 20×/1.0 NA water-immersion objective lens (Zeiss UK, Cambridge, UK) and a tunable Titanium: sapphire solid-state two-photon excitation source (Chameleon Ultra II; Coherent Laser Group, Glasgow, UK) and optical parametric oscillator (OPO; Coherent Laser Group). Excised LNs were continuously bathed in warmed (37°C), oxygenated CO<sub>2</sub> independent medium. A laser output of 820 nm and OPO signal at 1060 nm provided excitation of YFP CD11c<sup>+</sup> and DsRed OT-II cells. Videos were acquired for 20 to 30 min with an X-Y pixel resolution of 512 × 512 in 2 μm Z increments. 3D tracking was performed using Volocity 6.1.1 (Perkin Elmer, Cambridge, UK). Values representing the mean velocity, displacement, and meandering index were calculated for each object. The intersection of DsRed and YFP objects was used to determine interaction between T cells and DCs respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Gaussian distribution was confirmed by D'Agostino &amp; Pearson omnibus normality test prior to significance being determined by one-way ANOVA. Significance in DC-T cell interaction experiments was confirmed by Mann Whitney. Values of p &lt; 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Grant Number WT085589MA).

Your full submission has been evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Based on discussions amongst the reviewers and the individual comments below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In particular, the reviewers expressed their concern that the paper is short of conceptual novelty and the role of B cells as antigen-presenting cells is not addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>T-follicular helper cells have been found to have a critical role in the formation and maintenance of germinal centers and the production of high affinity antibodies. As such, the issue of how best to induce these cells is of considerable importance to vaccine design. In this report, Benson et al. examine the use of polystyrene nanoparticle of different sizes as adjuvants. They find that larger particles lead to formation of more stable peptide MHC complexes on DCs leading to prolonged antigen presentation and longer DC/T-cell contact durations which leads to the enhanced formation of Tfh cells. Consequently antibody production, GC formation and protection from influenza virus infection are all enhanced.</p><p>1) This is an interesting study but it almost entirely omits consideration of the critical role of B-cells as APCs in Tfh induction. Previously it has been demonstrated that Tfh form following a two-step process by which T-cells initially interact with DCs which leads to an early wave of pre-Tfh production before a second step of interaction with antigen presenting B-cells that cements the Tfh program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crotty, 2011</xref>). It is surprising that the authors have only focused on the first of these two steps and not examined if there is also any effect on B-cell antigen presentation as this would widen and strengthen the article’s conclusions. An effect on B-cells would not be mutually exclusive to the effects on DCs and it seems possible that both would play a role in the increased Tfh formation seen here. The authors correctly state that the Tangye group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deenick et al., 2010</xref>) have demonstrated that it is possible to bypass the requirement for B-cells by adding more antigen and prolonging DC antigen presentation, but even here it remains controversial if DCs alone can induce PD1hi GC-Tfh and high levels of IL-21 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goenka et al., 2011</xref>) and where both DCs and B-cells are present B-cells are believed to have a dominant role in Tfh formation from day 3 onwards even in the presence of large amounts of antigen (LCMV infection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>This is important as the authors make clear statements ascribing all the phenomenon to the increased antigen contact in DCs without exploring this alternative possibility. This is particularly acute in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> where MHCII blocking antibodies are used to interfere with the late stage DC/T-cell contacts. At 72 hours we would also expect B-cell antigen presentation to have an important/dominant role as APCs which would also be blocked by the same antibody, currently it is not possible to say if the effects of the antibody is only by blocking DCs or both DCs and B-cells. It is also worth noting that essentially this point would be testable using the same experimental methods already used i.e. YAe antibody to see if B-cells had altered antigen presentation. Additionally some experiments using vaccination in B-cell deficient mice ideally (μMT, T-cell transfer into RAG-/- or B-cell depletion by anti-CD20) are required to make strong conclusions about the specific role of DCs in the absence of B-cells.</p><p>2) A wider range of sizes (e.g. 40, 100, 150, 200nm) would have been useful to more precisely investigate the relationship between particulate size, DC antigen presentation and effectiveness. For example, Mottram et al. used a range of 7 bead sizes and found a bimodal distribution of effectiveness for cytokine induction suggesting that the relationship between size and efficacy may be not always be entirely linear, it would be impossible to make any similar observation in this study since only two sizes are used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Benson et al. use polystyrene nanoparticles coated with various antigens to assess the impact that size has on vaccine responses. They show that coupling the same amount of protein antigen to larger particles increases antibody production, in a similar way to using an adjuvant. This increased influenza vaccine efficacy. They demonstrate that antigen presentation By DCs is prolonged when larger particles are administered, and DCs engage T cells in longer interactions. Finally they demonstrate that blocking antigen presentation at 72hrs post immunisation decreases the proportion of Tfh cells formed. Although it is not clear how the larger particles mediate this effect. Together, this is a nice paper showing that particle size can alter vaccine efficacy, something with direct relevance to human and animal health.</p><p>There are a few issues with the manuscript in its current form that should be addressed:</p><p>1) In 2011 in JI, Baumjohann et al. described that B cells are dispensable for initial Tfh differentiation (48hrs post vaccination) but played an important role 3.5 days after vaccination for stabilising the Tfh population. There is no discussion in this paper of whether these particles may be acting via Ag-presentation by B cells. Indeed, the evidence for changing the interaction time of T cells and DCs is clear, but the inference that the increased population of Tfh cells observed with large particles is due to these T:DC rather than T:B interactions at 72hrs post immunisation has not been demonstrated. The blocking experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> would disrupt all antigen presentation, not just that from DCs. A way to determine this experimentally would be to immunise B cell deficient mice (or mice whose B cells don't present cognate antigen) with the different sized particles and see if the expansion of the Tfh population still occurs.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> it is clear that the % of DCs presenting antigen is the same for the first 48hrs. Is the amount (or MFI) of antigen presentation similar between particle sizes, particularly at earlier time points?</p><p>Benson et al. argue that 200 nm particles prolong the duration of peptide/MHCII presentation on DCs. Does this mean that each individual MHCII molecule is maintained at the cell surface for longer? Or that larger particles deliver processed peptide at a slower rate, perhaps via an alternative route, so that MHCII can be loaded in the ER for longer? Or is it both? Do the authors know how the antigen is processed by the DC when conjugated to 40 nm or 200 nm nanoparticles? Are they processed by different compartments? The stage 3 disruption experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> define stage 3 simply by time after immunisation; so a slowly loaded MHCII could confound this approach. It would be worth discussing these potential confounders of the interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors analyze the relative capacity of particulate antigens to optimize antibody response by inducing dendritic cell-mediated Tfh cell development. They found that:</p><p>1) Ag conjugated 200 nm particles induced more enhanced antibody responses than 40 nm particles or soluble antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These data are redundant with previous literature showing that nanoparticles allow for the reduction of the administered antigen amount compared to immunization with soluble protein and induce strongly enhanced antibody responses (Virology Journal 2013, 10:108).</p><p>2) Ag conjugated 200 nm particles induced prolonged presentation of antigen by dendritic cells compared with 40 nm particles or soluble antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These data are redundant with previous literature showing that particulate form of antigens are more efficiently processed and presented by different APC, including dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, than soluble antigen (Journal of Immunology, 1996, 156:2809; Immunology and Cell Biology, 2004 82:506).</p><p>3) Prolonged antigen presentation by dendritic cells drove Tfh cell development.

We appreciate the time and effort taken in reviewing it. Understandably, we are disappointed in the decision made by the panel, however we would welcome an opportunity to address the comments made by the referees in a revised manuscript. The two key issues raised by the referees were the lack of novelty and the role of B cell antigen presentation.</p><p>Firstly, with regard to the issue of novelty raised by Reviewer 3. While, our use of physically highly characterised particles is not novel, it is controllable, relevant to vaccination and avoids the usual empirical adjuvant approaches widely used in the literature. Our combination of manipulation of T cell/Dendritic cell interactions and the impact on resulting immune response with the analysis of this directly in vivo using real-time imaging is entirely novel. The references quoted by Reviewer 3 are purely descriptive, only demonstrating that particulate antigens are better than soluble at driving an antibody response, an approach that has been used in the vaccine field for some considerable time with no clear mechanism of action. The further work cited does not attempt to delineate the cellular mechanisms underlying how particulate antigens drive Tfh generation and hence antibody production – the novel component of our study. Thus, our manuscript is the first causal in vivo demonstration of how T cell/dendritic cell interactions can be modulated to determine T cell phenotype in a way directly relevant to human and animal health (as stated by Reviewer 2).</p><p>With regard to the second point, we already have data requested by Reviewer 2 relating to antigen presentation by B cells. These results show no difference in presentation following immunisation with different particles, which is why we focused the current manuscript on DC. However, if you feel it would strengthen the manuscript, we could include the MD4 studies suggested by the referees, though we believe this would be negative data.</p><p>We are currently in a situation where we still lack a mechanistic basis for the function of vaccine adjuvants in vivo despite their constant use in vaccination for over 90 years. Particles form an important part of these vaccine formulations, and we believe that the current manuscript is unique in explaining their in vivo mechanism of action.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) This is an interesting study but it almost entirely omits consideration of the critical role of B-cells as APCs in Tfh induction. Previously it has been demonstrated that Tfh form following a two-step process by which T-cells initially interact with DCs which leads to an early wave of pre-Tfh production before a second step of interaction with antigen presenting B-cells that cements the Tfh program (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>Crotty, 2011</italic></xref><italic>). It is surprising that the authors have only focused on the first of these two steps and not examined if there is also any effect on B-cell antigen presentation as this would widen and strengthen the article’s conclusions. An effect on B-cells would not be mutually exclusive to the effects on DCs and it seems possible that both would play a role in the increased Tfh formation seen here. The authors correctly state that the Tangye group (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><italic>Deenick et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>) have demonstrated that it is possible to bypass the requirement for B-cells by adding more antigen and prolonging DC antigen presentation, but even here it remains controversial if DCs alone can induce PD1hi GC-Tfh and high levels of IL-21 expression (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16"><italic>Goenka et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>) and where both DCs and B-cells are present B-cells are believed to have a dominant role in Tfh formation from day 3 onwards even in the presence of large amounts of antigen (LCMV infection) (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><italic>Choi et al., 2011</italic></xref><italic>).</italic></p><p><italic>This is important as the authors make clear statements ascribing all the phenomenon to the increased antigen contact in DCs without exploring this alternative possibility. This is particularly acute in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>where MHCII blocking antibodies are used to interfere with the late stage DC/T-cell contacts. At 72 hours we would also expect B-cell antigen presentation to have an important/dominant role as APCs which would also be blocked by the same antibody, currently it is not possible to say if the effects of the antibody is only by blocking DCs or both DCs and B-cells. It is also worth noting that essentially this point would be testable using the same experimental methods already used i.e. YAe antibody to see if B-cells had altered antigen presentation. Additionally some experiments using vaccination in B-cell deficient mice ideally (μMT, T-cell transfer into RAG-/- or B-cell depletion by anti-CD20) are required to make strong conclusions about the specific role of DCs in the absence of B-cells.</italic></p><p>As the reviewer correctly states, antigen presentation by B cells could be examined using the methods we had employed for the DCs. We had previously generated these data but had found no significant differences in B cell antigen presentation at later times, hence we focused our interest on DCs. We have now included this pMHCII data using the YAe system tracking presentation by B cells following immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Also, as noted in the response to Reviewers 2 and 3 below, we have performed the suggested experiments in BcR Tg animals which we feel suffer less drawbacks than the B cell deficient strains suggested. These studies revealed that 200 nm particles were still able to induce a larger population of CXCR5<sup>+</sup>PD-1<sup>+</sup> cells 5 days post immunization in the absence of cognate interactions with antigen specific B cells, consistent with our other data implicating a role for presentation by DCs.</p><p><italic>2) A wider range of sizes (e.g. 40, 100, 150, 200nm) would have been useful to more precisely investigate the relationship between particulate size, DC antigen presentation and effectiveness. For example Mottram et al. used a range of 7 bead sizes and found a bimodal distribution of effectiveness for cytokine induction suggesting that the relationship between size and efficacy may be not always be entirely linear, it would be impossible to make any similar observation in this study since only two sizes are used.</italic></p><p>We now include data demonstrating the impact of wider range of particle sizes (20, 40, 100, 200 and 1000nm). Induction of antigen specific IgG2c and IgG1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) In 2011 in JI Baumjohann et al. described that B cells are dispensable for initial Tfh differentiation (48hrs post vaccination) but played an important role 3.5 days after vaccination for stabilising the Tfh population. There is no discussion in this paper of whether these particles may be acting via Ag-presentation by B cells. Indeed, the evidence for changing the interaction time of T cells and DCs is clear, but the inference that the increased population of Tfh cells observed with large particles is due to these T:DC rather than T:B interactions at 72hrs post immunisation has not been demonstrated. The blocking experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>would disrupt all antigen presentation, not just that from DCs. A way to determine this experimentally would be to immunise B cell deficient mice (or mice whose B cells don't present cognate antigen) with the different sized particles and see if the expansion of the Tfh population still occurs.</italic></p><p>Our rationale for focusing on DCs at this time point rather than B cells had been due to pMHCII data demonstrating that not only was it prolonged in DCs but that there was no significant difference detected on B cells at this time. Unfortunately, we had not included these data in our original submission, but they are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We agree that this alone does not directly address the contribution of cognate B cell interactions to the effect of 200 nm particles on Tfh differention. As such, we have performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer and compared 200 nm particle induction of Tfh cells in C57BL/6 and MD4 BcR transgenic mice (i.e. in the absence of cognate B cell interactions), and these studies show these cognate interactions were not required. We have now included these data along with reference to the Baumjohann et al. JI paper.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>it is clear that the % of DCs presenting antigen is the same for the first 48hrs. Is the amount (or MFI) of antigen presentation similar between particle sizes, particularly at earlier time points?</italic></p><p><italic>Benson et al. argue that 200 nm particles prolong the duration of peptide/MHCII presentation on DCs. Does this mean that each individual MHCII molecule is maintained at the cell surface for longer? Or that larger particles deliver processed peptide at a slower rate, perhaps via an alternative route, so that MHCII can be loaded in the ER for longer? Or is it both? Do the authors know how the antigen is processed by the DC when conjugated to 40 nm or 200 nm nanoparticles? Are they processed by different compartments? The stage 3 disruption experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>define stage 3 simply by time after immunisation; so a slowly loaded MHCII could confound this approach. It would be worth discussing these potential confounders of the interpretation.</italic></p><p>Similar levels of DCs pEaMHCII presentation (by MFI) are seen across the bead sizes during the first 48hrs. The levels detected are comparable with those seen on DCs in the 200 nm particle group at 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). A trend for lower numbers of DCs presenting pEaMHCII in the first 12 hours following immunisation with 200 nm particles was seen, however this was never statistically significant. We agree with the reviewer that the fine detail of why pMHCII is available for longer in the DC compartment is an interesting point of discussion and likely represents a combination of the processes mentioned. We have now included these points in the Discussion and referenced our recent paper investigating these issues for alum adjuvants.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors analyze the relative capacity of particulate antigens to optimize antibody response by inducing dendritic cell-mediated Tfh cell development. They found that:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Ag conjugated 200 nm particles induced more enhanced antibody responses than 40 nm particles or soluble antigen (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>).

(JI, 1996) extensively and elegantly demonstrated different capacities for in vitro stimulation of T cell hybridomas by B cell lines and ex-vivo bone marrow differentiated macrophages in response to particle size, the complexity of antigen presentation in vivo setting is not addressed. Thus, by directly immunizing mice with a trackable antigen, we have demonstrated when the processed antigen is presented in vivo and which physiological cell population is doing this. Hence we feel these data are not redundant but is of value to our manuscript and to the field. Additionally, the particulates used throughout our study only differ in size lacking traditional ‘immunostimulatory’ adjuvant properties that would confound analysis of processing, presentation and costimulation (Gamvrellis et al., Immunol Cell Biol, 2004). Thus our data allow direct comparison of in vivo availability of pMHCII in vivo when the only variable is antigen size.</p><p><italic>3) Prolonged antigen presentation by dendritic cells drove Tfh cell development. These data are redundant with previous literature showing that dendritic cells support prolonged Tfh cell responses when they are forced to sustained antigen stimulation (Journal of immunology, 2011, 187:1091; Immunity, 2010, 33:241).</italic></p><p>The aim of the manuscript was not to decipher key biological events in the induction of Tfh cell differentiation. Rather the aim was to delineate the underlying process by which a single variable of an antigen delivery system (i.e. size) stimulates an adaptive immune response. Thus we believe the novelty lies in the linking of particle size to in vivo presentation kinetics/dynamics, the activation and differentiation of CD4 T cells and induction of protective antibody responses.</p><p><italic>Although the authors provide a comprehensive examination of the in vivo T/dendritic cell interactions following in vivo administration of particulate forms of antigens, the lack of conceptual novelty tampers down the enthusiasm for this manuscript.
