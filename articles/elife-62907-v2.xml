All bacterial species encode a single, highly conserved σ factor that drives the expression of house-keeping genes essential for vegetative growth and cell homeostasis. In addition, many bacteria encode a variable set of alternative σ factors that control specific regulons, providing appropriate properties to the cells in response to various stimuli. These alternative σ factors play pivotal roles in the multifaceted lifestyles of bacteria. They trigger specific developmental programs, such as sporulation or biofilm formation, as well as adapted responses to multiple types of stress and virulence in some pathogenic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kazmierczak et al., 2005</xref>). How these alternative σ factors are activated in the cell has been extensively studied, revealing multiple mechanisms underlying their finely tuned regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Österberg et al., 2011</xref>). However, how these mechanisms are orchestrated spatiotemporally within the cell remains poorly understood.</p><p>The human pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (the pneumococcus) possesses a unique alternative σ factor σ<sup>X</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Morrison, 1999</xref>). It is key to the regulatory circuit controlling the transient differentiation state of competence. Pneumococcal competence is induced in response to multiple types of stresses, such as antibiotic exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prudhomme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slager et al., 2014</xref>). This induction modifies the transcriptional expression of up to 17% of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aprianto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dagkessamanskaia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Slager et al., 2019</xref>). Competence is a key feature in the lifestyle of pneumococci as it promotes natural transformation, a horizontal gene transfer process widespread in bacteria that facilitates adaptation by acquisition of new genetic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, pneumococcal competence development provides the cells with the ability to attack non-competent cells, a scavenging property defined as fratricide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Claverys and Håvarstein, 2007</xref>), is involved in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vidal et al., 2013</xref>) and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin and Lau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Pneumococcal competence induction is primarily regulated by a positive feedback loop involving the genes encoded by the <italic>comAB</italic> and <italic>comCDE</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>comC</italic> gene codes for a peptide pheromone coordinating competence development within the growing cell population. This peptide, accordingly named CSP (Competence Stimulating Peptide), is secreted by the dedicated ComAB transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hui et al., 1995</xref>). After export, it promotes autophosphorylation of the membrane-bound two-component system histidine kinase ComD, which in turn phosphorylates its cognate intracellular response regulator ComE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Phosphorylated ComE (ComE~P) specifically induces the expression of 25 genes, which include the <italic>comAB</italic> and <italic>comCDE</italic> operons, generating a positive feedback loop that controls competence development. Conversely, unphosphorylated ComE acts as repressor of its own regulon, the expression of which is thus modulated by the ComE/ComE~P ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). The ComE regulon includes two identical genes encoding σ<sup>X</sup>, named <italic>comX1</italic> and <italic>comX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Morrison, 1999</xref>). The σ<sup>X</sup> regulon comprises ~60 genes, with ~20 involved in natural transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claverys et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>), five in fratricide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Claverys and Håvarstein, 2007</xref>) but the majority having undefined roles. The reason why the σ<sup>X</sup>-encoding gene is duplicated is unknown, the inactivation of one of them having no impact on transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Morrison, 1999</xref>). To fully activate transcription, σ<sup>X</sup> needs to be assisted by ComW, another protein whose production is controlled by ComE~P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luo et al., 2004</xref>). ComW is proposed to help σ<sup>X</sup> association with the RNA polymerase at promoter sequences presenting the consensual 8 bp <italic>cin</italic> box motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sung and Morrison, 2005</xref>). Altogether, ComE~P and σ<sup>X</sup> trigger two successive waves of competence (<italic>com</italic>) gene transcription, commonly referred to as early and late, respectively. Importantly, competence shut-off is mediated by the late <italic>com</italic> protein DprA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weng et al., 2013</xref>), which directly interacts with ComE~P to turn-off ComE~P-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to defining the negative feedback loop of the pneumococcal competence regulatory circuit, DprA also plays a crucial, conserved role in transformation by mediating RecA polymerization onto transforming ssDNA to facilitate homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mortier-Barrière et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quevillon-Cheruel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Over 8000 molecules of DprA are produced per competent cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>). Although only ~300–600 molecules are required for optimal transformation, full expression of <italic>dprA</italic> is required for optimal competence shut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>). Uncontrolled competence induction in cells lacking DprA results in a large in vitro growth defect, and high cellular levels of DprA thus maintain the fitness of the competent population and of resulting transformants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, inactivation of <italic>dprA</italic> was shown to be highly detrimental for development of pneumococcal infection, dependent on the ability of cells to develop competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin and Lau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these studies showed that the DprA-mediated shut-off of pneumococcal competence is key for pneumococcal cell fitness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DprA: Localization and roles in competence and transformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (1) Pre-CSP is exported and matured by the ComAB transporter, and then promotes phosphorylation of the histidine kinase ComD.

How this regulation is coordinated within the cell remains unknown. Here, we studied the choreography of pneumococcal competence induction and shut-off at the single cell level by tracking the spatiotemporal localization of the main effectors of these processes, DprA, σ<sup>X</sup>, ComW, ComD, ComE and exogenous CSP. Remarkably, DprA, σ<sup>X</sup>, ComD, CSP and to some extent ComE were found to colocalize at a single-cell pole during competence. This study revealed that the entire pneumococcal competence cycle occurs at cell pole, from its induction triggered by ComD, ComE, and CSP to its shut-off mediated by DprA and assisted by σ<sup>X</sup>. In this regulatory mechanism, σ<sup>X</sup> is found to exert an unprecedented role for a σ factor. In addition to directing the transcription of the <italic>dpr</italic>A gene, σ<sup>X</sup> associates with and anchors DprA at the same cellular pole where ComD and CSP are located, allowing this repressor to interact with newly activated ComE~P and promoting timely extinction of the whole transcriptional regulatory circuit of competence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DprA displays a polar localization in competent cells, which correlates with competence shut-off</title><p>To investigate the localization of DprA during competence in live cells, we used a fluorescent fusion protein DprA-GFP, produced from the native <italic>dprA</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). DprA-GFP was synthesized during competence and remained stable up to 90 min after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), similarly to wild-type DprA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>), without degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A strain possessing DprA-GFP was almost fully functional in transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but partially altered in competence shut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In pneumococcal cells induced with exogenous CSP, the peak of competence induction occurs 15–20 min after induction. 15 min after competence induction, DprA-GFP showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization, punctuated by discrete foci of varying intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The distribution and localization of DprA-GFP foci was analyzed by MicrobeJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ducret et al., 2016</xref>), with results presented as focus density maps ordered by cell length. Spots represent the localization of a DprA-GFP focus on a representative half pneumococcal cell, while spot color represents density of foci at a particular cellular location. DprA-GFP foci were present in 70% of cells, predominantly at a single cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DE</xref>). To ascertain whether the polar localization of DprA-GFP was due to the GFP tag or represented functional localization, we carried out immunofluorescence microscopy with competent cells possessing wild-type DprA using α–DprA antibodies. Results showed that native DprA exhibited a similar accumulation pattern as the DprA-GFP foci upon competence induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Next, to explore the relation between these foci and the dual role of DprA in transformation and competence regulation, we investigated focus formation in cells possessing a previously published mutation in DprA impairing its dimerization (DprA<sup>AR</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quevillon-Cheruel et al., 2012</xref>). This mutant strongly affected both transformation and competence shut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quevillon-Cheruel et al., 2012</xref>). Results showed that 15 min after competence induction, DprA<sup>AR</sup>-GFP did not form foci, despite being produced at wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). DprA thus accumulates at the cell pole during competence, dependent on its ability to dimerize. To explore whether the polar foci of DprA were involved in its role in transformation, or competence shut-off, we began by investigating how a <italic>dprA<sup>QNQ</sup></italic> mutation, specifically abrogating the interaction between DprA and RecA and thus affecting transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quevillon-Cheruel et al., 2012</xref>), affected the localization of DprA-GFP. Fifteen minutes after competence induction, the DprA<sup>QNQ</sup>-GFP mutant formed polar foci at wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In addition, the inactivation of <italic>comEC</italic>, encoding for an essential protein of the transmembrane DNA entry pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pestova and Morrison, 1998</xref>), or <italic>recA</italic>, encoding the recombinase with which DprA interacts during transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mortier-Barrière et al., 2007</xref>), did not alter the frequency or localization of DprA-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1GH</xref>). Altogether, these results suggested that the polar foci of DprA-GFP may not be related to the DNA entry or recombination steps of transformation but could be linked to competence shut-off.</p><p>We recently reported that optimal competence shut-off relies on the maximal cellular concentration of DprA (~8000 molecules), while wild-type transformation required only around 1/10th of these molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>). This conclusion was obtained by expressing <italic>dprA</italic> under the control of the IPTG-inducible P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic> promoter (<italic>CEP<sub>lac</sub>-dprA</italic>), which enables the modulation of the cellular concentration of DprA by varying IPTG concentration in the growth medium. Here, we reproduced these experiments with the DprA-GFP fusion, to test whether its concentration correlates with the formation of polar foci in competent cells. The expression, transformation, and competence profiles of a <italic>dprA<sup>-</sup></italic> mutant strain harboring the ectopic <italic>CEP<sub>lac</sub>-dprA-gfp</italic> construct in varying concentrations of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) were equivalent to those reported previously for <italic>CEP<sub>lac</sub>-dprA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, a steady decrease in DprA-GFP foci was observed as IPTG was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AB</xref>). When comparing the cellular localization of DprA-GFP foci, a sharp reduction in the proportion of polar foci was observed as IPTG was reduced, with most of the remaining foci observed at midcell and appearing weaker in intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AC</xref>). This shift correlated with a progressive loss of competence shut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), presenting a strong link between the presence of polar DprA-GFP foci and the shut-off of pneumococcal competence. Altogether, these results strongly support the notion that the polar foci of DprA-GFP represent the subcellular site where DprA mediates competence shut-off.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Reducing cellular DprA-GFP levels results in loss of polar accumulation and competence shut-off.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Focus density maps of DprA-GFP foci at different cellular levels during competence. <italic>CEP<sub>lac</sub>-dprA-gfp</italic> from strain R4262.

This BIP-derived induction mimics rapid, strong induction by CSP during competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2016</xref>). These cells were found to produce stable DprA-GFP after exposure to BIP, and upon addition of CSP to the growth medium, to transform at wild-type levels and to partially shut-off competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, BIP-induced production of DprA-GFP in the absence of CSP resulted in the formation of weak, barely detectable polar foci in only 10% of non-competent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). In comparison, 47% of cells producing DprA-GFP during competence formed bright polar foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).

This led us to consider that the only proteins whose presence correlated directly with the presence of polar DprA-GFP foci were thus σ<sup>X</sup> and ComW.</p><p>To first investigate whether ComW played a role in the formation of polar DprA-GFP foci, the <italic>comW</italic> gene was inactivated in a strain possessing a <italic>rpoD<sup>A171V</sup></italic> mutation, enabling σ<sup>X</sup>-RNA polymerase interaction and resulting in late <italic>com</italic> regulon expression in the absence of ComW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tovpeko et al., 2016</xref>). DprA-GFP expressed from the native locus still formed polar foci in this strain at levels comparable to the wildtype strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). ComW was thus not required for the formation of DprA-GFP foci. In light of this, the only remaining candidate whose presence in competent cells correlated directly with formation of polar DprA-GFP foci was σ<sup>X</sup>.

The number of cells with foci decreased steadily after this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C, D</xref>), contrasting with polar DprA-GFP which remained stable over 60 min after induction. Importantly, σ<sup>X</sup>-GFP continued to form polar foci in a strain lacking <italic>dprA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), showing that σ<sup>X</sup> does not depend on DprA for its localization. Together, these results strongly supported the notion that σ<sup>X</sup> promotes the targeting and assembly of DprA-GFP foci at the cell pole. To further explore this hypothesis, we co-expressed DprA-mTurquoise and σ<sup>X</sup>-YFP fluorescent fusions in the same cells and found that 86% of DprA-mTurquoise foci colocalized with σ<sup>X</sup>-YFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). DprA and σ<sup>X</sup> are thus present at the same pole of the cell at the same time and the polar accumulation of DprA molecules in competent cells depends on σ<sup>X</sup>. These results suggested that σ<sup>X</sup> could interact with DprA to anchor it to the pole of competent cells. The potential interaction between σ<sup>X</sup> and DprA was tested in live competent pneumococcal cells in pull-down experiments. To achieve this, we used GFP-TRAP magnetic beads (Chromotek) to purify σ<sup>X</sup>-GFP from competent cells expressing either wild-type DprA or, as a control, the DprA<sup>AR</sup> mutant that did not accumulate at the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Since DprA interacts directly with ComE~P to mediate competence shut-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>), this raised the question of the subcellular localization of ComD and ComE, which define a two-component system controlling competence regulation. To first explore the localization of ComE in competent cells, a strain was generated expressing a functional <italic>comE-gfp</italic> fluorescent fusion at the native <italic>comE</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In competent cells, ComE-GFP formed patches around the periphery of the cell, often at the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A time-lapse experiment showed that these patches were dynamic, navigating around the cell membrane over time (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

The resulting GFP-ComD fusion displayed partial functionality in competence induction and transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). In contrast to ComE-GFP, GFP-ComD formed distinct polar foci of varying intensity in 57% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>), a localization pattern reminiscent of those observed with DprA-GFP and σ<sup>X</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, respectively). Since GFP-ComD was not fully functional, we also analyzed the localization of a synthetic fluorescent exogenous CSP peptide (CSP-HF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) in parallel, to track its interaction with ComD at the cell surface. This fluorescent peptide was found to accumulate at a single-cell pole in the majority of competent, wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). In addition, this accumulation was dependent on the presence of ComD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), showing that the polar accumulation of the partially functional GFP-ComD fusion represented a functional subcellular localization during competence. In addition, most cells with ComD-GFP foci possessed a single focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which persisted after the shut-off of competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Altogether, these findings revealed that activation of the positive feedback loop of competence triggered by CSP interaction with ComD to phosphorylate ComE occurs at the cell pole.

Although ComE-YFP foci were dynamic and their localization difficult to analyze, 20% of DprA-mTurquoise foci were nonetheless found to colocalize with ComE-YFP at the cell pole, showing that these proteins can be found at the same pole in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Taken together, these results showed that DprA colocalizes strongly with ComD, generally at one cell pole during pneumococcal competence, further suggesting that the localization of DprA to this cellular location, mediated by σ<sup>X</sup>, facilitates pneumococcal competence shut-off. The localization of DprA at the cell pole where ComD appears to interact with CSP means that DprA is present at the time and place that neophosphorylated ComE~P is produced, allowing DprA to interact with the activated regulator at the cell pole and prevent it from accessing its genomic targets, facilitating shut-off.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Two copies of <italic>comX</italic> are required for optimal competence shut-off</title><p>A distinct hallmark of the single pneumococcal alternative sigma factor σ<sup>X</sup> of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is that it is produced from two distinct and strictly identical genes, at two distinct loci in the pneumococcal genome, known as <italic>comX1</italic> and <italic>comX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Morrison, 1999</xref>).

In addition to controlling the transcription of the late <italic>com</italic> gene <italic>dprA</italic>, σ<sup>X</sup> also mediates the accumulation of DprA molecules mostly at the same pole as ComD, a mechanism that facilitates competence shut-off. σ<sup>X</sup> thus controls both induction of the late <italic>com</italic> regulon and the shut-off of the early <italic>com</italic> regulon, including thereby its own expression and by consequence that of its regulon.

Unexpectedly, DprA is targeted to this hub by σ<sup>X</sup>, describing an unprecedented role for an alternative sigma factor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The pneumococcal polar competence regulation hub is focused around the histidine kinase ComD</title><p>An important finding is the discrete accumulation of the pneumococcal histidine kinase ComD at the cell pole during competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). The localization of histidine kinases has not been extensively studied, but few histidine kinases of two-component signaling systems have been found to accumulate at the cell pole. One well-documented example is the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> histidine kinase CheA, which is involved in chemotaxis. CheA localizes along with its cognate response regulator CheY to a single cell pole, forming a chemotactic cluster with a variety of chemoreceptors. CheY stimulates the production of flagellae at the opposite cell pole, driving chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2006</xref>). Another example is the histidine kinase PilS in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, which also accumulates at the cell pole, and along with its cognate cytoplasmic response regulator PilR, regulates expression of polar pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyd, 2000</xref>). In addition, the PleD response regulator of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, which is phosphorylated by both polar DivJ and PleC kinases, localizes to the cell pole and is actively involved in cell cycle control and cell differentiation in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paul et al., 2004</xref>). Although ComD tethering at one cell pole is similar to these examples, major differences exist between these two-component systems. Firstly, regarding how their response regulators localize, ComE presents a different localization pattern than CheY, PilR, and PleD, assembling into patches close to the inner side of the cell membrane and focusing dynamically on the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). ComE phosphorylation by ComD promotes its dimerization and switch into a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). ComE~P dimers should then leave the cell pole to interact with genomic targets and turn on early <italic>com</italic> gene expression, producing σ<sup>X</sup> and ComW, which then cooperate to turn on late <italic>com</italic> gene expression. Secondly, the ComDE two-component system induces its own expression, generating a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claverys et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2013</xref>), and leading to the strong, rapid induction of competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dagkessamanskaia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peterson et al., 2004</xref>). As found here, this leads to the accumulation of the regulatory proteins at the cell pole hub. In addition, the ComDE two-component system controls a complex, multi-faceted genetic program involving the altered expression of 17% of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aprianto et al., 2018</xref>) and is present at a unique cell pole, while the actors of transformation are present at midcell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergé et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, it is possible that the polar localization of the competence regulatory hub is dictated by the very nature of the competence regulation mechanism itself. This localization could be linked to the transient nature of pneumococcal competence. A spatiotemporally controlled localization for this process would provide a mechanism to allow initial induction followed by repression, thus preventing toxicity. It is also possible that the purpose of polar accumulation of σ<sup>X</sup> is to limit the circulating levels of σ<sup>X</sup>. Polar accumulation of σ<sup>X</sup> may thus protect the cell from a potentially dangerous hyper-competent state at two levels: firstly by promoting polar DprA accumulation to facilitate shut-off and secondly by sequestering σ<sup>X</sup> itself to prevent over-induction of the late <italic>com</italic> regulon. Although the factor localizing σ<sup>X</sup> to the cell pole is unknown, it could be considered an anti-sigma factor in this light. Anti-sigma factors can control alternative sigma factors by interacting directly with them to sequester them to the cell membrane to prevent activity until a specific signal is received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Österberg et al., 2011</xref>). Although ComD goes to the same pole as σ<sup>X</sup>, it is not the anchor directing σ<sup>X</sup> to the pole, since DprA (and thus σ<sup>X</sup>) still localizes to the cell pole in the absence of early <italic>com</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EF</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Two copies of <italic>comX</italic> ensure optimal fitness of competent cells</title><p>This study has uncovered a second role for σ<sup>X</sup> in the shut-off of pneumococcal competence, besides its transcriptional role with ComW, which is to associate with the RNA polymerase and direct the expression of the late <italic>com</italic> regulon. This second role is independent of ComW. It promotes accumulation of DprA at the cell pole to facilitate competence shut-off. Pneumococci possess two identical copies of <italic>comX</italic> at distinct locations within the genome, called <italic>comX1</italic> and <italic>comX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Morrison, 1999</xref>). It has remained unclear why two copies exist, since inactivation of a single copy of <italic>comX</italic> does not affect transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Morrison, 1999</xref>). The finding of a second role for σ<sup>X</sup> in the shut-off of competence suggests a different reason for this duplication, since both copies of <italic>comX</italic> are required for optimal competence shut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In light of this, it may be that two copies of <italic>comX</italic> are maintained within the genome to optimize the shut-off of competence. Since unregulated competence is toxic for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>), two copies of <italic>comX</italic> provide a fail-safe in case of loss or inactivation of one <italic>comX</italic> gene by transformation or spontaneous mutation, allowing the cell to nonetheless exit the competent state. In light of the second role of σ<sup>X</sup> uncovered here, two copies of <italic>comX</italic> provide a simple yet elegant means for <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and close relatives to ensure they are always equipped to survive competence, allowing cells to reap the potential benefits of competence without the fitness cost associated with unregulated competence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Polar accumulation of DprA and ComD and heterogneity in a post-competence cell population</title><p>The σ<sup>X</sup>-mediated accumulation of DprA in foci at the cell pole depends on a high concentration of DprA molecules in the cell, resulting from the σ<sup>X</sup>-driven transcription of the <italic>dpr</italic>A gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This dual feature implies that polar DprA foci are not formed immediately during competence, in line with our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We suggest that this short delay provides the opportunity for ComD to phosphorylate ComE and induce competence, before DprA arrives at the cell pole to facilitate shut-off. In addition, the foci formation is dependent on the ability of DprA to dimerize, which alters both its role in transformation via interaction with RecA and its role in competence shut-off via interaction with ComE~P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirouze et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quevillon-Cheruel et al., 2012</xref>). However, DprA polar foci formation is independent of the presence of the transformation pore protein ComEC or the recombinase RecA, suggesting that the observed foci are not linked to the conserved role of DprA in transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the loss of polar foci when reducing cellular levels of DprA-GFP correlates with the loss of competence shut-off, strongly supporting the proposal that DprA accumulation at the cell pole underpins its negative feedback role in competence regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In a competent population, the presence and intensity of DprA-GFP foci varies from cell to cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The same heterogeneity is observed with GFP-ComD foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, at the peak of CSP-induced competence, a quarter of cells do not present detectable DprA-GFP or GFP-ComD foci and, in the other cells, the foci exhibit different level of brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, foci are observed in all cell types, meaning that their formation is not determined by a particular stage of the cell-cycle. This highlights a heterogeneity in the pneumococcal competent cell population. Furthermore, DprA-GFP and GFP-ComD foci persist in many cells at least 30 min after the shut-off of competence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). It has been previously shown that post-competent cells are unable to respond to CSP for a period of time after they shut-off competence, a phenomenon known as ‘blind to CSP’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Morrison, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fox and Hotchkiss, 1957</xref>). We suggest that the heterogeneity of polar DprA and ComD accumulation could play a role in this phenomenon. Polar DprA accumulation in a majority of cells could prevent cells from responding to CSP by immediately antagonizing neosynthesized ComE~P, while cells lacking ComD foci may not respond optimally to the competence signal. Our findings explain the suggestion made previously based on a mathematical model simulating competence regulation that a high amount of DprA played a role in this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weyder et al., 2018</xref>). This notion is supported by the fact that co-expression of DprA and σ<sup>X</sup> prior to CSP addition to the cell culture antagonized competence development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–F</xref>). Furthermore, since not all post-competent cells possess detectable polar foci of DprA-GFP or GFP-ComD, we suggest that whether sufficient DprA or ComD has accumulated at the pole of a particular cell should govern whether this cell can respond to an external CSP signal and is thus receptive to a second wave of competence. This produces a mixture of competent and non-competent cells, which may maximize the potential survival of a pneumococcal population.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the entire pneumococcal competence regulatory cycle occurs at a single cell pole. This generates an asymmetry at the poles of a competent cell, which can be transmitted to future generations and impact the ability to respond to subsequent competence signals. In addition, we have uncovered a key second role for the competence-dedicated alternative sigma factor σ<sup>X</sup> that actively localizes DprA to the polar competence regulatory hub to facilitate competence shut-off. This regulatory mechanism, involving two proteins with other conserved roles in competence and transformation respectively, is pivotal to optimal competence shut-off and maintains the fitness of competent cells. This finding represents the first example of an alternative sigma factor playing a central role in the extinction of the signal on which its own production depends and broadens our knowledge of the regulatory roles played by bacterial alternative sigma factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>)</td><td>Various</td><td>This paper</td><td>NBCI Taxon: 1313</td><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Various oligonucleotides</td><td>This paper (Eurofins-MWG)</td><td>Primers for cloning</td><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2019">10.1038/nmeth.2019</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MicrobeJ</td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.77">10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.77</ext-link> </td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microbeJ.com">www.microbeJ.com</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>R project for statistical computing</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, transformation, and competence</title><p>The pneumococcal strains, primers, and plasmids used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.

Twenty minutes after this, CSP was added to the culture to induce competence, and the induction of the early <italic>com</italic> regulon was tracked by measuring activity of a <italic>comC-luc</italic> transcriptional reporter fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berge et al., 2002</xref>) every 2 min for 20 min to observe initial competence induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Pneumococcal precultures grown in C+Y medium at 37°C to an OD<sub>550</sub> of 0.1 were induced with either CSP (100 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) or BIP (250 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) peptide. At indicated times post-induction, 1 mL samples were collected, cooled down by addition of 500 mL cold medium, pelleted (3 min, 3000 g), and resuspended in 1 mL C+Y medium. Of this suspension, 2 µL were spotted on a microscope slide containing a slab of 1.2% C+Y agarose as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergé et al., 2013</xref>) before imaging. Unless stated, images were visualized 15 min after competence induction, at the peak of competence gene expression. To generate videos, images were taken of the same fields of vision at varying time points during incubation at 37°C. Images were captured and processed using the Nis-Elements AR software (Nikon). Images were analyzed using MicrobeJ, a plug-in of ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ducret et al., 2016</xref>). Data was analyzed in R and unless stated, represented as focus density maps plotted on the longitudinal axis of half cells ordered by cell length. Each spot represents the localization of an individual focus, and spot color represents focus density at a specific location on the half cell. Cells with &gt; 0 foci shown for each time point. In cells possessing &gt; 1 foci, foci were represented adjacently on cells of the same length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blots</title><p>To compare the expression profiles of competence proteins after competence induction, time-course western blots were carried out. Cells were diluted 100-fold in 10 mL C+Y medium pH 7 and grown to OD 0.1. Where appropriate, cells were induced with CSP (100 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) or BIP (250 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) peptide. At indicated time points, OD<sub>550</sub> measurements were taken and 500 µL of culture was recovered. Samples were centrifuged (3 min, 3000 g) and pellets were resuspended in 40 µL of TE 1x supplemented with 0.01% DOC and 0.02% SDS. Samples were then incubated for 10 min at 37°C before addition of 40 µL 2x sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, followed by incubation at 85°C for 10 min. Samples were then normalized compared to the initial OD<sub>550</sub> reading, and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (BIORAD). Samples were migrated for 30 min at 200V, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane using a Transblot Turbo (BIORAD). Membranes were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 1x TBS with 0.1% Tween20% and 10% milk, before two washes in 1x TBS with 0.1% Tween20 and probing with primary antibodies (1/10,000 as noted) in 1x TBS with 0.1% Tween20% and 5% milk overnight at 4°C. After a further four washes in 1x TBS with 0.1% Tween20, membranes were probes with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1/10,000) for 1 hr 30 min, followed by another four washes in 1x TBS with 0.1% Tween20. Membranes were activated using Clarity Max ECL (BIORAD) and visualized in a ChemiDoc Touch (BIORAD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Construction and validation of strains expressing only early or late <italic>com</italic> regulons</title><p>To express only the late <italic>com</italic> regulon, the <italic>comX</italic> and <italic>comW</italic> genes were placed under the control of BIP at the CEP expression platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weyder et al., 2018</xref>) in a strain possessing <italic>dprA-gfp</italic> at the native locus, with the <italic>comCDE</italic> operon deleted to prevent any expression of early <italic>com</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, the <italic>cbpD</italic> gene was inactivated to compensate for the absence of the early com gene <italic>comM </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergé et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guiral et al., 2005</xref>). Addition of BIP to this strain resulted in induction of the late <italic>com</italic> regulon in the absence of the autocatalytic feedback loop generated by the early <italic>com</italic> regulon. This strain transformed equally well upon CSP or BIP addition, showing that late <italic>com</italic> regulon expression was sufficient for transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, since the catalytic feedback loop of the early <italic>com</italic> genes was removed, little to no shut-off of late <italic>com</italic> gene expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Addition of both BIP and CSP to this strain resulted in the induction of the early <italic>com</italic> regulon and the production of DprA-GFP. As no other late <italic>com</italic> genes were expressed in this strain, the strain could not transform and the induction profile of <italic>ssbB-luc</italic> could not be tracked.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>To visualize native DprA and σ<sup>X</sup> in live competent pneumococci, immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wayne et al., 2010</xref>), with alterations. Briefly, cells were grown in 3 mL C+Y medium at 37°C until OD<sub>550</sub> 0.1. Competence was induced by addition of CSP (100 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>) and cells were incubated for 15 min at 37°C before recovery of cell pellets by centrifugation. Pellets were fixed by resuspending in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma F8775) in PBS and incubation for 15 min at room temperature followed by 45 min on ice. Cells were then washed three times in 1 mL PBS and resuspended in 0.3 mL chilled GTE (50 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA). 50 µL of cells were transferred onto polylysine slides (Sigma P0425) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature before aspiration of excess liquid, with slides then washed twice with 50 µL PBS. 0.2% Triton X100 in PBS (PBS-T) was added for 10 s before being aspirated, and slides were dipped in methanol at −20°C for 10 min and air-dryed. Slides were then rehydrated with 50 µL PBS, and incubated with 50 µL PBS-T for 5 min at room temperature before a 1 hr incubation with 50 µL 5% skimmed milk in PBS-T (PBS-T-M). After this, slides were washed twice with 50 µL PBS and incubated with 50 µL of 1/100 dilutions of polyclonal primary antibodies raised in rabbits against DprA and σ<sup>X</sup> in PBS-M for 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were washed twice in 50 µL PBS for 10 s and once for 5 min, before incubation with 50 µL of 1/100 goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen A32731) with 0.2 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma D9542) in PBS-M for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark.

Briefly, cells were inoculated 1/100 in 25 mL of C+Y medium pH 7 and grown to OD<sub>550</sub> 0.1. Competence was induced by addition of 100 ng mL<sup>−1</sup> CSP, and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Cultures were mixed with 25 mL cold buffer A (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 g. Pellets were washed twice with 10 mL cold buffer A and stored at −80°C until use. After defrosting, pellets were resuspended in 1 mL buffer B (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% TritonX100, 1 M DTT) and incubated for 10 min on ice, followed by 10 min at 37°C, and a further 10 min on ice. Samples were then sonicated (2 × 30 s with 10 s pause) and centrifuged for 30 min at 4°C and 16,000 g. After normalizing the protein concentrations in the samples, 20 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> RNAse A and 50 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> DNAse I were added and samples were tumbled end over end at 4°C for 30 min. 75 µl of GFP-Trap beads were added to the samples, which were then tumbled end over end at 4°C for 2 hr 30 min. GFP-Trap beads were purified by magnetism and washed twice in 500 µL ice cold dilution buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA), before being resuspended in 2x sample buffer + 10% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 95°C for 10 min.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Melanie Blokesch as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Dubnau (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates natural competence regulation in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> with a focus on competence shut-off. While previous work by the group had shown that the DNA processing protein A (DprA) was involved competence termination, its mode-of-action was not fully understood. Here, the protein's mode-of-action was addressed by adding a spatial regulation layer on top of the temporal competence window. Precisely, the authors provided evidence that DprA is recruited to the cell pole and that this localization is important to turn off the competence program. Moreover, DprA's localization was shown to be stimulated by the accumulation of the comX-encoded σ factor SigX at the same pole and a direct interaction between these proteins was demonstrated. The polar location of DprA is thought to inactivate the response regulator (ComE~P), a process that ultimately ended the competence induction circle. Collectively, these data provide new insights into the spatiotemporal choreography of competence proteins and how certain protein relocalization events to the pole are required to switch off competence in this organism. The finding are especially remarkable given the long-known roles of SigX and DprA in competence induction and DNA recombination mediation, respectively, while their role in competence shut-off was mostly understudied in the past.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three experts agreed that this study is very well performed, that it includes important controls, and that the manuscript is clearly written. The only minor concern that the experts had was the impact of the fused GFP part on SigX1's localization pattern. Indeed, with GFP being prone to dimerization, the fusion protein might not fully reflect the localization of the unfused σ factor. While the localization dynamics of SigX1-GFP somewhat speaks against an artifact, the experts wonder if the authors could do or have tried immunofluorescence microscopy on native SigX or a modified version with a short detection tag? Such experiments would further strengthen the manuscript. In case such experiments are technically unfeasible, the authors should nonetheless mention this caveat in the text of their manuscript.</p><p>In this context, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62907.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three experts agreed that this study is very well performed, that it includes important controls, and that the manuscript is clearly written.

This was done previously for DprA in Figure 1F. The results show that σ<sup>X</sup> accumulates at the cell pole in native conditions, confirming the relevance of the localization of the σ<sup>X</sup>-GFP fusion. This information has been added to the subsection “σ X mediates the localization of DprA at the cell pole of competent cells” and to Figure 5—figure supplement 2. We also added an immunofluorescence microscopy section to the Materials and methods section, as this was absent. We thank the reviewers for this suggested control, which strengthens the arguments of our paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
