plants (BWWTP) are considered to be hotspots for the evolution and subsequent spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) promote the mobilization and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and are thereby critical mediators of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community. At present, it is unclear whether specific AMR categories are differentially disseminated via bacteriophages (phages) or plasmids. To understand the segregation of AMR in relation to MGEs, we analyzed meta-omic (metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic) data systematically collected over 1.5 years from a BWWTP. Our results showed a core group of 15 AMR categories which were found across all timepoints. Some of these AMR categories were disseminated exclusively (bacitracin) or primarily (aminoglycoside, MLS and sulfonamide) via plasmids or phages (fosfomycin and peptide), whereas others were disseminated equally by both. Combined and timepoint-specific analyses of gene, transcript and protein abundances further demonstrated that aminoglycoside, bacitracin and sulfonamide resistance genes were expressed more by plasmids, in contrast to fosfomycin and peptide AMR expression by phages, thereby validating our genomic findings. In the analyzed communities, the dominant taxon <italic>Candidatus</italic> Microthrix parvicella was a major contributor to several AMR categories whereby its plasmids primarily mediated aminoglycoside resistance. Importantly, we also found AMR associated with ESKAPEE pathogens within the BWWTP, and here MGEs also contributed differentially to the dissemination of the corresponding ARGs. Collectively our findings pave the way toward understanding the segmentation of AMR within MGEs, thereby shedding new light on resistome populations and their mediators, essential elements that are of immediate relevance to human health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>wastewater treatment</kwd><kwd>metatranscriptomics</kwd><kwd>metaproteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001866</institution-id><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CORE/13684739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilmes</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CoG 863664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilmes</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001866</institution-id><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIDE/11823097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilmes</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>de Nies</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII5_180241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Busi</surname><given-names>Susheel Bhanu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biological wastewater treatment plants are critical reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), allowing for early detection and monitoring of resistant pathogens, whilst serving as models for understanding the segregation of mobile genetic elements through AMR.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Throughout human history, bacterial infections have been a major cause of both disease and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bonilla and Muniz, 2009</xref>). The discovery as well as the subsequent development and medical use of antibiotics have provided effective treatment options which limited the development and spread of bacterial pathogens. However, the use of antibiotics has exacerbated the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both commensal and pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wright, 2007</xref>). As a result, AMR, as the ‘silent pandemic’, has become a prevalent threat to human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brogan and Mossialos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahoney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O’Neill, 2014</xref>).</p><p>From a public health perspective, biological wastewater treatment plants (BWWTPs) are considered hotspots of AMR due to the convergence of antibiotics with resistant, potentially pathogenic microorganisms originating from both the general population as well as agriculture, healthcare services and industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rodríguez-Molina et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the mobilization of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) through rampant horizontal gene transfer (HGT) promotes the dissemination of AMR within the BWWTP microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">von Wintersdorff et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, BWWTPs represent an environment exceptionally suited for the evolution and subsequent spread of AMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Calero-Cáceres et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). To date, more than 32 studies have documented the role of BWWTPs as key reservoirs of AMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fouz et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, BWWTPs generally do not contain the necessary infrastructure to remove either ARGs or resistant bacteria, which are released into the receiving water via the effluent, promoting its spread in the environment at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2020</xref>). Most often these are surface water bodies such as rivers, which contribute to the further dissemination of AMR and resistant bacteria among environmental microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singer et al., 2016</xref>). Acquired resistance may in turn be carried over to humans and animals using these water resources. In fact, there is strong evidence suggesting that ARGs from environmental bacteria can be taken up by human-associated and pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nadeem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trinh et al., 2018</xref>). From an epidemiological and surveillance perspective, BWWTPs also provide samples representative of entire populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendriksen et al., 2019</xref>). As such, BWWTPs have recently been crucial for the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 within the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herold et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, to increase our understanding of the dissemination of AMR and the underlying mechanisms as well as its general prevalence, it is necessary to map the resistome of various environments starting with biological BWWTPs because it is critical to unravel the extent to which they act as reservoirs for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) to bacterial pathogens. Moreover, understanding the community-level overviews of the ARG potential and its expression, coupled with population-level linking, including to pathogens, may allow for efficient monitoring of pathogenic and AMR potential with broad impacts on human health.</p><p>The presence of resistance genes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) along with sub-inhibitory antibiotic selection pressures may facilitate HGT of ARGs into new hosts through the mobilome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">von Wintersdorff et al., 2016</xref>). Previous work has in particular shown that antibiotic selection pressures may alter HGT processes, thereby increasing the number of resistance elements which reside on mobile DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Datta and Hughes, 1983</xref>). Acquisition of ARGs via MGEs primarily occurs through two mechanisms: conjugation or transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacLean and San Millan, 2019</xref>). In conjugation, plasmids carrying one or more resistance genes are transferred between microorganisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carattoli, 2013</xref>), while in transduction bacteriophages carrying ARGs infect bacteria and integrate their genome into those of the host thereby conferring resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chiang et al., 2019</xref>). Of these mechanisms, conjugation is often thought to have the greatest influence on the dissemination of ARGs, while transduction is deemed less important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">von Wintersdorff et al., 2016</xref>). In general terms, studies concerning AMR and its dissemination focus either on phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strange et al., 2021</xref>) or plasmids solely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, the two are treated collectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Che et al., 2019</xref>) without a comprehensive comparative analysis. This circumstance has created a knowledge gap whereby the contributions of plasmids and phages as independent entities to AMR transmission within complex communities, such as those found in biological BWWTPs, is largely unknown.</p><p>To shed light on the dissemination and potential segregation of AMR within MGEs in a WTTP microbial community, we leveraged longitudinal meta-omics data (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics). Samples collected for 51 consecutive weeks over a period of 1.5 years were used to characterize the resistome. We found that several bacterial orders such as Acidimicrobiales, Burkholderiales, and Pseudomonadales were associated with 29 AMR categories across all timepoints. Our longitudinal analysis suggests that MGEs are important drivers of AMR dissemination within BWWTPs. More importantly, we reveal that MGEs, that is plasmidomes and phageomes, contribute differentially to AMR dissemination. Furthermore, we observed this phenomenon in clinically-relevant taxa such as the ESKAPEE pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reza et al., 2019</xref>), for which plasmids and phages were exclusively associated with specific ARGs. Collectively, our data suggest that BWWTPs are critical reservoirs of AMR which show clear evidence for the segregation of distinct AMR genes within MGEs especially in complex microbial communities. In general, we believe that these findings may provide crucial insights into the segregation of the resistome via the mobilome in any and all reservoirs of AMR, including but not limited to animals, humans, and other environmental systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Longitudinal assessment of the resistome within a BWWTP</title><p>To characterize the BWWTP resistome, we sampled a municipal BWWTP on a weekly basis over a 1.5-year period (ranging from 21-03-2011 to 03-05-2012) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herold et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martínez Arbas et al., 2021</xref>). Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were preprocessed, and both sets of reads co-assembled using the Integrated Meta-omic Pipeline as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Narayanasamy et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, utilizing the PathoFact pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Nies et al., 2021</xref>) on the assembled contigs (<italic>Methods</italic>), we resolved the BWWTP resistome. This analysis revealed the presence of 29 different categories of AMR within the BWWTP. Subsequent longitudinal analyses highlighted enrichments in aminoglycoside, beta-lactam and multidrug resistance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Concomitantly, we observed specific shifts in the AMR profiles over time. For example, a transient change at two timepoints (13-05-2011, 08-02-2012) highlighted a steep increase in resistance genes corresponding to glycopeptide resistance. Other AMR categories, such as diaminopyrimidine resistance, exhibited a less drastic but more fluid change in longitudinal abundance observable over multiple timepoints.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Longitudinal metagenomic and metatranscriptomic assessment of AMR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) ARG relative abundances over time within the BWWTP.

A core group of 15 AMR categories in total were identified and found to be present across the 1.5-year sampling period. These included aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, and multidrug resistance genes, which contributed the most to the pool of ARGs. A further six (aminocoumarin, aminoglycoside:aminocoumarin, elfamycin, nucleoside, triclosan, and unclassified) AMR categories were found to be prevalent (&gt;75% of all timepoints), while another three AMR categories were moderately (50–75% of all timepoints) present over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Five other categories were rarely present within the BWWTP, with resistance corresponding to acridine dye only present at six of the timepoints. Altogether, this emphasized that the BWWTP resistome varies over time, substantiating the requirement for a longitudinal analysis to obtain an accurate overview of the community’s overall resistome.</p><p>Although the data thus far provided a clear overview of the BWWTP from a metagenomic perspective, it did not provide any information regarding AMR expression. We therefore utilized the corresponding metatranscriptomic dataset to investigate the expression of identified ARGs and monitor their changes, within the BWWTP, over time. In contrast to the metagenomic data, we observed a difference in AMR expression levels for several categories. Aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, and multidrug resistance identified at high levels in metagenomic information were also highly expressed within the BWWTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, peptide resistance demonstrated the highest expression levels of all the AMR categories. We further investigated which ARG subtypes contributed to the identified peptide resistance category and found that ~90% of the expressed peptide resistance was directly contributed by a single resistance gene, <italic>YojI</italic>, which was found to be widely distributed among the major taxa comprising the BWWTP community such as the Comamonadaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). YojI is typically associated with resistance to microcins by reducing the intracellular concentration of the toxic antibiotic peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delgado et al., 2005</xref>). The high incidence of this gene indicates a broad adaptive strategy amongst the microbial populations in the BWWTP against these specific stressors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Microbial community and co-occurrence patterns of AMR</title><p>Based on the previously identified microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herold et al., 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that the abundant and prevalent bacterial orders such as Acidimicrobiales were major contributors to the abundance in ARGs observable via metagenomics. To further investigate the contribution to AMR by the distinct microbial populations, we linked AMR genes to the contig-based taxonomic annotations of the assemblies (Methods). Herein, we identified a wide variety of taxonomic orders contributing to AMR, with multiple orders often contributing to the same resistance categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, taxa belonging to Acidimicrobiales, followed by Burkholderiales<italic>,</italic> were found to encode most of the ARGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Additionally, the abundance of ARGs linked to taxonomy varied over time. This was most noticeable during a five-week period (autumn: 02-11-2011 to 29-11-2011), where a decrease in abundance in ARGs linked to Acidimicrobiales and Bacteroidales was observed coinciding with an increase in ARG abundance in Pseudomonadales and Lactobacillales.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Microbial population-linked AMR.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Longitudinal ARG relative abundance levels linked to their corresponding microbial taxa (order level).

Overall, aminoglycoside, beta-lactam, multidrug, and peptide resistance were found to be abundant in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), with aminoglycoside resistance demonstrating the highest expression levels as confirmed through metatranscriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although it was not surprising to find a high abundance of ARGs linked to this species, the longitudinal variation in the abundances of these ARGs was nevertheless surprising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Furthermore, coupled to a decrease in the abundance of <italic>M. parvicella</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martínez Arbas et al., 2021</xref>), we observed an almost complete decrease in ARGs at two timepoints (23-11-2011 and 29-11-2011). However, the <italic>M. parvicella</italic> population recovered to levels resembling the earlier timepoints in conjunction with the abundances in ARGs toward the end of the sampling period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), underlining their overall contribution to AMR within this BWWTP.

These patterns indicated a strong segregation of distinct, taxa-specific ARG subtypes within the BWWTP community over time. One clear example was that of <italic>M. parvicella</italic> which encoded different aminoglycoside resistance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

Further studies have shown that conventional BWWTP processes at best only partially remove ARGs from the effluent and may find their way into the urban water cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hiller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Proia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rodriguez-Mozaz et al., 2015</xref>). Wastewater treatment plants, therefore, are crucial reservoirs of AMR, whose monitoring may allow for early-detection of AMR within the human population feeding into the system. Here, we leveraged a systematic and longitudinal sampling scheme from a BWWTP to identify diverse AMR categories prevalent within the BWWTP microbial community. In line with the studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szczepanowski et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parsley et al., 2010</xref>, we found up to 29 AMR categories with several ARGs within the BWWTP. More importantly, and unlike the previous studies, we linked the identified ARGs to clinically-relevant ESKAPEE pathogens, which represent a growing global threat to human health.</p><p>In our BWWTP samples, we identified a core group of 15 AMR categories that were ubiquitous at all timepoints. In line with the above-mentioned reports, the observed core resistance categories may reflect their abundance in the surrounding human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarestrup and Woolhouse, 2020</xref>). This has previously been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pärnänen et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hendriksen et al., 2019</xref> where they showed that BWWTP AMR profiles correlate with clinical antibiotic usage as well as other socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, bacteria are known to have innate defense mechanisms against inhibitory secondary metabolites from other taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frost et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, one must be cognizant of thprace phenomenon that the observed core group of AMR categories may also be a proxy for the abundance of specific resistant bacteria. Despite this observation, it is plausible that both anthropogenic and microbial sources for AMR play a role in the observed resistance categories within the BWWTP. For instance, we found that several AMR categories, including ancillary (prevalent, moderate, and rare) groups, were associated with <italic>M. parvicella</italic> within the BWWTP. While the mechanisms underlying the abundance of this taxon are numerous, the increased abundance of ARGs are likely to contribute to its fitness advantage in this metal- and antibiotic-rich environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baquero et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, similar to the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munck et al., 2015</xref>, we found a wide range of bacteria associated with AMR categories including Acidimicrobiales, Burkholderiales and Rhodocyclales. On the other hand, we report that taxa, including ESKAPEE pathogens, belonging to 25 bacterial orders were associated with 29 AMR categories, compared to the eight bacterial orders reported previously.</p><p>It is important to note that the mobilome plays a critical role in the dissemination of AMR within microbial communities. AMR from resistant bacteria within the BWWTP can quickly disseminate within the BWWTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Che et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fouz et al., 2020</xref>), including transmission from pathogenic to commensal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brinkac et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, mediated through HGT, the BWWTP becomes a hotspot for resistant bacteria, which are then released back into the receiving environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turolla et al., 2018</xref>), and eventually the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fouz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Newton and McClary, 2019</xref>). Therefore, to limit the dissemination of AMR, it is important to understand the role of MGEs within the BWWTP. Our comprehensive analyses identified the differential contributions of AMR transmission mediated via phage and plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Specifically, we identified clear segregation of aminoglycoside, bacitracin, MLS and sulfonamide resistance categories with plasmids, while fosfomycin and peptide resistance were increasingly encoded and conferred via phages. While the association between these AMR categories and plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dubnau et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Galimand et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Razavi et al., 2017</xref>) or phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Torres-Barceló, 2018</xref>) are in line with previously reported results, differential analysis between MGEs has not been previously reported and has not been performed on multi-omic levels. In this study we report for the first time the systematic and extensive comparison of AMR encoded and expressed by phages versus plasmids. Our results indicating the segregation of ARGs within the ESKAPEE taxa via the MGEs further provide insights into potential modes of AMR transmission among pathogens. Although one cannot exclude the possibility of transmission of the above-mentioned ARGs via other MGEs, identifying potential segregation of MGEs in the transmission of ARGs brings us one step closer to identifying specific transmission paths and limiting the spread of AMR. For example, some studies have reported plasmid ‘curing’, the process by which plasmids are lost from bacterial populations, as a strategy against dissemination of AMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouanchaud and Chabbert, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vrancianu et al., 2020</xref>). As described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buckner et al., 2018</xref> plasmid curing, as well as other anti-plasmid strategies, could both reduce AMR prevalence, and (re-)sensitize bacteria to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buckner et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Separation of MGE-derived AMR within the BWWTP.</title><p>A graphical summary highlighting AMR categories found significantly increased in phage versus plasmid in all three omes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81196-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although several methods and tools exist for the identification of MGEs, the linkage to their respective bacterial hosts still remains a challenge. Our method presented here involves taxonomic annotations of reconstructed genomic information as a mean of linking bacteria to their corresponding MGEs using stringent filtering/identification criteria. An alternative approach may involve targeted sequencing of plasmids of interest and their respective hosts using the methodology established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>. However, to use such targeted sequencing approaches one requires a priori information on which plasmids to focus on in contrast to our method which is agnostic to such prior information. Furthermore, Hi-C-based methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Press et al., 2017</xref>) capture inter-chromosomal junctions, such as plasmid-genome interactions. However, compared to metagenomic approaches, these methods require different and extensive processing of the samples prior to sequencing to induce covalent linkages among DNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Press et al., 2017</xref>), therefore precluding the use of this method for large-scale characterization efforts. Combining these strategies in future studies with AMR categorization according to taxonomic affiliation as well as linkage to specific MGEs will provide novel strategies for characterizing and subsequently affecting MGE-mediated AMR.</p><p>By complementing the metagenomic analyses, metatranscriptomics conferred essential information regarding gene expression within the resistome. For instance, when comparing AMR expression levels of aminoglycoside, bacitracin, and sulfonamide mediated via MGEs, it is noticeable that expression levels in plasmids mirror the genomic content, that isthey exhibited higher levels of expression when compared to phage. On the other hand, glycopeptide and mupirocin resistance genes which were highly expressed in phages were not reflected within the metagenomic data. Additionally, we found the <italic>YojI</italic> resistance gene to be more highly expressed than any other ARGs. To facilitate resistance against the peptide antibiotic microcin J25, the outer membrane protein, TolC, in combination with <italic>YojI</italic> is required to export the antibiotic out of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delgado et al., 2005</xref>). Microcin J25 belongs to the group of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) and has antimicrobial activity against pathogenic genera such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. and <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Naimi et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, it has only recently been proposed as a treatment option against <italic>Salmonella enterica and</italic> has been discussed in recent years as a potential novel antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben Said et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these results, by considering that BWWTPs may reflect both the presence of AMR within the human population as well as be a hotspot of dissemination and generation of new AMR, surveillance of BWWTPs must be emphasized when developing new antibiotics. Our findings collectively suggest that the differential capacity of MGEs to disseminate AMR, coupled with longitudinal and expression-level analyses are crucial for monitoring human health conditions. More importantly, we report for the first time that BWWTP monitoring for AMR may allow for early detection of resistance mechanisms previously undescribed in BWWTP.</p><p>Finally, we applied an integrated multi-omic analysis approach to improve our knowledge on the functional potential of AMR and simultaneously validate the abundance and expression findings of the ARGs. By normalizing the metaproteomic results with the normalized expression of genes, we were able to assess the stability of expressed AMR across time. We find that our methodology allows for an unbiased assessment of overall expression accounting for gene copy abundance and expression. These findings support the notion that the AMR genes may serve as sentinels or indicators of the presence of particular antimicrobial agents. However, it is plausible that we are only identifying the most abundant proteins and/or proteins that are more stable over time, and do not capture the entirety of the proteome profiles. Factors such as protein decay rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cameron and Collins, 2014</xref>) among others, may additionally influence this assessment. Irrespective of these observations, we identified segregation of AMR categories with respect to plasmids and phages.</p><p>Our findings also highlight the potential for identifying segregation of AMR via specific MGEs with an aim toward possible therapeutic and mitigation strategies via for example plasmid curing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that longitudinal analyses are required to survey AMR within BWWTPs due to the variations in the resistome across time. These shifts may either be representative of a shift within the human population itself, which in turn could be associated with the concurrent use of antibiotics at a given time, or competition within the microbial community. In any case, an independent or static analysis of the various time points may show an incomplete view of the BWWTP resistome, thus underlining the importance of our longitudinal resistome analyses. Overall, our findings suggest that BWWTPs are critical reservoirs of AMR, potentially allowing for early detection and monitoring of pathogens. In addition, BWWTP monitoring may allow detection of resistance mechanisms linked to the introduction of new antimicrobials. Finally, BWWTPs may serve as a model for understanding the segregation of MGEs through AMR.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling and biomolecular extraction</title><p>From within the anoxic tank of the Schifflange municipal biological wastewater treatment plant (located in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg; 49° 30′ 48.29″ N; 6° 1′ 4.53″ E) individual floating sludge islets were sampled according to previous described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herold et al., 2020</xref>).

Furthermore, utilizing PathoFact, AMR genes were linked to predicted MGEs (i.e. plasmids and phages) to track transmission of AMR.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Mobilome-driven segregation of the resistome in biological wastewater treatment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including María Mercedes Zambrano as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, more methodological details and rigorous statistical analyses are needed in several places, as well as more thorough and clearer information to fully assess the validity of the results and the subsequent claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work aims to provide a broad view of antimicrobial resistance determinants in a wastewater treatment plant by conducting a multi-omics approach on samples taken over 1.5 years. The use of several omics approaches and the distinction of markers associated with either phages or plasmids in the system represent strengths of the study. However, the lack of clarity and methodological details weaken the interpretation and impact of the results.</p><p>1. While the multiple omics approach provides valuable insight, it is not entirely clear how expression data adds to what is already known regarding ARGs in the environment and how this expression information sheds new light on the resistome or can be &quot;crucial for monitoring human health conditions&quot; (L412). In this respect it would have been good to see if their findings on ARGs segregating between phages and plasmids correlate with what is known about resistances, at least in the relevant taxa (eg, L 288-9).</p><p>2. Since the results are based on assembled data (L 158), the authors should provide additional and sufficient information regarding these assemblies and how they can be confident of taxa identification to the species level (such as the ESKAPEE group) and the linkage of ARGs to particular microorganisms. This is important, given that much of the analysis and ensuing conclusions are based on linkage of ARGs and MGEs to particular taxa. It would also be important to know how they managed to precisely map expression data to these MGEs and not to chromosomal loci and if perhaps this could also explain some of the discrepancies observed (eg, L397-8).</p><p>3. It seems that about 18% of all ARGs are associated with MGEs, yet no additional mention is made of the remaining genes, which presumably are chromosomal. Please clarify this in the document and also indicate how this could affect the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.</p><p>4. It is intriguing that they observe high levels of peptide resistance in their metatranscriptome (L146) associated with resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is not a major contributor in the community and the gene was apparently not abundant in their metagenomic analysis. This discrepancy is not fully addressed and is relevant because it can also reflect biases in the approach or conditions of the sites being analyzed.</p><p>5. It seems that the majority of markers are associated with abundant taxa, which is to be expected, but it is not clear if this is the reason why the authors hypothesize that the majority of ARGs would be in the major taxon M. parvicella (L169 and L175) or why these ARGs would confer fitness advantage (L184), unless of course this correlates with antibiotics present, which was not determined.</p><p>6. The document can also benefit from revision of the text, particularly the discussion, to clarify some claims and make the document easier to follow. There are some statements that do not accurately reflect either the scope of the work or the results obtained. Some of these include:</p><p>L79 – why would ARGs and sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations (which should not be lethal) promote HGT?</p><p>L 96 – They do not really shed light on &quot;the evolution&quot; and at best suggest dissemination differences.</p><p>L102 – The analysis suggests but does not necessarily &quot;demonstrate&quot; that MGEs are important drivers of AMR dissemination. In addition, it does not necessarily follow that &quot;assessing the activity of the ARGs&quot; can lead to understanding the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>L186 – why population sizes? Did you actually look at association with the size?</p><p>L192 – Is this figure 3a?</p><p>On L202 it says that they &quot;assessed the acquisition and dissemination of AMR&quot;. The data shows only associations, which is not necessarily acquisition and at best hints at modes of dissemination.</p><p>L292-94- the findings indicate but are not themselves a threat or have potential for dissemination. Please correct.</p><p>L296 – it does not seem that the proteomics validated transcriptomics data, but rather are more of a complementary analysis (L298). Likewise, on L416- It does not seem that proteomics data validated the abundance and expression findings.</p><p>L413 and 438 – Monitoring based on sequence analysis is based on comparisons using known data and therefore it would be difficult to detect undescribed or novel mechanisms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this paper, de Nies and colleagues reanalyse their previously released, ground-breaking multi-omics time series dataset collected from a wastewater treatment plant microbial community over a 14 month period (with 51 sampling days), with the aim of exploring the type and diversity of AMR-related genes present in this microbial community, the type of mobile genetic element they are associated with (plasmid or phage), their association with microbial groups and the nature of their temporal dynamics.</p><p>This work holds strong interest and utility for workers in the areas of antimicrobial resistance and One Health, and, more broadly, for our understanding the nature of the interconnections between human and natural ecosystems.</p><p>The starting point is the metagenome assemblies constructed from the collected nucleic acid sequence datasets, and from which contigs form the units of analysis. The analysis is organised around classifying AMR related genes within contig sequences, with particular reference to distinguishing between the type of mobile genetic element (MGE) that harbour them, namely either plasmids or bacteriophage/prophages (assumed to be incorporated into a host genome via transduction).

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work aims to provide a broad view of antimicrobial resistance determinants in a wastewater treatment plant by conducting a multi-omics approach on samples taken over 1.5 years. The use of several omics approaches and the distinction of markers associated with either phages or plasmids in the system represent strengths of the study. However, the lack of clarity and methodological details weaken the interpretation and impact of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the reviewer’s appreciation of the strength of the study as well as their concerns regarding the lack of clarity and methodological details. To address these concerns, we have included additional information on the methodology. We have also thoroughly revised the manuscript to improve clarity as described in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. While the multiple omics approach provides valuable insight, it is not entirely clear how expression data adds to what is already known regarding ARGs in the environment and how this expression information sheds new light on the resistome or can be &quot;crucial for monitoring human health conditions&quot; (L412). In this respect it would have been good to see if their findings on ARGs segregating between phages and plasmids correlate with what is known about resistances, at least in the relevant taxa (eg, L 288-9).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Although metagenomics is useful to characterize the resistome, it does not provide information regarding the actual expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). In contrast, metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics identifies the ARGs encoded in the metagenome that are actively expressed within the community. For instance, expression indicates that the relevant ARGs are actively expressed as the organisms are exposed to the corresponding antibiotics. As such, linked with metagenomic data, metatranscriptomic data provides a taxonomic, genomic and functional overview of the BWWTP resistome. Thereby potentially reflecting the presence of ARGs in the general human population, as well as the further dissemination in the receiving environment. Moreover, metatranscriptomic data, in addition to metagenomic data, provides essential additional perspectives not only of the short-term adaptation to existing environmental conditions but also regarding selective pressures shaping the resistome.</p><p>Regarding the segregation of ARGs according to MGE, while to our knowledge no other study has assessed the differential contribution of MGEs to the dissemination of AMR, various studies have investigated the dissemination of AMR by MGEs in clinically relevant taxa. For instance, correlating with our findings a study by Gupta <italic>et al.</italic> (PMID: 23734150) found that phages are associated with aminoglycoside resistance, among others, in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. Additionally, analogous to our findings, they found that plasmid encoded resistance is heavily associated with pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, E. kobie</italic> and <italic>E. hormaeche.</italic> This has been further highlighted in lines 381-384 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Since the results are based on assembled data (L 158), the authors should provide additional and sufficient information regarding these assemblies and how they can be confident of taxa identification to the species level (such as the ESKAPEE group) and the linkage of ARGs to particular microorganisms. This is important, given that much of the analysis and ensuing conclusions are based on linkage of ARGs and MGEs to particular taxa. It would also be important to know how they managed to precisely map expression data to these MGEs and not to chromosomal loci and if perhaps this could also explain some of the discrepancies observed (eg, L397-8).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. Based on this comment, we have restructured and included additional information regarding the methodology in the revised manuscript (lines 457-514). Additionally, we have included an additional figure representing a schematic overview of the methods used (Figure 8).</p><p>With respect to the reviewer’s first point relating to this comment, both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were preprocessed and assembled using the Integrated Meta-omic Pipeline (IMP v1.3; available at https://r3lab.uni.lu/web/imp/, PMID: 27986083). Specifically, during processing Illumina Truseq2 adapters were trimmed, and reads of human origin were filtered out, which was followed by a de novo assembly using MEGAHIT (v1.2). For the assembly, both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were co-assembled to increase the contiguity of the assemblies (lines 465-472, in the revised manuscript), in an iterative process to optimize read usage (PMID: 27986083).</p><p>The contig-based assembly file was then used as input for the taxonomic classification system Kraken2 which subsequently assigned the bacterial taxonomy, including where relevant the ESKAPEE group, to each contig. To ensure high levels of confidence in taxonomic classification, stringent cutoffs such as a minimum 70% identity of the contig with the database, across 90% of the contig length was used. Since the same contig-based assembly file was used as input for PathoFact, and as such for the prediction of antimicrobial resistance genes and mobile genetic elements, functional- and taxonomic- annotations were linked based on the contig they originated from (lines 487-496, in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Finally, to calculate the gene copy number and transcriptome expression, both the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were independently mapped to the assembly files. The tool FeatureCount was then used to extract the raw read counts per contig as well as per individual ORF, as provided by PathoFact (lines 511-514). By using the above-described stringent methods and based on an identical approach in our previous (peer-reviewed) publications (PMIDs: 33597026, 35484157, DOI: 10.1038), we were able to precisely map the expression data to MGEs, including those distinct from the chromosomal loci, with high levels of confidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It seems that about 18% of all ARGs are associated with MGEs, yet no additional mention is made of the remaining genes, which presumably are chromosomal. Please clarify this in the document and also indicate how this could affect the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting that the remaining resistance genes are found encoded on the bacterial chromosome and have expanded on this in the revised manuscript (lines 226-228).</p><p>Regarding the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, these are not affected at all given that all expressed genes and proteins are taken into account (i.e. both chromosomal and MGE-derived genes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is intriguing that they observe high levels of peptide resistance in their metatranscriptome (L146) associated with resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which is not a major contributor in the community and the gene was apparently not abundant in their metagenomic analysis. This discrepancy is not fully addressed and is relevant because it can also reflect biases in the approach or conditions of the sites being analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for picking up on this point. While resistance against the peptide antibiotic microcin J25 mediated by YojI has first been described in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we found this resistance gene to be widely distributed among Comamonadaceae members, among others, which are major members in the community. We have now adjusted the manuscript to reflect this fact in lines 149153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It seems that the majority of markers are associated with abundant taxa, which is to be expected, but it is not clear if this is the reason why the authors hypothesize that the majority of ARGs would be in the major taxon M. parvicella (L169 and L175) or why these ARGs would confer fitness advantage (L184), unless of course this correlates with antibiotics present, which was not determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. <italic>M. parvicella</italic> generally, as confirmed in previous studies, is found to be the major taxon of the studied wastewater microbial community (PMID: 25424998, 33077707, 28721231). While the mechanisms underlying the abundance of this taxon are numerous, we hypothesized that their success within the WWTP microbial community may also be driven by an increased abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes. Owing to the nature of the sample, i.e. wastewater derived from commercial and anthropogenic influences, we posited that the relatively higher abundance of <italic>M. parvicella</italic> may be driven by the presence of several ARGs, which are likely to be introduced into the WWTP via the intake system. This is further underlined by the expression levels of ARGs encoded by <italic>M. parvicella</italic> indicating a fitness advantage and, thus, allowing it to thrive in the general antibiotic rich environment of a wastewater treatment plant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The document can also benefit from revision of the text, particularly the discussion, to clarify some claims and make the document easier to follow. There are some statements that do not accurately reflect either the scope of the work or the results obtained. Some of these include:</p><p>L79 – why would ARGs and sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations (which should not be lethal) promote HGT?</p></disp-quote><p>Various studies have reported both the development of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms as well as the selection of resistant strains (as cited in the manuscript: PMID: 27029295, 20159551, 14506034 and 7726525). Furthermore, there has been further evidence suggesting that subinhibitory concentrations may significantly increase the frequency of dissemination of many types of MGEs (PMID: 21845185, 3710955, 3343220 and 18359835).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L 96 – They do not really shed light on &quot;the evolution&quot; and at best suggest dissemination differences.</p></disp-quote><p>The passage has been rephrased as suggested by the reviewer (line 96).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L102 – The analysis suggests but does not necessarily &quot;demonstrate&quot; that MGEs are important drivers of AMR dissemination.

However, we agree with the reviewer that the metaproteomic analysis should be seen more as a complementary analysis than validation and have revised the section as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L413 and 438 – Monitoring based on sequence analysis is based on comparisons using known data and therefore it would be difficult to detect undescribed or novel mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>As correctly noted by the reviewer, sequence analysis is based on known data and the corresponding databases. Although using machine learning based searches allows us to identify homologs of known antimicrobial resistance genes and mechanisms with current methods, it is still difficult to detect completely novel mechanisms. However, these methods allow for the early detection of mechanisms novel to a specific microbial reservoir. For example, the identified resistance gene <italic>Yoji</italic>, was already reported as a resistance mechanism against microcin J25 in 2005. Nevertheless, resistance was expected to be rare and microcin J25 has even recently been investigated as a potential new commercial antibiotic. Yet, within our BWWTP we not only identified the presence of <italic>Yoji</italic>, heretofore unknown in BWTTPs, we also identified high expression levels of this resistance mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this paper, de Nies and colleagues reanalyse their previously released, ground-breaking multi-omics time series dataset collected from a wastewater treatment plant microbial community over a 14 month period (with 51 sampling days), with the aim of exploring the type and diversity of AMR-related genes present in this microbial community, the type of mobile genetic element they are associated with (plasmid or phage), their association with microbial groups and the nature of their temporal dynamics.</p><p>This work holds strong interest and utility for workers in the areas of antimicrobial resistance and One Health, and, more broadly, for our understanding the nature of the interconnections between human and natural ecosystems.</p><p>The starting point is the metagenome assemblies constructed from the collected nucleic acid sequence datasets, and from which contigs form the units of analysis. The analysis is organised around classifying AMR related genes within contig sequences, with particular reference to distinguishing between the type of mobile genetic element (MGE) that harbour them, namely either plasmids or bacteriophage/prophages (assumed to be incorporated into a host genome via transduction). While there are definitive strengths of using the contig-level analysis, I feel far more detail could be provided in the methods description to convince the reader of the validity of the analysis, particularly in relation to drawing associations between MGE sequences and host microbial groups.

(line 466).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. For the assembly, both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were indeed co-assembled, i.e. assembled together, to increase the contiguity of the assemblies and enhance read usage (PMID: 27986083). Specifically, both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic reads were processed and assembled together in a single set of contigs using the Integrated Meta-omic Pipeline (IMP v1.3; available at https://r3lab.uni.lu/web/imp/). This has been extensively described in the article describing the IMP workflow (PMID: 27986083). However, to clarify this further as pointed out by the reviewer, we have expanded lines 468-473, in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, a critical part of the methodology relates to the annotation of MGE sequences, and the inference of association between MGE sequences and bacterial groups; however.

As detailed in our response to comment 1.X. by reviewer 1, we have now provided much more methodological details in the revised manuscript. As indicated by the reviewer, PathoFact does indeed predict whether a contig arises, if classifiable, from either a plasmid or a phage through application of three different prediction methods (PlasFlow, DeepVirFinder and VirSorter). Subsequently, the bacterial taxonomy, such as the ESKAPEE pathogens, are assigned, as highlighted by the reviewer using the taxonomic classification system Kraken2. To ensure confidence in taxonomic classification, stringent cutoffs such as a minimum 70% identity of the contig with the database, across 90% of the contig length was used (lines 487-496). As per the reviewer’s suggestion, and as described in Comment 1.3, to clarify the linkage of different sources of data, a schematic diagram (Supp. Figure 9) has been added to the revised manuscript.</p><p>We would further like to clarify that though several tools exist for the identification of plasmids and/or phages, for example: metaplasmidspades, PlasFlow, DeepVirFinder and VIBRANT; tools for comprehensively identifying the respective bacterial hosts for MGEs do not exist. Simultaneously, the hosts for phages can be determined based on classification and linking of CRISPR and Spacer sequences between bacterial and phage sequences, respectively. Since most tools, i.e. SpacePHARER and PHIST, limit this analysis to high-quality viral sequences thus precluding a large fraction of putative identified phages; we did not pursue this approach. The hosts of plasmids, on the other hand, due to the competence of plasmids (e.g. self-replication, broad host range) the precise nature of plasmid ranges are difficult to identify. Therefore, to streamline this process, we used taxonomic associations as a means of linking bacteria with MGEs, given the stringent filtering/identification criteria used. Since we already used stringent cutoffs for plasmid/phage predictions, the original MGE predictions from PathoFact were used asis. This was followed by the taxonomic classification using Kraken2. We have now further clarified these points in the revised manuscripts in lines 493-514.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>Figure 1.

Meanwhile, lowly abundant AMR categories such as bicyclomycin resistance were found only sporadically within the BWWTP, indicating an association between AMR abundance and prevalence throughout time. However, one should also note the identified exceptions such as fosfomycin resistance, which, although less abundant, was found to be present across all timepoints, demonstrating that even lowly abundant AMR categories may still be prevalent over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 158 &quot;assemblies&quot;.

Additionally, we used edges with correlation values of greater than 0.6 correcting for multiple testing where the adjusted p-value &lt;0.05.

Where are the data that support the genomic &quot;backbone&quot; of these pathogens are detectable in this dataset? Also relevant for Figure 5C. The lack of protein level expression signals (line 316) from these organisms may also be a relevant observation in relation to this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As highlighted in our response to comments 1.2 and 2.2 above, the genomic backbone of the pathogens was based on taxonomic classifications of the contigs using stringent cutoffs. We have now included said data, i.e. taxonomic classification of pathogens and the resistance genes they encode, within our publicly available git repository: https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/laura.denies/lao_scripts.</p><p>With respect to the protein level expression, we agree that an overall lack of protein expression is relevant, and therefore now discuss this in detail in the Discussion section in lines 430-433. In this context, there are many factors which affect the detection of proteins, not least the presence of proteases in the WWTP environment. In some cases, the proteins secreted may act as lytic molecules or potentially even degraded. Dreyer <italic>et al.</italic> (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-478439) reported the proteolytic degradation of bacteriocins, positing the possibility that some of the proteins may be undetectable due to technical reasons. The revised discussion now includes details reflecting these circumstances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 222. &quot;…we found that plasmids contributed to an average of 10.8% of all ARGs, while phage contributed to an average of 6.8% of all resistance genes, confirming the general hypothesis that conjugation has the greatest influence on the dissemination of ARGs&quot;. Where is the statistical support for this conclusion? Do you think the effect size is scientifically significant?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We found the contribution of plasmids contributing to AMR significantly increased compared to phages (p-value &lt;0.05, Two-way ANOVA) and have updated the revised manuscript with the required statistical support (lines 228233).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 235.

The resolution appears to have increased but the nodes with long annotations are extremely difficult to read, as are the overlapping labels. I don't think it is unreasonable to say that this figure in its present form is not suitable for publication. Have you considered a heatmap (of the adjacency matrix) as an alternative?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns regarding Figure 2c. We have considered a heatmap of the adjacency matrix as an alternative, but this resulted in the loss of information provided by the clusters as observed in the network. However, we have revised the original network and adjusted the long annotations as well as the overlapping labels to improve readability. ARGs have been color coded by the corresponding AMR category, with further information regarding specific ARGs provided in a supplementary adjacency matrix (https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/laura.denies/lao_scripts//tree/master/Data). Additionally, the fonts and size of the taxa annotations have been adjusted to improve readability. These adjustments should address the reviewer’s concerns regarding this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments 2.12</p><p>Firstly I do not see how these tests can be described a two-way ANOVA, given there appears to be only one factor that is tested e.g. phage vs plasmid. Can you confirm that multiple testing has been performed using the total number of tests: that is, the number of ARG categories, encoded (Figure 4) or expressed (Figure 5)? In terms of visualisation, some of the horizontal &quot;significance bars&quot; are solid at both ends, while some show some kind of directionality. Can you clarify what these each mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting these points. Regarding the two-way ANOVA, the different ARG categories were taken into account as an additional factor. More specifically, in the metagenomic data, a total of 28 ARG categories were tested, of which 6 (aminoglycoside, bacitracin, fosfomycin, MLS, peptide and sulfonamide resistance) were significantly differentially encoded on phages in comparison to plasmids. In the metatranscriptomic data, the same 28 ARG categories were tested of which 6 (aminoglycoside, bacitracin, glycopeptide, mupirocin, peptide and sulfonamide resistance) were significantly differentially expressed on phages versus plasmids. We have clarified this further in the text by further elaborating on the description of the statistical analyses (lines 242-244 and lines 584-586).</p><p>Regarding the visualizations, the bars indicating significance should be straight and solid at both ends. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this artifact. We have fixed it in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this revised version the authors have done a good job of addressing the reviewers' various concerns, such as rephrasing some claims and including additional needed methodological information and statistical support. As consequence, the manuscript and their interpretation of the results are clearer. There are still some small points to be addressed for further clarification of the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their appreciation of the revised manuscript. Please see below our responses to the remaining comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Despite making it clear in the rebuttal that sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations can in fact induce HGT, the same does not apply (as far as I know and despite the references shown) for ARGs. Resistant genes can be selected as a consequence of a particular pressure, but I see no indication that these genes actually &quot;facilitate HGT of ARGs into new hosts&quot; as is suggested in the text (L79). Please revise.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point and appreciate their concern. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can induce HGT as well as select for genes conferring resistance and/or induce resistant mutations (PMID: 26925045). Additionally, as shown by Datta and Hughes (PMID: 6316165), selection pressures may alter HGT processes, increasing the number of resistance elements which reside on mobile DNA, thereby indirectly facilitating the transmission of said resistance elements to new hosts. However, we appreciate the reviewer’s concerns and have revised the manuscript to clarify and elaborate on these aspects (lines 78-83).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is there a possible explanation for the fact that, for example, there were no markers associated with plasmids (or very few) in Salmonella, even though plasmids are in fact associated with ARGs? It might also be relevant to mention possible limitations of this approach (as in any approach) since this might help researchers in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. While <italic>Salmonella</italic> was identified throughout the time series in the BWWTP, the overall levels of detection for this genus were quite low (relative abundance of 0.01-0.02%). In addition, resistance genes encoded on the <italic>Salmonella</italic> genome were only observed at 5 timepoints, which may be related to the low abundances within this BWWTP. This may also be the reason that, any resistance-encoding plasmids associated with <italic>Salmonella</italic> were undetected.</p><p>As highlighted by the reviewer in comment #3 (below), there are Hi-C based methods which provide the capacity to link MGEs and hosts during sample preparations and subsequent sequencing (PMID: 19815776 and https://doi.org/10.1101/198713). We have now included this aspect in the Discussion in lines 410-418. Other methods include targeted sequencing of plasmids of interest using the methodology established by Li et al. (PMID: 29325009), which has been highlighted in the revised Discussion section in lines 402-409.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lines 496-8 mention the lack of tools to link MGEs and hosts, but the authors should look at the following reference: https://doi.org/10.1101/198713.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. While Hi-C-based methods allow capturing of inter-chromosomal junctions, such as plasmid-genome interactions, it requires a different processing of the samples prior to sequencing to induce covalent linkage among DNA molecules. As such we did not include said methods in our manuscript. However, we agree with the reviewer that Hi-C-based methods provide an important method to link MGEs and hosts and have rephrased the corresponding section accordingly (lines 410-418).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. L422 – In the response to a previous comment, the authors state that the approach can detect &quot;mechanisms novel to a specific microbial reservoir&quot;. Since this phrase was not included in the text itself, the sentence is still misleading. They should make clear that when they refer to novel mechanisms, they refer to a specific environment being studied (particularly in L422; perhaps also on L 445).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point and have now revised the paragraph as suggested (lines 439-441 and lines 465-468).</p></body></sub-article></article>
