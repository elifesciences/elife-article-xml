sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The burden of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria is greatest in young children and pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">World Health Organisation, 2019</xref>). Among women with lifelong malaria exposure, pregnant women have increased susceptibility to malaria, and complications include maternal mortality, severe maternal anemia, miscarriage and stillbirth, and impaired fetal growth or prematurity leading to low birth weight delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steketee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guyatt and Snow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moore et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moore et al., 2017b</xref>). The prevalence, intensity, and consequences of infection decline with increasing gravidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guyatt and Snow, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The susceptibility of pregnant women to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria is in part due to the ability of infected erythrocytes (IEs) to sequester in the maternal blood spaces of the placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rogerson et al., 2007</xref>), where IEs that express VAR2CSA adhere to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), a glycosaminoglycan chain on syndecan-1 expressed by the placental syncytiotrophoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salanti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ayres Pereira et al., 2016</xref>). VAR2CSA is a unique 350 kDa protein that is a member of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (<italic>Pf</italic>EMP1) family of variant surface antigens (VSA). <italic>Pf</italic>EMP1s are encoded by <italic>var</italic> genes and are composed of multiple Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains and cysteine-rich interdomain regions (CIDR). VAR2CSA has six DBL domains, with CSA adhesion being strongly associated with the DBL2 domain, which is present in the N-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doritchamou et al., 2013</xref>). Two constructs based on this region have entered clinical trials as vaccine candidates to prevent placental malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mordmüller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Antibodies to VAR2CSA, in its native form on IE or expressed as recombinant protein, develop in a parity-dependent manner, block adhesion to CSA, and opsonize IE for phagocytosis by monocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fried et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ricke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salanti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keen et al., 2007</xref>). Some studies report associations between measures of single antibody features and protection from malaria complications such as placental infection, impaired fetal growth, prematurity, or anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duffy and Fried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Staalsoe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2009</xref>). However, identifying targets and features of protective antibody responses to malaria is challenging because exposure to infection is accompanied by the production of antibody to many parasite antigens, only a fraction of which contributes to protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crompton et al., 2010</xref>). The large size and multidomain structure of VAR2CSA adds complexity to the identification of targets and features of protective immune response. In a recent systematic review, antibody responses to VAR2CSA were often correlated with exposure to placental malaria, rather than protection from infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutts et al., 2020</xref>), although some studies indicate an association between antibody to IE and protection from low birth weight in subsets of pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duffy and Fried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Staalsoe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To identify antibody responses that protect women from placental malaria, an alternative approach that examines multiple antibody features and controls for exposure may be needed. Placental malaria mostly occurs when antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 1992</xref>) leads to a parasite that has infected a pregnant woman, expressing VAR2CSA. These parasites can flourish by sequestering in the placenta in women who lack VAR2CSA-specific immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hviid, 2004</xref>). By contrast, some pregnant women with peripheral blood infection remain free of placental malaria, and we postulate that these women have antibody responses that specifically protect them against VAR2CSA and placental malaria.</p><p>Antibody measures towards the IE have traditionally focused on the quantity of bound antibodies and their ability to inhibit IE binding to CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutts et al., 2020</xref>), but there is increasing interest in how antibodies that recognize IE engage with innate immune cells and activate complement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aitken et al., 2020</xref>), which are both determined by biophysical features of the Fab and Fc regions of antibody (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold and Chung, 2018</xref>). In recent years, detailed functional and biophysical characterization of antibody responses has led to the identification of specific antibody determinants that correlate with vaccine-induced protection from HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2015</xref>), control of latent tuberculosis infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>), transplacental transfer of antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jennewein et al., 2019</xref>), and correlates of vaccine-induced protection in human malaria challenge models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suscovich et al., 2020</xref>). This approach, which has been termed systems serology, is well suited to placental malaria because there is a clear relationship between a single antigen (VAR2CSA) and a specific pathology (the sequestration of parasites in the placenta, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ataíde et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The objective of this study was develop a prognostic model using antibody features to identify women protected from placental malaria. In this prospective study, we identified features, functions, and targets of naturally acquired antibody to VAR2CSA that contribute to protection against placental malaria. Pregnant Papua New Guinean women who were participating in a trial of intermittent preventive treatment against malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unger et al., 2015</xref>) were categorized at delivery as currently uninfected, having placental malaria, or having a non-placental infection. Using plasma samples collected at enrollment in mid-pregnancy, we performed extensive profiling of antibody responses to VAR2CSA recombinant proteins and IEs expressing VAR2CSA. Machine learning techniques revealed that 6 of 169 antibody features measured mid-pregnancy were able to discriminate between women who had placental malaria and non-placental infection at delivery with high accuracy. Five of the six leading antibody features we found were related to inhibition of placental sequestration and/or opsonization for phagocytic clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Human subjects</title><p>Study participants were recruited between November 2009 and August 2012 as part of a randomized controlled trial of Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unger et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01136850">NCT01136850</ext-link>), in which pregnant women received either three courses of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP) and azithromycin or one course of SP and chloroquine. Women were recruited at 14–26 gestation weeks and followed up until delivery. All women presenting for their first antenatal visit at one of the nine participating health centers in Madang Papua New Guinea were invited to participate in the original cohort study. Exclusion criteria included a gestation of &gt;26 weeks, hemoglobin &lt;6 g/dl with symptomatic anemia, previous serious adverse reactions to the IPTp study medications, permanent disability or chronic medical conditions, known multiple pregnancy, age &lt;16 years, or known unavailability to follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unger et al., 2015</xref>. Demographic data collected at enrollment included maternal gravidity, age, residence, and bed net use. Peripheral blood collected at 14–26 gestation weeks, before initiation of IPTp, was used in the antibody assays. Peripheral blood collected at delivery was used to prepare blood smears for malaria microscopy and to extract DNA for qPCR for malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Unger et al., 2015</xref>). Placental biopsies were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Giemsa stained sections of placental biopsies were examined for malaria infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lufele et al., 2017</xref>). Women were selected for inclusion in this case-control study based on the presence of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> IEs in peripheral blood and/or placenta at delivery. Groups included women with no evidence of infection in peripheral blood by PCR or light microscopy nor on examination of placental histology at delivery (n = 50); women with active placental malaria characterized by detection of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> IEs by placental histology (n = 50); and women with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection by light microscopy and/or PCR in the peripheral blood but with no IEs detected by placental histology examination (n = 27). Sample size was based on published work that used a similar approach to investigate antibody responses to infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>); in addition, sample size for the non-placental infection group was also limited by sample availability as few women met the criteria for inclusion. All clinical data were collected, and grouping of women by outcome was completed prior to measurements of antibody features included in the model. The three groups were frequency matched for primigravidity, IPTp regime receipt, bed net use, rural residency, and age.

Multivariate imputations by chained equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011</xref>) with predictive mean matching was used to impute any missing values (0.82% of observations). The imputation process was repeated five times, and the median of the imputed values across the five generated imputed datasets was finally used for each missing value. An elastic net-regularized logistic regression (ENLR) model was initially used to identify the subset of antibody features that best discriminate between the pregnant women with non-placental infection and women with placental infection. Elastic net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zou and Hastie, 2005</xref>) allows to attain sparsity (keeping only a small subset of important variables), but unlike the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalization, groups of highly correlated important variables can as well be selected (a property of ridge regression). The parameter α, which alters the nature of penalization between ridge regression and LASSO, was set to 0.5 to achieve a balance between sparsity and group selection; the final selected antibody features did not alter when <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was varied over [0, 1], as detailed below. We used a resampling approach in which the ENLR model was repeatedly fitted to subsets of data, as used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gunn et al., 2018</xref>. This provided a means to take account of the uncertainty in the feature selection by ENLR and identify the features that are consistently selected when the model is fitted to different resampled data. The selection stability of an antibody feature was defined as the proportion of times that it was picked in the selected set of important features by elastic net when the model was repeatedly fitted to 50,000 resampled subsets of data (5000 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation). In each of the 5000 repetitions, the dataset was divided into 10-folds, of which 9-folds were used to perform an inner 10-fold cross-validation to find the best value of λ (shrinkage parameter) that maximizes the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and in turn select the antibody features; using other performance measures such as binomial deviance gave the same ranking of the features according to selection frequencies. In each resampling iteration, the majority group (50 women with placental malaria) was downsampled to have an equal number of observations in both groups, thus avoiding overfitting the model to the majority group.

Importantly, four of the six antibody features were significantly higher in the non-placental infection cohort (p≤0.013), and the remaining two features trended to be higher in the non-placental cohort (p≤0.064).

Distinct clustering of some antibody features was apparent; for example, IgA1, IgA2, IgG4, and IgM to recombinant DBL domains formed four distinct clusters. Similar functions sometimes also clustered together (e.g., primary monocyte and THP1 cell phagocytosis of DBL domain-coated beads). Multiplex measurement of IgG, IgG1, IgG3, and ability of antibody to bind FcyRs and C1q for all the different DBLs formed one large cluster, highlighting the collinearity of many of the antibody features measured towards recombinant proteins.

This indicated that there are multiple mechanisms for antibodies to confer protection. To investigate this further, we constructed a heat map of the Z-score of each feature against individual women and compared the groups with non-placental infection and placental malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Looking at just the three functional measures, 52% of women with non-placental infection had elevated antibodies (a Z-score &gt;0) that both promoted IE phagocytosis by THP-1 cells and/or neutrophils and inhibited binding of IE to CSA, compared to 18% of women with placental malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Distribution of antibody features in women with non-placental infection (NPI) and placental malaria (PM).</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Levels of each of the selected antibody features in individual women in the two groups (<bold>G</bold>) No single antibody feature was present in all individuals with NPI (or was absent in all those with PM).

The combination of a prospective study design and a systems serology approach provided an unbiased way to identify the key features of the antibody response to VAR2CSA that mediates protection. Using this approach, we identified six antibody features of 169 tested, which were able to correctly differentiate, on average, 86% of the pregnant women with placental malaria and non-placental infection. The antibody features identified fell into broad functional groups: antibody that blocks placental binding of IEs and opsonizing antibody that result in phagocytic clearance of IEs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> for a schematic of mechanisms of protection of the six selected antibody features).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The six selected antibody features may protect women from placental malaria by (<bold>A</bold>) inhibiting infected red blood cells from binding chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and sequestering in the placenta and/or (<bold>B</bold>) promoting phagocytosis of infected red blood cells by monocytes and/or neutrophils.</title><p>Selected features that may inhibit placental sequestration include IgG3 to the whole infected red blood cell and IgG3 and IgA2 to VAR2CSA's CSA binding domain DBL2.

We frequency matched groups on participant characteristics such as gravidity and urban or rural residence to minimize confounding by these variables that are known to affect exposure and immunity. Antibody features at enrollment did not differ between women with placental malaria and those who were uninfected at delivery, but they did differ between infected women with and without placental malaria at delivery.</p><p>Unlike previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitken et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fried et al., 2018</xref>), the inclusion of an infected group without placental malaria allowed us to accurately control for exposure to the parasite at the time point of outcome. The lack of differences in antibody features between the non-infected and placental malaria groups was quite striking and mirrors previous observations (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutts et al., 2020</xref>). It may in part be attributable to the heterogeneous nature of the non-infected group, which probably includes both women who are exposed but protected by antibody and women who have not been exposed to malaria in pregnancy and therefore lack pregnancy-specific antibodies. It is possible that the non-infected group is protected by antibodies towards other antigens. That differences were seen only when comparing the two infected groups, clearly highlighting the importance for controlling for exposure when studying antibody responses and protection from malaria. In Cameroon, multigravid women studied in early pregnancy who did not go on to have placental malaria had a greater breadth and intensity of antibody responses to DBL domains than those with placental malaria at delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tutterrow et al., 2012</xref>), and higher avidity antibodies to full-length VAR2CSA, suggesting that a broad, high-affinity IgG response to DBL proteins may also correlate with protection.</p><p>In this study, fitting the ENLR model to resampled subsets of data allowed us to rank antibody features by their selection frequency. We generated a ranking of the 20 most frequently selected features, and then used PLSDA to determine a minimal set of antibody features that classify the pregnant women with a high accuracy. These six features were selected by ENLR more than 70% of the time, and the inclusion of these six features in the PLSDA showed an ability to accurately distinguish 86% of the women in the two groups. Notably this ability to distinguish the two groups did not increase if more than six features were included in the model. The six antibody features that best distinguished the groups were all more common in women with non-placental infection, and they included previously identified and novel responses.</p><p>Among the features we identified as associated with protection against placental malaria were adhesion inhibition and cytophilic antibodies that mediate ADCP of IE. The ability to block IE binding to CSA has been associated with protection against placental malaria, maternal anemia, low birth weight, or prematurity in subsets of pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duffy and Fried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ndam et al., 2015</xref>). IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses to VAR2CSA are dominant and mediate opsonic clearance of IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tebo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Megnekou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Keen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Damelang et al., 2019</xref>). ADCP using THP-1 cells has been correlated with protection from malaria or its complications in pregnant women and in adults (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Teo et al., 2016</xref>). ADNP of IE, which has not previously been systematically studied in malaria immunity, also correlated with placental infection status. Antibodies that block adhesion and mediate ADCP by THP-1 cells or ADNP are important correlates of protection that should be included in future studies of naturally acquired and vaccine-induced antibody to malaria in pregnancy.</p><p>Although only 11% of features measured antibody to IE, four of the six top antibody features involved assays using IE. Similarly, both features towards recombinant proteins involved the DBL2 domain, which is the principal DBL domain involved in placental adhesion. The overrepresentation of both IE and DBL2 in the selected features supports the notion that antibody features directed towards functionally important targets are key to protection from placental malaria.</p><p>Novel features identified using the system serology approach include the antibody feature IgA2. Of note, IgA2 levels in serum are generally low (most serum IgA is IgA1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macpherson et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly a recent study looking for correlates of malaria protection from vaccine-induced immunity also identified IgA2 as a variable that helped predict those protected from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suscovich et al., 2020</xref>). IgA2 can elicit myeloid cell effector functions, including opsonic phagocytosis (mediated by FcαRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breedveld and van Egmond, 2019</xref>), and as it recognized the CSA binding DBL domain DBL2, it may also inhibit IE binding to CSA. However, since IgA2 levels in serum are low, we hypothesize that rather than being directly involved in protection IgA2 might instead be a marker of a protective antibody response. Further investigation of VAR2CSA-specific B cells and whether a protective response is associated with increased IgA2 is warranted.</p><p>Our analysis suggests that features determined by measuring antibody to VAR2CSA-expressing IE are important indicators of protection from placental malaria. Four features measured antibody to IE using representatives of the dominant 3D7-like and FCR3-like clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benavente et al., 2018</xref>) whose N-terminal regions are used in two VAR2CSA-based pregnancy malaria vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mordmüller et al., 2019</xref>). While three of these four assays targeted FCR3 or the isogenic CS2 parasite line, studies of global diversity in VAR2CSA to date have included few sequences from Papua New Guinea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benavente et al., 2018</xref>), and the relative importance of immunity to specific clades may vary by region. Vaccination offered limited heterologous protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>), and it is unclear whether effective naturally acquired protective immunity needs to target multiple clades or different clades in different regions.</p><p>Antibody responses to VAR2CSA domains serve as excellent markers of exposure to malaria in pregnant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cutts et al., 2020</xref>), but few were selected as correlates of protection in our analysis. This may reflect the fact that the responses to different VARCSA domains were generally highly correlated, as revealed by their clustering together in the center of our network analysis, or it might be because of the longevity of antibody that promotes ADCP of IE compared to that of antibody responses to recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Teo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrasiri et al., 2014</xref>). Antibody to VAR2CSA recombinant proteins, and particularly to specific VAR2CSA peptides, appears to be a good correlate of exposure and transmission intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fonseca et al., 2019</xref>), but these responses appear to be less useful as correlates of protection.</p><p>The correlation network showed close correlations between different antibody responses to recombinant DBL domains (which are predominantly located in the central cluster) but the protective antibody features were dispersed, suggesting that distinct pathways contribute to the development of protection against placental malaria. The analysis of functions identified in the selected features further supports this, with most protected women (and few unprotected women) having significant antibody that promoted both binding inhibition to CSA and phagocytosis; however, no consistent pattern of antibody functions in protected women was seen. Similar associations have been seen in the relationships between antibody features and protection from viral pathogens, and there is a growing awareness that polyfunctional antibody responses, rather than a single functional correlate, contribute to protection from disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gunn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). None of the antibody features targeted more than one variant of the protein or parasite strain. One possible explanation is that epitopes recognized by antibodies mediating each function may vary between strains (as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Doritchamou et al., 2019</xref>). This could in turn mean that protective functional features could vary with different populations (as there is variation in global distribution of the different VAR2CSA domain clades; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Benavente et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies should ideally include multiple VAR2CSA clades and study diverse populations.</p><p>We used systems serology to identify protective features of the naturally acquired antibody response to VAR2CSA, a PfEMP1 variant that is specifically associated with placental malaria, complementing a recent study that used systems serology to identify functional antibody correlates of vaccine-induced immunity, in subjects vaccinated with RTS,S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suscovich et al., 2020</xref>). A systems serology approach could also be used to identify the characteristics of protective immunity to other malaria syndromes, such as cerebral malaria, which is often associated with a subset of PfEMP1s that are potential vaccine candidates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>). It will be important to determine whether protective features of the cerebral malaria-associated PfEMP1 antibody response analogous to the ones that we identified in this study can be identified.</p><p>We were interested in measuring antibodies to placental binding parasites and defined placental malaria by the detection of IE in the placenta by histology because previous studies have shown that these are the infections associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menendez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogerson et al., 2003</xref>). Ring stage parasites in the peripheral blood will circulate through the placenta, and, in some cases, these could be detected by PCR of placental blood; however, we did not consider these submicroscopic infections as placental malaria as they were not shown to be sequestering there.</p><p>Study strengths include the application of 169 novel and established assays; minimal missing predictor and no missing outcome data, the ability to control for exposure with the identification of pregnant women with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection with, and without, placental malaria; the prospective study design; and the use of native antigens on IEs to complement the data we acquired using recombinant protein. Together, this allowed us to discover the determinants of naturally acquired protective immunity. Weaknesses include the lack of inclusion of full-length VAR2CSA in our Luminex and bead-based assays, and an imbalance in numbers between women with parasitemia but no placental infection relative to the other groups. Samples from all women in the former group were selected for this study (and statistical analysis controlled for this imbalance between groups), but this group is relatively rare, with placental infection in the absence of peripheral infection being substantially more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desai et al., 2007</xref>). High levels of collinearity between some variables make it difficult to dissect out individual protective responses. Demonstration that our selected variables correlate with lack of placental malaria in other cohorts would further strengthen the findings. Antibody glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2016</xref>) is an additional feature that could be included in future studies.</p><p>The present study identified leading candidate antibody features that mediate naturally acquired protection from placental malaria and demonstrated we could use these features to identify women in this cohort protected from placental malaria with high accuracy (though this should be validated in a second cohort). Our results suggest that multiple pathways exist that lead to the development of protective immunity against placental malaria. Next steps will include validating this set of features in other sample sets from different geographical settings and also determining whether these antibody features predict protection from adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight. The immune responses identified are relevant to further development of pregnancy malaria-specific therapies such as vaccines or monoclonal antibodies and possibly to the identification of protective antibody against malaria in non-pregnant populations. Multiple antibody functions and characteristics may be required to develop robust protective immunity to placental malaria.</p><p>Dataset used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> has been uploaded to Dryad: doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.wpzgmsbkx">10.5061/dryad.wpzgmsbkx</ext-link>.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Project Grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) to SJR, EHA, and AWC (APP1143946) and to PMH and BDW (GNT1145303) and a Program Grant (APP1092789) also from the NHMRC.

directed to specific Plasmodium (malaria) antigens and the results demonstrate that these responses correlate with protection from placental malaria. The analyses of samples from approximately 200 women revealed that these antibody features do discriminate between women with placental malaria at delivery and women with malaria detectable in the peripheral blood, but not in placenta. These findings support the effort to develop vaccines against the certain protein antigens of placental malaria parasites.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identifying women protected from placental malaria using systems serology&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sidhartha Chaudhury (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Editors and reviewers have discussed your revision plan with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Your responses to the revisions as proposed by the Reviewers have, in general, been considered as sufficient for addressing their concerns.</p><p>2) However, apart from the specific critical points as indicated in the initial decision letter and which are included here once again, the revised manuscript should clearly state your definition of the primary group used to analyze correlates of protection – the &quot;non-placental infection at delivery&quot; group. At present, it appears to be defined as &quot;women with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection by light microscopy and/or PCR in the peripheral blood but with no IEs visible in the placenta by histology&quot;. This response (&quot;Line 85&quot;) leaves open whether this definition means &quot;no IEs&quot; or &quot;no mature IEs&quot; by histology. Thus, it seems that a full clear definition is missing in the manuscript, and it is not clear from your response what the planned revision includes. In addition, please indicate in Table 1 how many of the 27 women in this group were positive by microscopy versus PCR of their peripheral blood.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have conducted a systems serology study of the relationship between antibody responses to VAR2CSA and protection from placental malaria (PM) in pregnant women from Papua New Guinea.</p><p>Based on initial analysis of 130 variables and samples from 127 women (15,340 data points) and subsequent analysis of 169 variables from 77 women (12,906 data points), they identified a list of six selected serological features that discriminated with 86% accuracy between women with placental parasitaemia at delivery and women with peripheral but not placental parasitaemia at the same time point. It is an important conclusion from the work performed that it underscores the likelihood that multiple pathways to clinical protection from PM exists – a conclusion that can safely be extended to other clinical categories of malaria – and probably even to infectious diseases in general. While this may seem obvious to some, it is nevertheless largely ignored in almost all existing reports. In particular, current efforts to develop vaccines against PM are completely focussed on inhibition of adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IEs), completely ignoring the antibody effector functions that rely on opsonization of IEs for cell-mediated destruction, and which the current analysis suggest are important.</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, based on careful and in-depth analysis, and constitutes a valuable addition to the existing literature.</p><p>While I am not able to ascertain the finer points of the advanced statistical analyses conducted, I have no reason to suspect that anything is amiss.</p><p>I have only a couple of specific comments:</p><p>P. 14 (&quot;ADNP of IE… contributed to protection&quot;): I think it would be more correct to write &quot;ADNP of IE… correlated with placental infection status&quot; as no causal relationship was established.</p><p>P. 15: The authors list weaknesses of their study, which is commendable. However, they fail to mention what I consider a more prominent weakness than those listed, namely the absence of a test of their six-features-list on an independent data/sample set. While such a test would be optimal, at least it should be mentioned as a weakness if it is not done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors are the first to use systems serology to examine antibody responses associated with protection from placental malaria. They determine that functional antibodies against CSA-binding IE are associated with protection from placental malaria, in general confirming findings from earlier studies. While the consistency with earlier studies engenders confidence in their findings, it does lessen the novelty. Important aspects of the clinical study design and study cohort need better description and justification. The study would be strengthened considerably if the top features identified here were tested for their predictive capacity in a second confirmatory cohort, albeit the fact that these associations have previously been made in other studies give general confidence in the findings. Protective immunity against placental malaria increases with gravidity, and therefore the authors should report how the protective features that they identify are related to gravidity.</p><p>Abstract concludes &quot;inhibition of placental binding and/or opsonic phagocytosis of infected erythrocytes&quot; identify women who are protected from placental malaria. This is consistent with earlier studies using non-systems approaches that previously identified these associations.</p><p>Line 85 &quot;some pregnant women with peripheral blood infection remain free of placental malaria&quot; – while such cases have been sporadically described, the &quot;placental malaria-negative infection&quot; phenotype is an uncommon phenomenon in studies that carefully document placental and peripheral Pf infections, and requires better definition here. Who has used such a study design before? &quot;Placental malaria-negative&quot; can mean that mature parasites do not sequester in the placenta, but does not necessarily mean that all parasites are absent from the placenta. Practically speaking, how could peripheral ring stage parasites be excluded from circulating through the intervillous spaces at the same density they are found in the peripheral blood? Related to this, the authors should provide detailed information on the pregnancy outcomes for the women in the different groups: especially Pf quantification in peripheral blood and placental blood by microscopy and by PCR, etc, but also BW, gestational age. It may be that the &quot;PM-negative infection&quot; phenotype is related to highly sensitive detection of sparse Pf in peripheral blood by PCR versus less sensitive detection of sparse Pf in placental blood using Giemsa-stained histology (see similar comment below).</p><p>Line 108 &quot;Five of the six leading antibody features we found were related to inhibition of placental sequestration and/or opsonisation for phagocytic clearance&quot; Can the authors comment whether the same antibodies might be mediating both effects, or do they surmise they are unlikely to overlap?</p><p>Line 112 Please state briefly but clearly here how the samples/women were selected for inclusion in the cohort (in addition to the more detailed description in the Methods).</p><p>Line 115 &quot;All women resided in heavily malaria exposed areas&quot; is not consistent with the evidence provided in Table 1 that only 14/127 women had Pf detected by PCR at their baseline visit. The authors should explain this. Had these women previously received IPTp, or was this their baseline sample collected before first IPTp?</p><p>Line 119 &quot;no <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in the placenta but who had peripheral blood parasitemia by PCR and/or light microscopy&quot; This wording and the Methods section indicate peripheral blood was tested for Pf by Giemsa and PCR, but placental blood was tested by Giemsa but not PCR. This is not a fair comparison. What is the sensitivity of their PCR versus their Giemsa stained blood or tissue?</p><p>Line 142 &quot;using samples from the 127 women and measuring 13 antibody features directed at ten DBL domains, 15,340 out of 16,510 possible data points were acquired&quot;. This is an impressive dataset to examine correlates of protection.</p><p>All pregnant women in this study have received IPTp and this can affect the PM outcome at delivery. Looks like this has not been really considered in the interpretation of the data, particularly in view of the fact that two types of IPTp combinations were used, and readers are not informed of their potentially different efficacies.</p><p>Among the identified antibody features in this study it appeared that none of the activities targeted more than one variant of protein or parasite. Can the authors discuss this lack of strain-transcending pattern in these activities? A similar pattern of parasite variant dependent activity of PM antibody has previously been described by Doritchamou et al. IAI 2019. The authors should discuss their findings in that context and also comment whether the six antibody features identified in this study might vary in populations from different geographical areas.</p><p>Lines 214 – 215 &quot;… the six features identified by elastic net were spread throughout the correlation network and were not well correlated with each other (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 3)&quot;. Based on this statement it is confusing when the authors conclude that the six features fall into two major functional groups. In particular the inverse correlation between IgG3.DBL2(ID1-ID2a).FCR3 with CSA.Binding.Inhibition.FCR3 is inconsistent with Figure 6 suggesting that these represent related responses.</p><p>The authors indicated that 17 samples were Pf positive at enrolment. What is the impact of early infection on these identified antibody features in relation to protection against PM and to antibody responses?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors hypothesize that protection from placental malaria requires specific humoral immunity to malaria protein VAR2CSA. The authors obtained plasma samples from 127 pregnant women and grouped them into three categories based on malaria diagnosis at delivery: non-infected at delivery, placental malaria at delivery, and non-placental malaria at delivery. They use systems serology to measure 169 variables related to antibody binding, isotype, and functional activity and used machine learning to identify 6 variables that could accurately distinguish between placental and non-placental malaria cases. They delve into these 6 variables to provide some insight into the mechanisms of protection against placental malaria.</p><p>Strengths: The cohorts in this study are large and robust, with 50 placental and 27 non-placental cases with similar demographic profiles. They assess a wide range of serology measures for binding, isotype, isotype subclass, and functional responses against both infected erythrocyte and recombinant antigens. They find significant group-level differences in serology measures between placental and non-placental malaria groups suggesting that there is great potential in this data set to identify correlates of immunity and potential mechanisms of protection.</p><p>Weaknesses: They used a elastic network-regularized linear regression method to identify from 169 variables, the top variables that distinguish placental and non-placental malaria cases, and then use a Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis method to assess how accurately a subset of these variables could be used to predict placental malaria susceptibility. While this overall approach is reasonable, it contains a substantial risk of overfitting that is not properly assessed in the study. Overfit models produce seemingly highly accurate predictions that result from incidental/random variation in the data rather than biologically significant differences, and jeopardize the scientific conclusions of the study.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors assume that differences between the placental malaria and non-placental malaria groups reflect correlates of protection, thus justifying an exploration into mechanisms of protection. However, these two groups could reflect differences in malaria exposure, despite demographic similarities in age/residence. If correlates of protection cannot be distinguished from correlates of exposure, this limits what can be inferred about mechanisms of protection.</p><p>Appraisal: The authors conclusions rest substantially on the six variables identified through machine learning. Ultimately the study conclusions cannot be supported by the data without demonstrating that these six variables reflect biologically significant differences and do not simply arise from analysis choices and model overfitting.</p><p>1) It is important to demonstrate that malaria exposure is similar in the placental and non-placental malaria groups because a key assumption made here is that a comparison between these groups identifies correlates of protection, and not simply correlates of exposure. Indeed, the authors find that the non-placental malaria group had almost double the PCR positive rate of the placental malaria group at enrolment, suggesting it is possible they had higher exposure, despite similar demographic profiles.</p><p>One way to address this would be to take serological markers in the data that others in literature have shown to be linked to exposure, and show that there is no significant differences between the three groups with respect to these serological markers of exposure.</p><p>2) Much of the conclusions of this study rests on the outcome of the machine learning analysis, so it is critical that each step of this analysis is properly justified.</p><p>In the elastic network-regularized logistic regression (ENLR), more detail is needed to explain how correlated variables are handled. For example, why was α set to 0.50, as opposed to any other value between 0 and 1? To what degree are the findings that a small number of non-correlated variables predictive of placental malaria susceptibility simply a reflection of the analysis approach rather than the underlying biology?</p><p>3) Only three variables out of the top 20 identified by logistic regression have odds-ratios whose lower bound IQR exceeds 1.0 (Figure 2). Does this suggest the observed effects are not significant? How was it decided that 20 variables would be selected for further study?</p><p>4) In the Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), was any cross-validation done? Or was the model trained on the entire data set? PLSDA can be highly susceptible to overfitting, and cross-validation should be done to assess prediction accuracy.</p><p>Also, given the imbalance in the data set (2:1 ratio of placental to non-placental malaria cases), other measures of accuracy should be considered, such as sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's kappa value, and/or ROC AUC.</p><p>5) An assessment of the this approach (ENLR + PLSDA) in terms of its risk for overfitting must be done. Guided feature reduction (ENLR) combined with PLSDA carries a high risk of overfitting. A comparison with 6 random variables in PLSDA is not sufficient to assess overfitting because it doesn't account for the degree to which guided feature reduction (ENLR) step contributes to overfitting.</p><p>Authors should consider doing a permutation test, where the data set is randomized with respect to outcome (placental vs. non-placental malaria), and then the entire ENLR + PLSDA method is carried out to determine prediction accuracy. This can be carried out for N different permutations (for example N=100 times) to determine the average prediction accuracy for this randomized outcome. Because the outcome is randomized, it is decoupled from the immune data, and thus acts as a 'negative control' for machine learning and it should fail to predict the outcome with any accuracy greater than chance. The degree to which it does 'accurately' predict this randomized outcome is a reflection of the overfitting of the model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65776.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The revised manuscript should clearly state your definition of the primary group used to analyze correlates of protection – the &quot;non-placental infection at delivery&quot; group.

In particular, current efforts to develop vaccines against PM are completely focussed on inhibition of adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IEs), completely ignoring the antibody effector functions that rely on opsonization of IEs for cell-mediated destruction, and which the current analysis suggest are important.</p><p>The manuscript is very well written, based on careful and in-depth analysis, and constitutes a valuable addition to the existing literature.</p><p>While I am not able to ascertain the finer points of the advanced statistical analyses conducted, I have no reason to suspect that anything is amiss.</p><p>I have only a couple of specific comments:</p><p>P. 14 (&quot;ADNP of IE… contributed to protection&quot;): I think it would be more correct to write &quot;ADNP of IE… correlated with placental infection status&quot; as no causal relationship was established.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the sentence as suggested.</p><p>Line 678-680 “<italic>ADNP of IE, which has not previously been systematically studied in malaria immunity also correlated with placental infection status”P. 15: The authors list weaknesses of their study, which is commendable.

They determine that functional antibodies against CSA-binding IE are associated with protection from placental malaria, in general confirming findings from earlier studies. While the consistency with earlier studies engenders confidence in their findings, it does lessen the novelty. Important aspects of the clinical study design and study cohort need better description and justification. The study would be strengthened considerably if the top features identified here were tested for their predictive capacity in a second confirmatory cohort, albeit the fact that these associations have previously been made in other studies give general confidence in the findings. Protective immunity against placental malaria increases with gravidity, and therefore the authors should report how the protective features that they identify are related to gravidity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful comments. We have added a comment to the discussion under study weaknesses regarding the need to confirm our findings in further cohorts (Lines 760-2, 765-767), see also response to Reviewer 1. Our plans to examine responses in a second confirmatory cohort have been severely disrupted by COVID-19, especially in regard to sample shipments which have not been possible for the past 12 months.</p><p>Regarding associations of protective features and gravidity, we have conducted a univariate analysis using linear regression looking at how the antibody levels vary with gravidity in our cohort and have added this to the paper in the form of Supplementary File 4-table 1.</p><p>In brief: Antibody feature CSA.Binding.Inhibition.FCR3 was positively associated with gravidity, and there was weak evidence that THP1.Phago.CS2 and Neutrophil.Phago.CS2 were also positively associated with gravidity.

We now discuss these observations in the manuscript (lines 573-585).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract concludes &quot;inhibition of placental binding and/or opsonic phagocytosis of infected erythrocytes&quot; identify women who are protected from placental malaria.

Who has used such a study design before? &quot;Placental malaria-negative&quot; can mean that mature parasites do not sequester in the placenta, but does not necessarily mean that all parasites are absent from the placenta. Practically speaking, how could peripheral ring stage parasites be excluded from circulating through the intervillous spaces at the same density they are found in the peripheral blood? Related to this, the authors should provide detailed information on the pregnancy outcomes for the women in the different groups: especially Pf quantification in peripheral blood and placental blood by microscopy and by PCR, etc, but also BW, gestational age. It may be that the &quot;PM-negative infection&quot; phenotype is related to highly sensitive detection of sparse Pf in peripheral blood by PCR versus less sensitive detection of sparse Pf in placental blood using Giemsa-stained histology (see similar comment below).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that women with peripheral blood infection without evidence of placental sequestration form a relatively rare group, and we only identified 27 in our cohort. They are analogous to infections that are found in non-pregnant women in malarious areas. When women conceive, some of these infections progress to higher density, especially in younger, less immune women (Ndam et al. Clin Infect Dis 2018; Hounkonnou et al. Clin Infect Dis 2020), likely due to emergence of variants than can sequester in the placenta and avoid existing antibody immunity.</p><p>Previous studies (reviewed by Cutts et al., BMC Med 2020) highlight the difficulty of distinguishing effects of exposure from those of immunity using the more common comparison of women with and without placental malaria, which was also not informative in our hands (Figure 1 a), compared to our novel inclusion of this additional group (Figure 1 b).</p><p>The reason we (and many other studies) use detection of IEs in the placenta by histology to define placental malaria, is because many studies show that these infections are associated with worse pregnancy outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight or maternal anemia (Menendez C et al., J Infect Dis 2000; Rogerson SJ et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg 2003). Identifying women whose infection has not progressed to placental malaria, and the antibody responses that might limit that progression by inhibiting placental sequestration, is our specific aim.</p><p>The circulating ring stage parasites will pass through the placenta although they do not sequester there, and placental blood PCR did detect them in some women (added to Table 1). These circulating rings are understood not to have any deleterious effects on the placenta, and submicroscopic infections, including in placental blood, appear to be only weakly associated with adverse birth outcomes, unlike active placental infection on histology.</p><p>We have included further information as requested on the pregnancy outcomes, including BW, hemoglobin and gestational age at delivery and peripheral and placental PCR in Table 1. Original groupings of the cohorts were not done using placental PCR, however subsequent analysis revealed that one individual classified as non-infected (which was based on PCR and light microscopy of peripheral blood as well as placental histology) was actually PCR positive in the placental blood. As our analysis identifying protective features did not include the non-infected cohorts, this individual’s results do not affect the conclusions in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 108 &quot;Five of the six leading antibody features we found were related to inhibition of placental sequestration and/or opsonisation for phagocytic clearance&quot; Can the authors comment whether the same antibodies might be mediating both effects, or do they surmise they are unlikely to overlap?</p></disp-quote><p>The diversity of responses in “protected” women in Figure 5G suggests that these often do not overlap, or the overlap is heterogenous in different women. However, determining whether individual antibodies have overlapping functions would ideally require monoclonals and therefore we cannot confidently comment on whether the same antibody might be able to mediate both functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 112 Please state briefly but clearly here how the samples/women were selected for inclusion in the cohort (in addition to the more detailed description in the Methods).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, in addition to the detailed description in the methods, we have briefly described the selection of the cohort in the Results section (which now follows methods, as requested by the Editors), see below:</p><p>LINE 467 onwards: “Women were selected based on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection status at delivery […] The three groups were frequency matched for primigravidity, IPTp regime receipt, bed net use, rural residency and age”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 115 &quot;All women resided in heavily malaria exposed areas&quot; is not consistent with the evidence provided in Table 1 that only 14/127 women had Pf detected by PCR at their baseline visit.

This is not a fair comparison. What is the sensitivity of their PCR versus their Giemsa stained blood or tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>See our earlier response to line 85. We specifically grouped women with malaria infection into those with and without placental malaria on histology, as classically defined (Walter Am J Path 1982; Bulmer, Histopathology 1993). Our question was, are there antibody responses that might explain why some infected women have not progressed to placental malaria, when others have. Antibody responses that prevent infection crossing a threshold (to symptomatic infection, to placental infection or to severe disease) are more relevant to blood stage immunity than antibodies that simply prevent infection, as may be sought for pre-erythrocytic infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 142 &quot;using samples from the 127 women and measuring 13 antibody features directed at ten DBL domains, 15,340 out of 16,510 possible data points were acquired&quot;.

Can the authors discuss this lack of strain-transcending pattern in these activities? A similar pattern of parasite variant dependent activity of PM antibody has previously been described by Doritchamou et al. IAI 2019. The authors should discuss their findings in that context and also comment whether the six antibody features identified in this study might vary in populations from different geographical areas.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have discussed our findings in relation to those described by Doritchamou et al.

One possible explanation is that epitopes recognised by antibodies mediating each function may vary between strains (as suggested by Doritchamou et al., 2019). This could in turn mean that protective functional features could vary with different populations (as there is variation in global distribution of the different VAR2CSA domain clades (Benavente et al., 2018)). Future studies should ideally include multiple VAR2CSA clades, and study diverse populations.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 214 – 215 &quot;… the six features identified by elastic net were spread throughout the correlation network and were not well correlated with each other (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 3)&quot;. Based on this statement it is confusing when the authors conclude that the six features fall into two major functional groups. In particular the inverse correlation between IgG3.DBL2(ID1-ID2a).FCR3 with CSA.Binding.Inhibition.FCR3 is inconsistent with Figure 6 suggesting that these represent related responses.</p></disp-quote><p>The broad functional mechanisms of antibody can fall into similar groups, even when the development of responses to different members of each group is only weakly correlated. As the reviewer notes, there was no correlation between IgG3.DBL2(ID1-ID2a).FCR3 with CSA.Binding.Inhibition in Figure 4 and a weak, non-significant negative correlation between them (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Although binding inhibition is likely to be primarily mediated by the more-abundant IgG1, we included IgG3 to DBL2 in both Figure 6A and Figure 6B because its principal functional role could fall in either group, as total IgG antibody to this domain is known to block adhesion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors indicated that 17 samples were Pf positive at enrolment. What is the impact of early infection on these identified antibody features in relation to protection against PM and to antibody responses?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking this important question, as it has improved the quality of the manuscript. We have now conducted a sub-analysis comparing the identified antibody features at enrolment in the non-placental infection cohort with those in the placental malaria cohort, excluding women who were infected (by light microscopy and/or PCR) at enrolment. In this sub-analysis we saw strong evidence that 4 of the 6 features were higher in the non-placental infection cohort (P≤0.013) and weak evidence that the other two features were higher in the non-placental infection cohort (≤0.064). The maintenance of the protective associations in the smaller, non-infected cohort suggests to us that the protective association seen in these variables was not greatly affected by the presence of the positive samples.</p><p>These data are included in the manuscript in Supplementary File 4 – table 2.

We measured IgG levels by ELISA to non-pregnancy specific malaria antigens merozoite surface protein-1 and schizont extract which we have previously shown to be strongly associated with exposure (Barua 2019 Malaria Journal) and have done univariate analyses comparing non-infected v placental malaria and non-placental infection v placental malaria.

Here we are repeating ENLR, resampling from the dataset 50,000 times, and therefore, the estimated coefficient for every variable is zero in a certain proportion of resampled datasets (even though a variable may frequently be selected in a high proportion of the resampled datasets). This pushes the lower bounds of the IQRs towards zero, hence lower bound of odds ratio will be very close to 1 for many of the variables.

Because the outcome is randomized, it is decoupled from the immune data, and thus acts as a 'negative control' for machine learning and it should fail to predict the outcome with any accuracy greater than chance.
