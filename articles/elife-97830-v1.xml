Given the unique metabolic challenges and poor glucose regulatory capacity of preterm infants, their glucose intake during infection may have a high impact on the degree of metabolism dysregulation and organ damage. Using a preterm pig model of neonatal sepsis, we previously showed that a drastic restriction in glucose supply during infection protects against sepsis via suppression of glycolysis-induced inflammation, but results in severe hypoglycemia. Now we explored clinically relevant options for reducing glucose intake to decrease sepsis risk, without causing hypoglycemia and further explore the involvement of the liver in these protective effects. We found that a reduced glucose regime during infection increased survival via reduced pro-inflammatory response, while maintaining normoglycemia. Mechanistically, this intervention enhanced hepatic oxidative phosphorylation and possibly gluconeogenesis, and dampened both circulating and hepatic inflammation. However, switching from a high to a reduced glucose supply after the debut of clinical symptoms did not prevent sepsis, suggesting metabolic conditions at the start of infection are key in driving the outcome. Finally, an early therapy with purified human inter-alpha inhibitor protein, a liver-derived anti-inflammatory protein, partially reversed the effects of low parenteral glucose provision, likely by inhibiting neutrophil functions that mediate pathogen clearance. Our findings suggest a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose supply for infected preterm infants could prevent or delay the development of sepsis in vulnerable neonates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Newborn babies, especially those born prematurely, are highly vulnerable to infections. This can then lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition where the immune system overreacts to an infection and damages organs. Immune cells are fueled by nutrients, especially glucose (sugar), when they help defend the body against dangerous microorganisms. Therefore, high blood glucose levels can heighten the risk that these infection responses become too powerful and harm the body. However, too little glucose can also result in low blood sugar levels which can cause brain damage. This represents a key challenge in neonatal care, especially for babies which cannot be fed by mouth and therefore require nutrients to be delivered directly to their bloodstream (parenteral nutrition). Infants also struggle to regulate blood sugar levels on their own, which affects their response to infection.</p><p>The liver plays a major role in both immune responses and in converting nutrients into energy forms that our body can use. Adjusting glucose intake may influence how the liver generates energy and, in turn, prevent premature babies from developing sepsis.</p><p>To address this question, Bæk, Muk et al. infused premature piglets with parenteral nutrition containing different levels of glucose, starting shortly after birth. The health of the animals was then monitored before and after being infected with a bacterium <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>, a common causative agent of infection in very preterm infants. The experiments showed that pigs that received lower levels of glucose were more likely to survive the infection than those that were given higher doses.</p><p>Despite receiving less glucose, the pigs managed to maintain their blood sugar levels within a safe range. This is because their livers compensated by shifting to using other sources of energy instead, and by manufacturing their own glucose. Further experiments found that adjusting glucose intake only protected against sepsis if the change was made early during infection, before the individual developed symptoms.</p><p>These findings suggest that adjusting the levels of glucose given to premature babies in hospital could be a simple, clinically relevant strategy to prevent sepsis. Further research is needed to explore how the liver uses alternative sources of energy to manufacture glucose and, in turn, to maintain normal blood sugar levels in infants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>preterm infant</kwd><kwd>pig</kwd><kwd>neonatal sepsis</kwd><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd><kwd>parenteral nutrition</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF22OC0078747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Duc Ninh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016469</institution-id><institution>Takeda Pharmaceuticals International</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Duc Ninh</given-names></name><name><surname>Sangild</surname><given-names>Per Torp</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reduced parenteral glucose during neonatal infection redirects hepatic metabolism to oxidative phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis, dampens systemic proinflammatory responses, and significantly enhances survival in preterm newborns.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preterm infants (born before 37 wk of gestation) are particularly susceptible to serious neonatal infections potentially leading to sepsis, a state of life-threatening organ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hibbert et al., 2018</xref>). Most episodes of late-onset sepsis in these infants (occurring &gt;48 hr after birth) are caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS), such as <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strunk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shane et al., 2017</xref>), which may enter the circulation via indwelling medical devices or from the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deitch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2018</xref>). The development of sepsis is often attributed to the immature immune systems in preterm infants, but a recent concept of immunometabolism suggests it may partly be caused by the distinct newborn metabolic state, affected by their limited energy reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harbeson et al., 2018</xref>). Upon exogenous challenge, immune cells and many other cell types in healthy adults undergo a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis, producing large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel inflammatory responses, facilitating efficient reduction of pathogen burden through immunological resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harbeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaber et al., 2017</xref>). However, immune cells can also employ a tolerance strategy, limiting the active resistance response and associated immunopathology, via an opposite shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harbeson et al., 2018</xref>). This tolerance strategy is found in newborns, especially those born prematurely, as they have low energy stores, but high demands for growth and development. Therefore, energy tends to be prioritized for vital organ functions rather than immune responses to external stimuli, explaining why they display low immune cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harbeson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kollmann et al., 2012</xref>) and can withstand 10–100 times greater pathogen loads than adults before showing clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strnad et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The liver plays a critical role during bloodstream infections, being a well-perfused organ with resident immune cells. Besides its role in producing important immunomodulatory plasma proteins, the role of hepatic metabolism during infections has recently emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strnad et al., 2017</xref>). For instance, blocking hepatic glycolysis lowers overall energy expenditure and improves OXPHOS, which facilitates immune tolerance and better survival during polymicrobial sepsis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mainali et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that manipulation of hepatic energy metabolism may affect the systemic immune responses and be a promising avenue to reduce morbidity during neonatal infections. Progression of sepsis is also concomitant with the activation of neutrophils, may lead to increased activity of neutrophil-derived serine proteases that play a key role in sepsis-related tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burg and Pillinger, 2001</xref>). Their inhibition has likewise been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to resolve septic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lord et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the components of one of the most abundant plasma protein complexes, Inter-Alpha Inhibitor Protein (IAIP), are differentially regulated during sepsis leading to a significant reduction of the whole complex both in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Opal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rucevic et al., 2007</xref>) and neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaaban et al., 2009</xref>). Administration of enriched human plasma-derived IAIP (hIAIP) in a murine model of neonatal sepsis has been shown to reduce disease severity and mortality through suppression of pro-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singh et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Due to the lack of mother’s milk and immature gut, preterm infants often receive glucose-rich parenteral nutrition (PN) during the first few weeks of life to ensure sufficient nutrition until full enteral nutrition can be established. The glucose levels are tailored to provide energy for growth and to avoid hypoglycemia-induced brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mesotten et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaedeen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). However, this practice leads to hyperglycemia in up to 80% of very preterm infants during early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beardsall et al., 2010</xref>). Prolonged glucose-rich PN is related to longer hospitalization in septic infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaedeen et al., 2006</xref>), which suggests it may affect the blood immune-metabolic axis or hepatic metabolism during infection, facilitating glycolysis and active immune resistance. This is in line with a recent study showing that limited nutrition in the acute phase of bacterial infection in rodents reduced glycolysis and enhanced disease tolerance, leading to better survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Of note, there are no specific guidelines for parenteral glucose intake during serious neonatal infections.</p><p>Preterm pigs provide a unique, prematurely born, animal model, enabling PN via an umbilical catheter and mimicking clinical and cellular infection responses to <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bæk et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunse et al., 2018</xref>), as seen in septic preterm infants similarly infected with CONS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strunk et al., 2021</xref>). With this model, we have previously shown that the high parenteral glucose supply used in neonatal intensive care units exaggerated systemic glycolysis, triggering hyper-inflammatory responses and clinical sepsis signs, whereas strict glucose restriction prevented sepsis, but caused hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muk et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we further exploited this model to explore how glucose regimes affect hepatic metabolism and glucose homeostasis to both prevent hypoglycemia and to alleviate the risk of sepsis in CONS infected preterm newborns. We identified a reduced parenteral glucose regimen that during neonatal infection both maintained normoglycemia and modulated the hepatic immune-metabolic networks in a manner that avoided excessive energy used for immune responses, leading to improved overall survival. However, postponing the reduction in glucose supply until clinical symptoms started to manifest did not affect clinical deterioration, suggesting metabolic constraints early in the immune response are critical for determining the fate. Lastly, to further explore potential optimizations of the treatment regimen, we evaluated concomitant treatment of preterm pigs with reduced PN glucose regimen supplemented with intravenous administration of purified hIAIP. In contrast to our original hypothesis, hIAIP supplementation reversed the effects of glucose reduction in this model of neonatal sepsis and provided no survival benefit.</p><p>Collectively, these clinically relevant findings suggest that reduced parenteral glucose supply, together with antibiotics and other supporting care, as a concomitant therapy for CONS infected preterm infants may prevent or delay the development of neonatal sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced glucose supply improves glucose homeostasis and survival during neonatal infection</title><p>Using preterm pigs as models for infected preterm infants, we have previously shown that hyperglycemia induced by a high parenteral glucose supply (High, 21%, 30 g/kg/d), is predisposed to sepsis and high mortality following <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> infection.

Also, SE-Low animals showed less severe thrombocytopenia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), and depletions of these blood cellular subsets are known to be associated with increased severity in neonatal sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melvan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Timperi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, it was evident that the inflammatory response in infected animals with a reduced glucose supply also was dramatically attenuated, with lower levels of plasma TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10, compared to animals with a high glucose supply (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>).

However, within SE-Low and SE-High pigs, mortality did not correlate to bacterial burdens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although, we cannot exclude that circulating glucose levels affected bacterial proliferation, we hypothesized that an important mechanism behind these positive effects was a reduction of hepatic and circulating glycolytic metabolism, which may lead to rewiring immune cells to rely on other substrates than glucose, thereby constraining the overall pro-inflammatory cascades. Thus, we explored how glucose supply affected immune-metabolic gene expression in the liver, collected at euthanasia. Both infection and glucose supply dramatically impacted hepatic gene transcription, with more than 4000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each group comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Relative to SE-High, the SE-Low animals showed elevated pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, OXPHOS, and TCA cycle, as well as fatty acid and glucogenic amino acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and all DEGs can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Though glycolysis and gluconeogenesis share many enzymes catalyzing reversible reactions, enzymes related solely to glycolysis or glycogen formation, such as glucokinase (<italic>GCK</italic>) and phosphoglucomutase 2 (<italic>PGM2</italic>) were downregulated in SE-Low compared to SE-High (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>), whereas those only involved in gluconeogenesis, such as fructose-bisphosphatase 2 (<italic>FBP2</italic>) and pyruvate carboxylase (<italic>PC</italic>) were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). This suggests that a shift from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis occurs in infected animals kept on a reduced glucose supply, even during infections. In parallel, SE-Low animals showed multiple attenuated pathways related to inflammation, including NF-kappa B, IL-17, TNF, and Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It was evident that all markers of neonatal sepsis, such as blood pH, lactate, leucocyte/thrombocyte counts were improved by administration of the low glucose PN. At the same time, this nutritional strategy had a clear impact on the hepatic metabolism, reducing the rate of glycolysis while favoring OXPHOS and possibly gluconeogenesis. However, given that most metabolic endpoints are collected at euthanasia we are unsure when the shift in metabolism occurs. Also, to our surprise, we found only minor changes in the metabolism of circulating leucocytes despite the downregulation of a range of inflammatory genes in the SE-Low group. As such, it is unlikely that the blood leukocyte pool is the crucial link between glucose sensing and immune response to systemic infections. Instead, much of the cytokine production during infections seems to derive from liver macrophages or splenocytes, organs that monitor for blood-borne pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minasyan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heymann and Tacke, 2016</xref>). In the liver transcriptome, there were clear signs of both diminished pro-inflammatory responses and a switch to OXPHOS in SE-Low animals and, when coupled with the plasma metabolome, signs of enhanced gluconeogenesis. We are, however, limited by the use of whole blood/tissue transcriptomics, as opposed to single-cell sequencing, which does not allow for the identification of changes to individual cell types. The observed effects likely occur in separate cell types, with metabolic modulations by glucose supply probably more pronounced in hepatocytes while the immunological changes were altered in the liver immune cells. It is likewise possible that metabolic adaptations in circulating immune cells are present in specific subsets, not detected by the whole blood sequencing. However, from the entirety of our data, the liver appears to be the orchestrator of the immune response to bacterial infection in preterm neonates, and its immune-metabolic response is affected by the circulating glycemic state.</p><p>Crucially, a moderately reduced glucose supply did not lead to severe hypoglycemia as we had observed in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muk et al., 2022</xref>). However, we also found that high glucose provision in the early phases of the infection determined the clinical fate of the animals, as those who switched to a reduced glucose regime after the infection was initiated did not have better clinical outcomes than pigs kept on a high-glucose regime throughout the experiment. However, we have not explored the impact of increasing glucose provision after the onset of clinical symptoms, so it is still unknown if the metabolic state of the immune system at the start of the infection determines the outcome. Interestingly though, given that gluconeogenesis seems to be initiated in the SE-Low group during infection. It is possible that preterm newborns have an adequate capacity to utilize other nutrients (i.e. amino acids) to prevent hypoglycemia during glucose-restricted conditions. Therefore, we anticipate that PN with reduced glucose content could be enriched with glucogenic amino acids, which might provide substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis and help better balance blood sugar levels during neonatal infection.</p><p>Reducing glucose intake did not completely protect against the development of sepsis, but combining the low glucose regime with supplementation of hIAIP did further not resolve the inflammatory response and failed to improve survival. A possible underlying cause might be the dose used and its known impact on immune cell activation, which has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Htwe et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that in our model of neonatal sepsis, exogenously supplemented hIAIP may have negatively altered the responsiveness of neutrophils, thereby potentially increasing pathogen load, resulting in the worsening of the septic condition. Likewise, the premature state of the animals, with already suppressed pro-inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bæk et al., 2020a</xref>), may have negated the positive results reported elsewhere. Interestingly we observed that porcine IAIP components ITIH1 and bikunin were significantly reduced in circulation only under a high PN glucose regimen. This suggests that a high glucose feeding regimen might be a more suitable, alternative study set up to explore the potential benefits of IAIP supplementation. Further experiments will be needed to optimize the timing and the context of IAIP administration within the current treatment paradigm to uncover its potential treatment benefits in neonatal sepsis.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a clinically relevant regime of reduced glucose provision to prevent sepsis in infected newborn preterm animals, together with relevant mechanistic insights into hepatic immunity and glucose metabolism. Our findings imply that a similar approach for infants with a high risk of infection may help prevent or attenuate the development of life-threatening sepsis. Currently, we are developing a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility of such a reduced glucose supply in preterm infants with suspected infection, in parallel with more mechanistic pre-clinical studies of modulated hepatic metabolism and systemic immunity in infected preterm animals. Metabolic modulation of immune responses appears to be a promising therapeutic approach for infections in weak and immunocompromised infants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. epidermidis</italic> culture preparation</title><p>The full procedure for preparation of the <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> bacteria has been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunse et al., 2018</xref>).

Piglets with prolonged apnea were treated with continuous positive airway pressure until spontaneous respiration was established. Once stable, and still under the influence of maternal anesthesia, all pigs were fitted with an umbilical arterial catheter allowing for the administration of PN and collection of arterial blood samples. Approximately 2 hr after birth, pigs were stratified by birthweight and sex and, in <italic>Exp 1</italic> A, randomly allocated to receive PN with either high (High, 21%, 30 g/kg/d) or reduced (Low, 5%, 7.2 g/kg/d) glucose levels.

During experiments, blood samples were collected through the arterial catheter for blood gas, hematology, and cytokine measurements. For blood bacterial enumeration and glucose measurements, blood was collected by jugular vein puncture at the same time points. Blood glucose was measured by capillary puncture using a glucose meter (Accu-Chek, Roche Diagnostics, Denmark). At euthanasia, either scheduled or due to clinical deterioration, animals were sedated and euthanized by intracardial injection of pentobarbital after blood had been collected by an intracardial puncture to yield plasma and serum.

Briefly, plasma was lysed in cold lysis buffer (5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, Sigma-Aldrich) and prepared with filter-aided sample preparation (FASP). Thereafter proteins were recovered using 10 kDa spin filters (VWR), and samples were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were desalted, dried, and stored at –80 °C. At the time of LC-MS/MS analysis, dried peptides were reconstituted in loading buffer (1% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) and determined peptide concentration.

Here they found that a slightly higher dose of glucose could thread the needle and get the protective effects of low glucose without incurring significant hypoglycemia.

This may be due to changes in immune response leading to better clearance or it could be due to slower growth in lower glucose environment. These possibilities are not fully disentangled in this study.</p><p>(2) Many differences in the different omics (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics) were identified in the SE-LOW vs SE-HIGH comparison. Since the bacterial load is very different between these conditions, could the changes be due to bacterial load rather than metabolic reprograming from the low glucose PN? The authors argue in supplementary figure 1F that density of SE in blood does not correlate with sepsis implying that bacterial load is not the driver of outcome. The authors recently published some additional analysis that may be helpful to reference in this manuscript.</p><p>(3) Further, expanding upon a model to better understand the complex relationship between differences in supplemental glucose infusion, blood glucose levels, bacterial load, host responses and how they impact the development of sepsis would be helpful. These complex relationships are difficult to fully disentangle, but one could consider infusing the same quantity of heat-killed bacteria under different glucose conditions to see if the glucose levels drive outcomes independently of bacterial burden.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97830.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors demonstrate that a low parenteral glucose regimen can lead to improved bacterial clearance and survival from Staph epi sepsis in newborn pigs without inducing hypoglycemia, as compared to a high glucose regimen.

Taken together our experiments heavily imply that glucose provision is associated to severity in a seemingly linear manner. In the clinical setting, there is no fixed glucose provision, but guidelines specify ranges that are acceptable. However, these guidelines do not take possible infections into account and are designed to optimize growth outcomes. Increased provision of glucose to preterm neonates may therefore increase their infection risk, but parenteral glucose cannot be entirely avoided as it would lead to hypoglycaemia and associated brain damage. In the present paper the reduced glucose PN reflects the lowest end of the recommended PN glucose intake. More work is needed to figure out the best glucose provision to infected preterm newborns, balancing positive and negative factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 1B, preterm piglets provided the high glucose PN have 13% survival while preterm piglets on the same nutrition in Figure 6B have ~80% survival. Were the conditions indeed the same? If so, this indicates a large amount of variation in the outcome of this model from experiment to experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the follow-up experiment outlined in Figure 6 we reduced the follow-up time to 12 hours in an effort to minimize the suffering of the animals. We did this because we could detect relevant differences in the immune response between High and low glucose infected pigs as 12 hours. If we had extended the follow-up experiment to 22 hours we would likely have seen a much increased mortality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Piglets on the low glucose PN had consistently lower density of SE (~1 log) across all time points.

We have now added this data to the results section as supplemental and report this fact in the section called “Reduced glucose supply increases hepatic OXPHOS and gluconeogenesis and attenuates inflammatory pathways”. This finding inspired us to further explore the relationship between bacterial burdens and infection responses in our model which has resulted in our recent preprint: Wu et at.

The authors used different experimental strategies to arrive at the same conclusion, which lends credibility to their findings. The authors have published the negative findings associated with their study, including the inability to reverse sepsis-related mortality after switching from SE-high to SE-low at 3h or 6h and after administration of hIAIP.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors mention, and it is well-known, that Staph epi is primarily involved in late-onset sepsis. The model of S. epi sepsis used in this study clearly replicates early-onset sepsis, but S. epi is extremely rare in this time period. How do the authors justify the clinical relevance of this model?</p></disp-quote><p>The distinction between early and late onset sepsis makes sense clinically because they are likely to be caused by different organisms and therefore require different empirical antibiotic regimes. Early onset sepsis is caused by organisms transferred perinatally often following chorioamnionitis or uro-gential maternal infections (Strep. agalacticae/<italic>E. coli</italic>) whereas Late onset sepsis is likely caused by organisms from indwelling catheters or mucosal surfaces, most often coagulase negative staphylococci. Timing of an infection after birth of course plays a role, but the virulence factors of the pathogen probably plays a large role in shaping the immune response. Therefore, even though the infection in our model is initiated on the first day after birth, the organism that we use, <italic>Staph epidermidids</italic>, makes it a better model for pathogenesis of late onset sepsis. However, it is also important to acknowledge that the pathophysiology of “sepsis” may be similar despite timing and pathogen and depends on the degree of immune activation and downstream effects on organs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors find that the neutrophil subset of the leukocyte population is diminished significantly in the SE-low and SE-high populations. However, they conclude on page 10 that &quot;modulations of hepatic, but not circulating immune cell metabolism, by reduced glucose supply...&quot; and this is possible because the authors have looked at the entire leukocyte transcriptome. I am curious about why the authors did not sequence the neutrophil-specific transcriptome.</p></disp-quote><p>We collected the whole blood transcript during the experiments, which reflect the transcription profile of all the circulating leucocytes. Since we did not do single cell RNA sequencing during the experiment there is no possibility of isolating the neutrophil transcriptome at this time. Your point however is valid and we will reconsider incorporating single cell transcriptomics in future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use high (30g/k/d) and low (7.2g/k/d) glucose regimens. These translate into a GIR of 21 and 5 mg/k/min respectively. A normal GIR for a preterm infant is usually 5-8, and sometimes up to 10. Do the authors have a &quot;safe GIR&quot; or a threshold they think we cannot cross? Maybe a point where the metabolism switch takes place? They do not comment on this, especially as GIR and glucose levels are continuous variables and not categorical.</p></disp-quote><p>Our reduced glucose PN was chosen as it corresponded with the low end of recommended guidelines for PN glucose intake. There likely is not a “safe GIR” as the clinical responses to glucose intake during infections do not seem binary but increase with glucose intake. It is also important to remember that the reduced glucose intervention still resulted in significant morbidity and a 25% mortality within 22 hours. There is therefore still vast room for improvement, but even though further reduction in PN glucose would probably provide further protection it would entail dangerous hypoglycaemia (as described in our previous paper). The findings in this current paper has prompted us to explore several strategies to replace parenteral glucose with alternative macronutrients. Thus, the optimal PN for infected newborns would probably differ from standard PN in all macronutrients and will require much more pre- and clinical research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figures 2B and C the authors show that SE-high and SE-low animals have differences in the oxphos, TCA, and glycolytic pathways. The authors themselves comment in the Supplementary Table S1B, E-F that these same metabolic pathways are also different in the Con-Low and Con-high animals, it is just the inflammatory pathways that are not different in the non-infected animals. How can they then justify that it is these metabolic pathways specifically which lead to altered inflammatory pathways, and not just the presence of infection along with some other unfound mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>It is to be expected that the inflammatory pathways do not differ between the Con-Low and Con-High groups as there is no infection to induce these pathways. The identified metabolic pathways that differ between SE-High and SE-Low animals seem to us the best explanation of the differences in clinical phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors mention in Figure 1F that SE-low animals had lower bacterial burdens than SE-high animals, but then go on to infer that the inflammatory cytokine differences are attributed to a rewiring of the immune response. However, they have not normalized the cytokine levels to the bacterial loads, as the differences in the cytokines might be attributed purely to a difference in bacterial proliferation/clearing.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to reviewer #1</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors mention that switching from SE-high to SE-low at 3 or 6 h time points does not reduce mortality. Have the authors considered the reverse? Does hyperglycemia after euglycemia initially, worsen mortality? That would really conclude that there is some metabolic reprogramming happening at the very onset of sepsis and it is a lost battle after that.</p></disp-quote><p>A very good point that we have not explored yet, we have added this consideration to the discussion and slightly amended our conclusions of this follow-up experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Baek and colleagues present important follow-up work on the role of serum glucose in the management of neonatal sepsis. The authors previously showed high glucose administration exacerbated neonatal sepsis, while strict glucose control improved outcomes but caused hypoglycemia. In the current report they examined the effect of a more tailored glucose management approach on outcomes and examined hepatic gene expression, plasma metabolome/proteome, blood transcriptome, as well as the the therapeutic impact of hIAIP. The authors leverage multiple powerful approaches to provide robust descriptive accounts of the physiologic changes that occur with this model of sepsis in these various conditions. Strengths:</p><p>(1) Use of preterm piglet model.</p><p>(2) Robust, multi-pronged approach to address both hepatic and systemic implications of sepsis and glucose management.</p><p>(3) Trial of therapeutic intervention - glucose management (Figure 6), hIAIP (Figure 7).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The translational role of the model is in question. CONS is rarely if ever a cause of EOS in preterm neonates. The model. uses preterm pigs exposed at 2 hours of age. This model most likely replicates EOS.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Reviewer #2</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Throughout the manuscript it is difficult to tell from which animals the data are derived. Given the ~90% mortality in the experimental CONS group, and 25% mortality in the intervention group, how are the data from animals &quot;at euthanasia&quot; considered? Meaning - are data from survivors and those euthanized grouped together? This should be clarified as biologically these may be very different populations (ie, natural survivor vs death).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point. For all endpoints that are analyzed “at euthanasia” the age of the animal will vary. Some will have been euthanized early due to clinical deterioration and some will have survived all the way to the end of the experiment. This needs to be kept in mind when interpreting the results. We have further highlighted this point in the discussion and made it clear to the reader at what time-point each analysis was performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) With limited time points (at euthanasia) for hepatic transcriptomics (Figure 2), plasma metabolite (Figure 3) blood transcriptome (Figure 4), and plasma proteome (Figure 5) it is difficult to make conclusions regarding mechanisms preceding euthanasia. Per methods, animals were euthanized with acidosis or clinical decompensation. Are the reported findings demonstrative of end-organ failure and deterioration leading to death, or reflective of events prior?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, all organ specific endpoints are snapshots of the state of the animals at the time of euthanasia, pooling together animals that succumbed to sepsis and those that survived to 22 hours post infection. These results therefore reflect the end-state of the infection we cannot be sure when the differences between groups manifested themselves. However, given the stark differences in plasma lactate at 12 hours post infection it is likely that changes to metabolism occurred before most of animals succumbed to sepsis.</p><p>We agree this is a weakness in our model, but we have since published a pre-print where we have further explored how metabolic adaptations shape the fate of similarly infected preterm pigs: BioRxiv 2024.02.23.581534; doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.23.581534">https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.23.581534</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Data are descriptive without corresponding &quot;omics&quot; from interventions (glucose management and/or hIAIP) or at least targeted assessment of key differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We only did in-depth analysis of the glucose intervention as this showed the most promising clinical effects that warranted further in-depth investigation. It is possible that further insights could be gained from in-depth analysis of the other interventions but given that there were no obvious clinical befits we refrained from that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I am intrigued that mortality was not correlated to bacterial burden. Please provide the &quot;data not shown&quot; as this would help the reader understand better whether the difference in bacterial burden is driving the phenotypes and findings of the low glucose group.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this data to supplementary figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) I would urge the authors to consider a neutrophil-specific transcriptomic analysis. I understand that this would add significantly to the resubmission process. If the authors wish to include that as a future direction instead, they need to specifically mention the limitations of whole blood transcriptomics and how different immune cell types react differently to bacterial antigens.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your considerations but we cannot include that data using the whole blood method applied in the experiment. We have added your consideration to the discussions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I urge the authors to remove any impression that this is a model of late-onset sepsis, which is implied from the introduction, lines 3 and 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention was not to directly suggest that our model is a perfect reflection of late-onset sepsis but rather to highlight the relevance of using a pathogen commonly associated with LOS. We believe our model primarily captures the effects of intense pro-inflammatory immune activation, which may have parallels with various forms of sepsis, including LOS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Drawing on the robust nature of your &quot;omics&quot;, identify key measures and test whether they are altered earlier in the development of clinical sepsis. Test whether these are altered by the intervention.</p></disp-quote><p>A very valid point, at the moment it is not possible for us to explore this within the confines of these experiments. But, building upon these findings and the ones in our recent preprint we are confident that shifts in hepatic ratio of Oxidative phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis vs glycolysis shape the immune response to infections in neonates. In our upcoming experiments we are planning to incorporate plasma metabolomics at earlier timepoints to monitor when shifts in metabolism occur. However, given the heterogeneity of pigs, as opposed to inbred rodent models, sacrificing animals at fixed timepoints to gauge their organ function will be hard to interpret as it is impossible to know what the end state of the particular animal would have been. Therefore longitudinal sampling of liver tissue, during the course of infection would be challenging.</p></body></sub-article></article>
