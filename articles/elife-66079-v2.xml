types, their subcellular compartments, and their major regulators during complex in vivo events. Here, we apply BioID2 proximity labeling to capture protein networks acting within cardiomyocytes during a key model of innate heart regeneration in zebrafish. Transgenic zebrafish expressing a promiscuous BirA2 localized to the entire myocardial cell or membrane compartment were generated, each identifying distinct proteomes in adult cardiomyocytes that became altered during regeneration. BioID2 profiling for interactors with ErbB2, a co-receptor for the cardiomyocyte mitogen Nrg1, implicated Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling in cardiomyocytes. Blockade of Rho A during heart regeneration, or during cardiogenic stimulation by the mitogenic influences Nrg1, Vegfaa, or vitamin D, disrupted muscle creation. Our findings reveal proximity labeling as a useful resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BioID2</kwd><kwd>heart regeneration</kwd><kwd>proximity labeling</kwd><kwd>ErbB2</kwd><kwd>Rho A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pronobis</surname><given-names>Mira I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 HL150713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poss</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poss</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poss</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002661</institution-id><institution>Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>34772792 –SCHISM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Sumeet Pal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proximity labeling-based proteomic strategies applied in zebrafish identify new insights into protein network changes in heart muscle cells during regeneration and implicate Rho A as a target of ErbB2 signaling during zebrafish heart regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding how and why tissue regeneration occurs is a central objective of developmental biology. Genome-wide transcriptome or chromatin profiling experiments using RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, ATAC-seq, or ChIP-seq approaches have helped to identify novel factors, mechanisms, and concepts that have informed our understanding of regeneration in many tissues, injury contexts, and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Although key for detecting and inferring changes in gene transcription, chromatin organization, or DNA–protein associations, these strategies are limited in their abilities to identify protein and signaling complexes that carry out changes at the cell and tissue level. Co-immunoprecipitations and affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP/MS/MS) are well-established techniques to probe protein interactions and networks. Yet, they require tissue dissociation and flow cytometry to acquire cell type-specific interactions, and weak interactions between proteins often escape detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Proximity labeling is a relatively recent technology established to probe protein interactions in specific sub-tissue and subcellular compartments, represented by multiple versions including BioID2, TurboID, and APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung et al., 2016</xref>). Here, engineered ligases that attach biotin to lysine residues are fused with a protein of interest such that, when expressed in cells, proteins in close proximity are indiscriminately biotinylated. The biotinylated proteome is isolated by streptavidin affinity, and proteins are identified by quantitative mass spectrometry. Most studies have applied proximity labeling to in vitro tissue culture systems, whereas many fewer have explored in vivo networks in mice or <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spence et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rudolph et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mannix et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). In the latter studies, proximity labeling captured the proteome within interneuron–neuron interactions, within muscle sarcomeres, and in the ring canal of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, producing new insights into protein network assemblies and signaling. The principles of proximity labeling should be capable of identifying key protein networks during dynamic cellular processes like embryonic development and tissue regeneration without the need for tissue disruption. Notably, proximity labeling has yet to be applied in central animal models of regeneration such as zebrafish and axolotl salamanders.</p><p>Unlike mammals, teleost zebrafish regenerate cardiac muscle after injury with minimal scar formation, based on division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>). Understanding mechanisms of innate cardiac repair in animals like zebrafish has the potential to define and overcome barriers to cardiac regeneration in humans. Evidence to date indicates that heart regeneration in zebrafish is a relentless process that outcompetes scarring to recover the heart function, rather than a linear series of molecular steps and synchronized cellular progressions. Intrinsic programs in cardiomyocytes and the ability to receive extrinsic proliferative cues are prime cardiomyocytes for cell division. Many ligands, receptors, and transcription factors have been shown to be required for heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dogra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pronobis and Poss, 2020</xref>). Three secreted factors, Nrg1, Vegfaa, and vitamin D, have been demonstrated to have instructive mitogenic effects, characterized by the ability to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation in zebrafish in the absence of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gemberling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2019</xref>). Nrg1/ErbB2 signaling can stimulate cardiomyocyte division in adult mice, most notably when ErbB2 is experimentally expressed in the form of a ligand-independent activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Uva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2009</xref>). ErbB2 signaling was recently reported to work in part through regulation of YAP, a transcriptional activator that can impact cytoskeletal remodeling and cell division in cardiomyocytes during cardiac growth or repair in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharonov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heallen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heallen et al., 2011</xref>). In zebrafish, Nrg1/ErbB2 signals in part by promoting glycolysis versus mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and reducing Tp53 levels through upregulation of its inhibitor Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shoffner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honkoop et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Signal transduction mechanisms by which ErbB2 and other mitogenic factors support cardiomyocyte proliferation versus other outcomes could be illuminated by customized proteomic profiling. Proteomic studies of heart regeneration to date have faced challenges, including lack of cell-type specificity and limited detection of changes in poorly represented members of the proteome due to the abundance of sarcomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Puig et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we applied a transgenic BioID2 strategy to capture cell-specific proteome changes in cardiomyocytes during heart regeneration in adult zebrafish. We show that BioID2 can be used to track changes in protein levels in whole cardiomyocytes or their membrane compartments during regeneration. We also investigate the proximal proteome of ErbB2 in cardiomyocytes, finding an increase in association with the small GTPase Rho A during regeneration, a protein with activity we find to be essential for injury-induced regeneration and the proliferative response to mitogens. Our findings demonstrate the utility of proximity labeling as a resource to interrogate cell proteomes and signaling networks during tissue regeneration in zebrafish, and they identify a key role of small GTPases in injury-induced cardiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BioID2 detects cardiomyocyte proteomes in adult zebrafish</title><p>BioID2 employs the promiscuous BirA2, which attaches biotin molecules to the lysines of proteins within an approximate distance of 10 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). We reasoned that the lysines of sarcomeric proteins might be less accessible when packed in supermolecular complexes, and therefore less likely to undergo biotinylation. To determine whether BioID2 is functional in cardiomyocytes of adult zebrafish, we generated a transgenic line with a cassette encoding BirA2 fused to GFP and placed downstream of the <italic>myosin light chain 7</italic> (<italic>cmlc2</italic>, or <italic>mlc7</italic>) promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). BirA2-GFP was readily detected in adult zebrafish cardiac chambers, where it was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nuclei of adult cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To test whether BirA2 expressed in this manner biotinylates the cardiomyocyte proteome, we supplied biotin either in the aquarium water or via intraperitoneal injections over three consecutive days. We found that effective protein biotinylation occurred only when biotin was delivered by injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>).

However, this requires a high threshold for protein changes to avoid false positives, diminishing the gating of proteins with subtle fold changes. Normalizing the regenerating heart data set of a transgenic strain to the uninjured control of the same strain allowed a low threshold. Gene ontology analysis (over-representation test) for biological processes characterized the proteins with increased levels during regeneration in the whole-cell BioID2 set as involved in wound healing, cardiac development, muscle cell differentiation, and response to wounding, whereas decreased proteins were enriched for metabolites and energy precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The latter category includes the generation of ADP to ATP and oxidative phosphorylation, implying that these processes are dampened during dedifferentiation and proliferation of cardiomyocytes, as suggested by recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honkoop et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda et al., 2019</xref>). The top 10% of increased proteins included ErbB2 and the mTOR signaling protein Rictora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), each previously implicated in heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gemberling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sciarretta et al., 2015</xref>). We compared the BioID2 data set to published RNA-seq or ChIP-seq data sets, which each identified a much greater number of differential products than BioID2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rudolph et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Yair et al., 2019</xref>). Correlations were generally weak, with the highest being an RNA-seq data set from 14 dpi hearts at r = 0.39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). We suspect that any post-transcriptional regulation incorporated in BioID2 data contributes to these weak correlations. Beyond this, there are several possible technical explanations, including differences in assessed timepoints, injury models, and cell types, and limitations of BioID2 in capturing targets. Regardless, our results indicate that proximity labeling with BirA2 can identify biological processes that are involved in tissue regeneration and proteins that have been reported to regulate cardiac repair.</p><p>To investigate how the membrane proteome changes after heart injury, we examined <italic>cmlc2:bira2-GFP-CAAX</italic> samples at 14 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). We identified 173 proteins with a 1.5-fold or greater change in membrane-associated proteins during regeneration when normalized to uninjured hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), with the majority of these proteins reducing presence during regeneration. This contrasts with BirA2-GFP samples, which showed more proteins increasing levels during regeneration than those decreasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Proteins with reduced membrane levels during regeneration showed over-representation of involvement in transmembrane transport, muscle development, and energy production (electron transport and glycolysis), while proteins increased at the membrane during regeneration were involved in protein complex assembly and organelle organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Intracellular restructuring is known to occur in dividing cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Uribe et al., 2018</xref>). Upon comparison of the top and bottom 10% of the membrane profiling data with BirA2-GFP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), very few proteins were found in both data sets, suggesting specificity of the membrane BioID2 data.</p><p>Comparison of proteins found in BirA2-GFP and BirA2-GFP-CAAX data sets identified 44 shared proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Of these, 16 proteins showed opposing changes in levels at the membrane or in the whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To visualize dynamism of proteins for which there were available candidate antibodies during regeneration, we assessed some of these proteins by immunofluorescence in a model of regeneration in which ~20% of the ventricle is resected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poss et al., 2002</xref>). Erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 like 5 (Epb41l5) is involved in animal organ development and has been implicated as a positive regulator of Notch signaling, a pathway involved in heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Epb41l5 was predominantly localized at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, arrows) and increased presence throughout cardiomyocytes during regeneration, consistent with the BioID2 data. Talin 2, an adapter protein that couples integrin focal adhesions to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>), displayed low levels in uninjured hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Upon injury, Talin 2 levels increased near the wound site as well as in ventricular muscle away from the injury, with a punctate pattern appearing that resembled focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with a remodeling of focal adhesions during myocardial stress induction that has been reported for Talin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manso et al., 2013</xref>). To assess BioID2 results implicating proteins that increase levels at the cell membrane during regeneration, we identified antibodies against SET nuclear proto-oncogene a (Seta), which is involved in nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A, C</xref>). Seta levels were undetectable in uninjured hearts, yet became prominent in compact muscle and epicardial tissue in injured ventricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The Seta signal was perinuclear and colocalized with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which indicates that Seta associates in part with the nuclear membrane and endomembranes after heart injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). As Seta has been proposed to silence histone acetyltransferase-dependent transcription, its recruitment to nuclear and endomembranes could impact this function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seo et al., 2001</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that BioID2 can capture changes in the proteomes of cardiomyocytes during heart regeneration, providing a resource for candidate effectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rho A interacts with ErbB2 during heart regeneration</title><p>Nrg1 ligand has been reported to bind its receptor ErbB4 on cardiomyocytes, causing heterodimerization of Erbb4 and its co-receptor ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harskamp et al., 2016</xref>).

Using STRING and BioGRID databases, we identified nine known ErbB2 interactors in our data set. Three of these proteins showed increased association with ErbB2 during regeneration, whereas two had decreased association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, yellow and blue circles, respectively). Next, we examined the levels of these candidates as reported in published transcriptome and proteome data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-Yair et al., 2019</xref>), and found that overall expression levels were not predictive of ErbB2 association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). ErbB4, encoded by <italic>erbb4a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> paralogs, was not detected in any of the BioID2 data sets, which might either indicate that ErbB4 does not associate with ErbB2 in the zebrafish heart, or that their C-terminal regions are not in close proximity, or a limitation in sensitivity of the assays. The strongest detected increase was an association with the Rho GTPase Rho A-b, and pathway analyses indicated enrichment for proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Rho A activation by ErbB2 has been previously reported to promote pro-metastatic and invasive behavior of human breast cancer cells and contribute to mammary adenocarcinoma tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brantley-Sieders et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Worzfeld et al., 2012</xref>).

To test whether ErbB2-Rho A association is increased during regeneration, we conducted co-immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, Rho A was pulled down with ErbB2-BirA2-HA in regenerating heart samples, but not from uninjured myocardium, suggesting a context-dependent association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

We identified changes specific to cardiomyocytes at the levels of whole-cell, membrane compartment, and the molecular interface of a key pro-regenerative factor ErbB2. Our profiling and functional experiments implicate the GTPase Rho A as mediating the effects of Nrg1 and other mitogens in cardiomyocytes during regeneration and provide a resource for which other candidate regenerative effectors can be assessed. We expect that BioID2 and evolved iterations can be effectively applied in myriad ways to monitor proteome changes during dynamic developmental events like regeneration in many species, tissues, and injury contexts to provide high-resolution insights into essential networks of regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BirA2-GFP</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"><italic>Tg(cmlc2:birA2-GFP)<sup>pd335</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Transgenic line maintained in K.

Prior to isolation of hearts, 10 μl of a 500 μM biotin/PBS solution was intraperitoneally (IP) injected into adult zebrafish on three consecutive days. Ventricle and outflow tract but not atrium were extracted, rinsed in cold PBS, and collected in ice-cold RIPA buffer.

Lysates were then centrifuged at 21,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Meanwhile, NeutrAvidin beads were pre-washed in keratin-free conditions in a laminar flow hood. 25–50 μl of bead slurry were pipetted into a low-protein-binding tube and spun down for 30 s at 2000 rpm at room temperature (RT).

Proteins were trapped on the S-Trap, digested using 20 ng/μl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) for 1 hr at 47C, and eluted using 50 mM TEAB, followed by 0.2% formic acid (FA), and lastly using 50% ACN/0.2% FA. All samples were then lyophilized and resuspended in 12 μl 1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/2% acetonitrile containing 12.5 fmol/μl yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH_YEAST). From each sample, 3 μl was removed to create a QC Pool sample, which was run periodically throughout the acquisition period. Quantitative LC/MS/MS was performed on 3 μl of each sample using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corp.) coupled to a Thermo Fusion Lumos high-resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo) via a nanoelectrospray ionization source. Briefly, the sample was first trapped on a Symmetry C18 20 mm × 180 μm trapping column (5 μl/min at 99.9/0.1 v/v water/acetonitrile), after which the analytical separation was performed using a 1.8 μm Acquity HSS T3 C18 75 μm × 250 mm column (Waters Corp.) with a 90 min linear gradient of 5–30% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nl/min with a column temperature of 55°C.

Ion trap MS/MS scans were acquired with a Rapid scan rate, 100 ms max injection time, and a target AGC value of 5e3 ions. A 20 s dynamic exclusion was employed to increase depth of coverage. The total analysis cycle time for each sample injection was approximately 2 hr.</p><p>Following UPLC-MS/MS analyses, data were imported into Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Scientific Inc), and analyses were aligned based on the accurate mass and retention time of detected ions (‘features’) using Minora Feature Detector algorithm in Proteome Discoverer.

Database search parameters included fixed modification on Cys (carbamidomethyl) and variable modifications on Meth (oxidation) and Asn and Gln (deamidation). Peptide Validator and Protein FDR Validator nodes in Proteome Discoverer were used to annotate the data at a maximum 1% protein false discovery rate.</p><p>Relative peptide abundance of triplicates was averaged for each protein, and proteins were confirmed as positive with p&lt;0.05.

Injured hearts were normalized to uninjured hearts, and a fold change of 1.5-fold was used as a threshold for protein level change. For the membrane proteome, uninjured BirA2-GFP-CAAX-expressing hearts were normalized to BirA2-GFP hearts, and proteins with a 2.5-fold change were considered to be membrane-specific.</p><p>Cytoscape was used to create interactome maps. BioGRID and Scaffold were used to search for interactors of ErbB2, Rho A, Rac1b, and Cdc42. Panther gene list analysis was used for over-representation tests in cellular components, signaling pathways and reactome analysis of the BioID2 data sets.</p><p>BioID2 raw MS proteomics data sets have been deposited to MassIVE with the data identifier MSV000087028 and are also summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary files 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">8</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Hearts were removed and placed in Hanks Buffered Saline Solution supplemented with 20 U/ml heparin. Outflow tracts and atria were removed, and ventricles were pulled apart with tweezers to remove blood from the lumen. Washed ventricles were then placed in 1 ml Trizol and processed to recover RNA. Further enrichment for mRNA was performed by polyA isolation, and mRNA was processed into RNA-seq libraries for sequencing on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000. RNA-seq data was deposited at GEO with the data identifier GSE168371.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Immunofluorescence and imaging</title><p>Primary and secondary antibody staining was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kikuchi et al., 2011</xref>). Mef2/PCNA staining has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kikuchi et al., 2010</xref>). EdU/Mef2 staining of unfixed sections of ventricles was performed as follows: fish were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mM EdU on three consecutive days prior to harvest. For tissue preparation, hearts were removed from animals and placed into ice-cold 30% sucrose/PBS, before mounting. Hearts were flash-frozen in EtOH/dry Ice and stored in −80°C. Cryosections were performed to generate 10-μm-thick sections, and slides were air-dried for 30 min and then stored at −20°C. For EdU/Mef2 staining, slides were incubated on a slide warmer for 10 min and then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS at RT for 15 min. Next, slides were washed three times 5 min in PBS. EdU staining was performed by mixing 600 μl 1M Tris pH 8.5, 6 μl 1&lt; CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 6 μl 10 mM azide, and 600 μl 0.5 M ascorbic acid (made fresh). Slides were incubated for 30 min at RT. Next, washes were performed in 2% Triton-X-100/PBS four times each 5 min at RT, and slides were blocked for 1 hr at RT in 2% Triton-X-100/PBS, 5% goat serum, and 1% BSA. Primary antibody anti-Mef2 (Abcam, ab197070) was incubated 1:100 in 2% Triton-X-100/PBS and 5% goat serum overnight at 4°C. The next day, slides were washed in 2% Triton-X-100/PBS four times each for 5 min at RT and stained with the secondary antibody for 2 hr at RT. Lastly. four 5 min washes in 2% Triton-X-100/PBS were performed, and slides were mounted in Vectashield hard set DAPI reagent.</p><p>A Zeiss 700 confocal microscope was used to image slides. For EdU/Mef2 and Mef2/PCNA staining, images were acquired of the three largest sections from each ventricle. Mef2<sup>+</sup> and Mef2<sup>+</sup>/EdU<sup>+</sup> or Mef2<sup>+</sup>/PCNA<sup>+</sup> cells were counted manually using Fij (ImageJ) in a muscle strip 100 μm wide along the ventricular periphery or injury border zone. Values from the sections were averaged to compute a proliferative index for each animal. Four animals were sampled for each condition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>Co-immunoprecipitations of Erbb2-HA in whole zebrafish hearts were performed as follows. Hearts from 20 <italic>cmlc2:erbb2-birA2-HA-P2A-GFP; cmlc2:CreER; βactin2:loxp-mCherry-STOP-loxp-DTA</italic> animals treated with tamoxifen, or from 20 controls without <italic>cmlc2:CreER</italic>, were extracted 14 days after treatment. Ventricle and outflow tract was isolated, rinsed in cold PBS, and collected in ice-cold RIPA buffer. Using an Eppendorf tube pestle, hearts were lysed by 50 strokes, flash-frozen in EtOH/dry ice, incubated on ice for 15 min, and then again homogenized with 50 stokes of an Eppendorf tube pestle. Lysates were then centrifuged at 21,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. 50 μl were saved as an input control and kept on ice during the entire Co-IP protocol. Heart lysates were first pre-cleared with 20 μl of packed protein A beads (Sigma) per lysate on a rocker or tumbler at 4°C overnight. The next day, 1 μl of the anti-HA antibody (1 μl IgG rabbit for control) was incubated with 20 μl of protein A beads for 1 hr on a rocker or tumbler at 4°C. Next, antibody-bead mix was added to the pre-cleared heart lysates and incubated for 2 hr at on a rocker or tumbler at 4°C. Samples were three times washed with 500 μl lysis and spun down at 800 rpm for 1 min at 4°C. After the last wash, 50 μl of lysis buffer was added to the samples, and samples were boiled with Laemmli buffer and β-mercaptoethanol at 95°C for 10 min. Samples were stored at −20°C before western blot analysis.</p><p>For whole heart lysates, the first part of the Co-IP protocol was followed until lysates were centrifuged at 21,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was isolated, and a Bradford assay (BioRad) was performed to determine protein concentration. Then, samples were boiled with Laemmli buffer and β-mercaptoethanol at 95°C for 10 min. 25 μg protein from each whole heart sample was used in western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Primary antibodies used in this study: anti-Mef2 (Abcam, ab197070, 1:100), anti-Rho A (Santa Cruz, 26C4,1:1000), anti-epb41L5 (RPL39, Proteintech, 1:100), anti-Talin 2 (Boster Biological Technology, PB9961, 1:100), anti-Seta (Antibodies online, ABIN2786762, 1:100), anti-ROCK2 (Bioss Antibodies, BS-1205R, 1:500), anti-HA (Abcam, ab9110, 1:1000), anti-CT3 (DSHB, 1:200), anti-PCNA (1:200, Sigma, P8825), anti-Mef2 antibody used in PCNA/Mef2 staining (gift from Jingli Cao) and anti-MHC (DSHB, F59-S, 1:200).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Lilianna Solnica-Krezel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.

Using a transgenic approach to express the promiscuous Bir2 biotin ligase in whole cardiomyocytes, their membrane compartment, or fused to the regeneration regulator ErbB2 in zebrafish, the authors define cardiomyocyte-specific proteome changes and protein interactions during heart regeneration. They functionally validate a role of the identified ErbB2-RhoA interaction in regulation of cell proliferation during heart regeneration. Overall, the data are properly controlled and analysis of datasets are rigorously analyzed in comparison with previous progress for understanding the transcriptional responses during cardiac regeneration.

Supplementary File 5 also lists the mRNA levels of ErbB2 associated proteins found in previously published RNA-seq datasets (Kang et al. 2016 and Ben-Yair et al. 2019) and CM-specific ChIP-seq of H3.3 (Goldman et al. 2017). We added the following to the manuscript (p. 10): “Next, we examined the levels of these candidates as reported in published transcriptome and proteome datasets (1, 35, 36, 41, 42), and found that overall expression levels were not predictive of ErbB2 association (Supplementary File 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have now included an alignment of the different Rho A proteins and the immunogen used to generate the antibody (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and we also state in our manuscript on p. 11: “Due to their high conservation, we were unable to identify which of the Rho A proteins, Rho A-a, Rho A-b, or Rho A-c increased its association with ErbB2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

These data indicate that mRNA levels of <italic>rhoaa</italic> increase after Nrg1 overexpression, whereas there is no evidence of changes in <italic>rhoab</italic> and <italic>rhoac</italic>. We summarize these results in our manuscript as follows (p. 13): “Assessment of published single cell RNA-seq data revealed detectable <italic>rhoaa</italic> expression in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells, and <italic>rhoab</italic> expression in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells during zebrafish heart regeneration (33) (Supplementary File 6). Additionally, published profiles of cardiomyocyte H3.3 occupancy (1), an indicator of active gene expression, indicate a ~2-fold increase in H3.3 enrichment in <italic>rhoaa</italic> and <italic>rhoab</italic> gene bodies during heart regeneration (Supplementary File 6).

We conducted <italic>Mef2</italic>/PCNA staining on DN-Rho A, DN-Rac1 and DN-Cdc42 transgenic animals 8 days after myocardial induction of each transgene, and 7 days after resection of the ventricular apex. We found trends of reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation in each case and added the following to our manuscript (p. 12): “We also observed tendencies for lowered cardiomyocyte proliferation in each transgenic background at 7 days after resection of the ventricular apex (Figure 4G).</p></body></sub-article></article>
