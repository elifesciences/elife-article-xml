sites in chromatin. Based on previous biochemical and overexpression studies, binding of T2NRs to chromatin is proposed to be regulated by competition for a limiting pool of the core RXR subunit. However, this mechanism has not yet been tested for endogenous proteins in live cells. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT) and proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), we monitored interactions between endogenously tagged RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in live cells. Unexpectedly, we find that higher expression of RAR, but not RXR, increases heterodimerization and chromatin binding in U2OS cells. This surprising finding indicates the limiting factor is not RXR but likely its cadre of obligate dimer binding partners. SMT and PAPA thus provide a direct way to probe which components are functionally limiting within a complex TF interaction network providing new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo with implications for drug development targeting nuclear receptors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-molecule tracking</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptors</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory networks</kwd><kwd>molecular biophysics</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-CA231641-01659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darzacq</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graham</surname><given-names>Thomas GW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM098218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heckert</surname><given-names>Alec</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Type II nuclear receptors do not always compete for a limiting pool of their obligate partner RXRa.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex intersecting regulatory networks govern critical transcriptional programs to drive various cellular processes in eukaryotes. These networks involve multiple transcription factors (TFs) binding shared cis-regulatory elements to elicit coordinated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">RemÃ©nyi et al., 2004</xref>). A distinct layer of combinatorial logic occurs at the level of specific TF-TF interactions, which can direct TFs to distinct genomic sites. Thus, fine-tuning of TF-TF interactions can modulate TF-gene interactions to orchestrate differential gene expression. Often, dimerization between different members of a protein family can generate TF-TF combinations with distinct regulatory properties resulting in functional diversity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nandagopal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puig-BarbÃ© et al., 2023</xref>). For example, E-box TFs of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family such as MYC/MAD share a dimerization partner MAX. Several studies have shown that switching of heterocomplexes between MYC/MAX and MAD/MAX results in differential regulation of genes and cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amati et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouchard et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hurlin and Huang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) present another classic example of such a dimerization network wherein the distribution of heterodimeric species regulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bwayi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan and Wells, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). T2NRs constitute an extensive group of basic leucine zipper TFs that share a common modular structure composed of a well-conserved ligand binding domain (LBD) that mediates heterodimerization with their obligate partner retinoid X receptor (RXR) and a highly conserved DNA binding domain that recognizes consensus sequences termed direct response elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>). Unlike Type I nuclear receptors, T2NRs do not depend on ligand binding for DNA engagement. Rather, binding of ligands to the LBD of chromatin- associated T2NR heterodimers results in eviction of co-repressors and recruitment of co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans and Mangelsdorf, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McKenna and OâMalley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous Halo-tagging of RARa and RXRa to characterize their diffusive behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) like RXR-RAR bind direct response elements (DREs) as heterodimers to activate or repress transcription by recruiting co-activators (in presence of ligand) or co-repressors (in absence of ligand).

Mechanistic features of protein-protein interaction within this regulatory node and its effect on chromatin binding in live cells are yet to be explored.

To benchmark our SMT measurements, we first compared the diffusion spectra of RARÎ±-Halo and Halo-RXRÎ± to that of H2B-Halo (which as expected is largely chromatin-bound) and Halo-3ÃNLS (which is mostly unbound). We observed that RARÎ± and RXRÎ± both exhibit a clearly separated slow diffusing population (&lt;0.15 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s) along with a faster mobile population (1â10 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The former we classify as âboundâ since it represents molecules diffusing at a rate indistinguishable from that of Halo-H2B (chromatin motion).

Upon illumination by green light, the receiver and sender molecules distal to one another do not get photoactivated (red X) but receiver SNAP molecules proximal to the sender gets photoactivated (green â).

As expected, a low level of background reactivation by green light was observed for SNAP negative control, reflecting the baseline probability that an unbound SNAP molecule will at some low level be close enough to Halo to observe PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, orange points) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2022</xref>). Violet light-induced DR and green light-induced PAPA were linearly correlated as expected, since both are proportional to the number of receiver molecules. However, a greater PAPA signal was seen for the Halo-RXRÎ± â RARÎ±-SNAP and RARÎ±-Halo â SNAP-RXRÎ± combinations than for the negative control, consistent with direct protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

In contrast, the ratio of PAPA to DR for Halo-RXRÎ± â RARÎ±<sup>RR</sup>-SNAP was similar to the SNAP negative control, confirming that PAPA signal depends on a functional RAR-RXR interaction interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Next, we compared the diffusion spectra of molecules reactivated by DR and PAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Here, we used SMT in live cells with endogenously tagged proteins and carefully controlled protein levels of two players, RARÎ± and RXRÎ±, in the T2NRs dimerization network, thereby directly addressing a fundamental question - whether RAR (partner) or RXR (core) is limiting for chromatin association.</p><p>In stark contrast to the generally accepted T2NR competition model, our results reveal that in U2OS cells, formation and chromatin binding of RAR-RXR heterodimers are limited by the concentration of RAR and not the core subunit RXR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). PAPA-SMT directly confirmed in vivo that the association with RXRÎ± promotes chromatin binding of RARÎ± and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, unexpectedly, overexpression of RARÎ± increases <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> of endogenous RXRÎ±, while the reverse is not true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating that RXR is not limiting but is rather constrained by the availability of its binding partners. Note that even though the number of RXRÎ± and RARÎ± molecules is about the same and the heterodimer complex has a predicted 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rastinejad, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rastinejad et al., 2000</xref>), the <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> of endogenous RARÎ± (50%) and RXRÎ± (38%) differed by about 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). This surprising result could be explained by expression of additional RXR isoforms (most likely RXRÎ²) in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2âtable 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). The fact that the <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> of overexpressed RARÎ± decreases only twofold, even though it is in fourfold excess over endogenous RXRÎ±, likewise suggests that there are other heterodimerization partners of RARÎ± available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2âtable 1</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> of overexpressed RXR is essentially the same as the NLS control, indicating this excess core partner remains nearly totally unbound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This is consistent with endogenous RXR already being in excess such that any additional RXR would remain mostly monomeric and unbound to chromatin. Hence, despite not directly measuring the protein levels of all RXR isoforms, we can still deduce in U2OS cells that RXR is in excess relative to its binding partners.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>A model for RARa limited chromatin binding of RARa-RXRa heterodimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pool of RXRÎ± (red) and RXR partners (RARÎ± - blue, other Type II nuclear receptors [T2NRs] - yellow) along with some number of chromatin-bound RARÎ±-RXRÎ± heterodimers exist under normal conditions.

We favor the latter possibility because overexpression of RARÎ± reduces not only the expression of endogenous RARÎ± but also its <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), indicating a reduction in dimerization and chromatin binding. It is possible that endogenous RAR may be more readily degraded when not bound by RXR, analogous to what was recently shown for the c-MYC/MAX heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mark et al., 2023</xref>). Second, as has been previously reported, RARÎ± expression decreases upon ligand treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ismail and Nawaz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osburn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsai et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>).

Instead, an excess of RXR may ensure independent regulation of the different T2NRs without disrupting crosstalk between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>In this first study, we have not examined other T2NRs expressed in U2OS cells or whether there is a similar excess of RXR in other cell types. Therefore, we cannot rule out that competition for RXR between T2NRs occurs in some cases since different cell types express RXR and partner T2NRs in varying amounts. It seems likely that chromatin binding by any given T2NR will depend on the concentrations of all other T2NRs. It is thus important to determine how interactions within the dimerization network are perturbed upon up- or down-regulation of one or more T2NRs, especially since dysregulation of T2NR expression has been reported in several types of cancers as well as other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brabender et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins-Racie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frigo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Long and Campbell, 2015</xref>). Here, we have shown that SMT and PAPA-SMT provide one empirical way to determine which set of components in a dimerization network is stoichiometrically limiting in a given cell type, without having to measure the concentration of every T2NR or the affinity of every interaction. The basic framework we have established here could also be extended to probe the effect of ligands or small molecules on the T2NR interaction network or other dimerization networks seen in bHLH or leucine zipper family of TFs, providing useful information about critical regulatory network interactions often implicated in diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and stable cell line generation</title><p>U2OS cells were grown in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/l glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan UT, Cat. #AE28209315), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher 11360070), L-glutamine (Sigma #G3126-100G), GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher #35050061), and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher #15140122) at 37Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Briefly, a Nikon TI microscope was equipped with a Ã100/NA 1.49 oil immersion total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) objective (Nikon apochromat CFI Apo TIRF 100Ã Oil), a motorized mirror, a perfect Focus system, an EM-CCD camera (Andor iXon Ultra 897), laser launch with 405 nm (140 mW, OBIS, Coherent), 488 nm, 561 nm, and 639 nm (1W, Genesis Coherent) laser lines, an incubation chamber maintaining a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37Â°C. All microscope, camera, and hardware components were controlled through the NIS-Elements software (Nikon).</p><p>For tracking endogenous as well as overexpressed Halo-tagged proteins, PA-JFX549 labeled cells were excited with 561 nm laser at 2.3 kW/cm<sup>2</sup> with single band-pass emission filter (Semrock 593/40 nm for PA-JFX549). All imaging was performed using highly inclined optical sheet (HILO) illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>). Low laser power (2â3%) was used to locate and focus cell nuclei. Region of interest (ROI) of random size but with maximum possible area was selected to fit into the interior of the nuclei. Before tracking, 100 frames of continuous illumination with 549 laser (laser power 5%) at 80 ms per frame was recorded to later calculate mean intensity of each nuclei. After partial pre-bleaching (only for overexpressed Halo-tagged proteins), movies were taken with 1 ms pulses of full power of 561 nm illumination at the beginning of frame interval with camera exposure of 7 ms/frame, while the 405 nm laser (67 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) was pulsed during ~447 Î¼s camera transition time. Total of 30,000 frames were collected. 405 nm intensity was manually tuned to maintain low density (1â5 molecules fluorescent particles per frame).</p><p>For tracking experiments with endogenous Halo-tagged proteins in the presence of transgenic SNAP protein products, cells were dual-labeled with both PA-JFX549 and STL-SF650. Before tracking cells were excited with a 639 nm laser at 88 W/cm<sup>2</sup> and single band-pass emission filter set to Semrock 676/37 nm. Low laser power (2â3%) was used to locate and focus cell nuclei. As before, ROI of random size but with maximum possible area was selected to fit into the interior of the nuclei. The emission filter was switched to Semrock 593/40 nm band-pass filter for PA-JFX549, keeping the TIRF angle, stage XYZ position, and ROI the same. Cells were then excited with 549 nm and single molecules were tracked for 30,000 frames as described above.</p><p>Note, we estimated that to calculate <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> of RARÎ± and RXRÎ± with minimal bias and variation, we need to analyze at least 10,000 pooled trajectories from nâ¥20 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, all analyses of fSMT to calculate <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> or <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> % presented in this paper are done accordingly. At least 8â10 movies were collected for each sample as one technical replicate on a given day. Two technical replicates on 2 separate days were collected to produce the reported results. As observed previously for SMT experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McSwiggen et al., 2024</xref>), the variance within collected data was largely due to cell-to-cell variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>PAPA-SMT</title><p>PAPA-SMT imaging was performed using the same custom-built microscope described above using an automated system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graham et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walther et al., 2024</xref>). Briefly, the microscope described above was programmed using Python and NIS Elements macro language code to raster in a grid over the coverslip surface, acquire an image in the JFX650 channel, identify cell nuclei, reposition the stage to center it on a target nucleus, resize the imaging ROI to fit the nucleus, pre-bleach JFX650 with red light (639 nm) for 5 s, and finally perform a PAPA-SMT illumination sequence.

To confirm that all movies were sufficiently sparse to avoid misconnections, a maximum number of 5 localizations per frame was maintained (although most frames had 1 or less).

(2) The JFX650 receiver is placed in a dark state by illumination with intense red (639 nm) light. (3) A pulse of green (561 nm) light is used to excite the JFX549 sender, reactivating nearby dark-state JFX650 molecules. Because association of the two proteins brings the sender and receiver together, this step selectively reactivates complexes of the two proteins. (4) After switching off the green light, red light is used to image reactivated receiver molecules. (5) As an internal control, a violet (405 nm) light pulse is used to reactivate the receiver by âDRâ, independent of proximity with the sender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>). (6) After switching off the violet light, reactivated molecules are again imaged with red light. Steps 3â6 are repeated for multiple rounds, and SMT trajectories occurring after green and violet pulses are analyzed separately using SASPT. Trajectories occurring after a green pulse (PAPA trajectories) are enriched for complexes between the SNAP- and Halo-tagged proteins, while trajectories occurring after a violet pulse (DR trajectories) approximate a random sample from the whole population.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><table-wrap id="app2table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 2âtable

They discovered an asymmetric response to the overexpression of counter-partners.

This manuscript provides a paradigm for how to further dissect the complicated regulatory networks formed by T2NRs or other dimerizing TFs. I found this to be a complete story that does not require additional experimental work. However, I do have some suggestions for the authors to consider.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Does the increased chromatin binding measured when the RAR levels are increased reflect a higher occupancy of a similar set of loci, or are additional loci bound? The authors could discuss this issue in the context of the published literature. Obviously, this could be addressed experimentally by ChIP-seq or a similar analysis, but this would extend beyond the main topic of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to explore this experimentally using ChIP-seq with multiple RAR- and RXR-specific antibodies. Unfortunately, our results were inconclusive, as the antibody enrichment relative to the IgG control was insufficient for reliable interpretation. Specifically, our ChIP-seq enrichment levels were only around 1.5fold, while the accepted standard for meaningful ChIP enrichment is typically at least 2-fold. Due to these technical limitations, we decided to defer these experiments for now.</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer that understanding whether the increased chromatin binding of RAR reflects higher occupancy at the same set of loci or binding to additional loci is a key question. In similar experiments involving the transcription factor TFEB (Esbin et al., 2024, <italic>Genes Dev</italic>, doi: 10.1101/gad.351633.124) where an increase in the SMT bound fraction occurred, both scenariosâhigher occupancy at known loci and binding to additional loci in ChIP-seq was observed. So, addressing this intriguing possibility in future studies focused on RAR and RXR would be interesting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The results presented suggest convincingly that endogenous RXR is normally in excess to its binding partners (in U2OS cells). This point could be strengthened further by reducing RXR levels, e.g., by knocking out 1 allele or the use of shRNAs (although the latter method might be too hard to control). Overexpression of another T2NR might also help determine the buffer capacity of RXR.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewersâ acknowledgment that our results convincingly demonstrate that endogenous RXR is typically in excess relative to its binding partners in U2OS cells. We agree that this conclusion could be further reinforced by experiments such as overexpression of another T2NR to test RXR's buffering capacity. We are actively pursuing follow-up experiments involving overexpression of additional T2NRs to address this question in more detail. These studies are ongoing, and we plan to explore the buffer capacity of RXR more extensively in a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The ~10% difference in fbound of RAR and RXR (in Figs 1 and 2), while they should be 1:1 dimers, is explained by invoking the expression of RXR isoforms. Can the authors be more specific concerning the nature of these isoforms?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided detailed information about different T2NRs expressed in U2OS cells according to the Expression Atlas and the Human Protein Atlas Database in Supplementary Table S1. Table S1 specifically shows that both isoforms of RXRÎ± and RXRÎ² are expressed in U2OS cells. Additionally, the caption of Table S1 explicitly notes the presence of isoform RXRÎ² in U2OS cells. In the main text, we reference Table S1 when discussing the 10% difference in fbound between RARÎ± and RXRÎ±, and we have now suggested that the expression of RXRÎ² likely accounts for the observed discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Surprising Features of Nuclear Receptor Interaction Networks Revealed by Live Cell Single Molecule Imaging&quot;, Dahal et al combine fast single molecule tracking (SMT) with proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA) to study the interaction between RARa and RXRa. The prevalent model in the nuclear receptor field suggests that type II nuclear receptors compete for a limiting pool of their partner RXRa. Contrary to this, the authors find that over-expression of RARa but not RXRa increases the fraction of RXRa molecules bound to chromatin, which leads them to conclude that the limiting factor is the abundance of RARa and not RXRa. The authors also perform experiments with a known RARa agonist, all trans retinoic acid (atRA) which has little effect on the bound fraction. Using PAPA, they show that chromatin binding increases upon dimerization of RARa and RXRa.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In my view, the biggest strength of this study is the use of endogenously tagged RARa and RXRa cell lines. As the authors point out, most previous studies used either in vitro assays or over-expression. I commend the authors on the generation of single-cell clones of knock-in RARa-Halo and Halo-RXRa. The authors then carefully measure the abundance of each protein using FACS, which is very helpful when comparing across conditions. The manuscript is generally well written and figures are easy to follow. The consistent color-scheme used throughout the manuscript is very helpful.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Agonist treatment:</p><p>The authors test the effect of all trans retinoic acid (atRA) on the bound fraction of RARa and RXRa and find that &quot;These results are consistent with the classic model in which dimerization and chromatin binding of T2NRs are ligand independent.&quot; However, all the agonist treatments are done in media containing FBS. FBS is not chemically defined and has been found to have between 10 and 50 nM atRA (see references in PMID 32359651 for example). The addition of 1 nM or 100 nM atRA is unlikely to result in a strong effect since the medium already contains comparable or higher levels of agonist. To test their hypothesis of ligand-independent dimerization, the authors should deplete the media of atRA by growing the cells in a medium containing charcoal-stripped FBS for at least 24 hours before adding agonist.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the presence of atRA in FBS and agree that it may introduce baseline levels of agonist. However, in our experiments, both the 1 nM and 100 nM atRA treatments resulted in observable changes in RAR expression levels (Figure S3C). Additionally, the luciferase assays demonstrated that 100 nM atRA significantly increased retinoic acid-responsive promoter activity (Figure S1C). Given these clear responses to atRA, we believe the observed lack of effect on the chromatin-bound fraction cannot be attributed to the presence of comparable or higher levels of atRA in the FBS, as the reviewer suggests. Moreover, since our results align with the established literature and do not impact the core findings of our study, we decided not to pursue the suggested experiments with charcoal-stripped FBS in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Photobleaching and its effect on bound fraction measurements:</p><p>The authors discard the first 500 to 1000 frames due to the high localization density in the initial frames. This will preferentially discard bound molecules that will bleach in the initial frames of the movie and lead to an over-estimation of the unbound fraction.</p><p>For experiments with over-expression of RAR-Halo and Halo-RXR, the authors state that the cells were pre-bleached and that these frames were used to calculate the mean intensity of the nuclei. When pre-bleaching, bound molecules will preferentially bleach before the diffusing population. This will again lead to an over-representation of the unbound fraction since this is the population that will remain relatively unaffected by the pre-bleaching. Indeed, the bound fraction for over-expressed RARa and RXRa is significantly lower than that for the corresponding knock in lines. To confirm whether this is a biological result, I suggest that the authors either reduce the amount of dye they use so that this pre-bleaching is not necessary or use the direct reactivation strategy they use for their PAPA experiments to eliminate the pre-bleaching step.</p><p>As for the measurement of the nuclear intensity, since the authors have access to multiple HaloTag dyes, they can saturate the HaloTagged proteins with a high concentration of JF646 or JFX650 to measure the mean intensity of the protein while still using the PA-JFX549 for SMT. Together, these will eliminate the need to prebleach or discard any frames.</p></disp-quote><p>The Janelia Fluor dyes used in our experiments are known for their high photostability (Grimm et al., 2021, <italic>JACS Au</italic>, doi: 10.1021/jacsau.1c00006). During the initial 80 ms imaging to calculate the mean nuclear intensity, the laser power was kept at very low intensity (~3%) for a brief duration (~10 seconds), in contrast to the high-intensity (~100%) used during the tracking experiments, which span around 3 minutes. This low-power illumination does not induce significant photobleaching but merely puts the dyes in a temporary dark state. Therefore, this pre-bleaching step closely resembles the direct reactivation strategy employed in our PAPA experiments.</p><p>To further address the reviewer's concern, we performed a frame cut-off analysis for our SMT movies of endogenous RARÎ±-Halo and over-expressed RARÎ±-Halo (Figure S9B). The analysis shows no significant change in the bound fraction of either endogenous or over-expressed RARÎ±-Halo when discarding the initial 1000 frames. Based on these results, we conclude that the pre-bleaching does not lead to an overestimation of the unbound fraction, and that our experimental approach is robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Heterogeneous expression of the SNAP fusion proteins:</p><p>The cell lines expressing SNAP tagged transgenes shown in Fig S6 have very heterogeneous expression of the SNAP proteins. While the bulk measurements done by Western blotting are useful, while doing single-cell experiments (especially with small numbers - ~20 - of cells), it is important to control for expression levels. Since these transgenic stable lines were not FACS sorted, it would be helpful for the reader to know the spread in the distribution of mean intensities of the SNAP proteins for the cells that the SMT data are presented for. This step is crucial while claiming the absence of an effect upon over-expression and can easily be done with a SNAPTag ligand such as SF650 using the procedure outlined for the over-expressed HaloTag proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there is heterogeneity in SNAP protein expression across the transgenic lines. In response to the reviewerâs suggestion, we performed the proposed experiment to assess the distribution of mean intensities for two key experimental conditions: Halo-RXRÎ± with overexpressed RARÎ±-SNAP and HaloRXRÎ± with overexpressed RARÎ±RR-SNAP. These results again confirm that the increase in chromatin-bound fraction of Halo-RXRÎ± is observed only in the presence of RARÎ± capable of heterodimerizing with RXRÎ±, supporting our main conclusion (Figure S9).</p><p>For these experiments, we followed the same labelling procedure described in the methods section for tracking endogenous Halo-tagged proteins alongside transgenic SNAP proteins. As shown in Figure S9, for ~ 70 cell nuclei, the distribution of mean intensities is similar for both conditions, with the bound fraction of Halo-RXRÎ± significantly increasing in the presence of RARÎ±-SNAP compared to RARÎ±RR-SNAP. This analysis underscores that the observed effects are indeed due to the functional differences between the two RARÎ± variants rather than variability in expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Definition of bound molecules:</p><p>The authors state that molecules with a diffusion coefficient less than 0.15 um2/s are considered bound and those between 1-15 um2/s are considered unbound. Clarification is needed on how this threshold was determined. In previous publications using saSPT, the authors have used a cutoff of 0.1 um2/s (for example, PMID 36066004, 36322456). Do the results rely on a specific cutoff? A diffusion coefficient by itself is only a useful measure of normal diffusion. Bound molecules are unlikely to be undergoing Brownian motion, but the state array method implemented here does not seem to account for non-normal diffusive modes. How valid is this assumption here?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the inconsistency in the diffusion coefficient thresholds for defining the chromatin-bound fraction used across our groupâs publications. The choice of threshold or cutoff (0.1 ÂµmÂ²/s vs 0.15 ÂµmÂ²/s) is largely arbitrary and does not significantly impact the results. To validate this, we tested the effect of different cutoffs on fbound (%) for endogenously expressed Halo-tagged RARÎ± and RXRÎ± (Figure S10). As shown in Figure S10, there was no substantial difference in fbound (%) calculated using a 0.1 ÂµmÂ²/s versus 0.15 ÂµmÂ²/s cutoff (e.g., RARÎ± clone c156: 47Â±1% vs 49Â±1%; RXRÎ± clone D6: 34Â±1% vs 35Â±1%).</p><p>Since we have consistently applied the 0.15 ÂµmÂ²/s cutoff throughout this manuscript across all experimental conditions, the comparative analysis of fbound (%) remains valid. While we agree that a Brownian diffusion model may not fully capture the motion of bound molecules, our state array model accounts for localization error, which likely incorporates some of the chromatin motion features. Moreover, the distinction between bound (&lt;0.15 ÂµmÂ²/s) and unbound (1-15 ÂµmÂ²/s) populations is sufficiently large that using a normal diffusion model is reasonable for our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Movies:</p><p>Since this is an imaging manuscript, I request the authors to provide representative movies for all the presented conditions. This is an essential component for a reader to evaluate the data and for them to benchmark their own images if they are to try to reproduce these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included representative movies for all the SMT experimental conditions presented in the manuscript. Please see data availability section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Definition of an ROI:</p><p>The authors state that &quot;ROI of random size but with maximum possible area was selected to fit into the interior of the nuclei&quot; while imaging. However, the readout speed of the Andor iXon Ultra 897 depends on the size of the defined ROI. If the ROI was variable for every movie, how do the authors ensure the same sampling rate?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the frame transfer mode on the Andor iXon Ultra 897 camera for our acquisitions, which allows for fast frame rate measurements without altering the exposure time between frames. Additionally, we verified the metadata of all our movies to ensure a consistent frame interval of 7.4 ms across all conditions.

Cos7 cells have been previously utilized in studies investigating the interaction between T2NRs (Kliewer et al., 1992, <italic>Nature</italic>, doi: 10.1038/355446a0). In our study, due to technical issues with antibodies for coIP in U2OS cells, we initially used Cos7 cells for control experiments to verify that Halo-tagging of RARÎ± and RXRÎ± did not disrupt their interaction, by transiently expressing the constructs in Cos7 cells. Following these control experiments, we confirmed the direct interaction of endogenously expressed RAR and RXR in U2OS cells with their respective binding partners using the SMT-PAPA assay. Since these results confirmed that Halo-tagging did not interfere with RAR-RXR interactions, we chose not to repeat the coIP experiments in U2OS cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study aims to investigate the stoichiometric effect between core factors and partners forming the heterodimeric transcription factor network in living cells at endogenous expression levels. Using state-of-the-art single-molecule analysis techniques, the authors tracked individual RARÎ± and RXRÎ± molecules labeled by HALO-tag knock-in. They discovered an asymmetric response to the overexpression of counter-partners. Specifically, the fact that an increase in RARÎ± did not lead to an increase in RXRÎ± chromatin binding is incompatible with the previous competitive core model. Furthermore, by using a technique that visualizes only molecules proximal to partners, they directly linked transcription factor heterodimerization to chromatin binding.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The carefully designed experiments, from knock-in cell constructions to singlemolecule imaging analysis, strengthen the evidence of the stoichiometric perturbation response of endogenous proteins. The novel finding that RXR, previously thought to be a target of competition among partners, is in excess provides new insight into key factors in dimerization network regulation. By combining the cutting-edge single-molecule imaging analysis with the technique for detecting interactions developed by the authors' group, they have directly illustrated the relationship between the physical interactions of dimeric transcription factors and chromatin binding. This has enabled interaction analysis in live cells that was challenging in single-molecule imaging, proving it is a powerful tool for studying endogenous proteins.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>As the authors have mentioned, they have not investigated the effects of other T2NRs or RXR isoforms. These invisible factors leave room for interpretation regarding the origin of chromatin binding of endogenous proteins (Recommendations 4). In the PAPA experiments, overexpressed factors are visualized, but changes in chromatin binding of endogenous proteins due to interactions with the overexpressed proteins have not been investigated. This might be tested by reversing the fluorescent ligands for the Sender and Receiver. Additionally, the PAPA experiments are likely to be strengthened by control experiments (Recommendations 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an interesting experiment. However, there are three technical challenges that complicate its implementation: First, as demonstrated in our original PAPA paper, dark state formation is less efficient when dyes are conjugated to Halo compared to SNAPf, making the reverse configuration less optimal. Second, SNAPf-tagged proteins have slower labeling kinetics than Halotagged proteins, often resulting in under-labeling of SNAPf. Third, our SNAPf transgenes were integrated polyclonally. Since background PAPA scales with the concentration of the sender-labeled protein, variable concentrations of the senderlabeled SNAPf proteins would introduce significant variability, complicating the interpretation of the background PAPA signal. Due to these concerns, we believe that performing reciprocal measurements with reversed fluorescent ligands may not yield reliable results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The term &quot;Surprising features&quot; in the title is ambiguous and may force readers to search for what it specifically refers to. Including a word that evokes specific features might be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings contradict previous work, which suggested that chromatin binding of T2NRs is regulated by competition for a limited pool of RXR. In contrast, we found that RAR expression can limit RXR chromatin binding, but not the other way around, which challenges the existing model. This unexpected result is what we refer to as a &quot;surprising feature&quot; in our title, and we believe it accurately reflects the novel insights our study provides. We also think that this is clearly conveyed in our manuscript abstract, supporting the use of &quot;Surprising features&quot; in the title.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) p.3, line 11 - The threshold of 0.15 Î¼m2s-1 seems to be a crucial value directly linked to the value of fbound. What is the rationale for choosing this specific value? If consistent conclusions can be obtained using threshold values that are similar but different, it would strengthen the robustness of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to Reviewer #2âs Public Review point 4. The threshold choice is arbitrary and doesnât affect the overall conclusions. To test this, we compared fbound (%) values calculated using both 0.1 Î¼mÂ²s-1 and 0.15 Î¼mÂ²s-1 cutoffs. For example, with endogenously expressed Halo-tagged RARÎ± (clone c156), we observed fbound values of 47Â±1% vs 49Â±1%, and for RXRÎ± (clone D6), 34Â±1% vs 35Â±1%, respectively (Figure S10). Since we have consistently applied the 0.15 Î¼mÂ²s-1 cutoff across all experimental conditions in this manuscript, the comparisons of fbound (%) between different conditions are robust and valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) p.4, line 13 - &quot;the fbound of endogenous RARÎ±-Halo (47{plus minus}1%) was largely unchanged upon expression of SNAP (47{plus minus}1%)&quot; part of the sentence is not surprising. It would make more sense if it were expressed as &quot;the fbound of endogenous RARÎ±-Halo (47{plus minus}1%) was largely unchanged upon expression of RXRÎ±-SNAP (49{plus minus}1%), consistent with the control SNAP (47{plus minus}1%).&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand how the original phrasing may be confusing to the readers and have restructured the sentence as suggested by the reviewer for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) p.6, line 26 - The discussion that &quot;most chromatin binding of endogenous RXRÎ± in U2OS cells depends on heterodimerization partners other than RARÎ±&quot; seems to contradict the top right figure in Figure 4. If that's the case, the binding partner for the bound red molecule might be yellow rather than blue. Given a decrease in the number of RARÎ± molecules with an unchanged binding ratio, the total number of binding molecules has decreased. Could it be interpreted that the potential reduction in RXRÎ± chromatin binding, accompanying the decrease in binding RARÎ±, is compensated for by other partners?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that both the yellow and blue molecules in Figure 4 represent T2NRs that can heterodimerize with RXR. For simplicity, we chose to omit the depiction of RXR dimerization with other T2NRs (represented in yellow) in Figure 4. We have now included a note in the figure caption to clarify this. We plan to follow up on the buffer capacity of RXR with other T2NRs in a separate manuscript and will discuss this aspect in more detail once we have data from those experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Fig. 3 - I expected that DR localizations always appear more frequently than PAPA localizations by the difference in the number of distal molecules. Why does the linear line for SNAP-RXRÎ± in Fig. 3 B have a slope exceeding 1? Also, although the sublinearity is attributed to binding saturation, is there any possibility that this sublinearity originates from the PAPA system like the saturation of PAPA reactivation? Control samples like Halo-SNAPf-3xNLS might address these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of DR and PAPA localizations depends on the arbitrarily chosen intensity and duration of green and violet light pulses. For any given protein pair, different experimental settings can result in PAPA localizations being greater than, less than, or equal to the number of DR localizations. Therefore, the informative metric is not the absolute number of DR and PAPA localizations, but rather how the ratio of PAPA to DR localizations changes between different conditionsâsuch as between interacting pairs and non-interacting controls.</p><p>Regarding the sublinearity, we agree that it is essential to consider whether the observed sublinearity might stem from saturation of the PAPA signal. We know of two ways in which this could occur:</p><p>First, PAPA can be saturated as the duration of the green light pulse increases and dark-state complexes are depleted. However, this cannot explain the nonlinearity that we observe, because the duration of the green light pulse is constant, and thus the probability that a given complex is reactivated by PAPA is also constant. Likewise, holding the violet pulse duration constant yields a constant probability that a given molecule is reactivated by DR. PAPA localizations are expected to scale linearly with the number of complexes, while DR localizations are expected to scale linearly with the total number of molecules. Sublinear scaling of PAPA localizations with DR localizations thus implies that the number of complexes scales sublinearly with the total concentration of the protein.</p><p>Second, saturation could occur if PAPA localizations are undercounted compared to DR localizations. While this is a valid concern, we consider it unlikely in this case because (1) our localization density is below the level at which our tracking algorithm typically undercounts localizations, and (2) we observe sublinearity for RXR â RAR PAPA even though the number of PAPA localizations is lower than the DR localizations; undercounting due to excessive localization density would be expected to introduce the opposite bias in this case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Fig. 4 - The differences between A, B, and C on the right side of the model are subtle, making it difficult to discern where to see.
