cortex architecture in the mammalian brain. One common theory is that the de-differentiation of topographic maps links to impairments in everyday behavior due to less precise functional map readouts. Here, we tested this theory by characterizing de-differentiated topographic maps in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of younger and older adults by means of ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging together with perceptual finger individuation and hand motor performance. Older adults’ SI maps showed similar amplitude and size to younger adults’ maps, but presented with less representational similarity between distant fingers. Larger population receptive field sizes in older adults’ maps did not correlate with behavior, whereas reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 related to worse finger individuation but better motor performance. Our data uncover the drawbacks of a simple de-differentiation model of topographic map function, and motivate the introduction of feature-based models of cortical reorganization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>pRF mapping</kwd><kwd>7 Tesla MRI</kwd><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>somatotopy</kwd><kwd>touch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ESIF/EFRE 2014-2020 FKZ: ZS/2016/04/78113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuehn</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KU 3711/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Doehler</surname><given-names>Juliane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project number: 423633679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name><name><surname>Doehler</surname><given-names>Juliane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003042</institution-id><institution>Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-A03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chrysidou</surname><given-names>Anastasia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SI topographic finger maps of older adults show signs of cortical aging but do not show classical hallmarks of cortical de-differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Topographic maps are a fundamental feature of cortex architecture and can be found in all sensory systems and in many motor systems of the mammalian brain. Topographic units organize subcortical brain structures such as the thalamus, the globus pallidus, and the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crabtree, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zeharia et al., 2015</xref>), primary sensory input and output areas such as primary sensory and motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>), and higher level integrative brain areas such as the medial and superior parietal cortices and the cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sereno and Huang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zeharia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zeharia et al., 2015</xref>). Topographic maps and their malfunctions give rise to a multitude of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and associated deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amedi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kikkert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Makin et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saadon-Grosman et al., 2015</xref>). This warrants a precise understanding of their organizational features and their associated adaptive and maladaptive behavior.</p><p>One common theory posits that the ‘de-differentiation’ of topographic maps represents one mechanism of their malfunction. Cortical de-differentiation can be conceptualized as greater map activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>), a larger topographic map area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalisch et al., 2009</xref>), but also more noisy topographic units and/or less cortical inhibition between neighboring topographic units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>). Such changes are particularly observed in older adults’ topographic maps, and one common model on cortical aging assumes ‘overactivated’ or more ‘de-differentiated’ topographic maps in older compared to younger adults, which are assumed to explain reduced sensory, motor, and cognitive abilities of older adults in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabeza, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassady et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dennis and Cabeza, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heuninckx et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Reuter-Lorenz and Lustig, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Riecker et al., 2006</xref>). However, the precise topographic features that characterize a presumably ‘de-differentiated’ map are so far not clarified, neither are the precise behavioral phenotypes that relate to different aspects of topographic map change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassady et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in younger and older adults as a model system to study the precise meso-scale features that characterize the presumably de-differentiated topographic maps of older adults, and their relation to behavior. Topographic maps in SI are a suitable model system to investigate basic aspects of cortical de-differentiation, because the tactile modality is not artificially corrected by glasses or hearing aids, and therefore offers access to the ‘pure’ architecture of the (altered) system. We assessed the functional architecture of topographic maps subject-wise at fine-grained detail using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla (7T-fMRI), and investigated sensory readouts as well as everyday hand movement capabilities of our participants. 7T-fMRI is a valuable method for describing fine-grained features of topographic maps, because it allows mapping small-scale topographic units, such as individual fingers, subject-wise and with high levels of accuracy and reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kolasinski et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kuehn and Sereno, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O'Neill et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, this allowed the precise description of features that characterize non-afferent maps in human SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>), SI map changes after short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kolasinski et al., 2016b</xref>), or movement-dependent maps in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huber et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To systematically characterize the meso-scale features of de-differentiated topographic maps and their relation to human behavior, we distinguished between global changes of the map that were present across topographic units (i.e. across finger representations), and local changes that only covered parts of the map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This distinction is relevant due to the nonhomogeneous use of individual fingers in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belić and Faisal, 2015</xref>), the non-uniform microstimulation-evoked muscle activity in motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Overduin et al., 2012</xref>), and for differentiating between age-dependent and use-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Makin et al., 2013a</xref>). We also distinguished between topographic map features that link to functional separation, as here tested by perceptual finger individuation and by motor tasks that rely on precise spatial acuity of the fingertip (i.e. Pegboard test, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>), and those that require functional integration, as here tested by perceptual finger confusion and a motor task that relies on haptic recognition involving multiple fingers (i.e. O’Connor Dexterity test). It is worth noting that local and global changes as well as integration and separation that are here introduced as different levels of the features ‘spatial extent’ and ‘functional readout’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), may be interlinked and may share common variance. For example, less finger individuation in one task may relate to more finger integration in another task, and both may influence motor behavior. However, their distinct investigation allows a precise understanding of how specific map features link to behavioral phenotypes (i.e. features-based model of cortical reorganization, FMC, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Feature-based characterization of meso-scale topographic maps in younger and older adults using 7T-fMRI and behavioral tests.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A feature-based model of cortical reorganization (FMC) requires a distinction between global and local map changes (factor of spatial extent), and between effects on functional integration versus effects on functional separation (factor of functional readout).

By combining ultra-high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging with population receptive field mapping, Fourier-based functional analyses, representational similarity analysis, psychophysics, and measures of everyday behavior, we could compare precise map features that differed between younger and older adults’ topographic maps, and link these to behavioral phenotypes relevant for everyday life. We could therefore test the basic assumption that de-differentiated cortical maps relate to impairments in everyday behavior. By targeting a mechanism that is assumed to be a hallmark feature of cortical aging, our data also help to uncover a fundamental principle of brain aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Surface area and % signal change of area 3b topographic maps do not differ significantly between younger and older adults</title><p>We used 7T-fMRI data to compare the fine-grained architecture of topographic finger maps in SI between younger and older adults. Older adults were expected to present with more ‘de-differentiated’ cortical maps compared to younger adults, which is assumed to link to higher map amplitude and larger map size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalisch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>). While undergoing fMRI scanning, younger and older adults were stimulated at the fingertips of their right hand using an automated piezoelectric stimulator, and different stimulation protocols (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants were stimulated at each finger at their 2.5-fold individual threshold to exclude topographic map changes that were due to peripheral (nerve or skin) differences between younger and older adults. We focused on topographic maps in area 3b of SI, because this area is the likely human homologue of the monkey SI cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaas, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Significant topographic finger maps in contralateral area 3b in response to finger stimulation were detected in younger and older adults, and across the group as a significant group effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for zoomed-in individual maps). The topographic Fourier-based maps were, as expected, composed of the thumb [D1], the index finger [D2], the middle finger [D3], the ring finger [D4], and the small finger [D5] in all individuals of both age groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The mean surface area that topographic maps covered in area 3b, % signal change within the map area, and mean f-values did not differ significantly between age groups (original surface area: <italic>t</italic>(34)=0.04, p=0.97, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.10; resampled surface area: <italic>t</italic>(34)=-0.15, p=0.88, <italic>d</italic> = 0.05; % signal change: <italic>t</italic>(34)=1.17, p=0.25, <italic>d</italic> = 0.38; f-value: t(34)=0.84, p=0.41, <italic>d</italic> = 0.28, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>). This was confirmed for % signal change using the two one-sided t-test (TOST) for equivalence. TOST is a frequentist alternative for testing for the equivalence by defining a band around 0 that constitutes the minimally-relevant effect size (ΔL and ΔU). TOST works (1) by running two t-tests, which test the null hypothesis that the effect is smaller than the maximum of the indifference area and larger than its minimum, and (2) by choosing the smaller of the two t-values. A significant result would reject this null hypothesis, indicating that the true value lies in the indifference area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lakens, 2017</xref>). This was the case for % signal change (t(34)=-2.11, p=0.000044), which was significant, that is equivalent. Statistical equivalence using the TOST test was not confirmed for mean f-values (<italic>t</italic>(34)=0.55, p=0.13).

For the ANOVA with the factors digit and age on tactile detection thresholds, we obtained a main effect of digit (F(4,192)=9.81, p&lt;0.001), a main effect of age (F(1,38)=48.56, p&lt;0.001), and an interaction between age and digit (F(4,192)=5.16, p&lt;0.01). <italic>Post hoc</italic> tests revealed that the main effect of digit was due to higher detection threshold for D1 compared to D4 (t(88.82) = 2.58, p&lt;0.05), for D1 compared to D5 (t(91.97) = 2.49, p&lt;0.05), for D2 compared to D4 (t(98)=2.42, p&lt;0.05), and for D2 compared to D5 (t(98)=2.33, p&lt;0.05).

At the same time, this effect could also reflect local changes in the topographic alignment between individual digit pairs. We used both absolute (Euclidean) and surface-based (geodesic) cortical distances measures to compare distances of digit representations in SI between younger and older adults to test for both global and local differences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We used peak representations and plotted each finger onto a three-dimensional grid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> for group averages and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for individual maps).

The main effect of finger-pair was due to increased Euclidean distances between D1 and D2 compared to D3 and D4 (<italic>t</italic>(35)=5.57, p&lt;0.00001), reduced Euclidean distances between D1 and D2 compared to D4 and D5 (<italic>t</italic>(35)=4.87, p&lt;0.0001), increased Euclidean distances between D2 and D3 compared to D3 and D4 (<italic>t</italic>(35)=3.24, p&lt;0.01), and reduced Euclidean distances between D2 and D3 compared to D4 and D5 (<italic>t</italic>(25)=2.93, p&lt;0.01) across age groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The interaction between finger-pair and age was driven by significantly reduced Euclidean distances between D2 and D3 in older adults compared to younger adults (Euclidean distance D2-D3 younger: 7.67 ± 0.80, D2-D3, older: 4.98 ± 0.40, p&lt;0.05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.98, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The latter effect was replicated for geodesic distances, where older adults showed significantly reduced geodesic distances compared to younger adults only between D2 and D3 (Geodesic distance D2-D3 younger: 7.80 mm ±0.72 mm, older: 5.72 mm ±0.64 mm, p&lt;0.05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.71, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The latter effect also presents as a trend when using center estimates instead of peak vertices as a metric for estimating digit location (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for full statistics and visualization).

Bayesian pRF modeling was employed to model pRFs in individual topographic maps, and to compare pRF sizes between younger and older adults. pRF centre locations were used to individuate the five fingers, and pRF sizes were extracted map- and finger-specific in each individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for individual data and for a comparison between pRF-based and Fourier-based topographic maps). An ANOVA with the factors age and finger calculated on pRF sizes was used to test for both global and local differences in pRF size.

Rather, at the global level, we observed slightly more aligned topographic maps in the group of older adults (i.e. slightly lower dispersion when aligning the vectors of participants’ Fourier maps within each age group), larger pRF sizes, more overlap between neighboring finger representations, and lower representational similarity between distant fingers in older adults. At the local level, we observed reduced cortical distances between the area 3b representations of the index finger and the middle finger in older adults. Some local and global functional map changes reflected the pattern of perceptual finger confusion, because older adults showed lower perceptual confusion between distant fingers (aligning with the lower representational similarity between them) and higher perceptual confusion between the index and the middle finger (aligning with the lower cortical distance between them) compared to younger adults. Because the latter result correlated with better performance in a motor task relying on haptic exploration, local cortical ‘de-differentiation’ (i.e. representations that are closer to each other) was here related to better motor performance in everyday life. These results are in three respects novel and even surprising.</p><p>Age-related differences in receptive field sizes in rats are restricted to the hindpaw representation and do not occur in the forepaw representation of SI, with more intensive use of the forepaw compared to the hindpaw assumed to be the underlying reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David-Jürgens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godde et al., 2002</xref>). In older rats, receptive fields in the hindpaw representation are less inhibitory and larger than receptive fields in younger rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David-Jürgens et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godde et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Spengler et al., 1995</xref>), which relates to worse walking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godde et al., 2002</xref>). This topographic pattern could not be replicated for humans in the present study, because we found larger pRF sizes in the hand area of older compared to younger participants, which does not corroborate the above described hindpaw-selective changes in rats. In contrast to rats, we also do not see a significant correlation between larger pRF sizes and worse motor control of the hand, neither for motor tasks that rely on precision grips nor for a motor task that relies on haptic exploration. We also do not see a significant correlation between pRF size and spatial tactile acuity at the fingertip. The behavioral relevance of increased pRF size in older humans therefore remains to be investigated.</p><p>We also do not see an increase in topographic map amplitude or topographic map size in older adults when the stimulation amplitude was adjusted to each finger of each individual. Similarly, we do not see an increased distance between the representations of the index finger and the small finger in older adults, as has been reported before. This does not corroborate the idea of a larger and ‘overactivated’ map in older adults. We did observe that older adults' maps show significantly higher response amplitudes compared to younger adults’ SI maps when all fingers are stimulated together at a fixed amplitude. Other studies, however, have found amplitude differences even if stimulation intensity was adjusted to the individual threshold (e.g. 2.5 times above sensory threshold, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>). This difference may be due to our stimulation paradigm where only two pins stimulated the skin at the same time, with randomly changing pins every 62 ms, reducing age-related differences in neuronal adaptation to influence the results. We also observed that topographic maps within the group of older adults were more aligned to each other than the topographic maps in younger adults. This questions the view that older adults’ topographic maps show higher degrees of stimulus-related noise, or are more disorganized. However, our data are in line with the assumption that changes in the inhibitory architecture in older adults’ SI explain larger somatosensory representations in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lenz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>). This view is supported by our finding that older adults have larger pRF sizes, greater overlap between neighboring finger representations, and show higher response amplitudes when all fingers are stimulated together; the latter could be due to decreased between-digit inhibition in older adults. Furthermore, decreased inhibition may also be one reason why the topographic maps within the group of older adults seem more consistent; this may be due to the less sharp representations of the fingers in SI.</p><p>The second finding that was not expected based on prior evidence is the reduced rather than enhanced representational similarity between distant finger representations in older compared to younger participants. The presumably more de-differentiated cortical maps were in fact less de-differentiated with respect to distant finger representations. It was even more astonishing that this effect related to a behavioral phenotype, because the fingers that showed less representational similarity in older adults (i.e. third-neighbor fingers) were also mixed up less perceptually (note, however, that we did not find a significant correlation between these two measures). So far, research has stressed that older adults' topographic maps are characterized by less rather than more distinct map organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassady et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>). However, subcortical U-fibers, which are located within the cortex or in the very outer parts of the subcortical white matter, particularly connect adjacent but not directly neighboring representations in the cortex. Short-association fibers are among the last parts of the brain to myelinate, and have very slow myelin turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reiser et al., 2007</xref>). Myelination and protracted maturation of short-association fibers can continue until the age of fifty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Fully myelinated U-fibers in older adults and less myelinated U-fibers in younger adults may explain higher correlated short-distance representations in older adults, and good performance in discriminating non-neighboring signals. This finding hints toward potentially better ‘abstract encoding’ in older adults, here defined as the distinct extraction of information from adjacent but not neighboring topographic units.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising finding of our study, however, is the reduced local cortical distances between the index and middle finger representations in older adults with preserved map size, where, previously, greater distances between fingers and larger map sizes were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalisch et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas the reduced cortical distance between neighboring fingers is in principle in line with a de-differentiation model of topographic map architecture, its relation to better rather than worse motor control is certainly not. In this respect, the distinction between functional readouts that capture integration versus separation seems relevant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Specifically, we found that reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 representations related to worse tactile discrimination between these two fingers (i.e. worse separation in a tactile task) but to better motor control in a task that required haptic object exploration and coordinated finger movements (i.e. improved integration in motor task). These findings highlight the importance of assessing different aspects of signal integration and signal separation to investigate the impact of functional map changes on everyday life. Because this relationship was only seen for the index and middle finger and not for the other fingers, also the factor of spatial extent (i.e. local versus global, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is relevant for comprehensive data analysis.</p><p>Interestingly, the reduced cortical distance between index and middle finger representations in older adults may explain the increased motor enslaving of the middle finger during index finger flexion, and the lower range of independent movements specifically of the index finger in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Van Beek et al., 2019</xref>). This can be assumed because passive stimulation of the fingers also activates finger maps in the primary motor cortex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Even though the interaction between tactile maps and motor maps warrants final clarification (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kuehn and Pleger, 2020</xref>), an interaction between both maps can be assumed in older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassady et al., 2020</xref>). Another interesting aspect is that the reduced cortical distances between index and middle finger representations in older adults may be explained by use-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Makin et al., 2013a</xref>). During everyday hand movements, the index and the middle finger correlate less with each other than other neighboring fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belić and Faisal, 2015</xref>), and the index finger is the most independent of the four fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ingram et al., 2008</xref>). During tactile learning, however, plasticity transfers more from the middle finger to the index finger than from the middle finger to the ring finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dempsey-Jones et al., 2016</xref>), which indicate their interaction. The observed local map changes may be induced by the correlated input of the middle and ring finger or ring finger and small finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kolasinski et al., 2016b</xref>), or by age-related changes in the local myeloarchitecture that link to functional map topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuehn et al., 2017b</xref>). Finally, because the reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 seems to have a beneficial relationship to motor control, also the increased coupling of D2 and D3 during haptic exploration may explain the observed effect. In either way, a positive relationship between increased cortical de-differentiation and impairments in everyday hand use is not supported by our data.</p><p>Also the observed age-related differences in representational similarity between distant finger representations can be discussed in the light of use-dependent versus age-dependent plasticity. One way to explain less representational similarity between distant finger representations in older adults is to assume a greater clustering of D1, D2 and D3 and/or of D4 and D5 with increased hand use. This could explain why the similarity between the representations of D1 and D4 and between D2 and D5 is lower in older adults. However, we do not see an interaction between finger and age in representational similarity, resting state correlations, or dice coefficients, which would be expected if a finger-specific clustering of D1 and D2 or D4 and D5 existed. Rather, we observe a specific shift of D2 and D3 toward each other, an effect that positively relates to hand dexterity. However, this shift does not correlate with the reduced representational similarity between distant fingers within the group of older adults. A direct relationship between these two measures can therefore not be established based on our data. On the other hand, we observed a significant correlation between N3 representational similarity and individual age in older adults, which hints towards a potential critical role of the factor age for the development of reduced similarity between distant finger pairs, and could be established via U-fiber maturation, as discussed above. Nevertheless, because we do not have information about hand use patterns of our participants, the effect of hand use on our data cannot be specifically investigated here.</p><p>Taken together, both in the case of cortical distance, where more local ‘de-differentiation’ related to better hand dexterity, and in the case of representational similarity, where presumably more ‘de-differentiated’ cortical maps showed less representations similarity at distant locations, a simple de-differentiation model of cortex function does not seem to appropriately reflect the empirical data. In our view, topographic maps should not be classified according to their ‘de-differentiation-level’ but according to specific map features that take into account spatial extent (global versus local map changes) and functional readout (integration versus separation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Even though not exhaustive, this distinction facilitates the precise investigation of how specific map features relate to corresponding functional readouts such as cortical integration or cortical separation in sensory or motor tasks. For example, whereas reduced cortical distances may increase the local integration of cortical signals, this may benefit tasks that require coordinated finger movements but may worsen tasks that require finger individuation. The distinction between local and global map features is particularly relevant when distinguishing between use-dependent and age-dependent topographic map plasticity, and between adaptive versus maladaptive plasticity. In our data, the local shifts of the index and middle finger representations towards each other seem to have adaptive consequences, whereas maladaptive consequences for global changes in pRF sizes were not identified. However, future research should specifically investigate the effect of use-dependent plasticity on older adults SI maps (an aspect that was not investigated here) to dissociate between adaptive and maladaptive plasticity.</p><p>This approach sheds new light on future interventions and training paradigms that aim at speeding up, slowing down, or reversing neuroplastic processes in the cortex. Repeated sensory stimulation of the skin induces NMDA-dependent Hebbian plasticity at the corresponding cortical territory, a mechanism that improves local spatial discrimination thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dinse et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kuehn et al., 2017a</xref>). Synchronous stimulation of more than one finger, but also glueing of multiple fingers, has been used to induce neuroplastic processes of topographic map architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kolasinski et al., 2016b</xref>). Synchronous stimulation of all five fingers causes less mislocalizations to nearby digits and more mislocalizations to distant digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kalisch et al., 2007</xref>), whereas temporal gluing of the index finger to the middle finger induces a shift of the ring finger toward the small finger, accompanied by less cortical overlap between the middle and the ring finger. This intervention also caused lower thresholds in temporal order judgments between the middle finger and the ring finger, and higher thresholds in temporal order judgments between the ring finger and the small finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kolasinski et al., 2016b</xref>). Integrating previous knowledge with our data leads to the assumption that concurrent stimulation of <italic>distant</italic> but not neighboring topographic units and/or correlated input to topographic units that neighbor the affected ones (here the <italic>ring finger and small finger</italic> instead of the index finger and the middle finger) may be particularly beneficial to induce adaptive neuroplasticity in aging topographic maps. This principle can be applied to other cases of distorted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saadon-Grosman et al., 2015</xref>) or preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Makin et al., 2013b</xref>) map architectures in clinical cases. At a more abstract level, these data indicate that a precise characterization of local and global map changes and their relation to mechanisms of signal integration and separation is a prerequisite for the development of beneficial and individualized training strategies that aim at stopping or reversing maladaptive topographic map change.</p><p>One limitation of this study is the relatively low sample size, where MRI data of n = 17 older and n = 19 younger adults are presented. This limitation is due to current procedures and restrictions in ultra-high field scanning, and their stringent exclusion criteria. It has the consequence that both type I and type II errors are more difficult to reduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>). To reduce type I error, we performed corrections for multiple comparisons and reduced the number of performed statistical tests to the minimum number needed to test our hypotheses. To reduce type II errors, we report and follow-up statistical trends (i.e. p&gt;0.5 and&lt;0.1), for example for the interaction between age and neighbor on perceptual confusion.</p><p>In summary, we here provide a comprehensive description of ‘de-differentiated’ topographic maps in SI, and detail the topographic map features that relate to cortical aging. Our data may inspire future research on cortical plasticity, and may motivate the distinction between local and global changes of the map area in relation to functional readout that may either benefit integration or separation of neuronal representations. Future neuroimaging studies with larger cohorts will uncover global topographic map features and their relation to behaviorally relevant neuroplasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We tested n = 25 younger adults (mean age 25 ± 0.49, ranging from 21 to 29 years, 13 male and 12 female) and n = 25 older adults (mean age 72.2 ± 0.81, ranging from 65 to 78 years, 13 male and 12 female) for sensorimotor behavior at the right hand (sample size for touch thresholds, tactile mislocalization and pegboard test based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>, sample size for topographic shift based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalisch et al., 2009</xref>). According to the Edinburgh handedness questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oldfield, 1971</xref>), all participants were right-handed (laterality index ranging from +40 to+100, M = 84.73 ± 18.18). Participants were recruited from the database of the DZNE Magdeburg. Due to the strict exclusion criteria for 7T-MR measurements (see below), participant recruitment and testing took 4 years in total (2016–2020). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) was used as a screening tool to assess the possibility of mild cognitive dysfunction amongst participants. Inclusion criteria were (i) no medication that influenced the central nervous system, (ii) intact hand function (sensory and motor), (iii) 7T-MRI compatibility (see below), and (iv) no sign of early dementia (note that n = 1 older adult had a MOCA score of 21; he showed good performance in all tests and was included in the analyses). The MOCA score of the other participants ranged between 25 and 30 (M = 28.44 ± 0.25).</p><p>We reinvited participants for one 3T-MRI session and one 7T-MRI session. Before the behavioral tests, participants were already screened for 7T-MRI exclusion criteria such as metallic implants and other foreign bodies, active implants (e.g. pacemaker, neurostimulators, cochlear implants, defibrillators, and pump system), permanent makeup, tinnitus, or hearing impairments. Due to changes in health conditions between the behavioral and MR-measurements, and/or due to stricter MR-regulations due to COVID-19 that were implemented in March 2020, we could reinvite n = 20 younger adults and n = 18 older adults of the original cohort for the MRI measurements. For n = 1 younger adult and n = 1 older adult, the 7T-MRI session could not be completed successfully. Therefore, MR analyses are presented for n = 19 younger adults (10 female, nine male, mean age: 24.89 years), and n = 17 older adults (eight female, nine male, mean age: 69.12 years). All participants were paid for their attendance and written informed consent was received from all participants before starting the experiment. The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>General procedure</title><p>Participants were invited to four appointments. There were two appointments for behavioral tests (one for digit confusion, detection thresholds, and hand dexterity, and one for the two-point-discrimination task), one appointment for a 7T-fMRI session where all fMRI data were acquired, and one appointment for a 3T-MRI session where a T1-based image was acquired used for cortex segmentation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for an overview of experimental design, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for an overview of analyses pipelines).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Digit confusion</title><p>The behavioral tests took place on the first testing day. To estimate perceptual digit confusion, a tactile finger mislocalization task was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schweizer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schweizer et al., 2000</xref>) that is assumed to reflect SI map topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kalisch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schweizer et al., 2001</xref>). First, the detection threshold of each finger was estimated. During testing, participants sat on a chair with the hand positioned palm upwards on a foam cushion. The tested hand was occluded from view. Participants heard white noise through headphones during the task. Before the experiment started, five points were marked on the participant’s fingertips via a felt-tip pen: one point at the center of the volar surface of the first segment of each digit (D1-D5). The detection threshold was estimated for each finger separately with a two-alternative forced choice task. For each finger, mechanical forces were applied to the marked area of the fingertip using Semmes Weinstein monofilaments (Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments; Baseline R, Fabrication Enterprises Inc, White Plains, NY, USA, applied weights: 0.008 g, 0.02 g, 0.04 g, 0.07 g, 0.16 g, 0.4 g, 0.6 g, 1.0 g, 1.4 g, 2.0 g, 4.0 g, 6.0 g). These calibrated filaments assert the same amount of pressure once the filament is bent. Stimulation duration was 1 s. At each trial, two intervals were presented with only one of them containing a stimulation. Participants were asked to detect the stimulation interval by pressing the respective key on the keyboard in a self-paced manner (‘1’ or ‘2’). For stimulus application, the experimenter followed auditory instructions via headphones. Neither the hand nor the experimenter were visible to the participant during testing. A randomized sequence (different for each participant) was used to determine which interval contained the stimulation. The adaptive thresholding procedure followed a 3-down/1-up staircase algorithm. Two such staircases were used in an alternating manner, one started at 0.4 g, the other at 0.02 g. The threshold was estimated if the standard deviation from the mean in stimulus intensity was equal or less than one step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gescheider et al., 1996</xref>). This was repeated five times, once per finger, in a randomized sequence. The task took approximately 60 to 75 min.</p><p>After a short break, the finger mislocalization task was applied using Semmes Weinstein monofilaments. The stimulation sites were the same as for the tactile detection task (marked area at fingertip, see above). For each finger, the applied force matched the respective tactile detection threshold as assessed before. Therefore, both younger and older adults were stimulated at each finger at their individual tactile detection threshold, controlling for individual and finger-specific variability in tactile sensitivity. Each trial started with a 3 s stimulation interval, where stimulation was applied to one of five possible fingertips. Stimulation duration was 1 s. The beginning and end of this interval were marked by computer-generated tones. In this five-alternative-forced-choice test, participants were provided with 7 s time to verbally name the finger where they felt the touch. Previous studies showed similar tactile misattributions for verbal versus motor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badde et al., 2019</xref>). This long response interval was chosen to prevent speed-accuracy trade-offs for older compared to younger adults. If participants did not feel touch at none of the fingers (note that touch was applied at individual thresholds and was therefore expected to be perceived in only around 50% of the cases), they were motivated to name their best guess. The next trial started once the experimenter had inserted the response into the computer. Each finger was stimulated 20 times, stimulation order was pseudo-randomized for each participant in a way that there was maximally one repetition in each sequence. All testing was done by one of the authors (A.C.). Because the results of this task are stable across multiple runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schweizer et al., 2000</xref>), all testing was done within one session. The task took approximately 20 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hand dexterity</title><p>Three standard tests were then used to test individual levels of hand motor function (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>Purdue Pegboard Test</italic> is composed of two rows of 25 small holes each, and one larger hole at the top that contains 25 small metal pins. The task was to pick one pin at a time with the right hand, and insert them into the holes on the right side of the board from top to bottom. If one of the metal pins dropped during the transfer, participants were instructed to continue with the next one. We measured the time to complete the test (in s), and the number of dropped pins (n). The <italic>Grooved Pegboard Test</italic> is composed of a 5 × 5 matrix of small (grooved) holes, and one larger hole at the top that contains 31 small metal pins. The task was to pick one pin at a time with the right hand, and insert them into the holes from left to right. Other than the Purdue Pegboard Test, this task requires changing the orientation of the pins such that they fit into the grooved holes (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). If one of the metal pins dropped during the transfer, participants were instructed to continue with the next one. We measured the time to complete the test (in s), and the number of dropped pins (n). The <italic>O’Connor Finger Dexterity Test</italic> is the most difficult test of these three, and is composed of a 10 × 10 matrix of small holes, and one larger hole at the top that contains 315 small, thin metal sticks. Participants were asked to pick three sticks at a time with their right hand, and place all of them into a small hole, starting from left to right. This required orienting the three sticks within one hand in a way that they would fit into the small hole. If one of the sticks dropped during the transfer, they were instructed to again pick three sticks out of the hole. Because there are strong individual and age-related differences in this test, participants were here given 4 min time to fill as many holes as possible. We measured the number of holes that were successfully filled with three metal sticks (n) as well as the number of dropped sticks (n).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Spatial acuity</title><p>A tactile two-point discrimination task was used to assess individual spatial acuity performance of the participant’s right D2 (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kalisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pleger et al., 2016</xref>). At a separate behavioral testing day, two rounded pins (diameter = 0.4 mm) were simultaneously applied to the skin surface of the fingertip. A fully automatic stimulation device controlled by the commercial software package Presentation (version 16.5, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc, Albany, CA, USA) moved the pins up and down. Amplitude of pin movement was adjusted to individual detection thresholds of mechanical forces, but was at least set to 1.2 mm. Pin spacing ranged from 0.7 to 2.8 mm (in steps of 0.3 mm) for younger adults and 0.7 to 6.3 mm (in steps of 0.8 mm) for older adults. Additionally, a single pin (control condition) was included. Pin spacing was vertically adjusted by moving a rotatable disc containing all possible conditions (n = 9 altogether). Pin conditions were pseudo-randomly presented in a two-alternative forced-choice task. Participants were asked to judge whether they felt one or two pins touching their fingertip. Only if they were sure of feeling two points of contact they were instructed to answer ‘two pins felt’. Decisions were indicated by mouse button press using the left hand. To prevent order effects, unique sequence lists of pin conditions were used per participant and task block. All participants performed two task blocks. Each task block included 90 trials (10 repetitions per pin condition). Intertrial intervals varied between 1 and 5 s (in steps of 1 s) and were pseudo-randomized to avoid fixed clock cycles gating reactions. All participants sat in front of a screen signalizing the beginning and ending of a task block. The right D2 was fixated on the stimulator, and the hand was covered by a white box during the task to prevent effects caused by seeing the stimulated finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardini et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>MR sequences</title><p>Data was acquired at a whole body 7 Tesla MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) in Magdeburg using a 32 Channel Nova Medical head coil.

The same sequence was used for all functional tasks (see below). 3T-MRI data were acquired at the Philips 3T Achieva dStream MRI scanner, where a standard structural 3D MPRAGE was acquired (resolution: 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm x 1.0 mm, TI = 650 ms, echo spacing = 6.6 ms, TE = 3.93 ms, α = 10°, bandwidth = 130 Hz/pixel, FOV = 256 mm×240 mm, slab thickness = 192 mm, 128 slices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Physiological data recording</title><p>A pulse oximeter (NONIN Pulse Oxymeter 8600-FO) clipped to the index finger of the participant’s left hand was used to measure the pulse during functional scanning at the 7T-MRI scanner.

One stimulator was attached to the tip of each right finger using a custom-build, metal-free applicator that could be fitted to individual hand and finger sizes. Each stimulator had eight individually-controlled pins arranged in a 2 × 4 array, covering 2.5 × 9 mm<sup>2</sup> of skin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Vibrotactile stimulation was applied to the fingertips at a frequency of 16 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schweizer et al., 2008</xref>). Stimulation intensity of each subject and each finger was adjusted to 2.5 times the individual tactile detection thresholds. To minimize adaptation-related differences in map activity between younger and older adults, two randomly chosen pins were raised once at a time, yielding 16 pin combinations per second (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schweisfurth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schweisfurth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schweisfurth et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Participants first underwent two phase-encoded protocols, and then continued with two blocked-design protocols. The phase-encoded protocols consisted of 2 runs of 20 cycles each. Each cycle lasted 25.6 s, stimulation was applied to each fingertip for 5.12 s, and for 20 times. Stimulation was delivered either in a forward order (D1- &gt; D5) or in a reverse order (D5- &gt; D1, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Half of the participants of each age group started with the forward-run, the other half started with the reverse-run. One run comprised 256 scans (512 s for a TR of 2 s), and lasted for 8 min and 31 s. Participants were instructed to covertly count short randomly distributed interrupts embedded in the tactile stimulation (duration 180 ms, slightly longer than in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schweisfurth et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schweisfurth et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schweisfurth et al., 2011</xref> to account for the effect of age). There were the same number of gaps in each run (15 gaps in total).</p><p>The blocked-design paradigm comprised six conditions: Stimulation to D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, and a rest condition with no stimulation. The same stimulation protocol as in the phase-encoded design was used (each finger was stimulated for 5.12 s, same frequency and stimulation duration). Fingers were here stimulated in a pseudo-random sequence, where there was never one finger stimulated more than two times in a row. In 70% of the trials, there was a 2 s pause between two subsequent stimulations, in 30% of the trials, there was a 6 s pause between two subsequent stimulations. This was counterbalanced across fingers. Each finger was stimulated 10 times. One run comprised 208 scans, and lasted for 6 min and 56 s. The same task was applied as in the phase-encoded paradigm. The blocked-design run was repeated twice. Subsequently, two runs were measured where a one-TR stimulation of all five fingers was followed by a 11-TR rest without any stimulation. This sequence was repeated 10 times for each run, with two runs in total. Finally, we acquired a 5 min resting state scan, where participants were asked to look at a centrally presented fixation cross, and to think about nothing in particular. All functional measurements together took around 40 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavioral analyses: digit confusion</title><p>Using an adaptive staircase procedure, the detection threshold was estimated if the standard deviation from the mean in stimulus intensity was equal or less than one step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gescheider et al., 1996</xref>). These values were transformed logarithmically (log<sub>10</sub>0.1mg), and were used as stimulation intensities for the mislocalization task. Mislocalizations were defined as responses where participants indicated another finger than the one that was stimulated, that is as false responses. These were analysed with respect to their distribution across the non-stimulated fingers. Mislocalizations were grouped according to their distance to the stimulated finger into 1st neighbor, 2nd neighbor, 3rd neighbor, and 4th neighbor (N1-N4) mislocalizations (e.g. if D2 was stimulated and the participant assigned the touch to D4, this was a N2 mislocalization, if the participant assigned the touch to D5 instead, this was a N3 mislocalization, and so forth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schweizer et al., 2000</xref>). No errors for one specific finger were computed as zero values. The resulting distribution of the relative number of mislocalizations towards N1-N4 was compared to the expected equal distribution of mislocalizations for each finger using the <italic>G</italic>-test of goodness of fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sokal and Rohlf, 1981</xref>). An equal distribution is expected if the naming of the localization is at chance level and does not follow the principles of topographic arrangement, where more mislocalizations are expected to closer neighbors compared to distant neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schweizer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schweizer et al., 2000</xref>). In this analysis, the different distributions of response options for the different neighbors were taken into account (i.e. the fact that across all fingers, there are more response options for 1st compared to 2nd, 2nd compared to 3rd, and 3rd compared to 4th neighbor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schweizer et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>G</italic>-tests of goodness of fit were Holm-Bonferroni corrected at a significance threshold of p&lt;0.05.</p><p>To calculate hit rates, for each participant, the number of correctly perceived stimulus locations was accumulated for each finger and divided by the number of stimulations of that finger. This resulted in the proportion of correct responses (hit rates) in percent for each finger. False alarms were defined as the number of times that this same finger was falsely identified as the one being stimulated when actually not touched. This is irrespective of which finger was touched that time (i.e. it could be misclassified when N1, N2, N3 or N4 was touched). For the estimation of <italic>d’</italic>, hits and false alarms were first converted to <italic>z</italic>-scores. The false alarm <italic>z</italic>-scores were then subtracted from the hit rate <italic>z</italic>-scores, and the sensitivity index was obtained for each finger separately. The beta criterion (bias) was further calculated for each finger based on the <italic>z</italic>-scores by estimating the exponential of the difference between the false alarm <italic>z</italic>-scores and the hit rate <italic>z</italic>-scores, each raised to a power of two, and divided by 2. To overcome the problem of missing events, the loglinear transformation was applied to the analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stanislaw and Todorov, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The distribution of mislocalizations (in %) was used for an ANOVA with the factors neighbor (N1-N4) and age (younger, older). To test for finger-specific effects, an ANOVA was calculated for each digit with the factors response digit and age (younger, older). For D1, response digit was specified as D2, D3, D4, D5; for D2, it was specified as D1, D3, D4, D5, and so forth. To estimate whether age-dependent changes in mislocalizations are due to age-related differences in sensitivity and/or bias, two ANOVAs with the factors digit (D1-D5) and age (younger, older) were also conducted for sensitivity and bias. In the case of sensitivity, the sensitivity index <italic>d’</italic> was used as a dependent variable and in the case of bias, the beta criterion was used as a dependent variable. Robust ANOVAs were calculated if the distribution of values in the non-normality distributed data was skewed, ANOVAs were calculated if the data were normally distributed, or if only sub-groups of the data were not normally distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glass et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harwell et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lix et al., 1996</xref>).

Recon-all is a fully automated image processing pipeline, which, among other steps, performs intensity correction, transformation to Talairach space, normalization, skull-stripping, subcortical and white-matter segmentation, surface tessellation, surface refinement, surface inflation, sulcus-based nonlinear morphing to a cross-subject spherical coordinate system, and cortical parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dale et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fischl et al., 1999</xref>).

To resolve these problems, two EPIs with opposite phase-encoding (PE) polarity were acquired before the functional scan. A point spread function (PSF) mapping method was applied to perform distortion correction of both EPIs with opposite PE polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">In et al., 2016</xref>). PSF mapping allows reliable distortion mapping due to its robustness to noise and field inhomogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Robson et al., 1997</xref>). Because the amount of spatial information differs between the opposite PE datasets, a weighted combination of the two distortion-corrected images was incorporated to maximize the spatial information content of the final, corrected image. The EPI-images of the functional blocks were motion corrected to time-point = 0, and the extended PSF method was applied to the acquired and motion-corrected images to perform geometrically accurate image reconstruction. Finally, after data acquisition, slice timing correction was applied to the functional data to correct for differences in image acquisition time between slices using SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK).</p><p>Functional time series were then registered to the T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE used for recon-all using csurf tkregister (12 degrees of freedom, non-rigid registration). The resulting registration matrix was used to map the x,y,z location of each surface vertex into functional voxel coordinates. The floating point coordinates of points at varying distances along the surface normal to a vertex were used to perform nearest neighbor sampling of the functional volume voxels (i.e. the 3D functional data were associated with each vertex on the surface by finding which voxel that point lay within). Because time series of the different cycle directions (D1- &gt; D5 and D5- &gt; D1) were mirror-symmetric to each other, they were averaged time point by time point by reversing the direction of time on a scan-by-scan basis. The time-reversed cycle direction (D5- &gt; D1 cycle) was time-shifted before averaging by 4 s (=2 TRs) to compensate for hemodynamic delay. Averaging was done in 3D without any additional registration. Note that data were neither normalized nor smoothed (beyond interpolation during registration) during this procedure. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for an overview of the representational spaces in which data of the different analyses pipelines were analyzed.</p><p>Moreover, physiological fluctuations originating from cardiac pulsation and respiration are considered a primary source of noise in functional MR data sets, particularly for resting state data acquired at high-field strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krüger and Glover, 2001</xref>). The resting-state functional data were therefore corrected for pulse- and respiration-induced noise. To prepare the physiological data for noise correction and to remove acquisition artifacts, we used the open-source Python-based software ‘PhysioNoise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kelley et al., 2008</xref>). Resulting respiratory and cardiac phase data were then used to correct the resting-state time series for pulse- and respiration-induced noise by performing RETROspective Image CORrection (RETROICOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Glover et al., 2000</xref>) on a slice-by-slice basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birn et al., 2006</xref>). Residuals were taken as cleaned data to regress out motion-related noise parameters (extracted from the raw data) using the program vresiduals implemented in LIPSIA (freely available for download at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lipsia-fmri/lipsia">github.com/lipsia-fmri/lipsia</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lohmann et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, the data were high-pass filtered at 0.01 Hz (allowing frequencies faster than 0.01 Hz to pass) using the program vpreprocess implemented in LIPSIA. For n = 9 participants, physiological data could not successfully be acquired due to a loss of the pulse oximeter and/or loosening of the breathing belt during scanning, which interrupted successful physiological data sampling. For n = 4 participants, we observed severe motion artifacts for the resting state data. Therefore, resting state analyses are presented for a subset of participants only (n = 12 younger and n = 12 older adults).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Phase-encoded analyses</title><p>The program Fourier implemented in csurf (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/.tmp/dist/csurf">http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~sereno/.tmp/dist/csurf</ext-link>) was used to conduct statistical analyses on the averaged individual time series of the averaged forward- and reversed-order runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>). Csurf was used to run discrete Fourier transformations on the time course at each 3D voxel, and then calculates phase and significance of the periodic activation. There were 20 stimulation cycles, which were used as input frequencies. No spatial smoothing was applied to the data before statistical analyses. Frequencies below 0.005 Hz were ignored for calculating signal-to-noise, which is the ratio of amplitude at the stimulus frequency to the amplitudes of other (noise) frequencies. Very low frequencies are dominated by movement artifacts, and this procedure is identical to linearly regressing out signals correlated with low frequency movements. High frequencies up to the Nyquist limit (1/2 the sampling rate) were allowed. This corresponds to no use of a low-pass filter. For display, a vector was generated whose amplitude is the square root of the F-ratio calculated by comparing the signal amplitude at the stimulus frequency to the signal at other noise frequencies and whose angle was the stimulus phase. The data were then sampled onto the individual freesurfer surface. To minimize the effect of superficial veins on BOLD signal change, superficial points along the surface normal to each vertex (upper 20% of the cortical thickness) were disregarded. The mean value of the other layers (20–100% cortical depth) were used to calculate individual maps. On the individual subject level, clusters that survived a surface-based correction for multiple comparisons of p&lt;0.01 (correction was based on the cluster size exclusion method as implemented by surfclust and randsurfclust within the csurf FreeSurfer framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hagler et al., 2006</xref>), and a cluster-level correction of p&lt;0.001, were defined as significant. On the group level, clusters that survived a cluster-filtered correction of the F-values were considered significant (pre-cluster statistical threshold of p&lt;0.01, and minimum surface area of 14 mm<sup>2</sup>, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hagler et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Complex-valued data from each individual subject’s morphed sphere were also sampled to the canonical icosahedral sphere (7th icosahedral sub-tessellation) surface.

Surface area measurements were extracted by calculating the sum of ⅓ of the area of each of the triangles surrounding that vertex. Surface area was defined as the summed vertex-wise area of the significant area 3b map. We report two sums: the surface area as of the individual surface (the. area file), and the surface area of the original surface (the lh.area file). F-values of the Fourier model from the significant tactile map area in area 3b were extracted subject-by-subject, and were then averaged. To estimate mean response amplitudes of the tactile maps (in %), we estimated the discrete Fourier transform response amplitude (hypotenuse given real and imaginary values) for each vertex within the significant map area. This value was multiplied by two to account for positive and negative frequencies, again multiplied by two to estimate peak-to-peak values, divided by the number of time points over which averaging was performed (to normalize the discrete Fourier transform amplitude), and divided by the average brightness of the functional data set (excluding air). Finally, the value was multiplied by 100 to estimate percentage response amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>). Independent-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests with a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of p&lt;0.0125 were used to compare mean F-values, mean response amplitude, and mean surface area (current and original surface) between younger and older adults. The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to test for normality of the data.</p><p>In addition, a ‘winner-takes-it-all’ approach was employed to investigate finger-specific differences in mean F-values, mean response amplitude, and mean surface area between age groups. Within the significant topographic map area as specified above, for each vertex, it was estimated on the surface whether it could be assigned to D1, D2, D3, D4, or D5 using finger-specific <italic>t</italic>-values. F-values and response amplitudes could then be extracted and averaged in a finger-specific way. We computed an ANOVA with the factors age and digit on these three measures to investigate main effects and interactions. Main effects and interactions with a p-value below 0.05 were specified as significant.</p><p>For non-significant results that were interpreted as evidence for the absence of an effect, we conducted statistical tests of equivalence using the two one-sided t-test (TOST). TOST is a frequentist alternative for testing for the equivalence by defining a band around 0 that constitutes a minimally-relevant effect size (Δ<italic><sub>L</sub></italic> and Δ<italic><sub>U</sub></italic>). TOST was employed (1) by running two t-tests, testing the null hypothesis that the effect is smaller than the maximum of the indifference area and larger than its minimum, and (2) by choosing the smaller of the two <italic>t</italic>-values. A significant result would reject this null hypothesis, indicating that the true value lies in the indifference area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lakens, 2017</xref>). To determine ΔL and ΔU, we used an approach suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Simonsohn, 2015</xref> who argue that in order to determine boundaries for equivalence tests, the boundaries should be set to the effect size of the distribution where a difference could be detected with 33% power. In the TOST procedure, the null hypothesis is the presence of a true effect of ΔL or ΔU, and the alternative hypothesis is an effect that falls within the equivalence bounds or the absence of an effect that is worthwhile to examine. If a p-value is below 0.05, we assumed the absence of an effect that is worthwhile to examine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Consistency of map alignment</title><p>We estimated the vertex-wise consistency of the map gradient within each age group using the dispersion index <italic>d</italic>, which is described as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The individual vectors that are referred to here are the vectors generated during the first-level Fourier analyses as outlined above (‘Phase-encoded analyses’).

The analyses were performed on the two blocked-design runs (run 3 and run 4 of the experiment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because we treated each finger individually and independently, BOLD activation elicited by each finger’s tactile stimulation was treated as an independent measure in the quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ann Stringer et al., 2014</xref>). We modeled one session with five regressors of interest each (stimulation to D1, D2, D3, D4, D5). We computed five linear contrast estimates: Touch to D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 (e.g. the contrast [4 -1 -1 -1 -1] for touch to D1). Frame-to-frame displacement of realignment parameters (first two shift regressors and rotation regressors) did not differ significantly between age groups (all p&gt;0.5). Given that functional and anatomical data were not normalized, no group statistics were performed with SPM. Instead, on the individual subject level, voxels that survived a significance threshold of p&lt;0.05 (uncorrected) and <italic>k</italic> &gt; 3 were mapped onto the cortical surfaces using the procedure as described above. These thresholded contrast images were used for finger mapping analyses on the individual subject level within the FSL-framework, that is, for calculating the overlap between neighboring finger representations, and for defining regions-of-interest for resting state data extraction (see below).</p><p>We also used fixed-effects models on the 1st level using the GLM as implemented in SPM8 to compute response amplitudes in response to the stimulation of all fingers together at the same (maximal) stimulation amplitude. The analyses were performed on the two stimulation runs (runs 5 and run 6 of the experiment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We modeled both sessions with two regressors of interest, ‘on’ and ‘off’ stimulation periods. The ‘on’ and ‘off’ stimulation maps were mapped onto the cortical surfaces using the procedure as described above. Signal amplitude was calculated vertex-wise within the region-of-interest as defined above (see ‘Phase-encoding analyses’) by calculating the difference value between ‘on’ and ‘off’ stimulation phases, divided by the baseline value. These data were averaged and compared between groups using a two-tailed independent sample t-test with a significance level of p&lt;0.05.</p><p>Finally, we also used GLM to reduce the number of voxel time courses used for pRF analysis (see section below ‘Bayesian pRF modeling’ for details).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Representational similarity analysis</title><p>For all participants, beta values (i.e. finger versus baseline) were extracted from each single finger receptive area within area 3b. Anterior-posterior boundaries were taken from Freesurfer surface labels. Significant tactile maps in each participant (see ‘Phase-encoded analyses’) were used to define the response regions. We characterized topographic similarity of finger representations for each digit pair by computing the similarity between all digit combinations between the first and second run within this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuehn et al., 2018</xref>). Correlation coefficients of the vectors were calculated using Pearson correlations. The correlation coefficients were first computed at the individual subject level, Fisher <italic>z</italic>-transformed, and then averaged across subjects to calculate digit-specific group averaged correlation matrices. We computed an ANOVA with the factors neighbor (N0-N4) and age (young, old) to test for age-related differences in distant-dependent similarities between finger representations between runs. We used an alpha level of p&lt;0.05 to test for significant main effects and interactions.</p><p>Preprocessed resting state data that were corrected for physiological noise (see above) were used to compute similarities between time series of finger representations in area 3b. The definition of finger representations was computed based on the GLM analyses (see above), but overlapping voxels were excluded from the analyses. The matlab-function ‘xcorr’ was used to compute cross-correlations between time series of all finger pairs. Cross-correlations measure the similarity between two vectors and their shifted (lagged) copies as a function of the lag, and take into account temporal shifts as a function of TR. For any given lag, cross-correlations estimate the correlation between two random sequences and estimate functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hyde and Jesmanowicz, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Cortical distance and cortical overlap</title><p>Geodesic distances between finger representations (in mm) were computed using the Dijkstra algorithm.

Bootstrapping is a non-parametric statistical test that can be applied both when the data are normal and non-normal distributed. Bootstrapping is particularly suitable for data with small sample sizes. Forest plots were used to visualize effect sizes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71020-forest-plot-for-visualisation-of-multiple-odds-ratios">https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/71020-forest-plot-for-visualisation-of-multiple-odds-ratios</ext-link>). A forest plot is a graphical display that illustrates the relative strength of interventions, such as training effects, in different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Timm and Kuehn, 2020</xref>), and is often used in clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of treatments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kang et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Bayesian pRF modeling</title><p>Population receptive field (pRF) modeling was performed using the SPM-based BayespRF Toolbox (freely available for download from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pzeidman/BayespRF">https://github.com/pzeidman/BayespRF</ext-link> (copy archived at URL to added)) which is dependent on Matlab (SPM12 and Matlab 2018b). The BayespRF toolbox provides a generic framework for mapping pRFs associated with stimulus spaces of any dimension onto the brain. It was first used for mapping two-dimensional (2D) visual pRFs in human visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zeidman et al., 2018</xref>), and it was recently applied to map somatosensory pRFs in human SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>). BOLD time-series were extracted for pRF modeling by reducing the number of voxel time courses. This was achieved by performing a two-stage analysis. The first stage was the GLM analyses stage, which was accomplished by performing a general 1st-level analysis with SPM to prepare data for pRF modelling procedure. At this stage, task regressors were first defined. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>, five regressors were constructed, corresponding with five fingers of the right hand. After performing an F-contrast, only time-series that passed a significance threshold of p&lt;0.05 (uncorrected) were used for the pRF modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zeidman et al., 2018</xref>). This procedure allows reducing computing time considerably (note that one pRF modeling process takes around 2 days for the reduced input data). The resulting mask was combined with the freesurfer mask of area 3b. pRF modeling was then conducted on a voxel-wise basis, where the fit between an estimated waveform and the empirically measured BOLD-response was optimized. This was achieved by modifying the size and position of the pRF model. The posterior model probability was thresholded at &gt;0.95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zeidman et al., 2018</xref>). We defined the somatosensory space using the same 2D matrix that was used for visual pRF mapping, but with limiting the dimensions to ±12.5 in both dimensions. pRF modeling was performed on the x-dimension, that is the inferior-superior dimension of topographic alignment. Note that similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>, these analyses model one dimension in the two-dimensional sensory space. We allowed the minimal pRF size to be not smaller than 1/10th of the sensory space occupied by a single fingertip, and the maximum size restricted to the equivalence of all five fingers (i.e. 25 units) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>). A Gaussian pRF profile was chosen as a response function for pRF analysis (code available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/pengliu1120/bayesian-prf-modelling.git">https://gitlab.com/pengliu1120/bayesian-prf-modelling.git</ext-link>). This model was characterized as a normal, excitatory distribution with pRF center location (x) and width (i.e. σ, the standard deviation of the Gaussian profile) as estimated parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Puckett et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>After processing, output volumes were extracted from the obtained results, including distance, angle, width, beta, decay, transit and epsilon. Distance and angle are the vectors of polar coordinates depending on stimuli space definition, width is the defined pRF size parameter, ranging from 0.5 to 25. Distance values were used to define locations of activated voxels for each finger, width values were used as pRF size estimates for activated voxels. Before pRF modeling, parameters for pRF centre locations were set between −12.5 (low x-values) and +12.5 (high x-values), and after pRF estimation, values were modeled accordingly. For display only, the values are shown with a range between 0 and 25, so that the boundaries between each finger could be shown in integral numbers. As the stimulus space defined before modelling was one-dimensional, only pRF centre location and size results were further analyzed by plotting them onto the surface using Freesurfer (csurf). Visualized results were saved as labels accordingly, with the coordination, and pRF centre location or pRF size specified for each voxel survived pRF modelling. After performing Bayesian pRF modelling and extracting result labels for every subject, individual and group average pRF sizes were calculated and used for statistical analysis. A two-way ANOVA was performed with age and finger as independent variables, and average pRF size of each finger for each individual as dependent variable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Factor analyses and correlations</title><p>We used the function ‘factoran’ in MATLAB_R2014b, which fits factor analysis models using maximum likelihood estimates. We searched for two and three common factors, that is factors that might affect several of the variables in common. In that way, we obtained maximum likelihood estimates of the factor loadings and the specific variances, representing independent random variability, for each variable. For the refitted models with more than one common factor, the loadings were initially estimated without rotation, but for better interpretability, we further used the ‘promax’ oblique rotation. Factor rotation aimed at obtaining for each variable only a small number of large loadings affected by the factors, preferably only one. The ‘promax’ rotation chosen here rotated the factor axes separately, allowing them to have an oblique angle between them, and computed new loadings based on this rotated coordinate system. We computed lambda as the coefficient, or loading, of the jth factor for the ith variable. Note that for the factor analysis with three common factors, some of the specific variances were equal to the value of the 'delta' parameter (close to zero), leading to a fit known as a Heywood case. We computed psi as the specific variance of the model. Psi = 1 would indicate that there is <italic>no</italic> common factor component in that variable, while psi = 0 would indicate that the variable is <italic>entirely</italic> determined by common factors.</p><p>Factor analyses were conducted only on the data of older adults, and only with variables that showed differences between the two age groups. Reduction of the dimensionality of the data only to these variables that were different was necessary to reveal variables that showed joint variations due to unobserved latent variables and not due to intertwined features. Our goal was to reduce the dimensionality in the data down to the number of variables needed to capture its maximum variability. The number of dimensions does not necessarily correspond to the number of features, as not all variables measured were independent from one another. Our goal was to obtain a reduced set of degrees of freedom in the data, which could be used to reproduce most of its variability, and thus redundant features were of no interest. This redundancy was evident when we included more variables in the model. By adding more variables, the presence of Heywood cases for some variables kept arising (meaning that these variables were entirely determined by common factors with specific variances-psi values close to zero) and in some cases, the model could no longer be computed. A factor loading of a variable can be considered important for a factor, if it is at least |0.4| (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maskey et al., 2018</xref>), explaining around 16% of the variance in the variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Field, 2009</xref>). We set a cut-off criterion for the accepted loadings in our model to |0.4| and followed the procedure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maskey et al., 2018</xref> regarding the exclusion of variables (i.e. deleting one variable at a time and always rerun the model, based first on the lowest factor loadings and then, if required, on the existence of cross-loadings). The first variable to be removed from the two-factor model was N3 representational similarity (loading of −0.19). After rerunning the model, pRF size was excluded next (loading of 0.30) and the model obtained after this second variable exclusion was the final two-factor model reported here. No further exclusions were required. The same process was followed for the three-factor model. pRF size was the first variable that had to be removed from the model (loading of 0.30). After pRF size exclusion, the obtained model was accepted with no further variable exclusions (all factor loadings &gt;|0.4|). Correlation coefficients between variables of each factor were then calculated within the group of older adults using Pearson correlations. Because pRF estimates were excluded by the model (see above), but there was interest about a potential behavioral correlate of the altered pRF size, we also performed correlation analyses between average pRF sizes and cortical distances (Euclidean distance and geodesic distance), recorded time of the Purdue Pegboard Test, recorded time of the Grooved Pegboard Test, and two-point discrimination thresholds.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>E.K. was funded by ESIF/EFRE 2014–2020; FKZ: ZS/2016/04/78113, Vorhaben: Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences (CBBS); P.L. and J.D. were funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) (KU 3711/2–1, project number: 423633679).

to study topographic maps in human somatosensory cortex in a far richer and more nuanced way than previously possible, simultaneously probing multiple features of finger representations such as size, distance and separation. Importantly, these neural map features and how they change with age are directly linked to multiple measures of somatotosensation and motor behaviour, providing insights in how these topographic maps determine behavioural performance.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The organizational principles of de-differentiated topographic maps&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michel Akselrod (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the question addressed is of great interest, and that the authors present an impressive and very valuable dataset and apply highly advanced fMRI methods. The refutation of a simple de-differentiation model is an interesting and novel contribution – though it should be said that the reviewers did not find that a clear alternative was demonstrated in the current paper.</p><p>Overall, they felt substantial revisions are required. While the fMRI analytical methods used by the authors are very advanced and appropriate, there is a general lack of precision in the description of these methods (detailed), which would prevent a thorough replication of the author's analytical pipeline. Additionally, the hypotheses require clarification and justification, the statistical approach should be improved, and interpretation of the results needs to be more stringent in places. The reviewers also noted that following these revisions, it is possible that the main results will no longer hold. The points to be addressed are detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The impact statement seems misleading and does not fit with the rest of the manuscript: &quot;De-differentiated cortical maps in S1 are characterized by local shifts in topographic representations that benefit behaviour and reduced topographic similarity, which corroborates previous models on de-differentiation and cortical aging&quot;, as de-differentiation has been associated with behavioural impairment rather than behavioural benefit and should by definition be associated with increased similarity (i.e. less differentiation), this statement is very counter-intuitive at this stage of the manuscript. In addition, the presented results do not really corroborate results from existing literature or previous models of de-differentiation. It might be more helpful to emphasize that, in the current results study, cortical aging was not associated with classical hallmarks of de-differentiation.</p><p>2. The authors interpret these results as evidence that cortical 'de-differentiation' is related to higher hand performance. This is based on the negative correlation found between a specific haptic test (O'Connor) and changes in relative peak distances between D2 and D3. However, these changes in peak distances are also negatively correlated with the increased mislocalisation between these two fingers, which may not be beneficial in other contexts. While mislocalisation is likely to reflect map overlap that is likely to affect finger motor enslavement as mentioned in the discussion, precision grip and haptic tests as done here are likely to rely more on the ability to detect peg's edges and orientation with D1, D2 and D3, which points more towards the involvement of tactile spatial acuity, in a finger-specific way.</p><p>Thus, the concern is that the conclusion made here is likely to be task and feature specific, and that the opposite conclusion might be reached when considering other aspects of tactile processing involved in hand dexterity and haptic tasks that may relate to other cortical features. For instance, the authors did not test spatial acuity performances, which are known to be impaired in elderlies (e.g., Vega-Bermudez and Johnson, 2004; Stevens, 1992; Tremblay et al., 2003; Kalisch et al., 2008; Pleger et al., 2016), assumed to be dependent on RF size and the density of innervation (see Vallbo and Johansson, 1978; Peters et al., 2009) and were found to be highly related to performances in the pegboard task (see Tremblay et al., 2003; Kalisch et al., 2008; Kowalewski et al., 2012). Thus, this aspect of 'de-differentiation' (i.e., increased pRF size), could be related to impaired spatial acuity, which could together negatively impact performance in the pegboard task. This would suggest maladaptive consequences. So, the overall claim should be dampened since it depends on which parameters we look at.</p><p>3. The feature-based model of cortical reorganization (considering local vs global aspects and separation vs integration) seems like a promising approach; however, the authors do not convincingly use these concepts as a red-thread throughout the manuscript. It is briefly mentioned in the introduction, but lacking a thorough description (e.g. the graphical summary in Figure 1A is not easily understandable). In addition, it is difficult to understand which of the tested features map onto which aspects of the model (local vs global and separation vs integration). For example, it is not clear which behavioural task assessed &quot;functional separation&quot; and how it was tested. In addition, the local vs global aspects feel like a post-hoc classification of results to distinguish between statistical effects associated with only one specific finger/finger-pair (e.g. finger*age interaction for cortical distance) or with all fingers (e.g. main effect of age for pRF size) rather than a hypothesis driven approach. For example, a more hypothesis driven approach could distinguish between local features for single fingers (e.g. area size, pRF size, response amplitude, etc…) and global features across fingers (e.g. distance, overlap, similarity, etc…).</p><p>4. Even though mentioned in the introduction, the authors do not take into account or discuss how finger usage (and thus use-dependent plasticity) may change with age and play a role here, especially if finger-specific. For instance, the reduced similarity between distant fingers (N3, so D1-D4 and D2-D5) (if still there after cross-validation) could arise from a use-dependent 'clustering' of D5-D4 vs D3-D2-D1 that are maybe increasingly co-used with age. While such 'clustering' might not be detectable with peak distances, the reduced similarity observed may result from the combination of two small clusters of de-differentiation driven by use-dependent changes.</p><p>5. While the literature on age-related cortical changes referred to in the introduction reported volumes changes at the level of a single finger (D2), the present study reports only global metrics across all fingers' representations. Can the authors break down the results for each finger (i.e., response amplitude, f-value, surface area)? This would also help interpreting the finger-specific changes in relative peak distances.</p><p>6. Regarding cortical distances, why did the authors use the peak vertex rather than the centre of gravity (that can be weighted by betas and/or cluster size)? The peak is sensitive to artefacts or aberrant values and does not account for cluster size. Also, interpreting differences between groups by comparing relative distances computed at the individual level between pairs of adjacent fingers is difficult, since these distances are not directly comparable between participants if the data is not normalised. If the point is to look at finger-specific differences, it might be better to consider normalised distances relative to a single anchor point consistent across subjects, for instance the D5 centre of gravity, or even better, an anatomical landmark.</p><p>7. The use of cross-validated measures and especially cross-validated Mahalanobis distances provides a more reliable measure of similarity (see Walther et al., 2016 NeuroImage). In addition, by grouping the data based on neighbourhood, different amount of data is pooled for each class: 4 pairs averaged for N1 vs 1 pair for N4. This impacts variability, degrees of freedom and thus stats. The analysis should account for that (by pooling specific pairs of fingers in a balanced way and driven by clear hypotheses, or by just comparing the 10 cells across groups).</p><p>8. In the within-scanner passive task, the stimulus intensity has been adjusted according to the participants' 50% detection threshold, determined separately for each individual and finger. As shown, the 50% detection threshold is clearly higher for the older group, and the authors also found a main effect of digit and a digit x age interaction. Unmatched stimuli are a concern for the interpretability of the S1 results. For example, the authors report no differences in response amplitude, which, given more intense stimuli for the older group, suggests that the excitability of the older group's S1 is in fact lower. While the authors may wish to point at age-related degradation of tactile information in the periphery (e.g. Hanley et al., 2019), it is unlikely the age-related drop in detection is fully explained by the periphery (as opposed to S1 or higher-order decision areas, see Romo et al., 2013). Other measures analysed by the authors are likely also dependent on stimulus intensity, e.g. surface area, Dice overlap, and pRF size. A discussion of how these corrections have affected the findings seems essential.</p><p>This issue could potentially be partially addressed with the following analyses:</p><p>a) using GLM, one can include a nuisance regressor to account for different stimulation intensity between fingers. Thus, the model includes one regressor for each finger and a nuisance regressor for the overall effect of stimulation intensity. This approach can be directly applied for their block experiment.</p><p>b) For the phase encoding analysis, the effect of the nuisance regressor can be regressed out from the fMRI timecourses before applying the phase encoding analysis.</p><p>This should at least capture some of the variance associated with different stimulation intensities, but since each finger is stimulated at a single intensity, the confound finger*intensity cannot be completely resolved.</p><p>9. A very large number of statistical tests are performed, and most effects were not significant. This could suggest that either the authors successfully identified very specific correlates of aging (e.g. D2-D3 differences), or maybe that some effects were significant by chance (e.g. the authors computed 20 correlations between the different measures and age and found that 2 out of 20 are significant without applying correction for multiple comparisons). Statistical analyses should be strongly hypothesis-driven to limit the number of tests, especially when dealing with some many variables. For instance, the reason for testing cortical distances between peaks is not clear. Is it to test the interpretation of previous results arguing that the increased D2-D5 distance is evidence for 'an enlargement of topographic maps in older adults', or to see if the authors can replicate this D2-D5 result? If the former, then is this analysis necessary considering that enlargement of maps was already assessed above with the surface area measure (that can be done both globally and in a finger-specific way)? If the latter, then why are the authors testing relative distances between adjacent fingers instead of distances relative to D5? In the same line, correlations between data not showing significant main effect of age or interactions should be avoided (e.g., correlation between mean pRF sizes and dice coefficients that are not significant). Similarly, running stats on both the factors neighbour/age and digit-pair/age for RSA consists in running the test twice on the same data (circularity), just pooled differently (and in an unbalanced way when it comes to neighbourhood). The same applies to the mislocalisation analysis. If the purpose is to test global vs local effects, the authors should have independent measures to assess each. For instance, while local effects can easily be measured by maps overlaps/RSA and mislocalisations, global effects could be assessed by global changes in surface area/pRF sizes and hand dexterity? Finally, the hypothesis and justification for the resting state analysis is not clear.</p><p>10. While the correspondence between fMRI features and behaviour is quite convincing and suggests that these effects are not spurious, a more sensitive statistical approach might shed new light on the data. First, why did the authors decide to define two groups of age rather than using age as a covariate (e.g. ANCOVA or LMM)? This approach could be sensitive to both between-group differences and within-group differences, thus preventing to rely on a large number of correlations. Second, the comparison between fMRI features and behaviour mostly relies on the qualitative correspondence between significant effects (except for the correlations computed in the factor analysis). If the aim was to determine which local or global fMRI features are associated with behavioural changes and aging, it might be more optimal to directly compare fMRI features and behaviour by defining local fMRI features for individual fingers (e.g. area size, pRF size, response amplitude, etc…) and global fMRI features across fingers (e.g. distance, overlap, similarity, etc…). These fMRI features could then be used as co-variates to analyse behaviour (e.g. ANCOVA or LMM).</p><p>11. Since most of the effects tested here were non-significant, considering the Bayesian equivalents of these test (available in R or JASP) might provide useful information by assessing the evidence for the presence or absence of an effect (rather than rejecting a possible difference with frequentist approach).</p><p>12. The authors are particularly lenient with describing effects as 'trending towards significance'. P-values above 0.1 should certainly not be described this way. In some places, the (range of) p-values were not given directly in the main text, making it harder for the reader to evaluate the strength of the evidence.</p><p>13. Please provide more details regarding the Bayesian pRF modelling:</p><p>a. Voxels were preselected prior to the analysis, but only a significance threshold is given. What was the contrast used to exclude voxels?</p><p>b. Which prior(s) was/were used – if the prior was based on 'typical pRF estimates' did this bias your estimates away from finding group differences?</p><p>c. Why did the authors use Bayesian pRF modelling, rather than a frequentist approach, which would match the rest of the manuscript's statistics?</p><p>d. Please provide more information about the fit. Could the larger RF estimates in older participants be due to a poorer fit of the Gaussian?</p><p>e. Is there good correspondence between the pRF distance estimates and the topographic maps estimated using phase encoding? Please also provide a supplementary figure with all participants' pRF estimates.</p><p>f. Relatedly, P26 who appears to be an outlier with very high pRF size for D5 (in Figure 4A) has medial activity for D1 (Figure 2C). If 'digit space' is parameterised as a circle instead of a line (allowing shared D5-D1 RFs), are the group estimates affected?</p><p>g. &quot;The main effect of finger was due to significantly larger pRF sizes of D1 compared to D2&quot; – p. 8. Based on figure 4, I think this should be &quot;smaller&quot;.</p><p>h. &quot;For display, the dimensions of the pRF distance volumes were adjusted to 0/25.&quot; – p. 31. It is unclear what this means, please rephrase.</p><p>14. Representational similarity analysis (RSA):</p><p>a. The distinction between 'local' and 'global' is not very clear, particularly when applied to distant finger pairs. Are N3 correlations the within-subject average of D1-D4 and D2-D5? Do the authors propose a global mechanism that only affects these two finger pairs, but not, say, D2-D4 or D3-D5?</p><p>b. RSA values are typically plotted as dissimilarity (e.g. 1-corr.). The decision to plot the corr. directly while using the term RSA may cause some confusion. This is at the authors' discretion.</p><p>15. Dexterity and factor analysis:</p><p>a. The distinction between measures of hand dexterity that are 'global' and 'local' seems to be fully driven by the results from the factor analysis. As it stands, it is unclear why the O'Connor test is fundamentally different from the other two. The authors should attempt to explain why the O'Connor test was associated with a positive loading on local effects, while the Purdue and Grooved tests were associated with a negative loading on the global effects. These three tasks, while corresponding to different levels of difficulty, were described as assessing similar aspects of hand dexterity. It would also be helpful if the authors can provide information about potential different strategies used for the three tasks across the different age groups (e.g. which fingers are primarily used to handle the pins, did this differ across the tasks and across age groups).</p><p>b. In the Discussion section and abstract, then, the O'Connor test is reduced to &quot;hand dexterity&quot;, e.g. in &quot;more local 'de-differentiation' related to better hand dexterity&quot; – p. 18. Given the other two tests of hand dexterity showed different effects, this should be phrased more carefully.</p><p>c. Both Euclidean and Geodesic distance are included as inputs to the factor analysis and are the inputs with the strongest loadings on factor 1. Does this influence the factors?</p><p>d. Why were the various non-significant digit pairs or neighbourhood relations (for confusion, distance, or repr. correlation) not included in the factor analysis? Perhaps one way to show how meaningful the distinction between the factors is would be to show that even non-significant group differences show an appropriate difference in factor loadings.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The organizational principles of de-differentiated topographic maps&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Floris de Lange (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors state in the results that the finger maps appeared in topographic alignment in all participants (page 6 and page 11). However, this is hardly appreciable when looking at the figures (Figure 2, 4 and 4S). There is also no description about how this topographic alignment was assessed. We recommend assessing statistically the topographic alignment between digits (different from the between subject dispersion analysis) to support these claims. Topographic alignment is visually depicted in Figure 3E, but this assessment is not described in the Results section.</p><p>To be specific, on page 6, &quot;The expected topographic alignment of the fingers (thumb [D1], index finger [D2], middle finger [D3], ring finger [D4], and small finger [D5] arranged superior -&gt; inferior in area 3b) was visible in all individuals of both age groups (see Figure 2C)&quot;, this seems like an overstatement after visual inspection of Figure 2C. Visual inspection of individual maps (Figure 2, 4 and 4S) suggest the presence of &quot;missing&quot; fingers in some individuals. This might be the case if no voxel responded preferably to a finger.</p><p>For example P1, P18, P25, P28, P33, P36 seem to have at least 1 missing color in the map. Please specify how the topographic alignment was assessed and how many participants had &quot;missing&quot; fingers in the maps (if any), and report the minimum number of voxels associated with a given finger in the topographic maps. In case a given subjects had a &quot;missing finger&quot;, how was missing data treated for statistics?</p><p>Further, on page 11, &quot;pRF centre locations revealed an organized finger map with D1-D5 arranged from superior to inferior, as expected&quot;, the authors probably meant &quot;inferior to superior. As for phase encoding, please specify how the topographic alignment was assessed and whether some participants had &quot;missing&quot; fingers in the maps and how this was treated for statistics. Inspection of figure 4S suggests indeed that some subject had &quot;missing&quot; fingers in their maps.</p><p>2. In the GLM used to define finger-specific maps, which are then used for overlap and resting-state analyses, the statistical threshold used is too liberal (p&lt;0.05 uncorrected) which might affect the results of subsequent analyses. Page 36, line 1155: &quot;voxels that survived a significance threshold of p&lt;.05 (uncorrected) and k&gt;3&quot;, this is a very liberal threshold to define finger-specific areas, which will likely detect unspecific responses and result in larger overlap between digits. This is problematic as the result &quot;increased overlap in elderly's maps&quot; might be attributed to difference in unspecific responses. In addition, these maps were used for resting-state data extraction, which is also problematic, because an increased overlap would predict an increased resting-state functional connectivity. It may be better to use a more conservative threshold (e.g. 0.001 uncorrected) and to exclude any overlapping areas in the resting-state analysis.</p><p>3. Considering that the authors select the variables 'that were shown differ between age groups' as inputs to the factor analysis, and that they now report a significant main effect of age on dice coefficients (and not just a trend), these should be added to the factor analysis. Related to that, please consider adding the dice result in the summary of your results at the beginning of the discussion.</p><p>4. Response to previous comment 7. The scale is saturating the colours in the RDMs so it is difficult to inspect. Could the authors report the same stats as reported in the main text (ANOVA neighbour*age and ANOVA finger pairs*age) to see if results hold?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The organizational principles of de-differentiated topographic maps&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We anticipate that these remaining issues can be assessed by the editors, without sending the manuscript out to the reviewers again.</p><p>1. From the authors' response to point 1:</p><p>&quot;With respect to the missing fingers, there were fingers 'missing' in the pRF centre location maps for 8 out of 36 subjects, as shown in Figure 4S. This is equal for the group of younger and older adults (n=4 in each group). The ANOVA with the factors age and finger calculated on pRF sizes was calculated with the missing cases excluded from the data, as described on page 11. This is justified because overall, the missing values take up 8.9% of the data where biases are expected when more than 10% of the data are missing (Dong, Y., and Peng, C. Y. J. (2013). Principled missing data methods for researchers. SpringerPlus, 2(1), 1-17, Bennett, D. A. (2001). How can I deal with missing data in my study?

The impact statement seems misleading and does not fit with the rest of the manuscript: &quot;De-differentiated cortical maps in S1 are characterized by local shifts in topographic representations that benefit behaviour and reduced topographic similarity, which corroborates previous models on de-differentiation and cortical aging&quot;, as de-differentiation has been associated with behavioural impairment rather than behavioural benefit and should by definition be associated with increased similarity (i.e. less differentiation), this statement is very counter-intuitive at this stage of the manuscript. In addition, the presented results do not really corroborate results from existing literature or previous models of de-differentiation. It might be more helpful to emphasize that, in the current results study, cortical aging was not associated with classical hallmarks of de-differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ objections. We now changed the impact statement to:</p><p>“SI Topographic finger maps of older adults show signs of cortical aging but do not show classical hallmarks of cortical de-differentiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors interpret these results as evidence that cortical 'de-differentiation' is related to higher hand performance. This is based on the negative correlation found between a specific haptic test (O'Connor) and changes in relative peak distances between D2 and D3. However, these changes in peak distances are also negatively correlated with the increased mislocalisation between these two fingers, which may not be beneficial in other contexts. While mislocalisation is likely to reflect map overlap that is likely to affect finger motor enslavement as mentioned in the discussion, precision grip and haptic tests as done here are likely to rely more on the ability to detect peg's edges and orientation with D1, D2 and D3, which points more towards the involvement of tactile spatial acuity, in a finger-specific way.</p><p>Thus, the concern is that the conclusion made here is likely to be task and feature specific, and that the opposite conclusion might be reached when considering other aspects of tactile processing involved in hand dexterity and haptic tasks that may relate to other cortical features. For instance, the authors did not test spatial acuity performances, which are known to be impaired in elderlies (e.g., Vega-Bermudez and Johnson, 2004; Stevens, 1992; Tremblay et al., 2003; Kalisch et al., 2008; Pleger et al., 2016), assumed to be dependent on RF size and the density of innervation (see Vallbo and Johansson, 1978; Peters et al., 2009) and were found to be highly related to performances in the pegboard task (see Tremblay et al., 2003; Kalisch et al., 2008; Kowalewski et al., 2012). Thus, this aspect of 'de-differentiation' (i.e., increased pRF size), could be related to impaired spatial acuity, which could together negatively impact performance in the pegboard task. This would suggest maladaptive consequences. So, the overall claim should be dampened since it depends on which parameters we look at.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we thank the reviewers for highlighting the importance of spatial acuity for characterizing behavioral and cortical aging. As part of another study where the same participants took part (both older and younger), we performed a spatial acuity task (two-point discrimination task) at D2 where the ability to discriminate two pins at the fingertip was measured. This task has also been used by some of the studies the reviewers cite above (for example Kalisch et al., 2008; Pleger et al., 2016). We agree with the reviewers that these data provide potentially important information to the present study with respect to the relationship between cortical and behavioral aging. We therefore now included these data into the manuscript (see Methods part for more information on experimental procedure) to specifically test whether</p><p>1. Older adults show impaired tactile spatial acuity at the fingertip compared to younger adults.</p><p>2. Individual tactile spatial acuity shows the expected relation to performances in the Pegboard Test as mentioned by the reviewers (see Tremblay et al., 2003; Kalisch et al., 2008; Kowalewski et al., 2012).</p><p>3. Individual pRF size correlates with individual 2PDT thresholds, which would, as the reviewers correctly noted, weaken our conclusion that increased pRF size does not have a behavioral correlate in our study.</p><p>The results of these analyses are now also reported in the manuscript including the used methodology. The results revealed:</p><p>1. As expected, we found significantly higher tactile spatial discrimination thresholds (reflecting worse performance) in older compared to younger adults (older: 3.17mm±0.85mm, younger: 1.78±0.29mm, <italic>t</italic>(19.52)=6.14, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.00001). This replicates prior studies that evidenced worse spatial acuity at the fingertip in older compared to younger adults.</p><p>2. As expected and as also suggested by the reviewers, individual tactile spatial acuity thresholds correlated with performance in the Grooved Pegboard Test in older, but not in younger adults (n=17 older: r=0.68, p&lt;.005, n=18 younger: r=0.01, p=0.983); the positive correlation revealed that higher spatial acuity relates to better performance in the Pegboard Test.</p><p>3. 2PDT thresholds did not correlate with individual pRF sizes neither in younger nor in older adults (n=16 younger: r=-0.07, p=0.789, n=16 older: r=0.35 p=.179).</p><p>The spatial acuity data therefore showed the expected patterns (worse spatial tactile acuity in older compared to younger adults, and correlation with Pegboard Test performance in older adults). However, there was no significant correlation between the 2PDT and pRF size neither of D2 nor of the full map area. Our previous notion that in the present study, pRF sizes are not related to a behavioral readout is therefore still valid. The potential behavioral relevance of enlarged pRF sizes still remains to be determined by future studies.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that in order to understand the behavioral relevance of functional map differences, the interpretation depends on the specific features that are investigated (see also Figure 1, feature-based model of cortical reorganization). It is in particular relevant, as the reviewers also point out, to distinguish between the Pegboard Test (which relies on finger acuity) and performance of the precision grip, and the O’Connor Dexterity Test, (which relies on haptic object recognition) and haptic exploration. It is also relevant to distinguish between map features that link to functional integration and those that link to functional separation, as both differently affect performance in different tasks (i.e., tactile separation versus haptic object recognition). This is now outlined in the Introduction, and also discussed in the Discussion in the following way:</p><p>“We also distinguished between topographic map features that link to functional separation, as here tested by perceptual finger individuation and by motor tasks that rely on precise spatial acuity of the fingertip (i.e., Pegboard test, Kalisch et al., 2008), and those that require functional integration, as here tested by perceptual finger confusion and a motor task that relies on haptic recognition involving multiple fingers (i.e., O’Connor Dexterity test). It is worth noting that local and global changes as well as integration and separation that are here introduced as different levels of the features “spatial extent” and “functional readout”, respectively (see Figure 1) are in fact interlinked and may share common variance. For example, less finger individuation in one task may relate to more finger integration in another task, and both may influence motor behavior. However, their distinct investigation allows a precise understanding of how functional map features link to behavioral phenotypes (i.e., feature-based model of cortical reorganization, FMC, see Figure 1).” (page 3)</p><p>“Perhaps the most surprising finding of our study, however, is the reduced local cortical distance between the index and middle finger representations in older adults with preserved map size, where, previously, greater distances between fingers and larger map sizes were reported (Kalisch et al., 2009). Whereas the reduced cortical distance between neighbouring fingers is in principle in line with a de-differentiation model of topographic map architecture, its relation to better rather than worse hand dexterity is certainly not. In this respect, the distinction between functional readouts that capture integration versus separation seems relevant (see Figure 1). Specifically, we found that reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 representations related to worse tactile discrimination between these two fingers (i.e., worse separation in a tactile task) but to better motor control in a task that required haptic object exploration and coordinated finger movements (i.e., improved integration in motor task). These findings highlight the importance of assessing different aspects of signal integration and signal separation to investigate the impact of functional map changes on everyday life. Because this relationship was only seen for the index and middle finger and not for the other fingers, also the factor of spatial extent (i.e., local versus global, see Figure 1) is relevant for comprehensive data analysis.” (page 24/25)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The feature-based model of cortical reorganization (considering local vs global aspects and separation vs integration) seems like a promising approach; however, the authors do not convincingly use these concepts as a red-thread throughout the manuscript. It is briefly mentioned in the introduction, but lacking a thorough description (e.g. the graphical summary in Figure 1A is not easily understandable). In addition, it is difficult to understand which of the tested features map onto which aspects of the model (local vs global and separation vs integration). For example, it is not clear which behavioural task assessed &quot;functional separation&quot; and how it was tested. In addition, the local vs global aspects feel like a post-hoc classification of results to distinguish between statistical effects associated with only one specific finger/finger-pair (e.g. finger*age interaction for cortical distance) or with all fingers (e.g. main effect of age for pRF size) rather than a hypothesis driven approach. For example, a more hypothesis driven approach could distinguish between local features for single fingers (e.g. area size, pRF size, response amplitude, etc…) and global features across fingers (e.g. distance, overlap, similarity, etc…).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our model is a potentially promising approach to investigate the relationship between topographic map features and everyday behavior. We apologize if this approach and the associated experimental design was not clearly explained in the previous version of the manuscript. We now added changes to the manuscript (Introduction, Results, Discussion) to better explain our experimental approach and the underlying theoretical concept. We also modified Figure 1 and added a definition of the terms “global”, “local”, “separation”, and “integration” into the figure. In order to clarify which of the tested features map onto which aspect of the model, we delineated which of the tested features were classified as local (finger specific measures of map amplitude, size, model fit, cortical distance, representational similarity, etc.) and which as global (features that characterize the full map area). We explain this when results on these variables are reported and interpreted. We also explain which of the tested features can be used to investigate separation, and which can be used to investigate integration. In fact, functional separation was tested by perceptual finger individuation and by motor tasks that rely on precise spatial acuity of the fingertip (i.e., Pegboard test, Kalisch et al., 2008), whereas functional integration was tested by perceptual finger confusion and a motor task that relies on haptic recognition involving multiple fingers (i.e., O’Connor Dexterity test, see also response to Essential Revision 2). Therefore, as the reviewers suggested, different experimental variables link to the different levels and factors of the model, which is now clarified in different sections of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Even though mentioned in the introduction, the authors do not take into account or discuss how finger usage (and thus use-dependent plasticity) may change with age and play a role here, especially if finger-specific. For instance, the reduced similarity between distant fingers (N3, so D1-D4 and D2-D5) (if still there after cross-validation) could arise from a use-dependent 'clustering' of D5-D4 vs D3-D2-D1 that are maybe increasingly co-used with age. While such 'clustering' might not be detectable with peak distances, the reduced similarity observed may result from the combination of two small clusters of de-differentiation driven by use-dependent changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a different (and longer) history of finger usage is an important component of aging that should be taken into account when interpreting our data. When considering the suggestion that there may be a clustering of D4 and D5 and/or of D1, D2, and D3 that may explain our representational similarity results (reduced N3 similarity in older adults), the dice coefficient results, the resting state results, and the cortical distance results do not support such a clustering. The representational similarity results show no interaction between digit-pair and age (statistics now reported in the manuscript: F(3,102)=1.20, <italic>p</italic>=.31) that would be expected if we assumed a finger-specific clustering. Rather, the data show an interaction between neighbour and age, which indicates a similarity effect that is independent of the specific finger. The dice coefficient results do not show an interaction between finger-pair and age (F(3)=0.1 <italic>p</italic>=0.963), which again does not support the clustering hypothesis. Finally, the resting state results also do not show an interaction between finger-pair and age (F(4)=0.73, <italic>p</italic>=.57).</p><p>Our data indicate a clustering of D2 and D3 in older adults, which seems to be beneficial for motor control. Following the reviewers’ argument, one could now assume that the more frequent co-use of D2 and D3 in older adults (perhaps due to its positive relation to manual dexterity) causes D2 and D3 to shift towards each other, and causes D1 and D4 as well as D2 and D5 to be less similar to each other. To test this assumption, we computed a correlation between individual D2-D3 distances and N3 representational similarity in older adults. These two correlations (one with Euclidean distance and one with geodesic distance) were not significant, and had low correlation coefficients (Euclidean distance-N3: <italic>r</italic>=-.084, <italic>p</italic>=.75, geodesic distance-N3: <italic>r</italic>=-.056, <italic>p</italic>=.83, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60090-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In addition, we investigated another hypothesis of how the increased N3 similarity in older adults could be explained. Even though individual age and individual hand usage are related (where we do not have data on individual hand usage patterns over the participants’ lifespan), we would expect shared variance between N3 representational similarity and individual age if both measures are related to one another. For this purpose, we computed a correlation between N3 representational similarity and individual age in older adults, which was significant (<italic>p</italic>=.047, <italic>r</italic>=.49). The correlations between cortical distance and age, however, were not significant (<italic>p</italic>=.721, r=0.094 and <italic>p</italic>=.483, r=.138). This indicates that individual age is one factor that relates to individual levels of N3 representational similarity but not to individual cortical distances. Even though speculative, one may interpret these results by assuming that the reduced cortical distances are use-dependent whereas the representational similarity changes are age-dependent. These analyses are now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.The aspect of age-related versus use-dependent changes is now discussed in the Discussion in the following way:</p><p>“Another interesting aspect is that the reduced cortical distances between index and middle finger representations in older adults may be explained by use-dependent plasticity (Makin et al., 2013a). During everyday hand movements, the index and the middle finger correlate less with each other than other neighbouring fingers (Belić and Faisal, 2015), and the index finger is the most independent of the four fingers (Ingram et al., 2008). During tactile learning, however, plasticity transfers more from the middle finger to the index finger than from the middle finger to the ring finger (Dempsey-Jones et al., 2016), which indicate their interaction. The observed local map changes may therefore be induced by the correlated input of the middle and ring finger or ring finger and small finger (Kolasinski et al., 2016b), or by age-related changes in the local myeloarchitecture that link to functional map topography (Carey et al., 2018; Kuehn et al., 2017a). Finally, because the reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 seems to have a beneficial relationship to motor control, also the increased coupling of D2 and D3 during haptic exploration may explain the observed effect.” (page 25)</p><p>“Also the observed age-related differences in representational similarity between distant finger representations can be discussed in the light of use-dependent versus age-dependent plasticity. One way to explain less representational similarity between distant finger representations in older adults is to assume a greater clustering of D1, D2 and D3 and/or of D4 and D5 with increased hand use. This could explain why the similarity between the representations of D1 and D4 and between D2 and D5 is lower in older adults. However, we do not see an interaction between finger and age in representational similarity, resting state correlations, or dice coefficients, which would be expected if a finger-specific clustering of D1 and D2 or D4 and D5 existed. Rather, we observe a specific shift of D2 and D3 towards each other, an effect that positively related to hand dexterity. However, this shift does not correlate with the reduced representational similarity between distant fingers within the group of older adults. A direct relationship between these two measures can therefore not be established based on our data. On the other hand, we observed a significant correlation between N3 representational similarity and individual age in older adults, which hints towards a potential critical role of the factor age for the development of reduced similarity between distant finger pairs, and could be established via U-fiber maturation, as discussed above. Nevertheless, because we do not have information about hand use patterns of our participants, the effect of hand use on our data cannot be specifically investigated here.” (page 25/26)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While the literature on age-related cortical changes referred to in the introduction reported volumes changes at the level of a single finger (D2), the present study reports only global metrics across all fingers' representations. Can the authors break down the results for each finger (i.e., response amplitude, f-value, surface area)? This would also help interpreting the finger-specific changes in relative peak distances.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. We computed finger-specific f-values, finger-specific % response amplitudes, and finger-specific surface areas using a “winner-takes-it-all” approach to extract these variables in a finger-specific way. We computed an ANOVA with the factor age and digit for these three metrics. Our results revealed no main effect of age (as expected because there was also no main effect of age for the global metrics), but also no interaction between age and digit (% response amplitude: main effect of age: F(34)=1.46, <italic>p</italic>=.23, interaction age and digit: F(136)=1.20, <italic>p</italic>=.31; f-value: main effect of age: F(34)=0.30, <italic>p</italic>=.59, interaction age and digit: F(136)=1.17, <italic>p</italic>=.33, surface area: main effect of age: F(34)=0.02, <italic>p</italic>=.88, interaction age and digit: F(136)=1.64, <italic>p</italic>=.17). These results are now also reported in the main text and in the novel figure panels of Figure 2 H-J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Regarding cortical distances, why did the authors use the peak vertex rather than the centre of gravity (that can be weighted by betas and/or cluster size)? The peak is sensitive to artefacts or aberrant values and does not account for cluster size. Also, interpreting differences between groups by comparing relative distances computed at the individual level between pairs of adjacent fingers is difficult, since these distances are not directly comparable between participants if the data is not normalised. If the point is to look at finger-specific differences, it might be better to consider normalised distances relative to a single anchor point consistent across subjects, for instance the D5 centre of gravity, or even better, an anatomical landmark.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important comments. Functional values were first projected onto the cortical surface before peak vertices were extracted and cortical distances were estimated. Data were extracted between 100-20% cortical depth, which reduced the contribution of superficial veins that are a major contributor for aberrant values and image artifacts particularly at 7T fMRI. Data points between 100-20% were then averaged (rather than taking the maximum value), which also reduced the influence of outliers on the final estimates. Finally, we applied a surface-based smoothing kernel of 1mm to the cortical surface to account for small variations in surface sampling or small artifacts in the reconstructed surface. This procedure reduced the number of aberrant values and artifacts significantly and provides us with reliable topographic mapping data (see Figure 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers, however, that different methods can be employed to compute the localization of fMRI activations, the most prominent being peak voxel, center coordinate, and center of gravity (COG). Vidyasagar and Parkes, (2011, JMRI) used the primary somatosensory finger map area to investigate which of these three measures is the most reliable to define finger locations and to compare finger distances between different runs. Similar to our design, the authors applied vibrotactile stimulation either to D2 or to D4, and performed reproducibility analyses to estimate which measure (under which statistical threshold) was most reliable to estimate finger localization and finger distance. The authors used an EPI voxel size of 2 mm isotropic and applied prospective motion correction to ensure that differences between sessions would not be due to head motion. The authors concluded: “This study shows a high level of reproducibility for fMRI localization in the somatosensory system.”, which applied to all three measures. This study therefore provides empirical evidence that the estimation of finger distances based on peak voxel estimates that we use is a suitable and reliable method to investigate cortical distances in S1.</p><p>Vidyasagar and Parkes, (2011, JMRI) also found that even though all three analyses showed high reliability (as explained above), center coordinates at an activation size of 200 voxels showed the highest reliability of the three introduced methods. Therefore, to investigate whether the observed age-related differences in D2-D3 cortical distances can be replicated with this method, we computed center coordinates for each finger using a threshold that allowed a mean activation size of 200 voxels, as employed in Vidyasagar and Parkes, (2011, JMRI). The results of this analysis repeated the patterns of our previous results: there was a trend towards reduced distances in older compared to younger adults only for the D2-D3 distance, but not for all other distances (D2-D3 young: 5.34 mm±0.83 mm, old: 2.62 mm±0.67 mm, <italic>p</italic>=.099, D1-D2 young: 3.38 mm±0.69 mm, old: 3.36 mm±0.70 mm, <italic>p</italic>=.98; D3-D4 young: 3.09 mm±0.41 mm, old: 3.59 mm±0.45 mm, <italic>p</italic>=.41; D4-D5 young: 9.09 mm±0.64 mm, old: 10.36 mm±0.92 mm, <italic>p</italic>=.25). Power analyses revealed that a significant effect for the D2-D3 distance would be obtained for center co-ordinates with slightly higher sample sizes (n=20 for each group to reach <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and power of 80% according to Dhand, N. K., and Khatkar, M. S. (2014), whereas we performed the analyses on n=19 younger and n=17 older adults). This additional analysis is now reported in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the pattern of results (reduced distance between D2 and D3) does not only reflect the pattern of our behavioral data that were assessed at a separate day (more tactile confusion between D2 and D3), but that the pattern also reflects previously reported behavioral data (increased motor enslaving specifically of the middle finger during index finger flexion, and lower range of independent movement specifically of the index finger in older adults, Van Beek et al., 2019).</p><p>Different anatomical brain changes are associated with cortical aging, such as cortical thinning, cortical flattening, and decreased cortical volume. Given these changes, defining an exactly corresponding anatomical location in younger and older adults’ brains at the single subject basis is challenging. In addition, using probabilistic mapping, a recent study has shown that there is high individual variability in finger locations in SI that does not allow to define a distinct anatomical location for each individual digit (O’Neill et al., 2020 Neuroimage). Therefore, functional rather than anatomical localizers are the preferred and more precise option to localize individual fingers in SI, and to compare finger maps between older and younger adults.</p><p>It is worth noting, however, that we expect the functional changes we report here to have an anatomical correlate. Identifying these correlates, however, is beyond the scope of the present article. We are currently preparing a manuscript on structural cortical differences of the same individuals, where we focus on layer-specific differences in cortical myelin and cortical iron. First results can be inspected already (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328134104_On_the_Influence_of_Age_on_Intracortical_Myelin_in_Human_Primary_Somatosensory_Cortex_and_its_Relation_to_Tactile_Behavior#fullTextFileContent) and two poster presentations are planned for the OHBM 2021 where Juliane Döhler and Alicia Northall will present first results on age-related differences in the cortical meso-scale architecture. These results indicate that age-related changes in superficial myelin content may relate to the topographic map changes, but the analyses are not yet finalized as also differences in iron content may be influential. However, as stated above, including these results into the present manuscript is beyond the scope of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The use of cross-validated measures and especially cross-validated Mahalanobis distances provides a more reliable measure of similarity (see Walther et al., 2016 NeuroImage). In addition, by grouping the data based on neighbourhood, different amount of data is pooled for each class: 4 pairs averaged for N1 vs 1 pair for N4. This impacts variability, degrees of freedom and thus stats. The analysis should account for that (by pooling specific pairs of fingers in a balanced way and driven by clear hypotheses, or by just comparing the 10 cells across groups).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. Indeed, Walther et al., (2016, Neuroimage) reported that the use of multivariate noise normalization can contribute to strongly improved pattern reliability, whereas the exact distance metric used after noise normalization (Euclidean or correlation) had a smaller effect, and where cross-validation was useful specifically for getting unbiased estimates of mean pattern similarity. However, the improvements through using multivariate noise normalization have not been unequivocal. Charest, Kriegeskorte and Kay, (2018, Neuroimage, Figure 4a) and Ritchie and Op de Beeck, (2020 Journal of Vision abstract) showed reduced reliability through multivariate noise normalization. In response to the reviewer's request, we carried out multivariate noise normalization, using the residuals of the general linear model for a better estimate of the noise covariance matrix, which we regularized using the same criteria as in Walther et al., (2016). The change in pattern reliability is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> (before / after), indeed demonstrating that noise normalization harmed estimated effects in this case. Since correlation coefficients are based on independent data (separate runs), the estimated mean correlation coefficients should not be positively biased. Since we carried out classical random-effects analyses, the different number of comparisons at the subject level should only minimally affect the estimated statistics at the group level.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60090-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In the within-scanner passive task, the stimulus intensity has been adjusted according to the participants' 50% detection threshold, determined separately for each individual and finger. As shown, the 50% detection threshold is clearly higher for the older group, and the authors also found a main effect of digit and a digit x age interaction. Unmatched stimuli are a concern for the interpretability of the S1 results. For example, the authors report no differences in response amplitude, which, given more intense stimuli for the older group, suggests that the excitability of the older group's S1 is in fact lower. While the authors may wish to point at age-related degradation of tactile information in the periphery (e.g. Hanley et al., 2019), it is unlikely the age-related drop in detection is fully explained by the periphery (as opposed to S1 or higher-order decision areas, see Romo et al., 2013). Other measures analysed by the authors are likely also dependent on stimulus intensity, e.g. surface area, Dice overlap, and pRF size. A discussion of how these corrections have affected the findings seems essential.</p><p>This issue could potentially be partially addressed with the following analyses:</p><p>a) using GLM, one can include a nuisance regressor to account for different stimulation intensity between fingers. Thus, the model includes one regressor for each finger and a nuisance regressor for the overall effect of stimulation intensity. This approach can be directly applied for their block experiment.</p><p>b) For the phase encoding analysis, the effect of the nuisance regressor can be regressed out from the fMRI timecourses before applying the phase encoding analysis.</p><p>This should at least capture some of the variance associated with different stimulation intensities, but since each finger is stimulated at a single intensity, the confound finger*intensity cannot be completely resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>We controlled tactile stimulation intensity for each finger and each individual to investigate age-related differences in the topographic architecture of the SI maps that are independent of age-related differences in peripheral nerve integrity and skin thickness. For this reason, we assessed tactile detection thresholds for each finger and each individual prior to fMRI scanning to adjust stimulation intensity accordingly. This procedure is a standard procedure used in studies that investigate age-related changes in SI (see for example Pleger et al., 2016 Sci Rep where stimulation intensity was adjusted to the 2.5-fold detection threshold). In addition, by using a stimulation method where only two out of eight (random) pins were risen at any one time point (and changed every 62.3 ms), we also minimized the effect of age-related differences in neuronal adaptation on our results. Controlling for these aspects is, in our view, a strength rather than a weakness of our experimental design. Interactions between peripheral factors, neuronal adaptation, lateral inhibition and cortical excitability can usually hardly be disentangled using fMRI (see e.g., Kuehn et al., 2014 Brain Struct Funct for a discussion on this point). On the other hand, controlling these variables allows us to more precisely understand observed (or missing) age-related differences.</p><p>We agree, however, that age-related differences in cortical response amplitudes (where both peripheral and central aspects are taken into account) may provide complementary information. We therefore performed novel analyses to investigate this aspect. We used the two short runs that were scanned at the end of the MR session, in which all participants were briefly stimulated at all of their fingers at once using the same (maximal) stimulation amplitude (see Materials and methods, fMRI Task). We computed response amplitudes for the same region-of-interest as used before (see Figure 2), and using the same extraction method as before (i.e., 100-20% of cortical depth, average, surface-based sampling). We computed a two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test to compare the response amplitudes between younger and older adults, which revealed significantly higher response amplitudes in older adults compared to younger adults (younger: 1.05±0.01, older: 1.08±0.008, <italic>t</italic>(34)=-2.10, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05, see Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This confirms prior findings on greater excitability / less inhibition of older adults’ SI maps when the same stimulation amplitude is used and/or when more than one finger is stimulated at a time. Note, however, that other studies also showed differences in cortical excitability when they adjusted stimulation amplitude to individual tactile thresholds (e.g., Pleger et al., 2016 Sci Rep) whereas we only see such a difference when the same amplitude was applied, and when all fingers were stimulated together. This may support the view that age-related differences in lateral inhibition and adaptation are a particularly critical factor to explain the larger cortical excitability in previous studies. Given in our design, only two small pins stimulated the fingertip at a time (see explanation above), lateral inhibition and adaptation differences in SI between younger and older adults may have influenced our major analyses to a lesser extent compared to other previously published datasets. We now report these results in the main text, and in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concern whether the difference in excitability during same amplitude stimulation relates to individual tactile detection thresholds, we computed a correlation between mean tactile detection thresholds across fingers and mean response amplitudes across the topographic map area as reported above. These correlations were not significant, and are also reported in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p>To make this distinction clear to the reader, we now point out at different parts of the manuscript, including the Discussion, that the reported differences are based on an adjusted threshold stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. A very large number of statistical tests are performed, and most effects were not significant. This could suggest that either the authors successfully identified very specific correlates of aging (e.g. D2-D3 differences), or maybe that some effects were significant by chance (e.g. the authors computed 20 correlations between the different measures and age and found that 2 out of 20 are significant without applying correction for multiple comparisons). Statistical analyses should be strongly hypothesis-driven to limit the number of tests, especially when dealing with some many variables. For instance, the reason for testing cortical distances between peaks is not clear. Is it to test the interpretation of previous results arguing that the increased D2-D5 distance is evidence for 'an enlargement of topographic maps in older adults', or to see if the authors can replicate this D2-D5 result? If the former, then is this analysis necessary considering that enlargement of maps was already assessed above with the surface area measure (that can be done both globally and in a finger-specific way)? If the latter, then why are the authors testing relative distances between adjacent fingers instead of distances relative to D5? In the same line, correlations between data not showing significant main effect of age or interactions should be avoided (e.g., correlation between mean pRF sizes and dice coefficients that are not significant). Similarly, running stats on both the factors neighbour/age and digit-pair/age for RSA consists in running the test twice on the same data (circularity), just pooled differently (and in an unbalanced way when it comes to neighbourhood). The same applies to the mislocalisation analysis. If the purpose is to test global vs local effects, the authors should have independent measures to assess each. For instance, while local effects can easily be measured by maps overlaps/RSA and mislocalisations, global effects could be assessed by global changes in surface area/pRF sizes and hand dexterity? Finally, the hypothesis and justification for the resting state analysis is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful that the reviewers raised these various concerns. We tested for cortical distances between peaks because previous studies have reported that older adults show greater distances between D2 and D5 compared to younger adults (Kalisch et al., 2009). The authors related this to global effects (i.e., a larger map), but it could also be explained by local effects (e.g., shift of D5 away from D4 or shift of D2 away from D3 and so forth). The latter result would support local map distortion that could also relate to worse performance, as argued by Saadon-Grosman et al., (Saadon-Grosman et al., 2015 <italic>PNAS</italic>). In fact, testing for local map distortions was the major rationale for the distinction between local and global effects in the first place. When computing the ANOVA between finger-pair and age, our expectation was that we would find a shift of a specific finger-pair (or of a cluster of fingers, see Essential Revision Nr. 4) away from each other. Our idea was that in case this change is non-organized (i.e., different between each of the older adults) and relates to greater map dispersion in older adults (see Figure 2), this may indicate local map distortion. Alternatively, we expected to see a larger map (i.e., as shown by replicating the increased D2-D5 distance, and by showing a larger topographic map area). Both of these assumptions were not confirmed, but we found a selective shift of D2 and D3 towards each other. Given this pattern was systematic and related to lower map dispersion in older adults, the hypothesis of greater local map distortion in older adults was not confirmed. This experimental approach is now explained in the Results section in the following way:</p><p>“Previous studies found larger cortical distances between D2 and D5 in older adults compared to younger adults, which was argued to evidence a global enlargement of topographic maps in older adults (Kalisch et al., 2009). At the same time, this effect could also reflect changes in the topographic alignment between individual digit pairs (local effect). We used both absolute (Euclidean) and surface-based (geodesic) cortical distances measures to compare distances of digit representations in SI between younger and older adults to test for both global and local differences (see Figure 3C).” (page 9)</p><p>We followed the reviewers’ suggestion and removed correlations from the manuscript that did not directly address a scientific question. We removed the correlations between average pRF size and dice coefficients, and we also removed the correlations between average pRF size and cortical distance from the manuscript as we had no specific hypotheses on the outcome of these correlations. Further, we removed the correlations between behavioral and fMRI measures and individual age (except for addressing a specific reviewers’ comment as was the case for the data now reported in Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Because those were not discussed in the main text and were also not part of our main hypotheses, we agree that the better approach is to remove these correlations to reduce the number of tests performed.</p><p>With respect to the comparison of different neighbours, when performing the mislocalization analyses where we compared the different neighbours to each other to estimate whether or not the distribution was non-random (<italic>G</italic>-test of goodness-of-fit), we accounted for the different amounts of data in the different levels by comparing the measured distribution of mislocalizations with the proportional distribution as expected by chance (see Figure 6—figure supplement 1). This statistical approach was introduced and explained in detail by Schweizer et al., (2000) for the given set of data, and we followed the same approach.</p><p>With respect to comparing neighbours as post hoc comparisons between younger and older participants (for example in RSA), this approach is justified because both age groups have the same variance and number of variables in each variable (because all have 5 fingers, and all fingers were touched 20 times). This analysis is therefore valid as long as normality and equal variance can be ensured, which we tested. Also, as pointed out above, since correlation coefficients are based on independent data (separate runs), the estimated mean correlation coefficients should not be positively biased. Since we carried out classical random-effects analyses, the different number of comparisons at the subject level should only minimally affect the estimated statistics at the group level.</p><p>The rationale for performing the resting state analyses was to investigate whether the age-related difference in N3 representational similarity would be reflected in differences in low-frequency fluctuations during rest. This would indicate that task-independent differences in functional connectivity between the fingers would drive the observed changes. Our data, however, do not support this hypothesis. This is now clarified in the following way:</p><p>“In addition, resting state data were used to investigate whether the distance-mediated differences in representational similarity between younger and older adults, as reported above, are accompanied by differences in low frequency fluctuations during rest (Kuehn et al., 2017). This could be indicated via decreased functional connectivity between N3 fingers in older adults.” (page 14)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. While the correspondence between fMRI features and behaviour is quite convincing and suggests that these effects are not spurious, a more sensitive statistical approach might shed new light on the data. First, why did the authors decide to define two groups of age rather than using age as a covariate (e.g. ANCOVA or LMM)? This approach could be sensitive to both between-group differences and within-group differences, thus preventing to rely on a large number of correlations. Second, the comparison between fMRI features and behaviour mostly relies on the qualitative correspondence between significant effects (except for the correlations computed in the factor analysis). If the aim was to determine which local or global fMRI features are associated with behavioural changes and aging, it might be more optimal to directly compare fMRI features and behaviour by defining local fMRI features for individual fingers (e.g. area size, pRF size, response amplitude, etc…) and global fMRI features across fingers (e.g. distance, overlap, similarity, etc…). These fMRI features could then be used as co-variates to analyse behaviour (e.g. ANCOVA or LMM).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our analyses suggest a relationship between the functional fMRI measures and phenotypic behavioral measures that needs to be explored. It is first important to clarify that we did not define two groups in the factor model but we only tested the relationship between fMRI features and behavior within the group of older adults. The factor model was therefore only computed on older adults’ data and not on younger adults’ data, because our aim was to link the extent of specific features of cortical “de-differentiation” that should be present in older adults’ maps but not in younger adults’ maps to behavioral phenotypes. To follow the reviewers’ previous suggestions, we removed the correlations between functional variables, behavioral variables and age from the manuscript unless they were used to test specific hypotheses, or they were requested by the reviewers. Therefore, we do not report large numbers of correlations anymore.</p><p>We would also like to explain our concept of global versus local changes and how it relates to the reported analyses. The critical difference between global and local features is in how far the map area is affected (global = affects the whole map area, local = affects only parts of the map, see Figure 1). Therefore, each variable that we tested can in principle be classified as global and local dependent on whether the full map area shows a difference in this variable, or whether only parts of the map show a difference in this variable. This is what we tested by computing interaction effects between finger and age, and between neighbour and age as well as computing main effects of age. We find some differences at the global level (such as changes in pRF size and N3 differences that spread across the map at a specific distance) and some differences at the local level (such as D2-D3 distance and D2-D3 confusion). The difference between local and global does therefore not refer to the variable itself, but rather to the spatial extent of change. This is the reason why we cannot include both factors within one model, because this would violate the assumption of independence.</p><p>Instead, we followed the approach to first detect those global and local differences that differentiate younger from older adults’ maps (i.e., that define the presumably “de-differentiated map”), and to then use a factorial model to investigate relationships between these variables and behavior. This is clarified in the introduction in the following way:</p><p>“By combining ultra-high resolution functional imaging with population receptive field mapping, Fourier-based functional analyses, representational similarity analysis, psychophysics, and measures of everyday behavior, we could compare precise map features that differed between younger and older adults’ topographic maps, and link these to behavioral phenotypes relevant for everyday life.” (page 4)</p><p>In addition to adhering to the assumption of independence (by only including each variable once), we also have to address the problem of dimensionality reduction. This was done in the following way (now also described in the Materials and methods section):</p><p>“Factor analyses were conducted only on the data of older adults, and only with variables that showed differences between the two age groups. Reduction of the dimensionality of the data only to these variables that were different was necessary to reveal variables that showed joint variations due to unobserved latent variables and not due to intertwined features. Our goal was to reduce the dimensionality in the data down to the number of variables needed to capture its maximum variability. The number of dimensions does not necessarily correspond to the number of features, as not all variables measured were independent from one another. Our goal was to obtain a reduced set of degrees of freedom in the data, which could be used to reproduce most of its variability, and thus redundant features were of no interest. This redundancy was evident when we tried to include more variables in the model. By adding more variables, the presence of Heywood cases for some variables kept arising (meaning that these variables were entirely determined by common factors with specific variances-psi values close to zero) and in some cases, the model could no longer be computed. However, not all factor loadings provide meaningful information and their interpretation should be treated with caution, particularly when the sample size for this analysis is small. In general, there are different opinions regarding whether a factor loading is high or low (Maskey, Fei and Nguyen, 2018). A factor loading of a variable can be considered important for a factor, if it is at least |0.4| (Maskey, Fei and Nguyen, 2018), explaining around 16% of the variance in the variable (Field, 2009). We set a cut-off criterion for the accepted loadings in our model to |0.4| and followed the procedure of Maskey, Fei and Nguyen, (2018) regarding the exclusion of variables (i.e., deleting one variable at a time and always rerun the model, based first on the lowest factor loadings and then, if required, on the existence of cross-loadings). The first variable to be removed from the two-factor model was N3 representational similarity (loading of -0.19). After rerunning the model, pRF size was excluded next (loading of 0.30) and the model obtained after this second variable exclusion was the final two-factor model reported here. No further exclusions were required. The same process was followed for the three-factor model. pRF size was the first variable that was removed in this model (loading of 0.30). After pRF size exclusion, the obtained model was accepted with no further variable exclusions (all factor loadings &gt;|0.4|). Correlation coefficients between variables of each factor were then calculated within the group of older adults using Pearson correlations.“ (page 42)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Since most of the effects tested here were non-significant, considering the Bayesian equivalents of these test (available in R or JASP) might provide useful information by assessing the evidence for the presence or absence of an effect (rather than rejecting a possible difference with frequentist approach).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers on this point. We took two approaches to provide additional information on non-significant results that were interpreted as evidence for the absence of an effect. First, we calculated Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> as a measure of effect size and now provide the results in the text. We adhered to the classification of <italic>d</italic> &gt; 0 and <italic>d</italic> &lt; 0.2 as no effect, of <italic>d</italic> &gt; 0.2 and <italic>d</italic> &lt; 0.5 as small effect, and of <italic>d</italic> &gt; 0.5 and <italic>d</italic> &lt; 0.8 as intermediate effect (as suggested by Cohen, 1988). With respect to the non-significant test results reported before, we found that both measures of surface area revealed no effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.048 and <italic>d</italic> = 0.10), that the geodesic distance between D2 and D5 revealed no effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.04), that the Euclidean distance between D2 and D5 revealed no effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.12), and that percent signal change and the f-value revealed a small effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.38 and <italic>d</italic> = 0.30). This is now reported in the text.</p><p>For non-significant results that were interpreted as evidence for the absence of an effect that presented with Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> &gt; 0.2 (that is, with a small effect), we also computed statistical tests of equivalence. We used the two one-sided t-test (TOST), which is a frequentist alternative for testing for the equivalence by defining a band around 0 that constitutes a minimally-relevant effect size (Δ<italic><sub>L</sub></italic> and Δ<italic><sub>U</sub></italic>). (A similar specification is required for Bayesian alternatives by specifying the width, and possibly shape, of the prior). TOST works (1) by running two t-tests, testing the null hypothesis that the effect is smaller than the maximum of the indifference area and larger than its minimum, and (2) by choosing the smaller of the two t-values. A significant result would reject this null hypothesis, indicating that the true value lies in the indifference area. For more detail, please see Lakens, (2017) Equivalence Tests: A Practical Primer for <italic>t</italic> Tests, Correlations, and Meta-Analyses.</p><p>Using this approach, we tested non-significant results using the TOST equivalence test on results which were critical for the interpretation of our data. To determine Δ<italic><sub>L</sub></italic> and Δ<italic><sub>U</sub></italic>, we used an approach suggested by Simonsohn, (2015) who argue that in order to determine boundaries for equivalence tests, the boundaries should be set to the effect size of the distribution where a difference could be detected with 33% power (Simonsohn, (2015). Small telescopes detectability and the evaluation of replication results. Psychological Science, 26, 559–569). In the TOST procedure, the null hypothesis is the <italic>presence</italic> of a true effect of Δ<italic><sub>L</sub></italic> or Δ<italic><sub>U</sub></italic>, and the alternative hypothesis is an effect that falls within the equivalence bounds or the <italic>absence</italic> of an effect that is worthwhile to examine. If the <italic>p</italic>-value is below 0.05, we can therefore assume the <italic>absence</italic> of an effect that is worthwhile to examine. This was the case for % signal change (<italic>t</italic>(34)=-2.11, <italic>p</italic>=.000044) and mean f-values (<italic>t</italic>(34)=0.55, <italic>p</italic>=.13). We now report these statistics in the manuscript and conclude that whereas there is no difference in most variables reported, there is a small difference in mean f-values between groups that is not significant but that is also large enough not to be considered indifferent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors are particularly lenient with describing effects as 'trending towards significance'. P-values above 0.1 should certainly not be described this way. In some places, the (range of) p-values were not given directly in the main text, making it harder for the reader to evaluate the strength of the evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if p-values above 0.1 were described as trends in the previous version of the manuscript. We removed these statements. We now also provide information on exact p-statistics when we report non-significant effects. In addition, as noted in response to comment No. 11, we now performed additional tests on the non-significant results in order to reject a tested hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Please provide more details regarding the Bayesian pRF modelling:</p><p>a. Voxels were preselected prior to the analysis, but only a significance threshold is given. What was the contrast used to exclude voxels?</p></disp-quote><p>Bayesian pRF modelly analysis in the present study was performed by closely following the procedure of Zeidman et al., (2018) and Puckett et al., (2020). They divided the analysis into two stages: The first stage was to conduct a GLM analysis, which was performed by applying a general first-level analysis to prepare data for the pRF modelling procedure using SPM12. Similar to Puckett et al., (2020), 5 regressors were defined, corresponding to the five fingers of the right hand.</p><p>1 0 0 0 0</p><p>0 1 0 0 0</p><p>0 0 1 0 0</p><p>0 0 0 1 0</p><p>0 0 0 0 1</p><p>An F-contrast and a threshold of p&lt;.05 (uncorrected) was employed to reduce the number of voxel time-courses to model, and to reduce the number of BOLD time-series required for the modelling computations (Puckett et al., 2020). Note that this procedure is recommended to restrict the computationally heavy modeling (i.e., 36-48 hours per subject) to those voxels that show responsivity to the stimulus (Zeidman et al., 2018). Then, the extracted BOLD time-series were sent into the second stage, the actual pRF modelling analysis (Zeidman et al., 2018). During pRF modelling, there was no contrast employed, except that within the area of regions of interest, voxels were excluded if the pRF parameters failed to deviate from their priors (p &gt; 0.95). This is now clarified in Materials and methods in the following way:</p><p>“BOLD time-series were extracted for pRF modeling by reducing the number of voxel time courses. This was achieved by performing a two-stage analysis. The first stage was the GLM analyses stage, which was accomplished by performing a general 1st-level analysis with SPM to prepare data for pRF modelling procedure. At this stage, task regressors were first defined. Similar to Puckett et al., (2020), 5 regressors were constructed, corresponding with five fingers of the right hand. After performing an F-contrast, only time-series that passed a significance threshold of p&lt;.05 (uncorrected) were used for the pRF modeling (Zeidman et al., 2018, Puckett et al., 2020). This procedure allows reducing computing time considerably (note that one pRF modeling process takes around 2 days for the given input data). The resulting mask was combined with the freesurfer mask of area 3b. pRF modeling was then conducted on a voxel-wise basis, where the fit between an estimated waveform and the empirically measured BOLD-response was optimized. This was achieved by modifying the size and position of the pRF model. The posterior model probability was thresholded at &gt;0.95 (Puckett et al., 2020; Zeidman et al., 2018).” (page 40)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Which prior(s) was/were used – if the prior was based on 'typical pRF estimates' did this bias your estimates away from finding group differences?</p></disp-quote><p>The priors used in this study were chosen based on the recommendations of the developer of the Bayesian pRF toolbox (Zeidman et al., 2018), and based on their use in a later study on SI pRF mapping using the same method (Puckett et al., 2020): To constrain the centre of the pRF to fall within a certain area, latent variables were used. Two latent variables, namely l<sub>ρ</sub> and l<sub>θ</sub> (which control the polar coordinates, i.e., distance and angle), were introduced to constrain the pRF location, while latent variable l<sub>β</sub> was introduced to constrain the neuronal response to be positive. To complete the neuronal model specification, each latent variable was assigned a prior (normal) distribution, as the estimated parameters provided by the algorithm employed in the toolbox were computed under the Laplace assumption. According to Puckett et al., (2020), using voxel-wise priors would only have little impact on the final results compared with using the same prior for all voxels. Hence, the same priors for all voxels were also employed in the present study, which is not expected to bias pRF estimates away from finding a group difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Why did the authors use Bayesian pRF modelling, rather than a frequentist approach, which would match the rest of the manuscript's statistics?</p></disp-quote><p>The Bayesian approach to pRF modeling has advantages compared to the traditional pRF technique (Dumoulin and Wandell, 2008). The reasons are that estimates of the uncertainty associated with the pRF parameter estimates are provided, and that variability in the hemodynamic response across the brain is accounted for. This is particularly important for pRF modeling of older adults where a precise match between the BOLD response and the model is required. This method has already been applied in the tactile domain by Puckett et al., (2020), which allowed us to use an established framework and a similar experimental approach to answer questions on age-related differences in SI. This is an advantage compared to introducing a novel model to the tactile domain where the relation to previously reported data is unknown.</p><p>In addition, it is worth noting that the use of a Bayesian statistical model is not the same as using Bayesian inferential statistics. Unless one applies Bayesian inferential statistics to it, one is not mixing two philosophies. The alternative to Bayesian modeling is not frequentist statistics but maximum likelihood estimation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Please provide more information about the fit. Could the larger RF estimates in older participants be due to a poorer fit of the Gaussian?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding this question, we have sought advice from the developer of the Bayesian pRF modelling toolbox, Dr. Peter Zeidman. We would like to refer to his view on this question, which is the following:</p><p>“The model ‘fit’ mentioned here would be signal-to-noise ratio, which was scored by the % explained variance. One may ask what role signal-to-noise ratio plays in the modelling we performed here. For instance, what would be the consequence if older people have noisier data? Would it lead to worse model fits? The generative model we employed partitions variance in the BOLD signal into three parts: the pRF model, the haemodynamic model, and observation noise. Each of these parts are parameterized, and Bayesian methods are used to estimate a (multivariate normal) probability density over the parameters. As a result, we obtained both the expected values of the parameters, as well as their (co)variance or uncertainty. Decreased SNR would therefore be expected to increase the contribution of the noise part of the model, and potentially decrease the estimated precision of the pRF and haemodynamic parameters. In the extreme case of uninformative data, all parameters would revert to their prior expectations.”</p><p>It was not the case in our data that nosier data lead to worse model fits. In our data, the parameters encoding pRF size confidently moved away from their prior expectation in almost all subjects. This means that the larger pRF estimates we obtained from older participants was not due to poorer fit of Gaussian during modelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Is there good correspondence between the pRF distance estimates and the topographic maps estimated using phase encoding? Please also provide a supplementary figure with all participants' pRF estimates.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. We now added a figure where we show topographic maps based on phase estimates and topographic maps based on pRF estimates of all individual participants. As can be inspected in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 in the manuscript, there is a clear correspondence in the arrangements of both topographic maps within each individual. As can be inspected, the Fourier maps are larger than the pRF maps, which is due to the sensitive statistical approach used for frequency-based mapping that usually offers higher <italic>t</italic>-values compared to other statistical techniques. For the pRF mapping, a biological model of expected tissue responses is used to identify high probability values that are used for thresholding, which is more conservative compared to taking into account each voxel that responds to the respective stimulation frequency and phase. In this respect, both analyses offer complementary information on topographic map features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Relatedly, P26 who appears to be an outlier with very high pRF size for D5 (in Figure 4A) has medial activity for D1 (Figure 2C). If 'digit space' is parameterised as a circle instead of a line (allowing shared D5-D1 RFs), are the group estimates affected?</p></disp-quote><p>P26 is indeed an outlier who shows relatively high pRF size for D5 (as shown in Figure 4A) and medial activity for D1 (shown in Figure 2C). Outliers are generally expected when investigating older adults due to the high heterogeneity of the individual aging process (in the range between “superagers” to “normal agers” and “fast agers”, Depp and Jeste, 2006; Borelli et al., 2018 and Sun et al., 2016). To further address this point, we performed an ANOVA with the factors age and finger calculated on pRF sizes with P26 excluded to investigate if the outlier has an impact on the results. Our results revealed that also without the outlier included in the model, there was a significant effect on age (F(1)=0.58, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.05) as well as a significant effect on finger (F(4)=13.26, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.0001), whereas no significant interaction between age and finger was shown, as before (F(4)=1.7, <italic>p</italic>=.15). This result replicates the previous ANOVA result where P26 was included. These additional analyses are now also reported in the manuscript.</p><p>It is worth noting that although the D5 pRF size of P26 appears to be relatively high, it still follows the expected pattern that pRF centre locations of D1-D5 are arranged from superior to inferior. In addition, the calculation of pRF sizes was performed based on the defined regressors, which would not be influenced by the locations of pRF shown on the surface. That is, even if the ‘digit-space’ was defined into a circle instead of a line, the result would remain the same, as the pRF for five fingers would be calculated separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g. &quot;The main effect of finger was due to significantly larger pRF sizes of D1 compared to D2&quot; – p. 8. Based on figure 4, I think this should be &quot;smaller&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, the corresponding context has been modified in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h. &quot;For display, the dimensions of the pRF distance volumes were adjusted to 0/25.&quot; – p. 31. It is unclear what this means, please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has now been rephrased to make this clearer. It now reads: “Before pRF modeling, parameters for pRF centre locations were set between -12.5 (low x-values) to +12.5 (high x-values), and after pRF estimation, values were modeled accordingly. For display, the values are shown with a range between 0 and 25 to show the boundaries between each finger in integral numbers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Representational similarity analysis (RSA):</p><p>a. The distinction between 'local' and 'global' is not very clear, particularly when applied to distant finger pairs. Are N3 correlations the within-subject average of D1-D4 and D2-D5? Do the authors propose a global mechanism that only affects these two finger pairs, but not, say, D2-D4 or D3-D5?</p></disp-quote><p>The distinction between local and global effects has now been clarified in response to concern no. 3. The reviewer is right that we interpret the N3 effect as a global effect given the effect seems to be distance-mediated rather than location-mediated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. RSA values are typically plotted as dissimilarity (e.g. 1-corr.). The decision to plot the corr. directly while using the term RSA may cause some confusion. This is at the authors' discretion.</p></disp-quote><p>RSA values can in principle be plotted both as similarity and dissimilarity. We chose the former to align with the other matrix plot in the same figure that shows similarity (i.e., resting state correlations). We chose different colors for both matrices to show that the measures are different. We think that the interpretation of similarity is more intuitive in the present context of the figure than the interpretation of dissimilarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Dexterity and factor analysis:</p><p>a. The distinction between measures of hand dexterity that are 'global' and 'local' seems to be fully driven by the results from the factor analysis. As it stands, it is unclear why the O'Connor test is fundamentally different from the other two. The authors should attempt to explain why the O'Connor test was associated with a positive loading on local effects, while the Purdue and Grooved tests were associated with a negative loading on the global effects. These three tasks, while corresponding to different levels of difficulty, were described as assessing similar aspects of hand dexterity. It would also be helpful if the authors can provide information about potential different strategies used for the three tasks across the different age groups (e.g. which fingers are primarily used to handle the pins, did this differ across the tasks and across age groups).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the Purdue Pegboard and the Grooved Pegboard tasks are more similar to each other than the O’Connor task is similar to the other two. This is evident in our data when inspecting the results of the factor analysis, and by inspecting correlation coefficients between these measures, but this is also evident when inspecting prior research. Previous studies have found that particularly demanding versions of the Pegboard task relate to measures of tactile spatial acuity at the fingertip in older adults (Kalisch et al., 2008, Trembley et al., 2003). We replicated this effect by now incorporating 2PDT data into our manuscript (see comment No. 2) that show higher correlation coefficients (and a significant correlation) between the 2PDT and the more difficult Grooved Pegboard Task compared to the 2PDT and the easier Purdue Pegboard Task (r = 0.68 versus r = 0.35). This confirms the view that Pegboard tests rely on an accurate precision grip that relies on good spatial acuity at the fingertip (Kalisch et al., 2008).</p><p>Previous research has also shown that the relationship between tactile acuity at the hand and haptic object recognition is weaker (Kalisch et al., 2008). This is similar to our data, where we do not find a significant correlation between the O’Connor Dexterity test and the 2PDT. In fact, the O’Connor Dexterity test relies more on haptic object recognition than the Pegboard tasks by the requirement of the former to grasp exactly three needles out of a box with 20-30 needles in it. Usually, participants take the longest time of the task to grasp the three needles and align them to each other (both of what they have to master using one hand only) rather than placing the needles into the holes. In the other two tasks, however, the major requirement is to put the object correctly into the holes. Therefore, there is evidence both in prior research and in our data that the O’Connor task relies on haptic object recognition and thus interaction between the fingers, whereas the Pegboard tests rely on tactile spatial acuity at the finger tip, where within-digit spatial acuity is more relevant than between-digit interaction. This difference between the tasks is now also explained in the introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. In the Discussion section and abstract, then, the O'Connor test is reduced to &quot;hand dexterity&quot;, e.g. in &quot;more local 'de-differentiation' related to better hand dexterity&quot; – p. 18. Given the other two tests of hand dexterity showed different effects, this should be phrased more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. In the abstract, we now replaced the term hand dexterity with motor performance. In the discussion, this is now explained in more detail:</p><p>“In contrast to rats, we also do not see a significant correlation between larger pRF sizes and worse motor control of the hand, neither for motor tasks that rely on precision grips nor for a motor task that relies on haptic exploration. We also do not see a significant correlation between pRF size and spatial tactile acuity at the fingertip. The behavioral relevance of increased pRF size in humans therefore remains to be investigated.” (page 23)</p><p>“In this respect, the distinction between functional readouts that capture integration versus separation seems relevant (see Figure 1). Specifically, we found that reduced cortical distances between D2 and D3 representations related to worse tactile discrimination between these two fingers (i.e., worse separation in a tactile task) but to better motor control in a task that required haptic object exploration and coordinated finger movements (i.e., improved integration in motor task). These findings highlight the importance of assessing different aspects of signal integration and signal separation to investigate the impact of functional map changes on everyday life. Because this relationship was only seen for the index and middle finger and not for the other fingers, also the factor of spatial extent (i.e., local versus global, see Figure 1) is relevant for comprehensive data analysis.” (page 25)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Both Euclidean and Geodesic distance are included as inputs to the factor analysis and are the inputs with the strongest loadings on factor 1. Does this influence the factors?</p></disp-quote><p>These two variables are indeed the ones with the highest loadings on factor 1, both in the revised two-factor model and three-factor model. To better understand their contribution to the factor, we should consider the correlations between all different variables loading on this particular factor and their specific variances (psi values). For the Euclidean distance, the specific variance was 0.04 in both models and for the Geodesic distance, it was 0.22 and 0.21 for the two- and three-factor model, respectively. The low values indicate that for both variables, variance is entirely determined by the common factor. Additionally, since these two variables highly correlate with each other (<italic>r</italic>=.85) and both measure cortical distances, it is not surprising that one common factor exists and greatly determines their variance. In our view, this does not constitute a major problem for the other variables included in the model. Variables loading on the same factor correlate in a similar way with both cortical distance measures, while at the same time these measures do not seem to affect the variables loading on the other factor, since they do not significantly correlate with any of them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. Why were the various non-significant digit pairs or neighbourhood relations (for confusion, distance, or repr. correlation) not included in the factor analysis? Perhaps one way to show how meaningful the distinction between the factors is would be to show that even non-significant group differences show an appropriate difference in factor loadings.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we did consider the possibility of adding more variables into the model, the low number of observations for each variable did not allow us to follow this approach. As we already explained in our answer to comment no. 10, and as is also explained in our answer to comment no. 23, it was essential to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in our data and minimise it to those variables that explained most of the variance. But we agree that this approach is interesting for future studies, particularly those that have the possibility to measure &gt;50 older adults in the 7T-MRI. This is usually a problem for a one-center study, however, due to the strict exclusion criteria for 7T scans that particularly affect older adults.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors state in the results that the finger maps appeared in topographic alignment in all participants (page 6 and page 11). However, this is hardly appreciable when looking at the figures (Figure 2, 4 and 4S). There is also no description about how this topographic alignment was assessed. We recommend assessing statistically the topographic alignment between digits (different from the between subject dispersion analysis) to support these claims. Topographic alignment is visually depicted in Figure 3E, but this assessment is not described in the Results section.</p><p>To be specific, on page 6, &quot;The expected topographic alignment of the fingers (thumb [D1], index finger [D2], middle finger [D3], ring finger [D4], and small finger [D5] arranged superior -&gt; inferior in area 3b) was visible in all individuals of both age groups (see Figure 2C)&quot;, this seems like an overstatement after visual inspection of Figure 2C. Visual inspection of individual maps (Figure 2, 4 and 4S) suggest the presence of &quot;missing&quot; fingers in some individuals. This might be the case if no voxel responded preferably to a finger.</p><p>For example P1, P18, P25, P28, P33, P36 seem to have at least 1 missing color in the map. Please specify how the topographic alignment was assessed and how many participants had &quot;missing&quot; fingers in the maps (if any), and report the minimum number of voxels associated with a given finger in the topographic maps. In case a given subjects had a &quot;missing finger&quot;, how was missing data treated for statistics?</p><p>Further, on page 11, &quot;pRF centre locations revealed an organized finger map with D1-D5 arranged from superior to inferior, as expected&quot;, the authors probably meant &quot;inferior to superior. As for phase encoding, please specify how the topographic alignment was assessed and whether some participants had &quot;missing&quot; fingers in the maps and how this was treated for statistics. Inspection of figure 4S suggests indeed that some subject had &quot;missing&quot; fingers in their maps.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion with respect to the above outlined analyses. On page 6, we refer to the Fourier-based analyses when describing the maps because those were used to estimate surface area, % response amplitude, and f-values, as well as the alignment. This is now clarified in the manuscript (i.e., it now says “topographic Fourier-based maps”). For the Fourier-based analyses, we did not see any missing fingers; each finger was significant for each single individual. This is now also mentioned in the manuscript. For better clarification, each individual map is now shown in an enlarged view in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3:</p><p>Following the reviewers/editors suggestion, we now moved the description about topographic arrangement to a later part of the manuscript where we describe the group analysis of topographic arrangements based on the blocked-design data (shown in Figure 3E). Here, we now added a visualization of each individual topographic arrangement as Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and we also added an explanation to the text how the data were generated. The exact alignment of each individual’s map can therefore now be inspected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the GLM used to define finger-specific maps, which are then used for overlap and resting-state analyses, the statistical threshold used is too liberal (p&lt;0.05 uncorrected) which might affect the results of subsequent analyses. Page 36, line 1155: &quot;voxels that survived a significance threshold of p&lt;.05 (uncorrected) and k&gt;3&quot;, this is a very liberal threshold to define finger-specific areas, which will likely detect unspecific responses and result in larger overlap between digits. This is problematic as the result &quot;increased overlap in elderly's maps&quot; might be attributed to difference in unspecific responses. In addition, these maps were used for resting-state data extraction, which is also problematic, because an increased overlap would predict an increased resting-state functional connectivity. It may be better to use a more conservative threshold (e.g. 0.001 uncorrected) and to exclude any overlapping areas in the resting-state analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dice coefficient analyses are influenced by the chosen statistical threshold. In most papers that we inspected prior to study design, a different statistical threshold and analysis technique was chosen to report dice coefficient results. Therefore, before reporting the final results, we explored the data by calculating finger- and age-specific overlaps using different statistical thresholds. When inspecting the results, it is evident that at the statistical threshold where dice coefficients are above 0.1 (i.e., where neighbouring fingers start to overlap), older adults show greater overlap than younger adults. Therefore, the chosen threshold did not bias our finding that olders show higher dice coefficients compared to younger adults. These additional analyses are now incorporated into the manuscript as Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><p>With respect to the resting state analyses, changing the statistical threshold will not solve the problem of overlapping voxels, given neighbouring voxels are overlapping even at very high thresholds (see Figure 4—figure supplement 3). For the correlation analyses, however, overlapping voxels were excluded from the data. This information is now added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Considering that the authors select the variables 'that were shown differ between age groups' as inputs to the factor analysis, and that they now report a significant main effect of age on dice coefficients (and not just a trend), these should be added to the factor analysis. Related to that, please consider adding the dice result in the summary of your results at the beginning of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added mean dice coefficients to the factor analysis as suggested by the reviewers/editors. Some key scientific findings such as a shift in topographic maps in amputees that had been reported using the euclidean distance could not be replicated by using geodesic distance measures (i.e., Makin et al., 2013 Nat Commun). It has therefore been argued that only geodesic distance reflects the true “cortical distance” where euclidean distance also reflects aspects of wm connectivity and superficial wm fibers. In fact, we were surprised by the high correlation coefficient that we found in our study between the two measures. Therefore, we think that this information is important and should be reported. The cut-off criterion for the accepted loadings in our models remained the same as before (|0.4|). The new model reveals similar results as the previous model, where N3 representational similarity has again a separate factor loading (factor 3), and the O’Connor dexterity test, D2-D3 confusion, and cortical distances load on factor 1 (local effects), as before. Factor 2 is now composed of the Grooved Pegboard, the Purdue Pegboard, N3 confusion, pRF size, dice coefficients (global effects). The data and text is now updated in the manuscript (i.e., Figure 7).</p><p>The result of greater dice coefficients in older adults has now also been added to the summary of the results at the beginning of the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Response to previous comment 7. The scale is saturating the colours in the RDMs so it is difficult to inspect. Could the authors report the same stats as reported in the main text (ANOVA neighbour*age and ANOVA finger pairs*age) to see if results hold?</p></disp-quote><p>We follow the reviewer’s suggestion and now plot the colors using the same colormap in a smaller range between -0.5 and 0.5. In addition, we now report the same statistics as reported in the main text. With multivariate noise normalization, as before, the interaction between age and finger-pair is not significant (F(3,102)=0.26, <italic>p</italic>=.85) but now also the interaction effect between age and neighbour is no longer significant (F(4)=1.14, <italic>p</italic>=.34). This is not unexpected, since in our case, multivariate noise normalization strongly reduced the overall reliability (mean digit reliability before: 0.47 (younger adults), 0.45 (older adults), after: 0.24 (younger adults, 0.24 (older adults)), which has been reported elsewhere previously (Charest, Kriegeskorte and Kay, 2018, Neuroimage, Figure 4a; and Ritchie et al., 2020, Annual Meeting of the Vision Science Society, https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.20.11.515).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.

From the authors' response to point 1 (p. 3 of the response to reviewers):</p><p>&quot;With respect to the missing fingers, there were fingers 'missing' in the pRF centre location maps for 8 out of 36 subjects, as shown in Figure 4S. This is equal for the group of younger and older adults (n=4 in each group).

This is justified because overall, the missing values take up 8.9% of the data where biases are expected when more than 10% of the data are missing (Dong, Y., and Peng, C. Y. J. (2013).
