and solid-like biomolecular condensates may contain the same molecules but their behaviour, including movement, elasticity, and viscosity, is different on account of distinct physicochemical properties. As such, it is known that phase transitions affect the function of biological condensates and that material properties can be tuned by several factors including temperature, concentration, and valency. It is, however, unclear if some factors are more efficient than others at regulating their behaviour. Viral infections are good systems to address this question as they form condensates <italic>de novo</italic> as part of their replication programmes. Here, we used influenza A virus (IAV) liquid cytosolic condensates, AKA viral inclusions, to provide a proof of concept that liquid condensate hardening via changes in the valency of its components is more efficient than altering their concentration or the temperature of the cell. Liquid IAV inclusions may be hardened by targeting vRNP (viral ribonucleoprotein) interactions via the known NP (nucleoprotein) oligomerising molecule, nucleozin, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> without affecting host proteome abundance nor solubility. This study is a starting point for understanding how to pharmacologically modulate the material properties of IAV inclusions and may offer opportunities for alternative antiviral strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are organized into compartments that carry out specific functions. Envelope-like membranes enclose some of those compartments, while others remain unenclosed. The latter are called biomolecular condensates, and they can shift their physical states from a more liquid to a more solid form, which may affect how well they function. Temperature, molecular concentration and molecular interactions affect the physical state of condensates.</p><p>Understanding what causes physical shifts in biomolecular condensates could have important implications for human health. For example, many viruses, including influenza, HIV, rabies, measles and the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, use biomolecular condensates to multiply in cells. Changing the physical state of biomolecular condensates to one that hampers viruses’ ability to multiply could be an innovative approach to treating viruses.</p><p>Etibor et al. show that it is possible to harden condensates produced by influenza A virus. In the experiments, the researchers manipulated the temperature, molecular concentration and strength of connections between molecules in condensates created by influenza A-infected cells. Then, they measured their effects on the condensate’s physical state. The experiments showed that using drugs that strengthen the bonds between molecules in condensates was the most effective strategy for hardening. Studies in both human cells and mice showed that using drugs to harden condensate in infected cells did not harm the cells or the animal and disabled the virus.</p><p>The experiments provide preliminary evidence that using drugs to harden biomolecular condensates may be a potential treatment strategy for influenza A. More studies are necessary to test this approach to treating influenza A or other viruses that use condensates. If they are successful, the drug could add a new tool to the antiviral treatment toolbox.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>biomolecular condensates</kwd><kwd>viral inclusions</kwd><kwd>phase transitions</kwd><kwd>proteome-wide solubility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101001521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amorim</surname><given-names>Maria-João</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/128436/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Etibor</surname><given-names>Temitope Akhigbe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Commission Twinning Action Symbnet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>952537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amorim</surname><given-names>Maria-João</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/148391/2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brás</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UI/BD/152254/2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Victor Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Thermodynamic, kinetic, and dynamic analyses as well as solubility proteome profiling reveal that influenza A virus liquid inclusions may be selectively hardened with promising antiviral activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central to the spatiotemporal control of reactions in many viral infections is the formation of biomolecular condensates that facilitate key steps of viral lifecycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Etibor et al., 2021</xref>). In influenza A virus (IAV) infection, this is key for assembling its segmented genome, a complex composed of eight different viral RNA segments (vRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pons, 1976</xref>). Each vRNA is encapsidated by molecules of nucleoprotein (NP) along its length, with one unit of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, consisting of PB2, PB1, and PA) bound to the base-paired RNA termini, forming viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>). How the eight vRNP complex self-assembles is unknown. It is known that genomic complex formation relies on RNA-RNA interactions between distinct vRNPs and is a selective process because most virions contain exactly eight different vRNPs, as reviewed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hutchinson et al., 2010</xref>). After export from the nucleus where vRNPs are synthesised, vRNPs reach the cytosol and induce the formation of cytosolic condensates, known as viral inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avilov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakdawala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Momose et al., 2011</xref>), which we postulated to be sites dedicated to IAV genome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, IAV cytosolic inclusions exhibit liquid properties (fuse and divide, dissolve upon shock and are dynamic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>), providing the first indication that defined material properties are critical for the formation of influenza epidemic and pandemic genomes.</p><p>As the list of viruses utilising liquid biomolecular condensates rapidly increases, including reoviruses, human cytomegalovirus, HIV, rabies, measles, SARS-CoV-2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Etibor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lopez et al., 2021</xref>), it becomes pertinent to ask whether targeting the material properties could constitute a novel antiviral approach. Recently, the Sonic hedgehog pathway antagonist cyclopamine and its analogue A3E were demonstrated to inhibit human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) replication by altering the material properties of viral condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Risso-Ballester et al., 2021</xref>). However, compounds targeting hRSV-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Risso-Ballester et al., 2021</xref>) and cancer-associated condensates exhibited off-target effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klein et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, a critical advance in condensate disease therapy, including in the case of viral infection, requires defining how to efficiently and specifically target selected biomolecular condensates. In several studies, it was demonstrated that the properties of biomolecular condensates respond to many factors in a system-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falahati and Haji-Akbari, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Riback and Brangwynne, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mittag and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Snead and Gladfelter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milovanovic and De Camilli, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perdikari et al., 2020</xref>). Entropic free energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quiroz and Chilkoti, 2015</xref>), concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>), type, number and strength of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>) have all been demonstrated to affect the properties of biomolecular condensates. <italic>In vivo</italic>, it is unknown if these changes affect equally the material properties (and function) of biomolecular condensates. This knowledge is the basis to understand which pathways could be manipulated to modulate the material properties of selected condensates, ultimately targeting their behaviour and function. For example, pathways affecting local energy production, consumption, or metabolism will alter the free energy landscape of biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, pathways that regulate the local density of condensate drivers could affect concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, pathways regulating post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rai et al., 2018</xref>), local pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kroschwald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Munder et al., 2016</xref>), or ionic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), as well as strategies promoting aggregation or dissolution of condensate interactomes could affect the type, number (valency), and strength of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracha et al., 2019a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bracha et al., 2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Viral replication programmes rely on cellular pathways, and as such, their condensate biology is more complex than attainable with <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted systems. For this reason, studying them in their native intracellular environment will more accurately define how they respond to specific stimuli. Our study depends on introducing a disturbance and evaluating its effect on the material properties through two different approaches. The first is to map the intracellular biophysical traits of the perturbations on viral condensates measuring thermodynamic parameters, as done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shimobayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wei et al., 2020</xref>. As liquids tend to be spherical to minimise surface tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2023</xref>), we assessed their morphology and topology, and as molecules move freely in liquids, we also measured the Gibbs free energy of partition (henceforth called free energy, ΔG) to define the degree of molecular stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). The lower the value of ΔG, the more stabilised the system becomes. The calculation of ΔG requires assessing the ratio of concentration of material inside a condensate (C<sub>dense</sub>), relative to the concentration dissolved in the cytosol (C<sub>dilute</sub>), which provides the value of the partition coefficient (K), and allows the use of the formula ΔG = -RT<italic>In</italic>K and evaluate how the system progresses. In addition, the nucleation density determines how many viral condensates are formed per area of cytosol. Overall, the data will inform us if changing one parameter, e.g. the concentration, drives the system towards condensates of different sizes with the same or more stable properties (e.g. induced by phase transitions), or changes their abundance on account of additional available nucleation centres or dissolves the condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Snead et al., 2022</xref>). These are the most relevant parameters for our scientific question, which is to define how IAV liquid viral inclusions can be hardened. However, other values are retrieved from these analyses, revealing, for example, the types of interactions required to maintain the properties of the system. This can be illustrated by reports showing that with bulk concentration, C<sub>dilute</sub> is constant in a binary mixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klosin et al., 2020</xref>) but increases in multi-component systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>). This type of information has implications about the condensates formed during influenza infection. If the system is binary, the eight vRNPs could behave as a single component, on account of their similar structure, and interact with the host Ras-related protein in the brain 11 (Rab11), reported to be part of inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avilov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>). If IAV inclusions are multi-component systems, each vRNP could behave as an independent entity, on account of differences in length, RNA sequence, and valency or, as an alternative, viral inclusions could contain yet unidentified components other than Rab11 and vRNPs. The second type of approach to accurately define how IAV liquid inclusions respond to specific stimuli is to assess the effect of the perturbations in the dynamics and kinetics of viral condensates, thus inferring changes in elasticity and viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). This relies on using live-cell imaging approaches to assess if two condensates can fuse, internally rearrange, or exchange material, which are all <italic>bona fide</italic> traits of liquids but not of solids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). The information collected will offer insight into how the material properties of IAV inclusions are regulated and maintained. In addition, understanding how IAV viral inclusions can be hardened can be therapeutically relevant if they rely on their liquid character for function.</p><p>The objective of this project is to determine the most effective and precise approaches for hardening IAV liquid inclusions. We find that the stabilisation of intersegment interactions is more efficient at hardening IAV inclusions than varying the temperature or the concentration of the drivers of IAV inclusions. Importantly, we show that the hardening topological phenotype is observed in the lungs of infected mice. We also report that it is possible to affect viral inclusions without imposing additional changes in host protein abundance and solubility using solubility proteome profiling (SPP) of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sridharan et al., 2022</xref>). In sum, our data support the development of strategies targeting the material properties of cellular condensates in viral infections and provide a critical advance in how these structures may be regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Framework to identify perturbations that harden IAV liquid inclusions</title><p>We previously demonstrated that viral inclusions formed by IAV infection display a liquid profile in the sense that they drip, acquire a spherical shape upon fusion, and dissolve in response to hypotonic shock or brefeldin A treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we seek to identify the best strategies to harden viral inclusions to investigate if altering their material properties may be a novel antiviral therapy. For this, we systematically probed and compared the impact of temperature, concentration, and number/strength of ligations on the material properties of liquid viral inclusions, as a proxy of entropic, molecular, and valency contributions, respectively.

However, biomolecular condensates respond to fluctuations in temperature, and we took advantage of this to assess the entropic contribution of free energy and evaluate whether regulating host cell metabolism could offer future solutions to harden IAV liquid inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We quantitatively analysed the viral inclusions formed in cells incubated at 4°C, 37°C, and 42°C for 30 min at 8 hr post-infection (hpi) (representative images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This short duration in temperature shift did not alter the levels of cytosolic vRNPs, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Increasing the temperature from 37°C to 42°C did not significantly change the size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), aspect ratio, or number of viral inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–G</xref>), but decreased the concentration of vRNPs in condensates (C<sub>dense</sub>), and increased the nucleation density despite not altering the concentration of vRNPs in the milieu (C<sub>dilute</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 1)). This means that increasing the temperature up to 42°C still maintains the system in a two-phase regime, but affects the nucleation capacity, increasing the number of inclusions. Of note, vRNPs become homogenously distributed in the cytosol at 43.5°C (data not shown), pointing that the entire system may undergo regulatory processes. Importantly, this increase in temperature modestly destabilised the structure, as observed by an increase in Gibbs free energy (–2167.3±2361 J/mol @ 37°C to –1477.9±228 J/mol @ 42°C, mean ± SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N–O</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 1)). Conversely, decreasing the temperature until 4°C leads to an increase in the size of inclusions that is statistically significant considering 42°C to 4°C shifts only (shift in area from 0.2896±0.02 µm<sup>2</sup> at 42°C to 0.3474±0.05 at 4°C), rounds up liquid inclusions, and decreases their nucleation capacity and abundance (the latter significant only considering 42°C and 4°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 1)). A drop in temperature increases the concentration of vRNPs in inclusions (C<sub>dense</sub> at 37°C of 3116.0±0.05 AU, mean ± SD, and at 4°C of 2144.5±0.04 AU, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 1)), and does not significantly change the stability of IAV inclusions as determined by Gibbs free energy (–2415.6±273 J/mol @ 4°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and O</xref>). Overall, the data indicate that the temperature increasing from 4°C to 42°C shifts our system to smaller inclusions that have less vRNPs.

However, we did not observe significant alterations in the stabilisation of our system, supporting that alterations in the conditions tested for temperature do not affect the material properties of viral inclusions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Thermal changes mildly perturb the material properties of inclusions.</title><p>A549 were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 with PR8 virus for 8 hr, incubated at different temperatures (4°C, 37°C, 42°C) for 30 min, fixed, and analysed by immunofluorescence using antibody staining against Rab11 and nucleoprotein (NP) as a proxy for viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP).

As infection progresses, the concentration of vRNPs inside condensates increases until 8 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>), accompanied by an increase in the diluted cytosolic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 2)), and both parameters stabilise thereafter, indicating that the critical concentration occurs around 8 hpi. This indicates that the liquid inclusions behave as a multi-component system and allow us to speculate that the differences in length, RNA sequence, and valency that each vRNP may be key for the integrity and behaviour of condensates. Importantly, Gibbs free energy (normalised to 3 hpi) is lowest at 6 hpi (–1799.0±623 J/mol) and destabilises mildly onwards (–1139.8±382, –1131.2±444, and –833.8±342 J/mol @ 8, 12, and 16 hpi, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 2)). These results are consistent with the increase in cytosolic vRNP leading to bigger sized inclusions that overall maintain the same concentration although becoming modestly destabilised, suggesting that the material properties are also modestly affected. When overexpressing Rab11a (right side of each graph), cytosolic vRNPs also accumulated in viral inclusions that increased with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, from 0.243±0.03 to 0.385±0.04 µm<sup>2</sup>), but were significantly bigger than viral inclusions in GFP expressing cells. In addition, the nucleation density was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), despite having similar aspect ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), C<sub>dense</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>) and C<sub>dilute</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D and F</xref>). The lowest value of Gibbs free energy occurs at 8 hpi (–1337.7±331 J/mol) and destabilises from then onwards (–1145.3±443 and –895.3±394 J/mol @ 12 and 16 hpi, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>, all thermodynamic data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 3)). This is consistent with Rab11a overexpression giving rise to bigger viral inclusions than cells expressing native levels of Rab11a that overall contained the same vRNP concentration and destabilise slightly later in the time course of infection, confirming that Rab11a is involved in nucleating and/or maturating viral inclusions. Therefore, these data indicate that altering the concentration of vRNPs and/or Rab11a affects the size but modestly impact IAV inclusions’ material properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The increase in type/strength of vRNP interactions dramatically stabilises IAV inclusions</title><p>Another critical regulator of condensate properties is the type and strength of interactions among its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>).

It is well established that increasing temperature shifts a thermodynamic system to a homogeneous mix. In agreement, when we exposed IAV infected cells to a range of temperatures (4°C, 37°C, and 42°C), we found that higher temperatures yield smaller inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) during the two-phase regime, but tending towards its homogenous distribution in the cytoplasm that was achieved at 43.5°C. Interestingly, when infected cells were exposed to the same thermal conditions after nucleozin treatment, inclusions were irresponsive to thermal fluctuation, which indicates that nucleozin stabilises viral inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tracked how nucleozin affected IAV liquid inclusions, by imposing the infected cells to this drug for different periods ranging from from 5 min to 2 hr. We observed that nucleozin-treated inclusions form a multi-shaped meshwork unlike the rounded liquid droplets formed without nucleozin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and confirmed that nucleozin does not affect Rab11a localisation in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>). Nucleozin affected the concentration of vRNPs in the cytosol that decreased with the time of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), presumably by blocking vRNP nuclear export and/or changes accessibility of antibodies to oligomerised NP. Conversely, nucleozin treatment increased the size of viral inclusions (from 0.284±0.04 without nucleozin to 1.02±0.18 µm<sup>2</sup> with 2 hr treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which lost circularity (0.893±0.02 without nucleozin to 0.761±0.02 2 hr treatment) and roundness (0.734±0.01 without nucleozin to 0.672±0.02 with 2 hr treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>) and decreased in number (from 310.5±133 to 38.1±34 after 2 hr treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>), suggesting that they were stiffer. Interestingly, C<sub>dense</sub> increased dramatically (from 2125.8±0.09 without nucleozin to 3650.0±0.03 with 2 hr nucleozin), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–K</xref>) and C<sub>dilute</sub> decreased and became stable after 20 min treatment (from 728.1±213 without nucleozin to 398.6±94 after 2 hr treatment, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 4, total C<sub>dilute</sub>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and L–M</xref>), suggesting a decrease in C<sub>sat</sub> (saturation concentration), that is compatible with the formation of a stable complex rather than a liquid condensate. Importantly, these structures were energetically more stable, with lower free energy (from –1711.1±397 J/mol without nucleozin to –5388.4±808 J/mol 2 hr post-nucleozin addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N–O</xref>, all topological and thermodynamic values in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 4)).</p><p>Using the knowledge that the viral protein NP is critical to vRNP-nucleozin binding, and that the NP-Y289H renders the virus resistant, we sought to validate our findings with the mutant after adding nucleozin for 1 hr at 8 hpi.

Furthermore, these observations were validated by calculating the area of viral inclusions (from 0.16 to 0.18 µm<sup>2</sup> in all mock conditions, to 0.26–0.28 µm<sup>2</sup> upon infection both with WT and NP-Y289H mutant virus).

The same was observed for nucleozin stabilisation, as measured by Gibbs free energy that was only seen with the WT PR8 virus and not with NP-Y289H, demonstrating that viral inclusion stiffness related to the viral protein NP and its effect on vRNP-vRNP interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>).</p><p>Together, the data suggest that stabilising vRNP interactions changes inclusions more efficiently than the other strategies tested above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Modifiers of strength/type of interactions among vRNPs but not concentration or temperature harden liquid IAV inclusions</title><p>Changing the strength of interactions amongst vRNPs impacted viral inclusions’ thermodynamics the most and our assumption is that this translated into modification in the material properties.</p><p>To validate our assumption, we compared the material properties of viral inclusions arising in infected cells with and without overexpression of Rab11a, with those subjected to changes in strength/type of interactions using nucleozin.

In addition, it would be possible to accurately determine if overexpressing Rab11a impacts in material properties.</p><p>We first assessed the material properties of viral inclusions upon changes in concentration of Rab11a. Initially, we tested whether, in the two conditions, viral inclusions could fuse and divide. We observed that both fusion and fission events were taking place at late timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video3">Figure 5—video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video4">Figure 5—video 4</xref>). In a second approach, we measured the internal rearrangement in viral inclusions. Because of the small size and highly dynamic nature of IAV inclusions, previous attempts to perform fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments resulted in highly variable recovery rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>) that were unable to accurately determine if internal rearrangements were taking place viral inclusions. As the microtubule depolymerising drug nocodazole largely blocks the movement of IAV inclusions, rendering them larger and more spherical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avilov et al., 2012</xref>), we opted for bleaching IAV inclusions upon treating them with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video5 fig5video6">Figure 5—videos 5; 6</xref>). We observed that at late stages of infection, vRNPs were able to internally rearrange in normal conditions as well as when Rab11a was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These two experiments were important to validate that concentration did not impact the material properties of viral inclusions. However, to establish if Rab11a overexpression had any impact in the dynamics of viral inclusions, we tested the inclusion molecular dynamics by fluorescence loss after photoactivation (FLAPh, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In a live imaging experiment, a region of interest (ROI) was photoactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), its decay profile was monitored for 120 s and the plot fitted to a single exponential model. At late points of infection, native levels of Rab11a versus overexpressed Rab11 conditions exhibited distinct vRNP decay profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), half-lives (14.48±2.2 s [mean ± SEM] and 52.15±9.6 s, respectively) and rate constants (0.06±0.04 s<sup>-1</sup> [mean ± SEM] and 0.02±0.003 s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), despite not changing the mobile and immobile fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 5) and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video7">Figure 5—videos 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video12">12</xref>).

First, we assessed their movement and measured speed and displacement from their point of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Native liquid inclusions (treated with sham vehicle – dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) display a highly stochastic movement and long displacement, whilst nucleozin-hardened inclusions were less mobile with smaller displacement, as observed by analysing loss of movement in individual tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). There is an overall reduction in mean square displacement (MSD) with nucleozin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) that results in a lower MSD at 100 s (MSD<sub>100 s</sub> = 0.838 ± 1.17 µm<sup>2</sup> without nucleozin shifting to 0.057±0.22 µm<sup>2</sup> with treatment, median ± SD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> (Sheet 6)).</p><p>In a second approach, we measured the time that two droplets take to relax to a sphere upon fusion by coarsening assays (shifting the aspect ratio from 2 to 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

However, at the organismal level, it was not demonstrated that RSV inclusion bodies in infected cells retained hardened features.

This is a lysate centrifugation assay, which can distinguish the soluble (supernatant) from insoluble (dense assemblies) protein pools. The majority of proteins annotated to be part of membraneless organelles, as well as many cytoskeletal proteins, exhibit prominent insolubility. In SPP, two aliquots of cellular lysates are extracted with either a strong (SDS) or a mild (NP40) detergent. Protein extracted with SDS represent the total proteome, while the supernatant of NP40-extracted lysate represents the soluble sub-pool. The ratio of NP40- and SDS-derived protein abundance represents the solubility of a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Protein solubility is a proxy to track phase transition events in different cellular states. However, this measurement cannot distinguish between different events, such as solidification, phase separation, percolation, and gelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti and Hyman, 2021</xref>) that may underlie the phase transition.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hardening of influenza A virus (IAV) inclusions changes its proteome solubility.</title><p>(A–E) A549 cells constitutively expressing GFP-Rab11a-WT or GFP-Rab11a-DN were infected for 12 hr with PR8 at an MOI of 5 and treated with 5 µM nucleozin (Ncz) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 1 hr.

Nucleozin treatment did not induce significant alteration in host proteome abundance in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Similarly, no major changes in terms of protein solubility were observed for the host proteome during this treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that nucleozin does not induce changes in cellular protein levels or their solubility.</p><p>In terms of the viral proteome, the abundance of all protein components of vRNPs (NP, PB1, PB2, PA) and M1 show a modest increase in Rab11a-DN cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). On the solubility level, NP exhibited a prominent change. NP remains more soluble in Rab11a-DN lines compared to Rab11a-WT infected cells (fold change of 0.188, p=7.97e-6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). This corroborates the observation that vRNPs remain uniformly distributed in Rab11a-DN cells. Upon nucleozin treatment, SPP data reveal that the solubility of NP remains unaltered in Rab11a-WT cells, while increasing the proportion of NP in insoluble pool in Rab11a-DN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–E</xref>, red square). Although there were no changes in solubility by SPP, we observed IAV inclusions growing larger and hardening upon nucleozin treatment at the microscopic level in Rab11a-WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This can be explained, as vRNPs are already insoluble in viral inclusions before nucleozin treatment and the net increase in size of the inclusions does not result in higher insolubility of vRNPs. Both SPP and microscopy complement each other in the case of Rab11a-DN cells, as viral inclusions change from soluble to insoluble and become bigger upon nucleozin treatment. Overall, these data substantiate our finding that vRNPs form Rab11a-dependent insoluble and liquid inclusions that undergo a distinctive (aberrant) phase transition upon nucleozin treatment.</p><p>PR8-infected Rab11a-WT and Rab11a-DN cells were treated with either DMSO (vehicle) or 5 µM of nucleozin for 1 hr.

This is well understood for binary systems but deviate considerably for multi-component systems, even <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klosin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Snead et al., 2022</xref>). How living cells, that are complex multi-component systems at non-equilibrium, operate lacks understanding. Small alterations in the interactions, caused by changes in the environment or the interactome of the condensate, originate different self-assembled structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>) that respond distinctly to thermodynamic variables such as concentration, temperature, and type/strength of interactions. For example, increasing the concentration in a system is mostly associated with more ordered, less flexible structures, however higher ordered structures were reported to arise in response to a concentration reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Helmich et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, understanding how physical modulators of phase transitions impact the properties of condensates is key to comprehend how biological systems may be regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermans et al., 2009</xref>). IAV infection forms cytosolic liquid inclusions that are sites for genome assembly. Our study to address the fundamental question of whether the material properties of IAV inclusions may be modulated shows that IAV inclusions may be hardened by targeting vRNP interactions but not by lowering the temperature down to 4°C nor by altering the concentration of the factors that drive their formation. The data on temperature reveals that a decrease in the entropic contribution leads to a growth of condensates, as observed for other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falahati and Haji-Akbari, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>), that is, however, mild and does not significantly impact the stability of the structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Similarly, altering the concentration of drivers of IAV inclusions impact their size but not their material properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This is unexpected because many studies have shown that changing the temperature or concentration of condensate drivers dramatically impacts their phase diagrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bracha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riback et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>) and material properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). For influenza, these minor effects demonstrate that system is flexible, which may result from the necessity to maintain the liquid character over a wide range of vRNP concentration in the cytosol (low levels in the beginning and high at late stages of infection). The maintenance of the liquid character may be a regulated process involving fission and fusion events associated with the ER, as reported for other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, IAV liquid inclusions develop in proximity to a particular part of a modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Castro Martin et al., 2017</xref>), the ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the fusion and fission events of inclusions may be necessary to promote vRNP interactions, which is essential for genome assembly, as proposed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eisfeld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakdawala et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Working model for the strategies to modulate influenza A virus (IAV) liquid inclusions.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85182-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Defining the rules for hardening the condensates is important for understanding how biological condensates may be manipulated in cells and has consequences for development of novel antiviral treatments. By demonstrating that targeting the type/strength of interactions modulates the material properties of liquid viral inclusions in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models, we show that the development of molecules that affect the interactions between two components (such as post-translational modifications, local pH, or ionic strength or pharmaceutical modulators) should be prioritised over those increasing their concentration or local entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Such targeting may prevent off-target effects, especially by developing compounds able to distinguish free vRNP components from those in the supramolecular complex. In fact, the SPP herein reported demonstrates that it is possible to harden a liquid condensate without imposing changes in the host proteome abundance and solubility, which is important to increase specificity. However, a cost of targeting conserved molecules is the evolution of escape mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, a concern to address in the future is how to design suitable combinatory therapies able to reduce their emergence. Since single nucleotide mutations underpin numerous resistance mechanisms to antivirals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lampejo, 2020</xref>), an alternative is to engineer condensate hardening drugs that require multiple amino acid changes for escaping.</p><p>In this work, we explored the rules for hardening IAV liquid condensates. Other alternatives to modulate the material properties tailored for function can be developed. For example, accumulating evidence shows that blocking viral inclusion formation hinders viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Momose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vale-Costa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Castro Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vale-Costa and Amorim, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alenquer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Veler et al., 2022</xref>). Herein, we observe that increase in temperature biases the system to dissolving viral inclusions (that is complete at 43.5°C), therefore activating exothermic reactions close to IAV inclusions may lead to their dissolution. Furthermore, it has been previously demonstrated that blocking Rab11 pathway, directly or indirectly, hampers viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eisfeld et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Momose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2021</xref>). Future research could also explore this route. As Rab11a has emerged as a key factor for the replication of members of many unrelated viral families relevant for human health (Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Pneumoviridae), targeting its activity may serve as a pan-antiviral strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amorim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruce et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nakatsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nanbo and Ohba, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosentino et al., 2022</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Understanding condensate biology in living cells is physiological relevant but complex because the systems are heterotypic and away from equilibria. This is especially challenging for influenza A liquid inclusions that are formed by eight different vRNP complexes, which although sharing the same structure, vary in length, valency, and RNA sequence. In addition, liquid inclusions result from an incompletely understood interactome where vRNPs engage in multiple and distinct intersegment interactions bridging cognate vRNP-Rab11 units on flexible membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gavazzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shafiuddin and Boon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haralampiev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Le Sage et al., 2020</xref>). At present, we lack an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution system to understand the underlying mechanism governing demixing of vRNP-Rab11a-host membranes from the cytosol. This <italic>in vitro</italic> system would be useful to explore how the different segments independently modulate the material properties of inclusions, explore if condensates are sites of IAV genome assembly, determine thermodynamic values, thresholds accurately, perform rheological measurements for viscosity and elasticity, and validate our findings. The results could be compared to those obtained in cell systems to derive thermodynamic principles happening in a complex system away from equilibrium. Using cells to map how liquid inclusions respond to different perturbations provide the answer of how the system adapts <italic>in vivo</italic>, but has limitations. One of the constraints of using cells in this work relates to the range and precision of the concentrations we can vary in our system. Herein, we compared endogenous Rab11a cellular levels to a single pool of transduced cells that contained low, but still heterogeneous, levels of Rab11a as a way to avoid toxicity and/or uncharacterised effects of exceedingly high concentration of Rab11a in the cell. To minimise this limitation, we combined overexpressing Rab11a with a range of low and high levels of vRNPs (analysing the entire time course of infection) to understand if a combination of high levels of vRNPs and of Rab11a could synergistically change the material properties of IAV inclusions. Technically, we retrieved thermodynamic parameters (such as C<sub>dense</sub>, C<sub>dilute</sub>, shape, size) from images in which vRNPs were stained using antibodies. As mentioned above, antibodies may have some difficulty accessing the inner of the condensates, which could affect measurements of C<sub>dense</sub> or the total concentration of vRNPs in the cytosol. This could, in turn, affect the calculation of some thermodynamic parameters, including nucleation density and Gibbs free energy. Importantly, differences in antibody access may depend on some condensate properties, which may even change during infection, inducing artefactual trends. Alternatives to using antibodies comprise viruses with fluorescently tagged vRNPs, like the reported virus with the viral polymerase PA tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhagwat et al., 2018</xref>). This virus could be the ideal approach to evaluate inclusion thermodynamics for the whole study, were it not for the fact that the virus is attenuated, exhibiting delayed infection, reduced levels of viral proteins and of accumulation of vRNPs in the cytosol, with viral inclusions forming later in infection. As such, the use of these viruses would also affect the thermodynamic analyses. Future assessment of when one approach is more suitable over the other is needed. A second technical limitation relates that we acquired data from images in z-stacks as the sum of slices at specific snapshots of infection. However, although requiring a very complex imaging analysis that we lack, in the ideal scenario, the analysis should have been done using the whole volumetry of each viral inclusion, and using live images quantified over time that is yet to be reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

We picked the best approach out of three to measure C<sub>dilute</sub>. (1) Use ROIs from randomly selected cytoplasmic areas lacking inclusions. The limitation with this method is that inclusions are highly abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and are nearly impossible to manually or automatically draw without selecting regions containing inclusions. (2) Use an enlarged ROI band around the inclusions. This was easy to automate but limited by the overlap with other ROI bands due to the density of IAV inclusions in the infected cell. (3) Use ROI of the entire cytoplasm devoid of viral inclusions. This was easy to automate, lacks overlap with other ROIs and serves as the cleanest strategy when compared to strategy 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>).

At 12 hpi, media was substituted for Leibovitz L-15 media to buffer CO<sub>2</sub> and data acquisition started on Zeiss AiryScan LSM 980 microscope with a caged incubator to control temperature at 37°C. An ROI inside the inclusion was pulsed with an excitation laser (455 nm) and internal rearrangement of the bleached region was monitored (chase) by live imaging for 120 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Particle tracking and coarsening assay</title><p>Coarsening assays were calculated from two biological replicates in which several events were imaged. TrackMate plugin ((Fiji Is Just) ImageJ 2.1.0/1.53p, FIJI) was used to track inclusions at a timescale of 1 s/frame in live imaging samples and XY trajectories were subsequently analysed in a custom R (version 4.1.0) script.

Five µg of proteins (per condition) were diluted to a final volume of 20 µL with 0.5% (v/v) SDS and mixed with a bead slurry (Sera-Mag Speed beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific in ethanol) and incubated on a shaker at RT for 15 min. The beads were washed four times with 70% ethanol. Proteins on beads were overnight reduced (1.7 mM TECP), alkylated (5 mM chloroacetamide) and digested (0.2 µg trypsin, 0.2 µg LysC) 100 mM HEPES, pH 8. On the next day, peptides were eluted from the beads, dried under vacuum, reconstituted in 10 µL of water, and labelled with TMT-16plex reagents for 1 hr at RT. The labelling reaction was quenched with 4 µL of 5% (v/v) hydroxylamine and the conditions belonging to a single MS experiment were pooled together. The pooled sample was desalted with solid-phase extraction after acidification with 0.1% formic acid. The samples were loaded on a Waters OASIS HLB µelution plate (30 µm), washed twice with 0.05% formic acid, and finally eluted in 100 µL of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) formic acid.

Mobile phases constituted of 20 mM ammonium formate pH 10 (buffer A) and acetonitrile (buffer B). This system was run at 0.1 mL/min on the following gradient: 0% B for 0–2 min, linear increase 0–35% B in 2–60 min, 35–85% B in 60–62 min, maintain at 85% B until 68 min, linear decrease to 0% in 68–70 min, and finally equilibrated the system at 0% B until 85 min.

The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. The spray voltage and capillary temperature was set to 2.2 kV and 275°C, respectively. Full-scan MS spectra with a mass range of 375–1200 m/z were acquired in profile mode using a resolution of 70,000 (maximum fill time of 250 ms or a maximum of 3e6 ions (automatic gain control [AGC])). Fragmentation was triggered for the top 10 peaks with charge 2–4 on the MS scan (data-dependent acquisition) with a 30 s dynamic exclusion window (normalised collision energy was 30), and MS/MS spectra were acquired in profile mode with a resolution of 35,000 (maximum fill time of 120 ms or an AGC target of 2e5 ions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Protein identification and quantification</title><p>The MS data was processed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sridharan et al., 2019</xref>.

To quantify thermodynamics and topological variables, we extracted imaging data using an ImageJ custom plugin and a custom R analytics pipeline. For particle tracking, coarsening assay, photoactivation, photobleaching, and shock treatments, we compared two groups: cells treated with DMSO and nucleozin. In mice, comparison also involved the Mock- and PR8- infection. After data transformation in R, we assessed for homogeneity of variance. Homogenously distributed data were assessed by parametric test using either one-way ANOVA to analyse independent variables, followed by a post hoc analysis by Tukey multiple comparisons of means or t-test for comparison of two groups only. When the data is not homogenous, we used non-parametric analysis with statistical levels determined after Kruskal Wallis Bonferroni treatment. For simplicity, the details of the test used for each experiment are included in the figure legends. In our case, when two groups were compared, they were not homogenously distributed, hence a non-parametric analysis was done instead of a t-test. Alphabets above each boxplot represents the statistical differences between groups. Same alphabets indicate lack of significant difference between groups while different alphabets infer a statistically significant difference at α=0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animals were group housed in individually ventilated cages with access to food and water ad libitum.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mauricio Comas-Garcia as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should check and review extensively for improvements to the use of English.</p><p>2) Please address all the comments from reviewers 1 and 3, and the minor comments from reviewer 2.</p><p>3) Please address at least the major comments 1, 2, and 4 from reviewer 2. It would be ideal for addressing major comment 3, but if these experiments cannot be performed on time, please add a rational explanation to solve this particular question,</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed your article. The ideas are extremely interesting. However, it is extremely hard to read. Although I mentioned this before, this problem does not arise from technical flaws but is most likely from a language barrier. Having this problem solved and defining most of the terms you discuss in the results in the introduction would make the manuscript readable.</p><p>I would strongly suggest collaborating with a theoretical physicist or a physical chemist, as I am sure that the data you have presented here is the tip of the iceberg for a more in-deep analysis of the thermodynamics of the viral liquid condensates. It is my opinion that now the data looks very cool and can provide some insight into what is going on, but there is a lack of a much deeper analysis of the thermodynamics processes that you are describing.</p><p>I know this part can be repetitive with respect to what I wrote in the public version, but I see this manuscript as a diamond in the rough, and with some further analysis, it could become a gem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following suggestions are here to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) It is not clear to the reviewer how ΔΔG is calculated. In line 879, the authors wrote, &quot;The change in free energy was normalised to 3hpi (an infection stage with nuclear vRNP staining lacking cytoplasmic inclusions) and was represented as ΔΔG = ΔG – ΔG(3 hpi)&quot;. However, how can they calculate ΔG(3 hpi) as G=-RTLnK with K=Cdense/Cdilute and Cdense=0 after 3h?</p><p>2) Similarly, in table supplement 1, in sheet 1 to 4, there is &quot;C_dil&quot; and &quot;total_C_dil&quot; which have different values. However, total Cdil is indicated as Cdilute in the description of the parameters. What is the difference between both parameters and which one is used to calculate K?</p><p>3) I would suggest performing more systematic FRAP/FLAPh experiments on cells expressing fluorescent versions of both NP and Rab11a to investigate the influence of condensate size, time after infection, or global concentrations of Rab11a in the cell (using the total fluorescence of overexpressed GFP-Rab11a as a proxy) on condensate properties.</p><p>4) Eventual artifacts induced by the use of antibodies to quantify Cdense should be mentioned in the paragraph dedicated to the limitations of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study was well-carried out, and the implications could be huge – congrats on the great work! A question that I was wondering – have you tried to obtain a drug-resistant mutant of nucleozin, and see where the mutation(s) are? (c.f. Risso-Ballester et al., 2021) That could give important insights into how nucleozin works at the molecular level.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85182.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I enjoyed your article.

Here, ΔG = RTLnK, where is K is the partition coefficient calculated as C<sub>dense</sub> / C<sub>dilute</sub>. After calculating the ΔG at all time points, each ΔG was normalised to the time when inclusions have not yet emerged in the cytosol (but vRNPs begin to reach the cytosol), which is 3 hpi. At 3hpi, vRNPs are homogenously distributed in the cytosol without visible inclusions, serving as good control for when there is no phase transition. Here, as inclusions were not formed, we designed an ImageJ macro to collect ROI from Rab11 channel and superimpose it on NP channel (with NP as a proxy for vRNPs). The mean intensities within and outside these NP ROIs were analysed as C<sub>dense</sub> and C<sub>dilute</sub> respectively for 3 hpi. Ideally, in the absence of phase transition, C<sub>dense</sub> = C<sub>dilute</sub>, K = 1, and ΔG = 0. However, at 3 hpi, K was either a few fractions above or below 1, with a median of 1.748089 and 1.689856 for GFP and GFP-Rab11a expressing cells respectively and median ΔG of -1439.5 and -1352.18 for GFP and GFP-Rab11a expressing cells respectively. This may be due to the computer generated C<sub>dense</sub> ROI, which were contingent on Rab11 distribution (akin to mock infection) but different from Rab11-positive inclusions. Due to the variation in K and the magnitude of its effect in ΔG, we transformed ΔG to ΔΔG by normalising to ΔG at 3hpi using the formula: ΔΔG = ΔG – ΔG <sub>(3 hpi)</sub>. The exception is at different temperatures (where we showed the ΔG) which were all done at 8hpi and does not require normalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, in table supplement 1, in sheet 1 to 4, there is &quot;C_dil&quot; and &quot;total_C_dil&quot; which have different values. However, total Cdil is indicated as Cdilute in the description of the parameters. What is the difference between both parameters and which one is used to calculate K?</p></disp-quote><p>The values used are the ones in the described parameters. In Materials and methods, we explained the possible methods for calculating K and in our case two methods were readily feasible and made more sense.</p><p>To calculate K, C<sub>dense</sub> and C<sub>dilute</sub> must first be extrapolated. C<sub>dense</sub> was calculated as the mean intensity of each inclusion per cell (i.e. Nth C<sub>dense</sub> per cell). To calculate Cdilute three strategies are possible: (1) As published by Riback <italic>et al.</italic> 2020, a number of C<sub>dilute</sub> ROIs were selected outside the C<sub>dense</sub>. This method is not feasible in our situation as inclusions were ubiquitous in the cytoplasm and presents a technical challenge. (2) Using a custom macro, we measured C<sub>dilute</sub> from ROI bands around every inclusion in the cytoplasm (denoted as C_dil in the supplementary table). This would have been the ideal method in our case as every C<sub>dense</sub> would have its own corresponding C<sub>dilute</sub>. However, due to the ubiquity of inclusions in each cell, there many ROI bands overlapping with other inclusion region or another C<sub>dilute</sub> region (as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Even when we removed the inclusions before measuring the intensity of the ROI band, same problem persists in the opposite direction due to overlap with black filled spots (as exemplified in the figure 3 below).

A question that I was wondering – have you tried to obtain a drug-resistant mutant of nucleozin, and see where the mutation(s) are? (c.f. Risso-Ballester et al., 2021) That could give important insights into how nucleozin works at the molecular level.</p></disp-quote><p>Using fluorescence spectroscopy, docking model, molecular cloning, and immunofluorescence microscopy, Kao <italic>et al.</italic> 2010, postulated that viral protein NP is critical to vRNP-nucleozin binding. Importantly, tyrosine residue Y289 of wild-type NP was shown to form hydrophobic interactions with nucleozin by aromatic stacking, resulting in vRNP aggregation. NP point mutation replacing tyrosine with histidine in the 289 position leads to the formation of an escape mutant (Y289H) unable to induce vRNP aggregation. Of note, Amorim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013 showed by immunofluorescence microscopy, live imaging, and affinity purification (coupled with primer extension assay and western blot) that cytoplasmic vRNP aggregation was lost cells infected with the Y289H nucleozin resistant strain.</p><p>In the present manuscript, we have now confirmed the data that the NP mutant Y289H is resistant to nucleozin and applied our thermodynamic analyses to cells infected with it. The results are shown in Figure 4 P- R of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
