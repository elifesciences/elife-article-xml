Aside from canonical ligands, phospholipids are thought to bind specifically to the transmembrane domain of several ion channels. However, structural details of such lipid contacts remain elusive, partly due to limited resolution of these regions in experimental structures. Here, we discovered multiple lipid interactions in the channel GLIC by integrating cryo-electron microscopy and large-scale molecular simulations. We identified 25 bound lipids in the GLIC closed state, a conformation where none, to our knowledge, were previously known. Three lipids were associated with each subunit in the inner leaflet, including a buried interaction disrupted in mutant simulations. In the outer leaflet, two intrasubunit sites were evident in both closed and open states, while a putative intersubunit site was preferred in open-state simulations. This work offers molecular details of GLIC-lipid contacts particularly in the ill-characterized closed state, testable hypotheses for state-dependent binding, and a multidisciplinary strategy for modeling protein-lipid interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic></kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>Markov state model</kwd><kwd>lipid binding site</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>conformational transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindahl</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-04433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindahl</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018880</institution-id><institution>Sven och Lilly Lawskis Fond för Naturvetenskaplig Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rovšnik</surname><given-names>Urška</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017156</institution-id><institution>Swedish e-Science Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindahl</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Howard</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101093290</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindahl</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-05806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindahl</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of molecular dynamics simulations and electron cryomicroscopy characterizes interactions of a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel with 25 lipid molecules, specifically in a functional state in which they were not previously observed.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) can be found in numerous cell types, particularly in the postsynaptic membrane of the vertebrate nervous system, where they transduce electrochemical signals upon neurotransmitter binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tasneem et al., 2005</xref>). Gating in pLGICs is initiated by ligand binding in the extracellular domain (ECD), which is believed to lead to large twisting and blooming motions in the ECD, followed by rearrangements in the transmembrane domain (TMD), which eventually lead to opening of the central transmembrane pore. In addition to soluble ligands and numerous allosteric modulators, lipid components of the plasma membrane have been shown to bind to a variety of membrane proteins, potentially modifying their stability or gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>). For pLGICs, lipid composition was shown to influence reconstitution of functional activity in the <italic>Torpedo</italic> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as early as the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Popot et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Criado et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fong and McNamee, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">daCosta et al., 2002</xref>). Multiple members of the pLGIC family, particularly nAChRs and prokaryotic channels cloned from <italic>Gloeobacter violaceus</italic> (GLIC) and <italic>Dickeya dadantii</italic> (formerly <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>, reflected in the channel name ELIC), have since demonstrated functional sensitivity or co-purification with membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson and Baenziger, 2020</xref>). It has been suggested that lipids interact with membrane-facing loops from the ECD, or with the four membrane-spanning helices (M1-M4) of the TMD. However, many structural details of these lipid interactions remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poveda et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A critical challenge to elucidating lipid-protein interactions is their typically poor definition in experimental densities. Among more than 100 deposited structures in the protein data bank for GLIC crystallized under activating conditions, several lipid poses have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gharpure et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). These include an outer-leaflet site on the complementary face of a single GLIC subunit, an inner-leaflet site on the principal face of a subunit, and an interfacial inner-leaflet site making contacts with two neighboring subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson and Baenziger, 2020</xref>). In one case, an additional outer-leaflet density was built as a detergent molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). However, the positions and orientations of these membrane components or mimetics vary between structures and typically include only a subset of their constituent atoms.</p><p>Another issue is the potential dependence of lipid interactions on the functional state of the membrane protein. In most members of the pLGIC family, binding of a chemical stimulus to the ECD favors a transition from an unliganded, nonconducting state to a liganded, conducting state, and in some cases to a subsequent liganded, desensitized state. Although terminology in the field may vary, conditions predicted to favor the first versus second of these states are referred to here as <italic>resting</italic> versus <italic>activating</italic>; the corresponding conformations of the TMD pore are designated <italic>closed</italic> versus <italic>open</italic>. No lipids were reported with the lone X-ray structure of GLIC under resting conditions, raising the possibility that interactions could be state-dependent, or obscured by the relatively low overall resolution of this dataset (4.0 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>). Independent validation of phospholipid interactions in the closed as well as open states of GLIC would provide a valuable baseline for investigating such contacts in the larger family of pLGICs, including pharmacologically important effects of components such as cholesterol and neurosteroids that modulate LGICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson and Baenziger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim and Hibbs, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer an alternative approach to visualizing lipid-protein interactions. All-atom simulations of membrane proteins typically involve inserting an experimental structure in a simplified lipid bilayer surrounded by water and ions, all of which move freely according to physical principles encoded in the force field. Simulations on both atomistic and coarse-grained levels have recently enabled the identification of specific lipid interactions in pLGICs such as ELIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietzen et al., 2022</xref>), nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharp and Brannigan, 2021</xref>), glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dämgen and Biggin, 2021</xref>), and serotonin-3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crnjar and Molteni, 2021</xref>), but were typically limited to shorter timescales or specific protein conformations. We recently reported free energy landscapes for GLIC gating using Markov state modeling (MSM) of 120 µs unrestrained MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergh et al., 2021</xref>). Because GLIC is activated by external acidification (pH &lt; 6), resting versus activating conditions could be approximated throughout these simulations by setting titratable amino acid residues as deprotonated versus protonated, respectively. Under these two conditions, different distributions of functional states were captured, consistent with the relative stabilization of open versus closed channels upon activation. Although our previous analyses focused on conformational changes of the protein alone, the same simulation data encodes a wealth of additional features, including membrane lipids. We also recently reported the first structural data for GLIC using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), which enabled the reconstruction of multiple new closed structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rovšnik et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the first cryo-EM structure of GLIC in a closed conformation with multiple bound lipids resolved in each subunit. These were built into non-protein densities evident in the cryo-EM data, further informed by closed-state lipid occupancies independently identified and characterized from extensive MD simulations. Five distinct closed-state lipid-interaction sites per subunit covered intra- and intersubunit cavities in the inner and outer leaflets. We also compared open-state lipid occupancies from our simulations with previous open X-ray structures, identifying six possible poses. These analyses allowed prediction of novel lipid interaction features in GLIC, including a potentially state-dependent binding site at the outer subunit interface, and a potential role for lipid-tail saturation in binding at the inner leaflet, further validated through mutant simulations. In addition to casting light on selective lipid interactions with LGICs, this work demonstrates the combined power of experimental densities and molecular simulations to support the characterization of lipid binding sites in systems challenged by heterogeneous or otherwise low-resolution data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MSM and cryo-EM data resolve lipid-protein interactions</title><p>We previously reported cryo-EM structures of GLIC in multiple closed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rovšnik et al., 2021</xref>) and demonstrated how MSM can predict shifts in the GLIC gating landscape under resting versus activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergh et al., 2021</xref>).

As described in Materials and methods, resting conditions corresponded to neutral pH with most acidic residues deprotonated; activating conditions corresponded to acidic pH with several acidic residues protonated. Both open and closed conformations were present in both conditions, albeit with different probabilities. Simulation frames previously identified as either closed or open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were clustered to their corresponding state, and used to generate densities occupied by lipids that contacted the protein in at least 40% of simulation frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). Although the stochastic nature of simulations resulted in nonidentical lipid densities associated with the five GLIC subunits, patterns of lipid association were notably symmetric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These included an ECD motif with a characteristic proline/cysteine-rich turn, known as the Pro-loop (or Cys-loop in eukaryotes); N-terminal residues of the M1 helix; regions in and surrounding the M2-M3 loop; interfacial residues at the C-terminal end of M3; and inward- and outward-facing regions of M4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In several cases, these regions corresponded to longer-duration lipid interactions in molecular simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In the inner leaflet, relatively long-lasting interactions were found at the subunit interface, involving buried residues in both the M1 and M3 helices. In the outer leaflet, longer interactions were focused around the pre-M1 and M2-M3 loops. Lateral lipid diffusion coefficients were estimated to 1.47 nm<sup>2</sup>/µs for bulk lipids and 0.68 nm<sup>2</sup>/µs for lipids of the first lipid shell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which is relatively slow compared to the timescales of each trajectory (1.7 µs). However, multiple residues throughout the M1, M3, and M4 helices exchanged contacts with two to four different lipid molecules in individual simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, 1.7 µs root mean square displacement of lipids originally in the first lipid shell was 2.15 nm, and 3.16 nm in the bulk bilayer, indicating such exchanges are not limited to nearby lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, exchange events and diffusion estimates indicate that the duration of lipid contacts observed in this work can be at least partly attributed to interaction stabilities and not solely to sampling limitations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and simulations reveal lipid interaction sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM reconstruction of closed GLIC with distance to the interacting lipids colored according to the bar below.

Interestingly, lipids adopted two types of poses in this site, depending on the placement of the unsaturated tail.

When the double bond exited the pocket, the more flexible saturated tail was able to enter the intersubunit cleft and sample a range of poses characterized by contacts distributed more broadly across the lipid tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), resulting in some deeply buried poses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right).</p><p>To further explore the influence of specific amino acid contacts on this interfacial lipid pose, we performed additional MD simulations with mutations in targeted sites.

Conversely, removing the bulky tryptophan sidechain at position 217 (W217A) dramatically shortened lipid contacts at the more deeply buried T274 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results confirm the importance of specific sidechain identities on the protein surface (W217) in influencing lipid binding pose, whereas even long-lived contacts (T274) may be sustained more by their buried position than sidechain size.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Intrasubunit lipids and state dependence in the outer leaflet</title><p>In the outer leaflet, closed-state cryo-EM densities enabled confident building of two lipid poses, associated with either the principal or complementary face of each subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left).

However, comparing open- versus closed-state occupancies suggested state-dependent differences in lipid interactions, as described below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>At the complementary face, lipid tails were more likely to enter a buried region of the intrasubunit pocket in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the difference was subtle, the distribution of outer-leaflet lipids shifted in snapshots of open compared to closed conformations, increasing (5–10%) the probability of lipids penetrating 18 Å from the pore axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, lipid tails entered even deeper (15 Å from the pore) in an alternative state within the GLIC gating landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), previously associated with channel desensitization due to relative contraction at the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergh et al., 2021</xref>). Although the lipid tails were too poorly resolved in our structural data to definitively capture buried interactions at the complementary site, it is interesting that the simulations implicated them in channel opening (and possibly in transitions further along the activation pathway) given that the deeper parts of this site have been shown to bind allosteric modulators such as propofol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heusser et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>At the principal face, interactions with lipid heads were more diverse than those with lipid tails. In our closed cryo-EM and a previously reported open X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2018</xref>), the lipid or detergent head in this site tilted away from the pore axis, toward M4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). On initial inspection, lipid-head densities appeared less tilted in closed- versus open-state simulation frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, lipid heads in this site were relatively flexible and did align with cryo-EM densities in several closed-state snapshots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In fact, lowering the occupancy threshold (from 40% to 30%) revealed an alternative head-group density, tilted toward M4 and covering most of the lipid built in our cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Thus, despite an apparent discrepancy between highly populated densities in simulations and cryo-EM data, both methods supported at least partial occupancy in the built pose. Although this lipid head was primarily associated with M3-M4 on the principal face of one subunit, it also made contacts with residues on the complementary M1 helix (Q193, S196) in closed- but not open-state simulation frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B, and C</xref>), likely associated with conformational changes during gating.</p><p>In addition to the intrasubunit sites described above, a third outer-leaflet lipid density was observed in open-state simulation frames, wedged between two subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right). This intersubunit pose was not apparent in closed-state simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left), nor in closed or open experimental GLIC structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The lipid head made particularly close contacts with residue P250 on the M2-M3 loop, which undergoes substantial conformational change away from the pore upon channel opening, along with outer-leaflet regions of M1-M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B, and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). These conformational changes were accompanied by a flip of M1 residue F195, which blocked the site in the closed state but rotated inward to allow closer lipid interactions in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Indeed, P250 was predominantly located within 3 Å of the nearest lipid atom in open- but not closed-state frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Despite being restricted to the open state, interactions with P250 were among the longest duration in all simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and as these binding events preceded pore opening, it is plausible to infer a role for this state-dependent lipid interaction in the gating process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Lipid interactions have increasingly been shown to play important roles in stabilizing and regulating membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cordero-Morales and Vásquez, 2018</xref>). Particularly since the emergence of cryo-EM, a growing number of ion channel structures have been reported with detergents or lipids in membrane-facing regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thompson and Baenziger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levental and Lyman, 2023</xref>). However, the resolution of bound lipids is typically low compared to the protein, making it challenging to define precise poses or interactions. As a result, lipids and detergents are often built with truncated heads, modeled as isolated hydrocarbon chains, or disregarded altogether to avoid overfitting. Here, we present the building of lipids in the closed state of GLIC by comparing non-protein densities in a relatively high-resolution cryo-EM map with lipid interactions sampled in MD simulations.</p><p>Our 2.9 Å cryo-EM structure represents, to our knowledge, the highest-resolution closed state of wild-type GLIC yet reported, and the first in which lipids could be confidently built. Notably, the GLIC sample was solubilized in detergent, which is typically thought to replace biological lipids. Nonetheless, the forked shape of non-protein densities associated with each channel subunit indicated the presence of phospholipids, evidently bound tightly enough to resist substitution by detergent. Similarly persistent lipids have been reported in at least three sites per subunit of open-state GLIC; here, we find evidence for five lipids per subunit in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Continued improvements in membrane-protein cryo-EM may reveal the full extent of persistent lipid binding at key transmembrane sites in the larger pLGIC family.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Lipid sites identified by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the closed state, five lipid interaction sites were independently identified through both cryo-EM and simulations. In the outer leaflet, two intrasubunit sites are situated at the principal (<bold>P</bold>) and complementary (<bold>C</bold>) subunits, with the lipid at the principal subunit site interacting with S196 of the pre-M1 loop. Particularly, no lipid site could be found at the subunit interface. In the inner leaflet, a buried lipid pose was found at the subunit interface, determined by interactions with T274 and W217 of the M3 and M1 helices, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) In the open state, six lipid interaction sites were identified from simulations, out of which three sites were known from previous structures and one presumably occupied by a detergent molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2018</xref>) (thin blue stripes). In the outer leaflet, an additional lipid site could be found at the subunit interface in the open state, interacting with P250 on the M2-M3 loop. Additionally, the site at the principal intrasubunit site is slightly closer to the M4 helix compared to the closed state, and the lipid site at the principal intrasubunit site has an increased likelihood of tail penetration into an allosteric pocket compared to the closed state. Lipid sites in the inner leaflet are at positions equivalent to those in the closed state.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86016-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>MD simulations have recently been used to identify lipid binding sites corresponding to experimental data for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dietzen et al., 2022</xref>), including nAChRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharp and Brannigan, 2021</xref>), glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dämgen and Biggin, 2021</xref>), and serotonin-3A receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crnjar and Molteni, 2021</xref>). In most cases, the slow rate of lateral lipid diffusion has resulted in the preferential use of coarse-grained force fields able to sample longer timescales, but that may overestimate the strength of interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamprakis et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, such studies typically apply harmonic restraints to the protein, potentially obscuring contributions of protein dynamics to lipid interactions. Indeed, the unrestrained atomistic MD simulations studied here were not expected to capture the maximal duration of stable contacts, as indicated by some interaction times approaching the full 1.7 µs trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, simulations were of sufficient length to sample exchange of up to four lipids, particularly around the M4 helix. Calculation of lipid lateral diffusion coefficients resulted in average displacements at the end of simulations of 2.15 nm for lipids initially interacting with the protein surface, roughly corresponding to lipids diffusing out to the fourth lipid shell. Diffusion of bulk lipids was faster, allowing lipids originally 3.16 nm away from the protein surface to ingress the first lipid shell. This observation underscores the potential for lipid exchange events even among lipids initially distant from the protein surface. Of course, duration of exceptionally stable interactions, such as those involving T274 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), inevitably remain bounded by the length of our simulations. Still, diffusion metrics, supported by robust statistical analysis encompassing diverse starting conditions (500 trajectories), enable confident estimation of relative interaction times.</p><p>Sampling was further simplified by performing simulations in a uniform POPC membrane. Prior experiments have been conducted to assess the sensitivity of GLIC in varying lipid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labriola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carswell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menny et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that GLIC remains fully functional in pure POPC bilayers. In our cryo-EM experiments, the protein was recombinantly expressed from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which means that the experimental density would likely represent phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylethanolamine lipids. However, as the molecular identities of bound lipids could not be precisely determined, POPC lipids were built for straightforward comparison with simulation poses. While it appears that GLIC is capable of gating in a pure POPC bilayer, it remains plausible that its function could be influenced by different lipid species, especially due to the presence of multiple charged residues around the TMD/ECD interface which might interact differently with different lipid head groups. Further experiments would be needed to confirm whether the state dependence observed in simulations is also lipid-dependent. It is possible that certain types of lipids bind in one but not the other state, or that certain states are stabilized by a particular lipid type.</p><p>In simulations, we were able to identify both long-lasting and highly occupied lipid sites by analyzing a large number of parallel trajectories (500 instances of each subunit). Simulation frames could further be classified into closed or open states by projection onto a previously published Markov state model of GLIC gating, which had been validated against electrophysiology recordings and structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergh et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, as simulations were initiated by placing the GLIC structures in generated POPC bilayers, it is reassuring that lipid binding sites identified in simulations appear to correspond closely to densities representing lipids bound tightly enough in the cryo-EM data to be retained during reconstitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). The resulting occupancy plots enabled confident distinction between functional annotations while preserving the protein’s flexibility and capacity to transition between states throughout the simulations. Interestingly, the occupational densities varied remarkably little between resting and activating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating state rather than pH dependence in lipid interactions, also further justifying the approach of merging closed-state GLIC cryo-EM datasets collected at different pH conditions to resolve lipids.</p><p>The three lipids identified in the inner leaflet may play primarily structural roles, as they did not vary substantially between closed and open states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Principal-face and intersubunit sites in our closed cryo-EM structure were largely superimposable with those in open X-ray structures, and all three sites contained comparable densities in closed- and open-state simulation frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A particularly stable contact in this leaflet featured deep intercalation of a lipid tail between channel subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), as represented by lipid interactions persisting over 1 µs at residue T274, the longest-lasting in the entire protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). A lipid in this site was also reported in previous open-state X-ray structures of GLIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocquet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Removal of the sidechain at W217 substantially abbreviated interactions with its buried neighbor T274 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting this hydrophobic contact helps to stabilize lipid penetration. Notably, the same W217A substitution was previously shown to suppress GLIC function and was considered the most impactful of several aromatic residues on the transmembrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Therien and Baenziger, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, a lack of double bonds in the intercalating tail was associated with the lipid head group interacting more closely with the protein surface, indicating a possible role for saturation in overall lipid-binding modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The relevance of lipid intercalation and saturation has been difficult to establish on the basis of structural data, given that resolved lipid tails are often limited to a few hydrocarbons beyond the glycerol group. An important extension of this work may be to apply similar analyses to simulations of mixed-lipid systems, albeit at substantially higher computational cost.</p><p>Lipid interactions in the outer leaflet were more variable, both between functional states and experimental methods, possibly reflecting larger conformational changes of the protein in this region. At the complementary-face site - one of the most consistently documented in previous X-ray structures - simulations indicated that lipid tails could penetrate deeper into the helical bundle upon channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and even further in a state associated with desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, buried portions of this site have been shown to host allosteric modulators such as propofol, substituting for lipid-tail interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heusser et al., 2018</xref>). State dependence was also suggested at the principal-face site, where the lipid head preferred a pose tilted in toward M3 in the closed state, but tilted out toward M4 in the open state. However, our closed cryo-EM structure was more consistent with open-state simulations, and with a detergent built in an open X-ray structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, the outward orientation was also sampled in closed-state simulations, albeit with lower frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The relevance of the inward-facing pose, possibly in the context of an alternative lipid head group, remains to be determined. The most provocative indication of state dependence was at the outer subunit interface, which did not contain strong density in either cryo-EM or simulations data for the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, lipid occupancy at this site was evident in open simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), including state-dependent contacts with P250, a conserved M2-M3 residue implicated in channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaczor et al., 2022</xref>). Although lipids have yet to be resolved at this intersubunit site in GLIC, they have been reported in open-state structures of both ELIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petroff et al., 2022</xref>) and GluCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Althoff et al., 2014</xref>), and in a desensitized neuronal GABA(A) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laverty et al., 2019</xref>). The state-dependent binding event at this site preceded pore opening in MSMs, where lipid binding coincided with crossing a smaller energy barrier between closed and intermediate states, followed by pore opening at the main energy barrier between intermediate and open states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Further, since the P250-lipid interaction was characterized by relatively long residence times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it is possible this lipid interaction has a role to play in GLIC gating.</p><p>Finally, this work demonstrates the combined power of cryo-EM and MD simulations to characterize membrane-protein lipid interactions. In leveraging extensive MD simulations to build lipids for the first time into a closed-state structure of GLIC, we were also able to capture features of lipid-tail saturation and potential state dependence that were not available from structural data alone. Knowledge of such interactions may prove useful in the development of lipid-like drugs or lipid-focused treatments of diseases related to malfunction of pLGICs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>MD simulations and analysis</title><p>We analyzed previously published MSMs of GLIC gating under both resting and activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergh et al., 2021</xref>).

Acidic residues (E26, E35, E67, E75, E82, D86, D88, E177, E243; H277 doubly protonated) were protonated to approximate the probable pattern at pH 4.6, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergh et al., 2021</xref>).

This residue has been shown to interact with phospholipids in other pLGICs and forms the binding site of potentiating neurosteroids in the GABA(A) receptor.</p><p>Weaknesses of this article include the following:</p><p>1. The authors describe in detail state-dependent lipid interactions from the MD simulations; however, the functional significance of these findings is unclear. GLIC function appears to be insensitive to lipids, although this understanding is based on experiments where GLIC proteoliposomes were fused to oocyte membranes, which may not be optimal to control the lipid environment. Without functional studies of GLIC in model membranes, the lipid dependence of GLIC function is not definitively known. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the meaning of these state-dependent lipid interactions in GLIC.</p><p>1. It is unlikely that the bound phospholipids in the GLIC structures, which are co-purified from <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes, are POPC. Rather, these are most like PE or PG lipids. While it is difficult to accommodate mixed phospholipid membranes in all-atom MD simulations, the choice of POPC for this model, while practically convenient, seems suboptimal, especially since it is not known if PE or PG lipids modulate GLIC function. Nevertheless, it is striking that the overall binding poses of POPC from the simulations agree with those identified in the structures. It is possible that the identity of the phospholipid headgroup will have more of an impact on the strength of interactions with GLIC rather than the interaction poses (see next point).</p><p>1. The all-atom MD simulations provide limited insight into the strength of the POPC interactions at each site, which is important to interpret the significance of these interactions. It is unlikely that the system has equilibrated within the 1.7 microseconds of simulation for each replicate preventing a meaningful assessment of the lipid interaction times. Although the authors report exchange of up to 4 POPC interacting at certain residues in M4, this may not represent binding/unbinding events (depending on how binding/interaction is defined), since the 4 Å cutoff distance for lipid interactions is relatively small. This may instead be a result of small movements of POPC in and out of this cutoff. The ability to assess interaction times may have been strengthened if the authors performed a single extended replicate up to, for example, 10-20 microseconds instead of extending multiple replicates to 1.7 microseconds.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors convincingly show multiple inner and outer leaflet non-protein (lipid) densities in a cryo-EM closed state structure of GLIC, a prokaryotic homologue of canonical pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, and observe lipids in similar sites during extensive simulations at both resting and activating pH. The simulations not only corroborate structural observations, but also suggest the existence of a state-dependent lipid intersubunit site only occupied in the open state. These important findings will be of considerable interest to the ion channel community and provide new hypotheses about lipid interactions in conjunction with channel gating.</p></disp-quote><p>Recommendations for the authors: please note that you control which, if any, revisions, to undertake</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, a discussion of whether the timescale of the simulations permit measurements of residence or interaction times of the lipids should be addressed.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Comment 1.1: The authors may consider expanding the discussion about the significance of state-dependent lipid interactions. On the one hand, they emphasize state-dependent interactions of POPC with closed and open states in the outer leaflet in the results. On the other hand, they state that GLIC is insensitive to its lipid environment. What is the significance of the state-dependent interactions of POPC in GLIC, if any? It is possible that GLIC agonist responses are sensitive to phospholipids (such as PE or PG found in <italic>E. coli</italic>)? The state-dependent differences in lipid interaction identified in this study support this possibility and suggest the need to better understand the effects of phospholipids on GLIC function.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1.1: We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting question and we have therefore extended the discussion with additional references on the functional effects on GLIC of various lipid membranes:</p><p>p. 11 (Discussion)</p><p>“Sampling was further simplified by performing simulations in a uniform POPC membrane. Prior experiments have been conducted to assess the sensitivity of GLIC in varying lipid environments (Labriola et al., 2013; Carswell et al., 2015; Menny et al., 2017), indicating that GLIC remains fully functional in pure POPC bilayers. In our cryo-EM experiments, the protein was recombinantly expressed from <italic>E. coli</italic>, which means that the experimental density would likely represent phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylethanolamine lipids.However, as the molecular identities of bound lipids could not be precisely determined, POPC lipids were built for straightforward comparison with simulation poses. While it appears that GLIC is capable of gating in a pure POPC bilayer, it remains plausible that its function could be influenced by different lipid species, especially due to the presence of multiple charged residues around the TMD/ECD interface which might interact differently with different lipid head groups. Further experiments would be needed to confirm whether the state dependence observed in simulations is also lipid-dependent. It is possible that certain types of lipids bind in one but not the other state, or that certain states are stabilized by a particular lipid type.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1.2: It would be helpful to state in the discussion that the co-purified lipids from GLIC structures are likely PE or PG from <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the phospholipid poses from the structures generally agree with those identified from the MD simulations using PC.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1.2: Good point. We have clarified in the discussion that the native lipids in the cryo-EM structure are likely PG or PE lipids, as quoted in the preceding Response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1.3: The authors describe a more deeply penetrating interaction of POPC in the outer intrasubunit cleft in the open state, but this is difficult to appreciate from the images in Fig. 4B, 4E or S3B. The same is true of the deep POPC interaction at the outer intersubunit site. It may be helpful to show these densities from a different perspective to appreciate the depth of these binding poses.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1.3: We have added Figure 4 – figure supplement 1 to better show the depth of lipid binding poses, especially the ones in the outer leaflet intrasubunit cleft and at the inner intersubunit site, and cited the figure on p. 7 (Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1.4: The representation of the lipid densities in Fig. 4B is not easy to interpret. First, the meaning of resting versus activating conditions and closed versus open states can be easily missed for readers who are not familiar with the author's previous study. It may be helpful to describe this (i.e. how open and closed state clusters were generated from structures determined in resting and activating conditions) in greater detail in either the figure legend, results or methods. Second, the authors state that there are differences in lipid poses between the closed and open states but not resting and activating conditions. With the exception of the intersubunit density, this is difficult to appreciate from Fig. 4B. As stated in point #3, the difference, for example, in the complementary intrasubunit site may be better appreciated with an image from a different perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1.4: Acknowledged - the distinction between resting and activating conditionsv.s. open and closed states can be confusing. We have tried to clarify these differences at the beginning of the results section, the methods section, and in the caption of Figure 4. Regarding differences in lipid poses between open and closed states, we agree it is difficult to appreciate from Figure 4, but here we refer the reader to Figure 4 – figure supplement 2 for an overlay between open and closed densities. Additionally, we now added Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 which provides lipid densities for all five subunits and overlays with the build cryo-EM lipids, possibly making differences easier to appreciate. Regarding images from different perspectives, we trust the new figure supplement described in Response 1.3 provides a better perspective.</p><p>p. 3 (Results)</p><p>“For computational quantification of lipid interactions and binding sites, we used molecular simulations of GLIC conducted under either resting or activating conditions (Bergh et al., 2021a). As described in Methods, resting conditions corresponded to neutral pH with most acidic residues deprotonated; activating conditions corresponded to acidic pH with several acidic residues protonated. Both open and closed conformations were present in both conditions, albeit with different probabilities.”</p><p>p. 8 (Figure 4)</p><p>“Overlaid densities for each state represent simulations conducted under resting (dark shades) or activating (light shades) conditions, which were largely superimposable within each state.”</p><p>p. 24 (Methods)</p><p>“We analyzed previously published MSMs of GLIC gating under both resting and activating conditions (Bergh et al., 2021a). Resting conditions corresponded to pH 7, at which GLIC is nonconductive in functional experiments, with all acidic residues modeled as deprotonated. Activating conditions corresponded to pH 4.6, at which GLIC is conductive and has been crystallized in an open state (Bocquet et al., 2009). These conditions were modeled by protonating a group of acidic residues (E26, E35, E67, E75, E82, D86, D88, E177, E243; H277 doubly protonated) as previously described (Nury et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1.5: The new closed GLIC structure was obtained by merging multiple datasets.

Fig. 1 caption suggests they may have been manually built? I understand that the idea was to place them in the overlap of simulation densities and structure densities, but can the authors please clarify if there were any quantifiable conditions that were employed during this process or if this was entirely manual placement in a pose that looked good? Regardless, it would be helpful to see an overlay of the built lipids with both the cryo and simulation densities (e.g., overly of Fig. 1F/H and G/H) to better visualize how the final built lipids compare.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2.1: We thank the reviewer for pointing out unclarities regarding our methods. We have extended the methods section to clarify how the lipids were manually built in the cryo-EM structure. We have also added Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 showing overlays of the computational densities and built cryo-EM lipids.</p><p>p. 15 (Methods)</p><p>“Lipids were manually built in COOT by importing a canonical SMILES format of POPC (Kim et al., 2021) and adjusting it individually into the cryo-EM density in each of the sites associated with a single subunit, based in part on visual inspection of lipid densities from simulations, as described above. After building, 5-fold symmetry was applied to generate lipids at the same sites in the remaining four subunits.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.2: Regarding the state-dependent lipid entry to the outer leaflet intersubunit site associated with channel opening, if the authors could include a movie depicting this process that would be great. The current short explanation does not do this justice. Also, what were the dynamics of this process? Beyond the correlation between site occupancy and the pore being open, how did the timing of lipid entry/exit and pore opening/closing correlate?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2.2: The point regarding the timing of state-dependent lipid binding at the subunit interface and pore opening is indeed an interesting one. We have added Figure 4 – figure supplement 3D showing that the state-dependent P250 lipid interaction precedes pore opening, as quantified by pore hydration levels, indicating a potential role in gating. The interaction between lipid binding and conformational change of the protein is also depicted in the newly added Figure 4 - video supplement 1, which we hope will be able to better communicate the conclusions regarding state-dependent interactions. We have also expanded the results and discussion to better explain these results:</p><p>p. 9 (Results)</p><p>“The lipid head made particularly close contacts with residue P250 on the M2-M3 loop, which undergoes substantial conformational change away from the pore upon channel opening, along with outer-leaflet regions of M1–M3 (Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure Supplement 3A,B,C, Figure 4—video 1). These conformational changes were accompanied by a flip of M1 residue F195, which blocked the site in the closed state but rotated inward to allow closer lipid interactions in the open state (Figure 4—figure Supplement 3C, Figure 4—video 1). Indeed, P250 was predominantly located within 3 Å of the nearest lipid atom in open- but not closed-state frames (Figure 4F). Despite being restricted to the open state, interactions with P250 were among the longest duration in all simulations (Figure 2C) and as these binding events preceded pore opening, it is plausible to infer a role for this state-dependent lipid interaction in the gating process (Figure 4 – figure supplement 3D).”</p><p>p. 12 (Discussion)</p><p>“The state-dependent binding event at this site preceded pore opening in MSMs, where lipid binding coincided with crossing a smaller energy barrier between closed and intermediate states, followed by pore opening at the main energy barrier between intermediate and open states (Figure 4 – figure supplement 3D). Further, since the P250- lipid interaction was characterized by relatively long residence times (Figure 2), it is possible this lipid interaction has a role to play in GLIC gating.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.3: Although the interaction times are helpful, I didn't get a great sense of how mobile the lipids are during the simulations. Can the authors discuss this a bit more. For example, are interaction times dominated by lipids that jiggle a bit away from a residue and then back again, vs how often are lipids exchanging with other lipids initially further away from the protein?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2.3: We have now added various measures of lipid diffusion, both for initially interacting lipids and for bulk lipids, which are summarized in the new Figure 2 – figure supplement 1. We have further addressed the question of simulation timescales in Results, Discussion, and Methods. These numbers highlight that it is possible for lipids several nanometers away from the protein surface to exchange with lipids of the first lipid shell.</p><p>p. 3,6 (Results)</p><p>“Lateral lipid diffusion coefficients were estimated to 1.47 nm2/µs for bulk lipids and 0.68 nm2/µs for lipids of the first lipid shell (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A), which is relatively slow compared to the timescales of each trajectory (1.7 µs). However, multiple residues throughout the M1, M3, and M4 helices exchanged contacts with 2-4 different lipid molecules in individual simulations (Figure 2C). Furthermore, 1.7-µs root mean square displacement of lipids originally in the first lipid shell was 2.15 nm, and 3.16 nm in the bulk bilayer, indicating such exchanges are not limited to nearby lipids (Figure 2 – figure supplement 1B). Thus, exchange events and diffusion estimates indicate that the duration of lipid contacts observed in this work can be at least partly attributed to interaction stabilities and not solely to sampling limitations.”</p><p>p. 11 (Discussion)</p><p>“Indeed, the unrestrained atomistic MD simulations studied here were not expected to capture the maximal duration of stable contacts, as indicated by some interaction times approaching the full 1.7-µs trajectory (Figure 2}). Nevertheless, simulations were of sufficient length to sample exchange of up to four lipids, particularly around the M4 helix. Calculation of lipid lateral diffusion coefficients resulted in average displacements at the end of simulations of 2.15 nm for lipids initially interacting with the protein surface, roughly corresponding to lipids diffusing out to the 4th lipid shell. Diffusion of bulk lipids was faster, allowing lipids originally 3.16 nm away from the protein surface to ingress the first lipid shell. This observation underscores the potential for lipid exchange events even among lipids initially distant from the protein surface. Of course, duration of exceptionally stable interactions, such as those involving T274 (Figure 2C), inevitably remain bounded by the length of our simulations. Still, diffusion metrics, supported by robust statistical analysis encompassing diverse starting conditions (500 trajectories), enable confident estimation of relative interaction times.“</p><p>p. 13 (Methods)</p><p>“Time-based measures of protein-lipid interactions, such as mean duration times and exchange of interactions, were calculated for the 100 x 1.7 µs-long simulations using prolintpy (Sejdiu and Tieleman, 2021) with a 4 Å interaction cutoff. Analysis of lateral lipid diffusion in individual simulations was carried out for two disjoint sets of lipids: the first lipid shell defined as lipids with any part within 4 Å of the protein surface (~90 lipids), and bulk lipids consisting of all other lipids (~280 lipids). Mean square displacements of each lipid set were calculated using GROMACS 2021.5 (Abraham et al., 2015b) with contributions from the protein center of mass removed. Diffusion coefficients for each set, DA, were calculated using the Einstein relation (Equation 1) by estimating the slope of the linear curve fit to the data.<disp-formula id="sa3equ1"><mml:math id="sa3m1"><mml:mrow><mml:munder><mml:mo movablelimits="true" form="prefix">lim</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munder><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>⟨</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>⟩</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where ri(t) is the coordinate of the center of mass of lipid i of set A at time t and DA is the self-diffusion coefficient.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2.4: How symmetric or asymmetric are the cryo and simulation densities across subunits and was there subunit asymmetry in the final build lipids?
