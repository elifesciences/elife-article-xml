Cancer patients with severe immune-related adverse events (irAE) after receiving anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 combination immunotherapy also have markedly reduced peripheral B cells. The immunological basis for B cell loss remains unexplained. Here, we probe the decline of B cells in human CTLA-4 knock-in mice by using anti-human CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab conjugated to a drug payload emtansine (Anti-CTLA-4 ADC). The anti-CTLA-4 ADC-treated mice have T cell hyper-proliferation and their differentiation into effector cells which results in B cell depletion. B cell depletion is mediated by both CD4 and CD8 T cells and at least partially rescued by anti-TNF-alpha antibody. These data revealed an unexpected antagonism between T and B cells and the importance of regulatory T cells in preserving B cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CTLA-4</kwd><kwd>Treg-depletion</kwd><kwd>B cell loss</kwd><kwd>ADC</kwd><kwd>Foxp3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI154722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Lishan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>OncoC4, Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Mingyue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A biochemical probe targeting Tregs shows the importance of Tregs for B cell homeostasis and peripheral B cell reduction is caused by an activated T-cell-dependent mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Foxp3 is a master regulator of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and its mutations result in fatal autoimmune disease in mice and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bennett et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brunkow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wildin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wildin et al., 2002</xref>). Among many known functions, Foxp3 is a transcriptional factor for expression of CTLA-4, which is constitutively expressed in Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tivol et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Waterhouse et al., 1995</xref>). <italic>Ctla4</italic> deletion in mice phenocopies that of Foxp3. In humans, CTLA-4 deficiency caused by autosomal heterozygous mutation of the CTLA-4 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuehn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schubert et al., 2014</xref>) or mutations in recycling partner LPS-Responsive beige-like anchor (LRBA) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lo et al., 2015</xref>) are associated with severe autoimmune diseases. Although CTLA-4 can be expressed at lower levels in other cell types and has been suggested as a negative regulator for naÃ¯ve T cell activation, lineage-specific deletion of the <italic>Ctla4</italic> gene in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs results in development of systemic lymphoproliferation, fatal autoimmune disease, and potent tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wing et al., 2008</xref>). These data are consistent with the notion that the predominant function of CTLA-4 is Treg-intrinsic.</p><p>A largely overlooked area is the cross-regulation between B cells and regulatory T cells. CTLA-4 conditional null mice and those with depletion of Tregs showed increase in germinal center B cells and heightened antibody responses with some reports showing a decrease B cell percentage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sage et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Klocke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leonardo et al., 2012</xref>). B cell loss is a common feature in genetic mutations of Foxp3, scurfy mice, Foxp3 knockout mice or Treg depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Riewaldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leonardo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pierini et al., 2017</xref>). Among cancer patients who received immunotherapy, early change of circulating B cells of patients who received combination immunotherapy anti-CTLA-4/PD-1 correlated to irAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Das et al., 2018</xref>). The change in B cells included decline of circulating B cells, and increase in CD21 low B cells and plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Das et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The correlation between B cell loss and immune activation associated with defective Foxp3-CTLA-4 function remains unexplained. Since both CTLA-4 and Foxp3 are largely expressed outside of B cell compartment, and since this pathway is the master regulatory of Treg function, we hypothesized that B cell loss maybe associated with activation of T cells that are autodestructive of B cells. This hypothesis is noteworthy as no autodestructive T cells for B cells have been described. To test this hypothesis, we generated anti-CTLA-4 ADC and showed that the ADC caused selective depletion of Tregs in mice and a marked reduction of B cells. Remarkably, activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells is the underlying cause of B cell depletion. Our data explains the B cell loss associated with Foxp3 and CTLA-4 dysfunction and suggested an unexpected antagonism between T cells and B cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CTLA-4 antibody-drug conjugate depleted regulatory T cells and B cells</title><p>Anti-CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab (Ipi) or human IgGFc (hIgGFc) control were conjugated to a well-known drug payload DM1, emtansine, to furnish the corresponding ADCs: Ipilimumab-DM1 (Ipi-DM1) and hIgGFc-DM1 with corresponding size shifts in the SDS-gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The binding for Ipi-DM1 ADC was evaluated by ELISA binding to immobilized His-hCTLA-4 and by flow cytometry using hCTLA-4 expressing CHO cells (CHO-hCTLA-4). Ipi-DM1 binding was found comparable to the parent antibody Ipi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

Peripheral blood was stained for flow cytometry and gated on CD45 and T-cell subset, including CD8, CD4, CD4 Foxp3<sup>+</sup> and CD4 Foxp3<sup>-</sup> subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). We found that Ipi-DM1 ADC significantly depleted Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs as indicated by the reduction in percentage and cell number of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells when compared to hIgGFc control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, total CTLA-4 levels and Ki67 staining in Tregs were decreased compared to control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). In contrast, Ipi-DM1 ADC did not alter either % of CD4 Foxp3<sup>-</sup> cells among CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes or CTLA-4 levels on the subset, but did slightly decrease the cell number of CD4 Foxp3<sup>-</sup> cells when compared hIgGFc control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Unexpectedly, Ipi-DM1 ADC caused a dramatic decline of B cells as percentages of CD45 and cell number in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). B cells from mice treated with Ipi-DM1 exhibited higher proliferation than those from hIgGFc treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>Since a dramatic loss of B cells and a slight decrease in CD4-nonTregs in Ipi-DM1 treated mice were observed, we sought ensure that this phenomenon was not a result of downstream release of payload drug DM1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>, hIgGFc-DM1 ADC (payload control) did not alter Treg percentage and cell number. A slightly higher level of CTLA-4 was noted in CD4 subset, while Treg proliferation did not change significantly compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B and C</xref>). No other effects on T cell subsets were noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4D and E</xref>). Importantly, B cell number and proliferation were unaffected by hIgGFc-DM1 ADC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4F and G</xref>). Additionally, to ensure B cell depletion was not directly caused by Ipi-DM1 ADC, we stained B220<sup>+</sup> B cells and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs for human CTLA-4 in both human CTLA-4 knock-in (<italic>Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup></italic>) and WT mice to evaluate expression of CTLA-4 in B cells. As expected, CTLA-4 was detected in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs of <italic>Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup></italic> but not B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>We then investigated the impact of anti-CTLA-4 ADC in lymphoid organs. Treg percentage and absolute numbers were not impacted by Ipi-DM1 treatment compared to control in the spleen at day 9. The percent of B cells decreased significantly, although the reduction in absolute number of B cells was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6A and B</xref>). Flow analysis of lymph nodes after Ipi-DM1 treatment resulted in a significant increase in absolute cell numbers of Tregs and B cells and B cell percentage. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1âfigure supplement 6C and D</xref>).</p><p>We then asked how Ipi-DM1 ADC induced Treg impairment impacted B cell lymphopoiesis. Bone marrow cells were stained for flow cytometry and gated on CD45 and T-cell subsets were defined as CD8 (CD8<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>-</sup>), CD4 (CD4<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>-</sup>), Tregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>-</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup>), and CD4-nonTregs (CD4<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>-</sup> Foxp3<sup>-</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Ipi-DM1 depletion of Tregs was confirmed in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Additionally, total CTLA-4 level in bone marrow Tregs decreased, however Ki67 staining did not change significantly compared to control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). In contrast, Ipi-DM1 ADC did not alter bone marrow CD4-nonTreg cell percentage among CD45<sup>+</sup>, absolute cell number, or CTLA-4 level compared hIgGFc control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C and D</xref>). FACS analysis of bone marrow B cells revealed the loss of mature B cells but not immature transitional type1 or Pre-pro/Pro/Pre B cells from Ipi-DM1 treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1MâQ</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1âfigure supplement 7</xref>).

Additionally, CD21/35 expression level in the remaining mature B cells in Ipi-DM1 treated mice was lower than those from hIgGFc-treated control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R</xref>).</p><p>We then investigated B cell apoptosis in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Only mature bone marrow B220<sup>hi</sup> B cells showed increase in apoptosis from Ipi-DM1 treatment, while progenitor/immature bone marrow B220<sup>lo</sup> B cells were similar to control group. Blood and spleen B cell apoptosis were similar to hIgGFC control group, while lymph node B cell apoptosis was lower than the control group. Thus, the loss of B cells in the peripheral blood is likely due to loss of mature B cells in the bone marrow, and that such loss correlates with Treg depletion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CTLA-4 antibody-drug conjugate increases apoptosis in mature B cells in bone marrow.</title><p>Flow analysis of B cell apoptosis on day 9 after treatment with hIgGFc or Ipi-DM1 ADC.

The large decrease of CD45 cells in Ipi-DM1 group is predominantly attributed to the decline of B cells, which plateaus on days 9 and 13 and recovers by day 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) in correlation with the kinetics of Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).

Having shown that the destruction of B cell can be prevented by total depletion of T cell, we sought to rescue the B cells by breaking the CD28-B7 signal with a soluble CTLA-4 that can bind to B7 but not Ipilimumab or Ipi-DM1 ADC.

Our analysis revealed B cell loss in both bone marrow and peripheral blood, specifically mature B cells. Loss of mature peripheral B cells is consistent with clinical data for some patients with CTLA-4 haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuehn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schubert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>B cell loss was previously reported in mice with either naturally occurred (in Scurfy mice) or targeted mutation of Foxp3 and Treg depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Riewaldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leonardo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pierini et al., 2017</xref>). The kinetics of B cell loss and Treg depletion in the Ipi-DM1 treated mice revealed that B cell loss was transient and correlated to Treg impairment (proliferation, CTLA-4 level, cell number). Our data further showed that B cell destruction under Treg impairment conditions is T-cell-mediated and required T cell activation.</p><p>Scurfy mice have poor central and peripheral B lymphopoiesis; however, neonatal WT Treg adoptive transfer in scurfy mice resulted in robust population of mature B cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Riewaldt et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic ablation of TCRÎ± gene by crossing scurfy with TCRAÎ±<sup>-/-</sup> mice efficiently support B cell lymphopoiesis and was sufficient to restore B cells in the bone marrow and peripheral compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Riewaldt et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, reconstitution of bone marrow chimera from scurfy or wild type mixed with that from Î¼MT mice that is deficient in B cells results in normal B cells after 8 weeks from reconstitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). This is in line with our data that Treg impairment results in activated T-cell-mediated apoptosis of mature B cells. Mature B cell loss in bone marrow explains the loss of B cell in the PBL and rules out the possibility that the loss of B cell in the periphery is merely a consequence of defective circulation of B cells normally produced in bone marrow. Others have implied that under Treg depletion, activated T cells are targeting interleukin 7 (IL-7) secreting ICAM1 +perivascular stromal cells needed to progress B cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pierini et al., 2017</xref>). IL-7 is essential for B lymphopoiesis transition from Pro-B cell into Pre-B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">von Freeden-Jeffry et al., 1995</xref>). However, our model system is distinct where only mature B cells are depleted, while B cell progenitor precursors, and specifically Pre-B cells are not impacted. The involvement of T cells is demonstrated by T cell depletion and requirement for T cell activation is demonstrated by requirement for B7-CD28 interaction for B cell loss. Furthermore, we found that anti-TNF-Î± can partially rescue B-cells from loss imposed by Treg impairment. These data showed that TNF-Î± is one of the mediators of B cell loss. Additional studies are needed to reveal other mechanism for B cells loss in Treg-defective environment.</p><p>While in vitro studies by others showed B cell killing by activated CD25<sup>+</sup>CD4 Tregs, but not by CD25<sup>-</sup> CD4 T cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhao et al., 2006</xref> this is not the case in vivo where B cell loss is associated with Foxp3 Treg loss or impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Riewaldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leonardo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Pierini et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, our current study shows that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contributed to B cell loss. The concept that B cells are actively eliminated by T cells in vivo expands our understanding of T-B cell interaction by showing antagonism rather than just âimmunological helpâ from T cells to B cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>C57BL/6 mice that express the CTLA-4 protein with 100% identity to human CTLA-4 protein under the control of endogenous mouse <italic>Ctla4</italic> locus, <italic>Ctla4<sup>h/h</sup></italic>, have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lute et al., 2005</xref>).

The authors show that Ipi-DM1 administration causes a partial decrease (about 50% in absolute number) of mature B cells in blood and bone marrow 9-14 days after the beginning of treatment. B cell progenitors and pre-B cells in the BM are not affected. Ipi-DM1 also results in a partial decrease in Foxp3+ Tregs (about 40% in absolute number) and a slight increase in activation of conventional T cells (Tconvs) in the blood, spleen, BM and LNs at D9 as well as increased plasma immunoglobulins especially IgE. Tconv depletion, CTLA4-Ig or anti-TNF mAb partially prevents the effect of ipi-DM1 on B cells. This effect of Ipi-DM1 on the reduction B cells and Tregs at D9 is not observed in the spleen and lymph nodes (maybe not the good timing to see it), and there is even an increase in the number of Treg and the frequency and number of B cells in lymph nodes. This work is interesting but has the following major limitations:</p><p>1- This work could have been of more interest if the Ipi-DM1 molecule would be used in the clinic. As this is not the case, the intimate mechanism of the effect of this molecule in mice is of reduced interest.</p><p>2- The fact that a partial deletion of Tregs is associated with activation of Tconvs and a decrease in B cells is not new. According to the authors, their work would be the first to show that activation of Tconvs would lead to B cell death. However, this is shown in an indirect way and the mechanisms are not really elucidated. The experiments to try to show a causal link are of 2 types: deletion of T cells (Fig 5) and blocking T cell activation with CTLA4-Ig (Fig 6). These 2 experiments are not fully convincing. The absence of B cell depletion in the blood when T cells are deleted can be explained by other mechanisms, such as B cell recirculation to lymphoid tissues or an effect of massive T cell death for example. The experiment with CTLA4-Ig is more convincing because the effect is targeted to activated T cells only. However, the prevention of B cell ablation is only partial. Since only blood is analyzed, other mechanisms could explain the B cell loss, such as their recirculation in lymphoid tissues.</p><p>3- The authors propose that the drop in B cell numbers in the blood in mice treated with Ipi-DM1 results from reduced mature B cells in the bone marrow. However, B cells are continuously recirculating between the blood and secondary lymphoid tissues. The drop of blood B cells could be well explained by an increased recirculation to lymphoid organs. The increased numbers of B cells in lymph nodes support this latter hypothesis.</p><p>4- The new Figure 2 suggests direct evidence of apoptosis of mature B cells in the BM of treated mice using a PI/annexin V staining assay. This is an important point to support the point of the manuscript. However, using the same assay, the level of B cell apoptosis is of 80% in lymph nodes and 50% in the spleen in control mice (see new Figure 2-figure supplement 1), which is way too high and questions the reliability of this assay. It is likely that B cells enter apoptosis only in vitro due to some artefactual stress.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87281.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Despite the fact that CTLA-4 is a critical molecule for inhibiting the immune response, surprisingly individuals with heterozygous CTLA-4 mutations exhibit immunodeficiency, presenting with antibody deficiency secondary to B cell loss. Why the loss of a molecule that regulates T cell activation should lead to B cell loss has remained unclear. In this study, Muthana and colleagues use an anti-CTLA-4 antibody drug conjugate (aCTLA-4 ADC) to delete cells expressing high levels of CTLA-4, and show that this leads to a reduction in B cells. The aCTLA-4 ADC is found to delete a subset of Tregs, leading to hyperactivation of T cells that is associated with B cell depletion.

CTLA-4 is not normally expressed in B cells so an indirect mechanism of action is assumed. The authors show that the decrease in Treg following aCTLA-4 ADC treatment is associated with activation of T cells, and that B cell loss is blunted if T cells are depleted. A role for both CD4 and CD8 T cells is identified by selective CD4/CD8 depletion. T cells appear to require CD28 costimulation in order to mediate B cell loss, since the response is partially inhibited in the presence of the costimulation blockade drug belatacept (CTLA-4-Ig).

Secondly, although the requirement for T cells to mediate B cell loss is convincingly demonstrated, the incomplete reversal by TNFa blockade suggests additional unidentified factors contribute to this effect. Finally, although the manuscript favours peripheral killing of mature B cells over alterations to B cell lymphopoiesis, one concern is that this may simply reflect the model employed: the short-term (6 day) treatment used here may be too acute to alter B cell development, but this may nevertheless be a feature of prolonged immune dysregulation in humans.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87281.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The co-suppressive molecule CTLA-4 has a critical role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, primarily by Treg mediated control of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. As stated by the authors, previous studies have found a variety of effects of anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment or genetic loss of CTLA-4 on B-cells. These include increased B-cell activation and antibody production, autoantibody production, impairment of B-cell production in the bone marrow and loss of peripheral B-cells. In this article Muthana et al use a CTLA-4 humanized mouse model and examine the effects of drug conjugated CTLA-4 on the immune system. They observe a transient loss of B-cells in the blood of the treated mice. They then use a range of immune interventions such as T-cell depletion and blocking antibodies to demonstrate that this effect is dependent on T-cell activation.</p><p>Since anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy is in active clinical use exploration of its effects are welcome, this is helped by the use of a humanized CTLA-4 system which should be considered a strength of the paper. However, currently the central premise of this paper, that B-cells are depleted seems underexplored. Direct evidence of T-cell killing of B-cells is never presented, rather it is inferred from the reduced numbers of B-cells in the blood and increased apoptosis in the bone marrow. It is not made clear if B-cell numbers in the bone marrow are reduced.</p><p>Upon examining lymphoid organs it seems that the spleen is relatively unchanged while the lymph nodes have a large increase in B-cells alongside increased serum antibody levels. The paper does underline the importance of looking at the differences of multiple immune compartments and interesting phenomenon are described in each compartment. Simultaneous inhibition of B-cell lymphopoiesis and blood trafficking with strong activation and antibody production of lymphoid resident (presumably germinal center) B-cells appears to be occurring. However the current overall interpretation that B-cells are broadly depleted is perhaps too simplistic and largely ignores the lymphoid organs and serum antibodies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87281.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Muthana</surname><given-names>Musleh M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Xuexiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jinan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Mingyue</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>OncoC4, Inc</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rockville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ai</surname><given-names>Chunxia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Jinan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Lishan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Pan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>OncoC4, Inc</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rockville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>OncoC4, Inc</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rockville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Muthana et al. describes the effect of injection of an antibody specific for human CTLA4 conjugated to a cytotoxic molecule (Ipi-DM1) in knock-in mice expressing human CTLA4.

However, this is shown in an indirect way and the mechanisms are not really elucidated.

The experiments to try to show a causal link are of 2 types: deletion of T cells (Fig 4) and blocking T cell activation with CTLA4-Ig (Fig 5) (neutralization of TNF addresses another question). Neither of these 2 experiments is totally convincing. Indeed, the absence of B cell depletion when T cells are deleted can be explained by other mechanisms than the preservation of B cell destruction by activated T cells. The phenomenon could be explained by B cell recirculation to lymphoid tissues or an effect of massive T cell death for example. The experiment shown in Fig. 5 with Belatacept is more convincing because this time the effect is targeted to activated T cells only. However, the prevention of B cell ablation is only partial. Again, since only blood is analyzed, other mechanisms could explain the B cell loss, such as their recirculation in lymphoid tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>While the concept of treg depletion leads to activation of Tconv cells and reduced B cells has been previously published, B cell loss was explained on basis of defective B cell lymphopoiesis due to low production of stroma cell-derived IL-7 or destruction of stromal cells by effector T cells. Our new data established that loss of B cells in the context of Treg depletion was not due to defects in the number of pre-/pro-B cells. Rather it is the death of mature B cells in the bone marrow.</p><p>To address the reviewerâs concern that the B cell loss was merely caused by a change in circulating pattern, we performed a new study on the effect of the ADC on B cells in bone marrow. Our new data reveal loss of mature bone marrow B cells, and that such loss is associated with increased apoptosis of mature B cells. Therefore, the loss of B cells in the peripheral blood is not due to a changed circulation.Furthermore, our data show that B cell progenitor, Pre-B, cells are not changed. Therefore, B cell lymphopoiesis is not the reason for B cell loss in our model system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is disappointing that only the blood (and sometimes the bone marrow) was studied in this work. The interest of doing experiments in mice is to have access to many tissues such as the spleen, lymph nodes, colon, lung, and liver. To conclude that there is B cell deletion without showing lymphoid organs (where the majority of B cells reside) is insufficient. As discussed above, the drop in B cells in the blood could be due to their recirculation in lymphoid organs. In addition, there is no measurement of functional B cells activity. Do mice treated with Ipi-DM1 have a decreased ability to develop an antibody response following immunization?</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed lymph nodes and spleen at the same time points. Unfortunately, Treg depletion was no longer observed at these time points. As expected, we did not see a clear depletion of B cells (Figure 1-figure supplement 6).

Following aCTLA-4 ADC treatment, it is surprising how subtle the deletion of Treg is (from ~8% to ~7%, Fig 1G), compared to the marked deletion of CTLA-4-expressing CHO cells. Is this a feature of in vivo versus in vitro treatment? If Treg are treated in vitro is deletion more efficient? How does the expression level of CTLA-4 in the CHO cells compare with the Treg in these assays?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comments. The anti-CTLA-4 ADC targets CTLA-4 on cell surface. On average about 5% of Tregs express surface CTLA-4 at given moment while human CTLA-4 expressing CHO cell line stains &gt; 90%. Nevertheless, Treg cell number in peripheral blood is reduced by &gt;40%. Additionally, we have included bone marrow data, which shows a greater percentage of Treg depletion (Figure 1J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The decrease in CTLA-4 seen after ipi-DM1 is complicated by the fact that the control DM1 conjugate (IgG1-DM1) appears to significantly increase CTLA-4 expression (Fig 1 supplement 2). It would be useful to clarify when hIgGFc is used versus hIgGFc-DM1 given the additional complexity introduced here (comparisons lacking a payload differ in more than one variable, while the hIgGFc-DM1 is clearly not inert).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comments. We agree that the hIgGFc-DM1 control slightly increased CTLA-4 level; nevertheless, it did not alter B cells, T cells or their proliferation capacity when compared to hIgGFc. Our point here is that B cell depletion is not mediated by DM1 payload off target release (new-version Figure 1-Figure supplement 4, old version Figure 1-figure supplement 2). As for the clarification comment when hIgGFc is used versus hIgGFcDM1 is used, the information is clarified in the figure legend.

IFNÎ³ was reported to induce apoptosis and cell arrest in Pre- B cells, however these studies are invitro studies Garvey et.al Immunology. 1994 Mar; 81(3): 381â388; Grawunder et.al Eur. J. Immunol. 23, 544â551. Since we did not observe any effect on Pre-B cells, we have not followed the literature to investigate the role of IFNy in B cell loss in our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The co-suppressive molecule CTLA-4 has a critical role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance, primarily by Treg mediated control of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. As stated by the authors, previous studies have found a variety of effects of anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment or genetic loss of CTLA-4 on B-cells. These include increased B-cell activation and antibody production, autoantibody production, impairment of B-cell production in the bone marrow and loss of peripheral B-cells. In this article Muthana et al use a CTLA-4 humanized mouse model and examine the effects of drug conjugated CTLA-4 on the immune system. They observe a transient loss of B-cells in the blood of the treated mice. They then use a range of immune interventions such as T-cell depletion and blocking antibodies to demonstrate that this effect is dependent on T-cell activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Since anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy is in active clinical use exploration of its effects are welcome, this is helped by the use of a humanized CTLA-4 system which should be considered a strength of the paper. However, currently, the central premise of this paper, that B-cells are depleted, seems underexplored. Direct evidence of T-cell killing of B-cells is never presented, rather it is inferred from the reduced numbers of B-cells in the blood. The status of B-cells in sites that contain a large proportion of B-cells such as the spleen and lymph nodes is not examined. Additionally, no examination of B-cell antibody production is performed.</p><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comments. To address the reviewerâs concerns we performed additional experiments to evaluate the impact on B cells in other organs, as detailed in our responses to specific questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Examination of B-cell apoptosis/cell death and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity is needed. The authors repeatedly refer to auto destructive T-cells without ever demonstrating their presence or any direct evidence that B-cells are dying. This is particularly important in the context of the blood since an alternative hypothesis would be a change in B cell trafficking and infiltration into tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comments. To address the reviewerâs concern that B cell loss in blood might be caused by a change in B cell trafficking pattern. We performed new study on the effect of the ADC on B cells in bone marrow. Our new data reveal loss of mature bone marrow B cells, and that such loss is associated with increased apoptosis of mature B cells (Figure 2). Therefore, the loss of B cells in the peripheral blood is not due to B cell trafficking and infiltration into tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors demonstrate that B-cells are mostly reduced in blood at around days 10 to 15, I believe it is critical to determine if this is also reflected in the lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comments. We have analyzed lymph node and spleen at the same time points. Unfortunately, Treg depletion was no longer observed at these time points. As expected, we did not see a clear depletion of B cells (Figure 1-figure supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Related to the above point do the authors see evidence of Splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comment. Evidence of splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy is presented in Figure 3-figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Minimal examination of the status of the B-cells or antibody production is performed. Previous reports would suggest that plasma cell induction and antibody responses may be expected. Do serum antibody levels change in this system?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewerâs comment. Increases of plasma immunoglobulins especially IgE are now shown in Figure 3-figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Its unclear how the authors interpret their experiment with anti-TNFa (figure 6). Are they suggesting that TNFa itself depletes B-cells or that it is part of the inflammatory milieu that contributes to wider T-cell activation and, in turn, B-cell depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>We have discussed these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
