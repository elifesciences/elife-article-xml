These interactions have been proposed to be functionally relevant across mechanosensory organs and vertebrate species. Here, we show that both CIB2 and CIB3 can form heteromeric complexes with TMC1 and TMC2 and are integral for MET function in mouse cochlea and vestibular end organs as well as in zebrafish inner ear and lateral line. Our AlphaFold 2 models suggest that vertebrate CIB proteins can simultaneously interact with at least two cytoplasmic domains of TMC1 and TMC2 as validated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of TMC1 fragments interacting with CIB2 and CIB3. Molecular dynamics simulations of TMC1/2 complexes with CIB2/3 predict that TMCs are structurally stabilized by CIB proteins to form cation channels. Overall, our work demonstrates that intact CIB2/3 and TMC1/2 complexes are integral to hair-cell MET function in vertebrate mechanosensory epithelia.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate senses of hearing and balance depend on the process of MET in inner-ear hair cells. This process is initiated when mechanical forces from sound waves and head movements deflect specialized mechanosensory projections at the apical surface of hair cells, known as stereocilia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fettiplace, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frolenkov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gillespie and Müller, 2009</xref>). Deflections of stereocilia result in tensioning of the extracellular tip links that convey mechanical force to the MET channels. Mature tip links are heterotetrameric filaments composed of cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kazmierczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Siemens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Söllner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sotomayor et al., 2012</xref>). In mammalian auditory hair cells, MET channels are localized at the PCDH15 end of the tip link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beurg et al., 2009</xref>). Significant progress in our understanding of MET has been recently made by identifying the transmembrane channel-like proteins 1 and 2 (TMC1 and TMC2) as the pore-forming subunits of the MET channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawashima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). In hair cells, two other transmembrane proteins, LHFPL5 and TMIE, are essential for sustained hearing. LHFPL5 binds to PCDH15 and may regulate force transmission to TMC1 and TMC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qiu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). TMIE also interacts with TMC1/2 and regulates unitary conductance and ion selectivity of the MET channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cunningham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Naz et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, MET currents can still be recorded from hair cells lacking LHFPL5 or TMIE, suggesting that neither are essential for channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fettiplace et al., 2022</xref>), yet all are needed for sustained hair-cell transduction and normal hearing. In zebrafish, Tmcs, Lhfpl5, Tmie, and Pcdh15 are also essential for sensory transduction, suggesting that these molecules form the core MET complex in all vertebrate hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erickson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ernest et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gleason et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gopal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maeda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pacentine and Nicolson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phillips et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seiler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Söllner et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2), and the closely related CIB3, interact with TMC1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>).

CIB2 belongs to a family of four closely related proteins (CIB1-4) that have partial functional redundancy and similar structural domains, with at least two Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hand motifs that are highly conserved for CIB2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2012</xref>).

However, additional evidence showing that CIB2/3 can function and interact with TMC1/2 proteins across sensory organs, hair-cell types, and species is still needed. Here, we provide further evidence that CIB2 and CIB3 are indeed evolutionary conserved and functionally redundant components of the vertebrate transduction apparatus necessary for MET channel activity in mouse vestibular hair cells, as well as in zebrafish mechanosensory epithelia. Moreover, based on our structural analyses and simulations, we propose that CIB2 and CIB3 are required for the stabilization and channel function of the MET proteins TMC1 and TMC2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CIB2 and CIB3 are expressed in mouse vestibular hair cells</title><p>We and others previously demonstrated that CIB2 is essential for MET in auditory hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Michel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2017</xref>).

To assess the implications of the <italic>Cib2<sup>KO/KO</sup>;Cib3<sup>KO/KO</sup></italic> mice on vestibular function, we next performed a series of tests, including: the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), performance in a rotating rod, and head movement analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–H</xref>). The VOR is mediated by a direct three-neuron pathway linking the vestibular nerve to the extraocular muscles and produces compensatory eye movements in the direction opposite of the head movement to provide a stable gaze (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cullen, 2019</xref>).

Unlike mammals, the zebrafish’s inner ear does not have a cochlea. Instead, zebrafish rely on their saccule for hearing and utricle for balance. Zebrafish also utilize hair cells in a specialized sensory system, the lateral line, to detect local water movement. The hair cells within both the zebrafish inner ear and lateral line share many morphological similarities to mammalian vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nicolson, 2017</xref>).

We first examined auditory function by testing the acoustic startle reflex in <italic>cib2</italic> and <italic>cib3</italic> mutants. For our experiments, we used a Zantiks behavioral system to quantify the probability of generating a startle in response to a vibrational tap stimulus. This response is thought to rely primarily on hair cells in the zebrafish saccule and lateral-line system. We found that, compared to controls, the probability of a startle response was significantly reduced in <italic>cib2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, control: 0.71 ± 0.04; <italic>cib2</italic>: 0.28 ± 0.06, p=0.005).

We found that, compared to controls, the average FM 1–43 label was reduced in <italic>cib2</italic> but not <italic>cib3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In <italic>cib2</italic> mutants we did observe residual hair cells that were labeled with FM 1–43. We hypothesized that in lateral-line hair cells, similar to its role in zebrafish auditory function, Cib3 may be able to substitute for Cib2 in MET. To assess whether Cib3 can substitute for Cib2, we examined FM 1–43 labeling in <italic>cib2;cib3</italic> mutants. In <italic>cib2;cib3</italic> mutant animals we observed a complete absence of FM 1–43 labeling in lateral-line hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D and G</xref>). Thus, taken together the results of our FM 1–43 labeling analysis are consistent with a requirement for both Cib2 and Cib3 to ensure normal MET in all lateral-line hair cells.</p><p>To obtain a more quantitative assessment of MET we used Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to perform evoked measurements of hair cell function. For this assessment, we used a transgenic line that expresses a membrane-localized GCaMP6s (memGCaMP6s) specifically in hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I’</xref>). This transgenic line has previously been used to measure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into apical hair bundles while stimulating lateral-line hair cells with a fluid-jet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). Using this approach, we were able to stimulate and monitor stimulus-evoked mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in hair bundles within neuromast organs of each genotype (Representative responses: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–L</xref>). We quantified the number of hair bundles per neuromast with mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, and found that compared to controls, significantly fewer cells were mechanosensitive in <italic>cib2</italic> and <italic>cib2;cib3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, control: 92.2 ± 2.5; <italic>cib2</italic>: 49.9 ± 5.8, <italic>cib2;cib3:</italic> 19.0 ± 6.6, p&lt;0.0001).

To examine MET function, we injected FM 4–64 into the zebrafish ear in a transgenic background that labels the hair cell membrane (memGCaMP6s). FM 4–64 is a redshifted version of FM 1–43 and provides a similar readout of MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2020</xref>).

Notably, the predicted interaction between TMC1-NT and CIB2 is consistent with previous biochemical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>), while the overall model resolves seemingly contradictory results indicating that either the NT or IL1 of TMC1 was responsible for interactions with CIB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). Additional AF2 models of TMC1 with CIB3 and of TMC2 with CIB2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) predicted the same architecture for the TMC1/2 + CIB2/3 complexes where CIB proteins are clamped between the IL1 and NT domains of TMCs.

In parallel, we produced an unlabeled soluble TMC1-NT fragment (6.9 kDa) and used these CIB and TMC1 samples to test protein-protein interactions by monitoring their effects on 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-correlation spectra of the labeled CIB2 and CIB3 proteins. All protein fragments were purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>), revealing a single monodisperse peak for [U-<sup>15</sup>N]-<italic>hs</italic> CIB2 (69.2 mL elution volume in S75 16/600 column) and a slightly displaced peak for [U-<sup>15</sup>N]-<italic>hs</italic> CIB2 + <italic>hs</italic> TMC1-IL1 (68.5 mL). In contrast, SEC experiments revealed two peaks for [U-<sup>15</sup>N]<italic>-hs</italic> CIB3 alone (potential dimer at 62.8 mL and potential monomer at 73.1 mL) and a single peak for [U-<sup>15</sup>N]<italic>-hs</italic> CIB3 + <italic>hs</italic> TMC1-IL1 (71.3 mL). <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-correlation spectra of [U-<sup>15</sup>N]<italic>-hs</italic> CIB2 alone were consistent with prior data indicating that many, but not all potential peaks are resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Spectra for the [U-<sup>15</sup>N]-<italic>hs</italic> CIB2 + <italic>hs</italic> TMC1-IL1 complex exhibit widespread perturbations, consistent with extensive remodeling of the CIB2 structure. Moreover, the addition of <italic>hs</italic> TMC1-NT induced additional chemical shift perturbations in many, but not all peaks, demonstrating that the TMC1-IL1 and TMC1-NT ligands bind simultaneously to [U-<sup>15</sup>N]-<italic>hs</italic> CIB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6B</xref>).

The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of LHFPL5 has been shown to interact with this TMC1 amphipathic helix, which might be essential for channel function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Qiu et al., 2023</xref>). The BSA for the dimeric TMC1 + CIB2 complex in these longer simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2E</xref>) decreased as contacts between TMC1-α0 and CIB2 were lost for one of the monomers in the mixed bilayer system. In the monomer in which contacts were maintained, a single cholesterol was situated in the middle of the putative pore. Similarly, TMC1-α0 and CIB2 contacts were lost for both monomers in the POPC bilayer systems. Regardless, in all Anton 2 equilibrium trajectories contacts between CIB2 and the TMC1-IL1 and -NT remained, thus confirming the stability of the complex over a microsecond timescale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>TMC1 and TMC2 complexes with CIB2 and CIB3 are predicted to be cation channels</title><p>To further explore the properties of our models of TMC + CIB complexes we took equilibrated TMC1 systems and applied a –0.5 V transmembrane voltage while monitoring ion permeation through the putative pore during 100-ns long trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata2">Figure 8—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>). In systems with pure POPC bilayers, we observed permeation of K<sup>+</sup> in either one or both pores of the TMC1 dimer, with or without CIB2 or CIB3 and with or without bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>, despite the presence of Cl<sup>-</sup> (150 mM KCl). Similar results were obtained for four TMC1 systems simulated at –0.25 V. Variability of the conductance state was attributed to partial blockage by lipids and poor sampling, but in all cases in which a clear conductive state was monitored, we observed the almost exclusive passage of K<sup>+</sup> with conductance values that reached up to ~138 pS for a single pore. While simulations tend to overestimate bulk KCl conductivity and in some cases, predictions need to be scaled down (by a factor of ~0.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walujkar et al., 2021</xref>), the conductance values monitored here are consistent with previous simulations and with the expected conductance of the inner-ear transduction channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walujkar et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, we observed smaller conductance values for TMC1 systems with mixed lipid bilayers (at most ~22 pS for a single pore), regardless of the presence of CIB2 or CIB3, with or without bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Additional Anton 2 simulations for one of these TMC1 + CIB2 + Ca<sup>2+</sup> systems with a mixed membrane, equilibrated for 240 ns and then subjected to –0.43 V for 480 ns, revealed a low conductance value of ~6.2 pS. The reduced conductance values observed for mixed-membrane systems were attributed in part to pore blockage by cholesterol and lipids in the initial setup. Interestingly, Anton 2 simulations of TMC1, TMC1 + CIB2, and TMC1 + CIB2 + Ca<sup>2+</sup> in pure POPC membranes subjected to –0.5 V, –0.25 V, and –0.125 V for 480 ns, 480 ns, and 960 ns, respectively, revealed a trend in which TMC1 exhibits higher conductance with CIB2 bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata2">Figure 8—source data 2</xref>). This may begin to explain why CIB2 is essential for normal TMC1 function.</p><p>Simulations of TMC2 with an applied transmembrane voltage of –0.5 V revealed a more closed state when compared to our TMC1 model, regardless of membrane composition and presence or absence of CIB2, CIB3, and bound Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). Conduction of K<sup>+</sup> was observed in most cases, but the maximum conductance did not reach above ~64 pS, suggesting that the conformation simulated is less open than the ones explored in simulations of TMC1. We also speculate that this is due to TMC2 having an intrinsic lower single-channel conductance than TMC1, as has been suggested by some experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2013</xref>), but not others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pan et al., 2013</xref>). It is also possible that our TMC2 model is not in a fully open conformation, which can only be reached upon mechanical stimulation. Regardless, our simulations unequivocally indicate that TMC1 and TMC2 are cation channels and that these proteins can form stable complexes with CIB2 and CIB3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous work on CIB proteins had primarily focused on mammalian auditory hair cells, leaving open the question of whether they play a functional role in vestibular function and across vertebrate species. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2023</xref> have suggested that CIB2 and CIB3 are important for stereocilia maintenance and MET in mouse vestibular hair cells. This work demonstrated that similar to <italic>Tmc1</italic> and <italic>Tmc2</italic>, <italic>Cib2</italic> is highly expressed in the striolar region while <italic>Cib3</italic> is expressed in the extrastriolar regions, and mice lacking both <italic>Cib2</italic> and <italic>Cib3</italic> had no MET and deficits in vestibular hair cell bundle structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Taking a step forward, here we establish that CIB2 and CIB3 are highly conserved regulators of MET in both mouse vestibular hair cells and zebrafish hair cells. We demonstrate that vestibular hair cells in mice and zebrafish lacking CIB2 and CIB3 are not degenerated but have no detectable MET, assessed via FM 1–43 dye uptake, at time points when MET function is well developed in wild-type hair cells. Similar structural-function phenotype has been reported in auditory hair cells in <italic>Tmc1/Tmc2</italic> double mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawashima et al., 2015</xref>). Besides the known in vitro interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>), our study provides strong genetic evidence for the direct functional relationship between CIB and TMC proteins in regulating MET both in auditory and vestibular hair cells.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the loss of CIB2 leads to profound hearing loss from birth in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seco et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that the endogenous levels of CIB3 present in auditory hair cells are not sufficient to compensate for CIB2 in hearing. Prior work has also shown that over-expression of CIB3 in mouse auditory outer hair cells can only partially compensate for the loss of CIB2 in MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether overexpression of CIB3 can rescue impaired hearing thresholds in <italic>Cib2</italic> mutant mice is not known. While CIB2 is also present in vestibular hair cells, compared to auditory hair cells, the expression of CIB3 is several folds higher in vestibular end organs. Indeed, our current data demonstrate that, unlike auditory hair cells, endogenous levels of CIB3 can fully compensate for the loss of CIB2 in vestibular hair cells in mice. Together our work on the vestibular system in mice highlights that both CIB2 and CIB3 can play overlapping roles in MET function.</p><p>Interestingly, our corresponding work in zebrafish indicates that Cib3 can also compensate for Cib2, but only in specific subsets of hair cells. Recent genetic, morphology, and scRNAseq data have revealed that within the zebrafish inner ear, each sensory epithelia (utricle, saccule, cristae) has distinct groups of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). In the crista of the zebrafish inner ear, which responds to angular acceleration, there are two main groups of hair cells that can be delineated by distinct morphological and genetic features. Morphologically these two groups are defined as either short or tall hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and E</xref>). Genetic studies have revealed that these two types of hair cells rely on different Tmc combinations for MET–short cells rely on Tmc2a while tall cells rely on Tmc2b and Tmc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). More recent mRNA in situ studies have validated this <italic>Tmc</italic> requirement and shown that <italic>tmc2a, tmc2b, tmc1</italic> are expressed in just tall cells, while <italic>tmc2a</italic> is only expressed in short cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, this work also demonstrated that <italic>cib2</italic> is expressed broadly in tall and short hair cells, while <italic>cib3</italic> showed more restricted expression in tall hair cells. Our work on MET in the zebrafish cristae indicates that Cib2 is required in both short and tall cells, while Cib3 is required in just tall cells. This expression data set is supported by the absence of FM 4–64 labeling from short hair cells when Cib2 is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). In contrast, the loss of Cib3 alone does not impact FM 4–64 labeling in the zebrafish crista, indicating that Cib2 can compensate for the loss of Cib3 in both short and tall cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Currently, it is not clear what role different types of hair cells play in zebrafish inner ear epithelia. Our present findings show that zebrafish <italic>cib2</italic> mutants have a severely diminished acoustic startle response, a behavior mediated primarily by the saccule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These behavioral results suggest that Cib2 plays an important role in hair cells that detect acoustic stimuli.</p><p>In addition to the inner ear, we likewise found that both Cib2 and Cib3 play an important role in the zebrafish lateral line. Similar to the zebrafish inner ear and mouse vestibular system, we show that in lateral-line hair cells, Cib2 can compensate for MET in all hair cells when Cib3 is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C,F,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). However, like in the zebrafish inner ear, when Cib2 is lost, MET is lost from a specific population of lateral-line hair cells. In the lateral line, each neuromast has two cell populations that detect flow in opposing directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">López-Schier and Hudspeth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pujol-Martí and López-Schier, 2013</xref>). Work in the posterior lateral line has demonstrated that cells that detect anterior flow rely on Tmc2a/2b for MET, while cells that detect posterior flow rely on just Tmc2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). In our work, we find that cells that detect anterior flow primarily rely on Cib2 for MET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). Furthermore, this work indicates that Cib3 cannot compensate for the loss of Cib2 in these cells. Interestingly, our functional assessment in the zebrafish lateral line and crista suggests that Cib2 is specifically required for mechanosensitive function in populations of hair cells that express Tmc2a. Whether Cib3 is unable to pair with Tmc2a or is simply not expressed along with Tmc2a remains an unanswered question. The significance of this pairing is also unclear. Recent work has shown that the addition of Tmc2a to lateral-line cells that detect anterior flow significantly augments the mechanosensitive responses of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kindig et al., 2023</xref>). Whether Cib2 is required along with Tmc2a for these augmented responses remains unclear.</p><p>Our in vivo studies of mouse TMC + CIB and zebrafish Tmc + Cib complexes suggest a conserved functional relationship between these two protein families across vertebrates. Structural predictions using AF2 show conserved folds for human and zebrafish proteins, as well as conserved architecture for their protein complexes. Predictions are consistent with previous experimentally validated models for the TMC1 pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballesteros et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pan et al., 2018</xref>), with the structure of human CIB3 coupled to mouse TMC1-IL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>), and with our NMR data validating the interaction between human TMC1 and CIB2/3 proteins. Remarkably, the AF2 models are also consistent with the architecture of the nematode TMC-1 and CALM-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>), despite low sequence identity (36% between human TMC1 and worm TMC-1 and 51% between human CIB2 and worm CALM-1). This suggests that the TMC + CIB functional relationship extends beyond vertebrates.</p><p>Taken together, the modeling predictions, NMR experiments, and simulations presented here provide a structural framework to interpret and understand seemingly contradictory results. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>), we showed that the N-termini of TMC1 and TMC2 interact with CIB2, and subsequent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>) presented biochemical data validating the interaction between the TMC1-NT with CIB2. However, X-ray crystallography data demonstrated that the main interaction between TMC1 and CIB3 involved IL1, leaving the role played by CIB2 + TMC-NT interactions unaddressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show using NMR that both TMC1-NT and TMC1-IL1 bind to CIB2 and CIB3 non-competitively. These interactions are consistent with AF2 models for TMC + CIB complexes where CIB proteins are clamped between TMC1-NT and TMC1-IL1. Simulations of these models indicate that there is some potential preferential binding of TMC1 and TMC2 to CIB3 over CIB2 (predicted from BSA) and that TMC + CIB interactions are stable and last for microseconds, with biochemical and NMR experiments showing that these interactions are stable at even longer timescales.</p><p>Interestingly, the behavior of CIB2 and CIB3 in solution (SEC experiments using 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) is different in the absence of TMC1-IL1. While CIB2 appears as a single peak, CIB3 shows two clear peaks indicating the presence of monomeric and dimeric states, consistent with the crystal structure of an apparent CIB3 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). In the presence of TMC1-IL1, the CIB3 dimeric peak is absent, and the potentially monomeric peak is slightly shifted accounting for the added TMC1-IL1, as observed for CIB2. This result suggests that CIB2, both in the presence and in the absence of TMC1-IL1, is monomeric in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). This proposal is consistent with prior conclusions that CIB2 is a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dal Cortivo et al., 2019</xref>), but is in disagreement with other reports indicating that CIB2 is a dimer in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vallone et al., 2018</xref>) and our own prior pull-down assays indicating that CIB2 co-immunoprecipitated with differentially tagged CIB2 or CIB3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Riazuddin et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, our NMR data (obtained using 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) indicates that CIB2 + TMC1-IL1 is unlikely to directly interact with CIB3. The simplest explanation for these seemingly contradictory results comes from the TMC1 and TMC2 dimeric states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pan et al., 2018</xref>) and our modeling indicating that each TMC monomer interacts with one CIB protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Pull-down assays might simply be reflecting the oligomeric state of TMC proteins. In such a scenario, and considering that TMC proteins have been suggested to form hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pan et al., 2018</xref>), there are up to ten different combinations of TMC1/2 and CIB2/3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>) that might have distinct properties. Such variety of complexes with potentially different conductance values might explain tonotopic changes of conductance along the cochlea, although other explanations exist, including a variable number of TMC proteins around the tip link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beurg et al., 2018</xref>) and the direct influence of membrane composition on conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Effertz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walujkar et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>How TMC + CIB interactions depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration may have important functional implications for adaptation and hair cell mechanotransduction. Structures of CIB3 and worm CALM-1, a CIB2 homologue, both bind divalent ions via EF-hand motifs proximal to their C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). Reports on CIB2 affinities for Ca<sup>2+</sup> are inconsistent, with <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values that range from 14 µM to 0.5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blazejczyk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vallone et al., 2018</xref>). Although qualitative pull-down assays done in the presence or the absence of 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> suggest that the TMC1 and CIB2 interactions are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2021</xref>), strength and details of the CIB + TMC-IL1 and CIB + TMC-NT contacts might be Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, especially considering that Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces changes that lead to exposure of hydrophobic residues involved in binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blazejczyk et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our simulations in the presence of a biasing potential unequivocally demonstrate that both TMC1 and TMC2, in the presence or the absence of CIB proteins, with or without bound Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and in two types of membranes, are cation channels with predicted single-channel conductance values that can reach values that are consistent with those of the transduction channel. Our models emphasize again the role played by the membrane in lining the pore of TMC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walujkar et al., 2021</xref>), and also indicate that CIB proteins are ideally positioned to connect various parts of cytosolic inter-helix linkers with the helices that form the pore, especially α3 and α4, recently implicated in gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Walujkar et al., 2021</xref>). Last, our modeling also positions the myristoylated N-terminus of CIB2 and CIB3 close enough to the membrane bilayer, which might be yet another way to sense membrane stretch and influence gating. Further studies should help provide a comprehensive view into CIB function in channel assembly, activation, and potentially hair-cell adaption.</p><p>Overall, the biochemically supported atomic-resolution structural models and simulations presented here along with our results obtained using animal models strongly suggest that TMC1/2 proteins must function with CIB2/3 in normal hair-cell MET across sensory organs, hair-cell types, and species. This is supported by structural data indicating multiple contact points between TMC and CIB proteins, simulation data predicting that CIB proteins stabilize TMC cytosolic domains and may enhance cation conduction, and in vitro and in vivo functional data indicating that both TMC1/2 and CIB2/3 proteins are needed for hair-cell MET.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

After washing, larvae were mounted in 1% low melt agarose containing an anesthetic, 0.02% tricaine methanesulfonate (Syndel, ANADA 200–226). FM 1–43 labeled hair cells were then imaged on an A1 Nikon upright laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 60×1.0 NA water objective. FIJI was used to process image Z-stacks. To estimate the number of hair cells per neuromast, laser scanning DIC images were used to count the number of hair bundles per neuromast. To quantify FM 1–43 label, a 5 µm circular region of interest (ROI) was placed on the soma of each hair cell with a hair bundle in the DIC image. These ROIs were used to quantify the mean FM 1–43 intensity per hair cell.

Approximately 2–3 nL of 10 µM FM 4–64 in 0.1 M KCl were injected into the otic capsule as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). FM 4–64 labeled hair cells of the medial crista were then imaged on an A1 Nikon upright laser-scanning confocal microscope with a 25×1.10 NA or 60×1.0 NA water objective. FIJI was used to process image Z-stacks. To assess tall versus short hair cells in each crista <italic>memGCaMP6s</italic> label was used.</p><p>To correlate hair bundle orientation in lateral line hair cells with intact mechanotransduction, larvae were immersed in 3 µM FM 1–43 FX (Thermo Fisher, F25255) in E3 for 30 s, and then washed three times in E3. After washing, larvae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After fixation, larvae were washed 4×5 min in 0.1% Tween in PBS (PBST). Larvae were then placed in blocking solution (2% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% fish skin gelatin in PBS +0.3% triton) for 2 hr at room temperature. After block Alexa Fluor 633 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher, A22284) was added at 1:100 in PBST. Larvae were incubated for 4 hr at room temperature and then washed 4×5 min in PBST. Larvae were mounted on glass slides with Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using No. 1.5 coverslips. To image hair bundle orientation and FM 1–43 FX label in lateral-line hair cells, a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope with Airyscan was used. Hair cells were imaged using a 63×1.3 NA oil objective and processed with an Airyscan processing factor of 7.0. For analysis, Z-stacks were max-projected in FIJI. Images were background subtracted using a rolling ball correction. Hair cells with a FM 1–43 FX intensity more than twice the background intensity were scored as FM 1–43 FX positive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Zebrafish Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and behavior</title><p>For imaging of mechanosensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neuromast hair bundles<italic>, Tg(myo6b:memGCaMP6s</italic>) animals were mounted on their side on Sylgard chamber in E3 embryo media containing 0.2% MESAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). Larvae were then pinned and a solution containing α-bungarotoxin (125 µM, Tocris) was injected into the heart cavity for paralysis during imaging. After paralysis, larvae were immersed in extracellular imaging solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, OSM 310+/-10). To image Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the hair bundles we used a Bruker Swept-Field confocal system equipped with a Rolera EM-C2 CCD camera (QImaging, Surrey, Canada) and a Nikon CFI Fluor 60×1.0 NA water immersion objective as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2018a</xref>). The system includes a band-pass 488/561 nm filter set (59904-ET, Chroma) and is controlled using Prairie View software (Bruker Corporation). A piezoelectric motor (PICMA P-882.11–888.11 series, PI Instruments) attached to the objective and used to acquire 5-plane Z-stacks every 0.5 µm using a 35 µm slit at a 50 Hz frame rate for a 10 Hz volume rate. A fluid-jet composed of a glass capillary attached to a pressure clamp system (HSPC-2-SB, ALA) was used to deliver a 500 ms anterior and posterior step stimulation to deflect hair bundles along their axis of sensitivity.</p><p>To quantify GCaMP6s fluorescent intensity changes during stimulation, we registered the Z-stacks and then average projected the Z-stacks into a single plane. We then loaded the projected images into FIJI and used the Time Series Analyzer V3 plugin to create circular ROIs with a ~1.7 μm diameter. ROIs were placed on the center of each individual bundle. We then measured and plotted change in the mean intensity (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) within the region during the recording period. The mean intensity within each ROI was computed for each hair bundle. A hair bundle with a signal magnitude (peak value of intensity change upon stimulation) above 10% ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> was considered mechanosensitive. To create the AVG hair bundle GCaMP6s (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>) per neuromast plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>, only traces from mechanosensitive cells were averaged.</p><p>A Zantiks MWP behavioral system was used to examine startle responses. The Zantiks system tracked and monitored behavioral responses via a built-in infrared camera at 30 frames per second. A 12-well plate was used to house larvae during behavioral analysis. Each well was filled with E3 and 1 larva. All fish were acclimated in the plate within the Zantiks chamber in dark for 15 min before each test. To induce startle, an integrated stepper motor was used to drive a vibration-induced startle response. A vibrational stimulus that triggered a maximal % of animals startling in controls without any tracking artifacts (due to the vibration) was used for our analyses. Each larva was presented with the vibrational stimulus 5 times with 100 s between trials. During the tracking and stimulation, a Cisco router connected to the Zantiks system was used to relay <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> coordinates of each larva every frame.

All experiments were performed on at least four animals and eight neuromasts and four cristae. Behavior analysis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was repeated at least twice on two independent days. For in vivo work (calcium imaging and FM 1–43 labeling) fish were chosen at random and experimenter was blinded when possible. All replicates represented in graphs are biological and no samples were excluded. A power analysis was used to ensure that a sufficient sample size was used for our in vivo work. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. A D’Agostino and Pearson test was used to test data for normality. A one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons was used to compare differences between siblings and controls regarding the % of mechanosensitive hair cells, number of hair cells, % of FM 1–43 positive hair cells, average FM 1–43 label. For proportion of animals startling and comparisons for FM 1–43 FX label, a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Expression and purification of bacterially expressed <italic>hs</italic> CIB2, CIB3, TMC1-IL1, and TMC1-NT</title><p>DNA sequences encoding for <italic>hs</italic> CIB2, CIB3, TMC1-IL1, and TMC1-NT were subcloned into <italic>NdeI</italic> and <italic>XhoI</italic> sites of the pET21a vector.

The authors try to combine the three parts with the overarching theme of demonstrating that CIB2/3 play a functionally conserved role across species and hair cell types.

The results largely coincide with what is seen in the mouse-they are both important, with stimulus-dependent Ca2+ entry reduced more in cib2 KOs than in cib3 KOs, and the cib2;cib3 showing the greatest impact.

following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This reviewed preprint is a bit of Frankenstein monster, as it crams together three quite different sets of data. It is essentially three papers combined into one-one paper focused on the role of CIB2/CIB3 in VHCs, one on the role of CIB2/CIB3 in zebrafish, and one on structural modeling of a CIB2/3 and TMC1/2 complex. The authors try to combine the three parts with the overarching theme of demonstrating that CIB2/3 play a functionally conserved role across species and hair cell types, but given the previous work on these proteins, especially Liang et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2023), this argument doesn't work very well. My sense is that the way the manuscript is written now, the sum is less than the individual parts, and the authors should consider whether the work is better split into three separate papers.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the frank evaluation of our work and point out that combining structural with functional data from mouse and zebrafish offers a comprehensive view of the role played by TMC1/TMC2 and CIB2/3 complexes in hair-cell mechanotransduction. We believe that readers will benefit from this comprehensive analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most important shortcoming is the novelty of the work presented here. In line 89 of the introduction the authors state &quot;However, whether CIB2/3 can function and interact with TMC1/2 proteins across sensory organs, hair-cell types, and species is still unclear.&quot; They make a similar statement in the first sentence of the discussion and generally use this claim throughout the paper as motivation for why they performed the experiments. Given the data presented in the Liang et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2023 papers), however, this statement is not well supported. Those papers clearly demonstrate a role for CIB2/CIB3 in auditory and vestibular cells in mice. Moreover, there is also data in Riazuddin et al. (2012) paper that demonstrates the importance of CIB2 in zebrafish and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. I think the authors are really stretching to describe the data in the manuscript as novel. Conceptually, it reads more as solidifying knowledge that was already sketched out in the field in past studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that work on mouse and fish CIB knockouts in our laboratories started over a decade ago and that our discoveries are contemporary to those recently presented by Liang et al., 2021 and Wang et al., 2023, which we acknowledge, cite, and give credit as appropriate. We also note that work on fish knockouts and on fish <italic>Cib3</italic> is completely novel. Nevertheless, the abstract text “Whether these interactions are functionally relevant across mechanosensory organs and vertebrate species is unclear” has been replaced by “These interactions have been proposed to be functionally relevant across mechanosensory organs and vertebrate species.”; and the introduction text “However, whether CIB2/3 can function and interact with TMC1/2 proteins across sensory organs, hair-cell types, and species is still unclear” has been replaced by “However, additional evidence showing that CIB2/3 can function and interact with TMC1/2 proteins across sensory organs, hair-cell types, and species is still needed.”. The work by Wang et al., 2023 is immediately discussed after the first sentence in the discussion section and the work by Liang et al., 2021 is also cited in the same paragraph. We believe that changes in abstract and introduction along with other changes outlined below put our work in proper context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is one exception, however, and that is the last part of the manuscript. Here structural studies (AlphaFold 2 modeling, NMR structure determination, and molecular dynamics simulations) bring us closer to the structure of the mammalian TMCs, alone and in complex with the CIB proteins. Moreover, the structural work supports the assignment of the TMC pore to alpha helices 4-7.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the positive evaluation of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The paper 'Complexes of vertebrate TMC1/2 and CIB2/3 proteins 1 form hair-cell mechanotransduction cation channels' by Giese and coworkers is quite an intense reading.

The modeling data reveal how CIB2/3 may affect the conductance of the TMC1/2 channels that mediate mechanotransduction, which is the process of converting mechanical energy into an electrical signal in sensory receptors. This work will likely impact future studies of how mechanotransduction varies in different hair cell types.</p><p>One caveat is that the experiments with the mouse mutants are confirmatory in nature with regard to a previous study by Wang et al., and the authors use lower resolution tools in terms of function and morphological changes. Another is that the modeling data is not supported by electrophysiological experiments, however, as mentioned above, future experiments may address this weakness.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for providing positive feedback and for highlighting caveats that can and will be addressed by future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Lines 100-101. Please temper this statement, as FM1-43 is only a partial proxy for MET.</p></disp-quote><p>The original text has been modified to: “In contrast to auditory hair cells, we found that the vestibular hair cells in <italic>Cib2KO/KO</italic> mice apparently have MET. We assessed MET via uptake of FM 1-43 (Figure 1A), a styryl dye that mostly permeates into hair cells through functional MET channels (Meyers et al., 2003), indicating that there may be another CIB protein playing a functionally redundant role.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 111-113. These data do not fully match up with the Kawashima et al. (2011) data. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to better report the data: “<italic>Tmc2</italic> expression increases during development but remains below <italic>Tmc1</italic> levels in both type 1 and type 2 hair cells upon maturation (Figure 1C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 125-126. The comparison in 2A-B is not described correctly for the control. The strain displayed is Cib2^+/+;Cib3^KO/KO (not wild-type). Show the Cib2^+/+;Cib3^+/+ if you are going to refer to it (and is this truly Cib2^+/+;Cib3^+/+ from a cross or just the background strain?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. To avoid confusion, we have revised the sentence as follow: “We first characterized hearing function in <italic>Cib3KO/KO</italic> and control littermate mice at P16 by measuring auditory-evoked brainstem responses (ABRs). Normal ABR waveforms and thresholds were observed in <italic>Cib3KO/KO</italic> indicating normal hearing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 137-140. Did you expect anything different? This is a trivial result, given the profound loss of hearing in the Cib2^KO/KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not expect anything different and have deleted the sentence: “Furthermore, endogenous CIB3 is unable to compensate for CIB2 loss in the auditory hair cells, perhaps due to extremely low expression level of CIB3 in these cells and the lack of compensatory overexpression of CIB3 in the cochlea of <italic>Cib2KO/KO</italic> mice (Giese et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 194-196. But what about Cib2^KO/KO; Isn't the conclusion that the vestibular system needs either CIB2 or CIB3?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, either CIB2 or CIB3 can maintain normal vestibular function. A prior study by Michel et al., 2017, has evaluated and reported intact vestibular function in <italic>Cib2KO/KO</italic> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 212-214. Yes. This is a stronger conclusion than the one earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the sentence as follow: “Taken together, these results support compulsory but functionally redundant roles for CIB2 and CIB3 in the vestibular hair cell MET complex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 265-267. I'm not sure that I would state this conclusion here given that you then argue against it in the next paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this statement to make the conclusions clearer and more consistent between the two paragraphs. The modified text reads: “Thus, taken together the results of our FM 1-43 labeling analysis are consistent with a requirement for both Cib2 and Cib3 to ensure normal MET in all lateral-line hair cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 277. I would be more precise and say something like &quot;and sufficiently fewer hair cells responded to mechanical stimuli and admitted Ca2+...&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text as requested: “We quantified the number of hair bundles per neuromast with mechanosensitive Ca2+ responses, and found that compared to controls, significantly fewer cells were mechanosensitive in <italic>cib2</italic> and <italic>cib2</italic>;<italic>cib3</italic> mutants (Figure 5-figure supplement 2A, control: 92.2 ± 2.5; <italic>cib2</italic>: 49.9 ± 5.8, <italic>cib2;cib3:</italic> 19.0 ± 6.6, p &gt; 0.0001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 278 and elsewhere. It doesn't make sense to have three significant digits in the error. I would say either &quot;92.2 {plus minus} 2.5&quot; or &quot;92 {plus minus} 2.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Edited as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 357-358. Move the reference to the figure to the previous sentence, leaving the &quot;(Liang et al., 2021) juxtaposed to its reference (crystal structure). Otherwise, the reader will look for crystal structures in Figure 7-figure supplements 1-5.</p></disp-quote><p>Text has been edited as requested: “The intracellular domain linking helices a2 and a3, denoted here as IL1, adopts a helix-loop-helix with the two helices running parallel to each other and differing in length (Figure 7-figure supplements 1-5). This is the same fold observed in its crystal structure in complex with CIB3 (Liang et al., 2021), which validated the modeling approach.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 450. What other ions were present besides K+? I assume Cl- or some other anion.</p><p>What about Na+ or Ca+? It's hard to evaluate this sentence without that information.</p></disp-quote><p>Systems have 150 mM KCl and CIB-bound Ca2+ when indicated (no Na+ or free Ca2+). This is now pointed out when the models are described first: “These models were embedded in either pure POPC or stereocilia-like mixed composition bilayers and solvated (150 mM KCl) to …”. The sentence mentioned by the reviewer has also been modified: “In systems with pure POPC bilayers we observed permeation of K+ in either one or both pores of the TMC1 dimer, with or without CIB2 or CIB3 and with or without bound Ca2+, despite the presence of Cl- (150 mM KCl).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 470-472. These results suggest that the maximum conductance of TMC1 &gt; TMC2. How do these results compare with the Holt and Fettiplace data?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. A comparison would be appropriate and has been added: “We also speculate that this is due to TMC2 having an intrinsic lower singlechannel conductance than TMC1, as has been suggested by some experiments (Kim et al., 2013), but not others (Pan et al., 2013). It is also possible that our TMC2 model is not in a fully open conformation, which can only be reached upon mechanical stimulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 563. Yes, the simulations only allow you to say that the interaction is stable for at least microseconds. However, the gel filtration experiments suggest that the interaction is stable for much longer. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We agree with this statement and modified the text accordingly: “Simulations of these models indicate that there is some potential preferential binding of TMC1 and TMC2 to CIB3 over CIB2 (predicted from BSA) and that TMC + CIB interactions are stable and last for microseconds, with biochemical and NMR experiments showing that these interactions are stable at even longer timescales.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3. Please use consistent (and sufficiently large to be readable) font size.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure has been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. Magnification is too low to say much about bundle structure.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right – we cannot evaluate bundle structure with the images shown in Figure 4. Our goal was to determine if the vestibular hair cells had been degenerated in the absence of CIB2/3 and Figure 4 panel A data reveals intact hair cells. We changed the text “High-resolution confocal imaging did not reveal any obvious vestibular hair cell loss and hair bundles looked indistinguishable from control in <italic>Cib2KO/KO;Cib3KO/KO</italic> mice (Figure 4A).” to “High-resolution confocal imaging did not reveal any obvious vestibular hair cell loss in <italic>Cib2KO/KO;Cib3KO/KO</italic> mice (Figure 4A).” to avoid any confusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Some datasets presented here can be published separately. Although I understand that the field is developing fast and there is no time to sort and fit the data by category or scale, everything needs to be published together and quickly.</p><p>I have no real questions about the data on the functional association of CIB2 and 3 with TMC 1 and 2 in mouse hair cells as well as association preferences between their homologs in zebrafish. The authors have shown a clear differentiation of association preferences for CIB2 and CIB3 and the ability to substitute for each other in cochlear and vestibular hair cells. The importance of CIB2 for hearing and CIB3 for vestibular function is well documented. The absence of the startle response in cib2/3 negative zebrafish is a slight variation from what was observed in mice where CIB2 is sufficient for hearing. The data look very solid and show an overall structural and functional conservation of these complexes throughout vertebrates. The presented models look plausible, but of course, there is a chance that they will be corrected/improved in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for appreciating the significance of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding NMR, there is indeed a large number of TROSY peaks of uniformly labeled CIB2 undergoing shifts with sequential additions of the loop and the N-terminal TMC peptides. Something is going on. The authors may consider a special publication on this topic when at least partial peak assignments are established.</p></disp-quote><p>We are continuing our NMR studies of CIB and TMC interactions and plan to have follow up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After reading the manuscript, I may suggest four topics for additional discussion.</p><p>(1) Maybe it is obvious for people working in the field, but for the general reader, the simulations performed with and without Ca2+ come out of the blue, with no explanation. The authors did not mention clearly that CIB proteins have at least two functional EF-hand (EF-hand-like) motifs that likely bind Ca2+ and thereby modulate the MET channel.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have modified the introductory text to include: “CIB2 belongs to a family of four closely related proteins (CIB1-4) that have partial functional redundancy and similar structural domains, with at least two Ca2+/Mg2+-binding EF-hand motifs that are highly conserved for CIB2/3 (Huang et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the data on affinities for Ca2+, as well as Ca2+-dependent propensity for dimerization and association with TMC exist, they should be mentioned for CIB2 and CIB3 and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we have added the following text to the discussion: “How TMC + CIB interactions depend on Ca2+ concentration may have important functional implications for adaptation and hair cell mechanotransduction. Structures of CIB3 and worm CALM-1, a CIB2 homologue, both bind divalent ions via EF-hand motifs proximal to their C-termini (Jeong et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2021). Reports on CIB2 affinities for Ca2+ are inconsistent, with _K_D values that range from 14 µM to 0.5 mM (Blazejczyk et al., 2009; Vallone et al., 2018). Although qualitative pull-down assays done in the presence or the absence of 5 mM CaCl2 suggest that the TMC1 and CIB2 interactions are Ca2+independent (Liang et al., 2021), strength and details of the CIB-TMC-IL1 and CIB-TMCNT contacts might be Ca2+-dependent, especially considering that Ca2+ induces changes that lead to exposure of hydrophobic residues involved in binding (Blazejczyk et al., 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not clearly mentioned in the figure legends whether the size-exclusion experiments or TROSY NMR were performed in the presence of (saturating) Ca2+ or not.

We have indicated this in appropriate figure captions as requested, and also mentioned it in the discussion text: “Interestingly, the behavior of CIB2 and CIB3 in solution (SEC experiments using 3 mM CaCl2) is different in the absence of TMC1-IL1.” and “Moreover, our NMR data (obtained using 3 mM CaCl2) indicates that TMC1-IL1 + CIB2 is unlikely to directly interact with CIB3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Speaking about the conservation of TMC-CIB structure and function, it would be important to compare it to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TMC-CALM-1 structures. Is CALM-1, which binds Ca2+ near its C-terminus, homologous or similar to CIBs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. To address it, we have added the following text in the discussion: “Remarkably, the AF2 models are also consistent with the architecture of the nematode TMC-1 and CALM-1 complex (Jeong et al., 2022), despite low sequence identity (36% between human TMC1 and worm TMC-1 and 51% between human CIB2 and worm CALM-1). This suggests that the TMC + CIB functional relationship may extend beyond vertebrates.” We also added: “How TMC + CIB interactions depend on Ca2+ concentration may have important functional implications for adaptation and hair cell mechanotransduction.

One question is whether the tip link in the double null forms normally and whether there is a vestige of MET current in the beginning.

I understand that not complete knock-outs, but rather partial loss-of-function mutants may help answer this question. The reader would be impatient to learn what process most critically depends on the presence of CIBs: channel assembly, activation, conduction, or adaptation. Any thoughts about it?</p></disp-quote><p>These are all interesting questions, although further investigations would be needed to understand CIB’s role on channel assembly, activation, conduction, and adaption.

What do they know about the permeation path a 600-800 Da hydrophobic dye may travel through? Is it the open (conductive) or non-conductive channel? Do ions and FM dyes permeate simultaneously or can this be a different mode of action for TMCs that relates them to TMEM lipid scramblases?

All background information about what is known about the MET complex in sensory hair cells focuses on work done with mouse cochlear hair cells without regard to other species. This is especially surprising as the third author uses zebrafish as an animal model and makes major contributions to this study, addressing the primary question posed in the introduction. Instead, the authors relegate this important information to the results section. Moreover, not mentioning the Jeong 2022 study when discussing the Liang 2021 findings is odd considering that the primary question is centered on CIB2 and TMC1/2 in other species.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We now discuss and reference relevant background on the MET complex in zebrafish hair cells in the introduction. We added: “In zebrafish, Tmcs, Lhfpl5, Tmie, and Pcdh15 are also essential for sensory transduction, suggesting that these molecules form the core MET complex in all vertebrate hair cells (Chen et al., 2020; Erickson et al., 2019, 2017; Ernest et al., 2000; Gleason et al., 2009; Gopal et al., 2015; Maeda et al., 2017, 2014; Pacentine and Nicolson, 2019; Phillips et al., 2011; Seiler et al., 2004; Söllner et al., 2004).”. We also added: “In zebrafish, knockdown of <italic>Cib2</italic> diminishes both the acoustic startle response and mechanosensitive responses of lateral-line hair cells (Riazuddin et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>The claim that mouse vestibular hair cells in the double KO are structurally normal is not well supported by the images in Fig. 4A and is at odds with the findings by Wang et al., 2023. More discussion about the discrepancy of these results (instead of glossing over it) is warranted. The zebrafish image of the hair bundles in the zebrafish cib2/3 double knockout also appear abnormal, i.e. somewhat thinner. These results are consistent with Wang et al., 2023. Is it the case that neither images (mouse and fish) are representative? Unfortunately, the neuromast hair bundles in the double mutant are not shown, so it is difficult to draw a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right – we cannot evaluate mouse hair-cell bundle structure with the images shown in Figure 4. Our goal was to determine if the vestibular hair cells had been degenerated in the absence of CIB2/3 and Figure 4 panel A data reveals intact hair cells. We changed the text “High-resolution confocal imaging did not reveal any obvious vestibular hair cell loss and hair bundles looked indistinguishable from control in <italic>Cib2KO/KO;Cib3KO/KO</italic> mice (Figure 4A).” to “High-resolution confocal imaging did not reveal any obvious vestibular hair cell loss in <italic>Cib2KO/KO;Cib3KO/KO</italic> mice (Figure 4A).” to avoid any confusions. In addition, we have changed the discussion as follows: “We demonstrate that vestibular hair cells in mice and zebrafish lacking CIB2 and CIB3 are not degenerated but have no detectable MET, assessed via FM 1-43 dye uptake, at time points when MET function is well developed in wild-type hair cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, the authors mention that Shi et al showed differential expression with cib2/3 in tall versus short hair cells of zebrafish cristae. However, there is no in situ data in the Shi study for cib2 and cib3. Instead, Shi et al show in situs for zpld1a and cabp5b that mark these cell types in the lateral crista. The text is slightly misleading and should be changed to reflect that UMAP data support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed reference to cib2/3 zebrafish differential expression from our discussion. It is true that this differential expression has only been inferred by UMAP and not in situ data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should be noted that the acoustic startle reflex is mediated by the saccule in zebrafish, which does not possess layers of short and tall hair cells, but rather only has one layer of hair cells. Whether saccular hair cells can be regarded as strictly 'short' hair cell types remains to be determined. In this paragraph of the discussion, the authors are confounding their interpretation by not being careful about which endorgan they are discussing (line 521). In fact, there is a general error in the manuscript in referring to vestibular organs without specifying what is shown. The cristae in zebrafish do not participate in behavioral reflexes until 25 dpf and they are not known to synapse onto the Mauthner cell, which mediates startle reflexes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these issues. We now state in the results that the startle reflex in zebrafish relies primarily on the saccule. In the discussion we now focus mainly on short and tall hair cells of the crista. We also outline again in the discussion that the saccule is required for acoustic startle and the crista are for angular acceleration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Lines 298-302: The Zhu reference is not correct (wrong Zhu author).

Otherwise, the basis for the roles of the Tmcs in the cartoon in panel 6E is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out this oversight.

Predictions are consistent with previous experimentally validated models for the TMC1 pore (Ballesteros et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2018), with the structure of human CIB3 coupled to mouse TMC1-IL1 (Liang et al., 2021), and with our NMR data validating the interaction between human TMC1 and CIB2/3 proteins. Remarkably, the AF2 models are also consistent with the architecture of the nematode TMC-1 and CALM-1 complex (Jeong et al., 2022), despite low sequence identity (36% between human TMC1 and worm TMC-1 and 51% between human CIB2 and worm CALM-1).
