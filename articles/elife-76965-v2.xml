Along with changes in transcription, one conserved means of gene regulation during conditions that quickly repress translation is the formation of cytoplasmic phase-separated mRNP granules such as P-bodies and stress granules. Previously, we identified that distinct steps in gene expression can be coupled during glucose starvation as promoter sequences in the nucleus are able to direct the subcellular localization and translatability of mRNAs in the cytosol. Here, we report that Rvb1 and Rvb2, conserved ATPase proteins implicated as protein assembly chaperones and chromatin remodelers, were enriched at the promoters and mRNAs of genes involved in alternative glucose metabolism pathways that we previously found to be transcriptionally upregulated but translationally downregulated during glucose starvation in yeast. Engineered Rvb1/Rvb2-binding on mRNAs was sufficient to sequester mRNAs into mRNP granules and repress their translation. Additionally, this Rvb tethering to the mRNA drove further transcriptional upregulation of the target genes. Further, we found that depletion of Rvb2 caused decreased alternative glucose metabolism gene mRNA induction, but upregulation of protein synthesis during glucose starvation. Overall, our results point to Rvb1/Rvb2 coupling transcription, mRNA granular localization, and translatability of mRNAs during glucose starvation. This Rvb-mediated rapid gene regulation could potentially serve as an efficient recovery plan for cells after stress removal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stress granules</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>cotranscriptional loading</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zid</surname><given-names>Brian M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moresco</surname><given-names>James J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new mechanism of Rvb1/Rvb2 proteins was found that couples transcription, mRNA granular localization and translation of select genes during glucose starvation stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression encompasses many steps across discrete cellular boundaries, including transcription, mRNA processing and export, translation, and decay. Cells do not always live in stable and optimal conditions, instead they are faced with various types of stresses, such as nutrient starvation, heat shock, toxins, pathogens, and osmotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majmundar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richter et al., 2010</xref>). In dynamic environmental conditions, cells must balance disparate responses in gene expression as they quickly transition between homeostatic states. This can present challenges such as when cells repress overall translation while needing to upregulate the protein expression of stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>). To date, it is generally thought that mRNA cytoplasmic activities are predominantly dictated by <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence elements within the RNA; however, coupling steps in gene expression presents an attractive strategy to overcome the challenges by creating regulons of mRNAs that are similarly controlled at the transcriptional level and can be coordinately tuned at the post-transcriptional level as well.</p><p>In recent years. âimprintingâ by co-transcriptional loading has been implicated as an alternative mechanism to <italic>cis</italic>-acting RNA sequence elements in determining cytoplasmic mRNA fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haimovich et al., 2013</xref>). For instance, it was found that promoters determined mRNA decay rates through the co-transcriptional loading of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bregman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trcek et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, Vera et al. showed that the translation elongation factor eEF1A coupled the transcription and translation of <italic>HSP70</italic> mRNAs through co-transcriptional loading during heat shock in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vera et al., 2014</xref>). Zander et al. showed that transcription factor Hsf1 might function in loading the nuclear mRNA export protein Mex67 on stress-related mRNAs during heat shock in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zander et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>During stressful conditions, one proposed means of post-transcriptional control is the phase separation of select mRNA transcripts and post-transcriptional regulatory proteins into phase-dense, concentrated, and membrane-less cytoplasmic structures generally described as phase-separated granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Glauninger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guzikowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>). Two well-known stress-induced phase-separated messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) granules are processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Youn et al., 2019</xref>). During stress, the direct connection between the formation of these granules coincident with an overall translational reduction suggests that the localization of mRNAs to these cytoplasmic granules might sequester the mRNAs away from the translational machineries, thus repressing the translation of the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivanov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kedersha and Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sahoo et al., 2018</xref>). Yet how mRNAs are partitioned to or excluded from stress-induced granules remains unclear.</p><p>Previously we found that during glucose starvation in yeast, promoter sequences play an important role in determining the cytoplasmic fate of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>). mRNAs transcribed by active promoters in unstressed cells (class III, e.g., <italic>PGK1</italic>, <italic>PAB1</italic>) were directed to P-bodies and are poorly translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzikowski et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, stress-induced mRNAs showed two distinct responses: mRNAs of most heat shock genes (class I, e.g., <italic>HSP30, HSP26</italic>) are transcriptionally induced, actively translated, and remain diffuse in the cytoplasm; however, class II mRNAs are transcriptionally induced but become sequestered in both P-bodies and stress granules and are associated with inactive translation. Class II mRNAs are enriched for alternative glucose metabolic function such as glycogen metabolism (e.g., <italic>GSY1</italic>, <italic>GLC3</italic>, <italic>GPH1</italic>). Surprisingly, instead of the mRNA sequence itself, the promoter sequence that sits in the nucleus directs the translation and cytoplasmic localization of the corresponding induced mRNAs. Specifically, Hsf1-target sequences were shown to direct mRNAs to be excluded from mRNP granules and well translated. However, the mechanism by which the promoter can couple steps of gene expression during glucose starvation is unclear. As the promoter exclusively resides in the nucleus, we hypothesize factors exist that interact with promoters and are co-transcriptionally loaded onto mRNA prior to nuclear export.</p><p>In this study, we developed a novel proteomics-based screening method that enabled us to identify Rvb1/Rvb2 as interacting proteins with the promoters of the class II alternative glucose metabolism genes (e.g., <italic>GLC3</italic>) that are upregulated in transcription but downregulated in translation and have granular-localized mRNA transcripts. Rvb1/Rvb2 (known as RuvbL1/RuvbL2 in mammals) are two highly conserved AAA+ (ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities) proteins that are found in multiple nucleoprotein complexes. Structural studies have shown that in yeast they form an alternating heterohexameric ring or two stacked heterohexameric rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeganathan et al., 2015</xref>). They were reported as the chaperones of multiprotein complexes involved in chromatin remodeling processes and other nuclear pathways including snoRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eickhoff and Costa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeganathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jha and Dutta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nano and Houry, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seraphim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). These two proteins are generally thought to act on DNA but have been found localized to cytoplasmic granules under stress and to be core components of mammalian and yeast cytoplasmic stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kakihara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rizzolo et al., 2017</xref>). Rvb1/Rvb2 have also been shown to regulate the dynamics and size of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narayanan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zaarur et al., 2015</xref>). The dual presence of Rvb1/Rvb2 at chromatin and stress granules hints to their potential in coupling activities in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, a human homolog of Rvb2 was found to be an RNA-binding protein that promotes the degradation of translating HIV-1 <italic>Gag</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mu et al., 2015</xref>). Relatedly, in this study we found that Rvb1/Rvb2 have roles in coupling transcription, cytoplasmic mRNA localization, and translation of specific glucose starvation-induced genes in yeast, providing insight into how gene expression can be coordinated during fluctuating environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rvb1/Rvb2 co-purify with plasmids containing an alternative glucose metabolism gene promoter</title><p>To identify proteins involved in the ability of promoter sequences to direct the cytoplasmic fate of mRNAs during stress, we developed Co-Transcriptional ImmunoPrecipitation (CoTrIP), a novel biochemical screening technique to identify co-transcriptionally loaded protein factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Here, we modified a yeast plasmid containing LacO-binding sites that were previously used as an efficient purification system to isolate histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Unnikrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unnikrishnan et al., 2012</xref>). To this plasmid, we added a uniform cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) open-reading frame (ORF) and different promoters of interest. We then used FLAG-tagged LacI, which binds to the LacO sequences, and UV-crosslinking to purify the plasmid along with the nascent mRNAs, and co-transcriptionally loaded proteins. Thereafter, mass spectrometry was performed to identify proteins enriched in a promoter-specific manner. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) validates that the CoTrIP method yields enrichment of the target nascent mRNAs, indicating that proteins enriched could be co-transcriptionally loaded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we performed CoTrIP of three plasmids (two heat shock genesâ promoters, <italic>HSP30</italic> and <italic>HSP26</italic>, and an alternative glucose metabolism geneâs promoter, <italic>GLC3</italic>) in cells subject to 10 min of glucose deprivation.

Rvb1/Rvb2âs interactions with DNA in the nucleus and presence in the cytoplasm suggest the potential of Rvb1/Rvb2 to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rvb1/Rvb2 are enriched at the promoters of endogenous alternative glucose metabolism genes</title><p>To validate the CoTrIP results as well as more globally explore the location of Rvb1 and Rvb2 on DNA during stress, Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was used to investigate Rvb1/Rvb2âs enrichment across the genome. Rvb1/Rvb2 were fused with a tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tag at the C-terminus and purified by rabbit IgG beads. The TAP-tagged strains grow at a normal rate (~90 min doubling time), which suggests TAP-tagging does not generally disrupt the endogenous protein function of these essential proteins. Here, we performed ChIP-seq on Rvb1, Rvb2, and the negative control Pgk1 in 10 min of glucose starvation (the Western validation of Rvb1 and Rvb2âs IP is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Rvb1/Rvb2 are enriched from the â500 bp to the transcription start site (TSS) along the genome at 10 min of glucose starvation, whereas ChIP-seq of the negative control Pgk1 is not enriched in the promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The overall enrichment of promoters is consistent with findings that Rvbâs can function as chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).

More generally we found that, for genes that show a greater than threefold increase in mRNA levels during glucose starvation, their promoters are significantly more enriched for Rvb2 binding. Previously we had found that Hsf1-binding sequences were sufficient to exclude mRNAs from mRNP granules during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>). Interestingly we found that glucose starvation-induced Hsf1-target promoters have no difference in Rvb1/Rvb2 binding than an average gene, and significantly lower Rvb1/Rvb2 enrichment than stress-induced non-Hsf1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rvb1/Rvb2 are enriched at the promoters of endogenous alternative glucose metabolism genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rvb1/Rvb2 are enriched on promoters and nascent gene bodies.

To test this, we eliminated the effects from the ORF sequences by designing a pair of reporter mRNAs with a uniform <italic>CFP</italic> ORF but driven by either the <italic>GLC3</italic> promoter or <italic>HSP26</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To test this, we engineered interactions between Rvb1 or Rvb2 and the mRNAs transcribed from various promoters of class I heat shock genes (e.g., <italic>HSP30</italic>, <italic>HSP26</italic>). We took advantage of the specific interaction between a phage-origin PP7 loop RNA sequence and the PP7 coat protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim and Peabody, 2002</xref>). Here, in our engineered strains, a reporter construct consists of a promoter of interest, a nanoluciferase (nLuc) reporter ORF for measuring protein synthesis, a PP7 loop to drive the engineered interaction, and an MS2 loop for the mRNA subcellular visualization. Along with the reporter, Rvb1 or Rvb2 are fused with PP7-coat protein to establish binding on the reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As previously shown, Rvb1/Rvb2 do not display strong binding on the promoters and mRNAs of class I heat shock genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>) (e.g., <italic>HSP30</italic>). Therefore, we specifically engineered the interaction between Rvb1 or Rvb2 and two types of mRNAs driven by the class I heat shock promoters (<italic>HSP30/HSP26</italic>). Strikingly, binding of both Rvb1 and Rvb2 alters the cytoplasmic fates of these class I heat shock mRNAs to be similar to the class II alternative glucose metabolism mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Taking <italic>HSP30</italic> promoter-driven reporter mRNA as an example, during glucose starvation the binding of Rvb1 or Rvb2 reduces protein synthesis by ~40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). It is important to consider that final protein abundance is determined by both mRNA levels and translation. Interestingly, we observed an increase in mRNA abundance when Rvb2 is tethered to the reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). When the translational efficiency was normalized by the mRNA abundance, we were surprised to observe Rvb2 tethering reduces translational efficiency by greater than twofold during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This change in gene expression was specific to Rvb2 as tethering a GFP PP7-coat protein control had no significant impact on protein levels, mRNA levels, or translational efficiency. Additionally, Rvb1/Rvb2 binding does not significantly repress the translational efficiency of mRNA in glucose-rich unstressed cells, indicating that Rvb1/Rvb2 has a more significant effect on mRNAs when mRNP granules have visibly formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Engineered Rvb1/Rvb2 tethering to mRNAs directs cytoplasmic granular localization and repressed translation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic view of Rvb-tethering methodology.

Consistent with reduced translation, Rvb1/Rvb2 tethering significantly increases the granular localization of the heat shock mRNA reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Taking <italic>HSP30</italic> promoter-driven reporter mRNA as an example, only 4% of the cells form <italic>HSP30</italic> promoter-driven mRNA-containing granules when the mRNA is not bound by Rvb1 or Rvb2, yet Rvb1 tethering increases the mRNAâs granular localization to 27% of the cells and Rvb2 tethering increases the mRNAâs granular localization to 39% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Furthermore, the binding of Rvb1 and Rvb2 to mRNA increases the formation of granules that are non-colocalized with a P-body marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). This indicates that Rvb2 is sufficient to drive the interacting mRNA to P-body independent starvation-induced granules. To further eliminate any potential artifacts caused by the C-terminal modification on Rvb1/Rvb2, the negative controls were tested where Rvb1 or Rvb2 are fused with PP7 coat protein, but the mRNA does not have the PP7 loop. The negative control strains did not show a decrease in translatability of the reporter mRNAs in glucose starvation. It indicates translation only decreases and the mRNA granular localization level only increases when the full Rvb-mRNA interaction was established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). These results support the ability of Rvb1/Rvb2 to suppress the translation of the binding mRNAs, potentially through sequestering the mRNAs into cytoplasmic granules.</p><p>The coupling of induced transcription and repressed translation of the class II alternative glucose metabolism genes may be an important adaptation for cells to survive from stress conditions. Results showed that after replenishing the glucose to the starved cells, the translation of those genes is quickly induced, with an approximately eightfold increase in ribosome occupancy 5 min after glucose readdition for class II mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We also find that class II mRNAs quickly increase their protein production upon glucose readdition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). This indicates the potential biological role of the starvation-induced granules as a repository for these translationally repressed class II mRNAs during stress that does not preclude these mRNAs from potentially being quickly released and translated once the stress is removed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Engineered Rvb2 binding to mRNAs increases the transcription of corresponding genes</title><p>Interestingly, Rvb2 not only suppress the translation of bound mRNAs, but also increases the abundance of the interacting mRNAs by approximately almost twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). There are two possibilities for this increased mRNA abundance by Rvb2 tethering: increased transcription and/or slower mRNA decay. To address this, we performed time-course measurements on the <italic>HSP30</italic> promoter-driven reporter mRNA abundance in 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min of glucose starvation. Here, we compared the mRNA abundance when mRNA is bound by Rvb2 and when mRNA is not bound by Rvb2 as a control. A mathematical modeling approach was performed to predict the mRNA induction abundance change caused by varied transcriptional efficiency or varied decay rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elkon et al., 2010</xref>). In the model, we assumed that mRNA level is mainly dependent on the transcriptional and decay rates, and these parameters stay constant over the course of induced expression during glucose starvation. From the mathematical modeling, mRNA fold induction differs between varied transcriptional induction versus mRNA decay changes. If transcriptional rates vary, differences in mRNA levels are the same (equal distance shift) at each time point on a log-log scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). While if mRNA decay varies, although little difference is seen in mRNA abundance in early glucose starvation, our simulation predicts increasing differences in mRNA abundance at later time points of glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). By comparing experimental measurements of mRNA induction of the Rvb2-tethered condition to the unbound control condition, the mRNA induction differences are similar at each time point. When Rvb2 binds to the mRNA, the abundance of the mRNA is constantly greater than the unbound mRNA at all time points during glucose starvation, indicating that the greater mRNA abundance is mainly due to greater transcription differences driven by the Rvb2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>To further experimentally validate that the greater mRNA abundance caused by Rvb2 binding is due to increased transcription and not slower decay, we stopped cellular transcription after 15 min of glucose starvation by treatment with the transcription inhibitor drug 1,10-phenanthroline. Then we performed time-course measurements on mRNA abundance and compared the decay of mRNAs with and without Rvb2 binding. Consistently, mRNAs bound by Rvb2 decay at a slightly but not significantly faster rate, not a slower rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Whether or not bound by Rvb2, the reporter mRNA has around a 25 min half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4C</xref>). These results further point to Rvb2 mRNA tethering driving transcriptional upregulation. Since Rvb2 is targeted to the mRNA, it is likely that local recruitment of Rvb2 to the nascently transcribed mRNA increases the local concentration of Rvb2 protein to the vicinity of the regulatory region of the corresponding gene, further showing the connections between the transcriptional and translational processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>RVB2 knockdown drives decreased mRNA induction but enhanced protein production of Rvb1/Rvb2 target genes</title><p>To further test the role of RVB1/RVB2 in regulating gene expression during glucose starvation, we sought to reduce RVB function in cells. RVB1/RVB2 deletions are inviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">JÃ³nsson et al., 2001</xref>) so we aimed to identify gRNA targets that would temporally reduce RVB expression through inducible gRNAs and dCas9-MXi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2016</xref>). We found an RVB2 gRNA that gave an ~20-fold reduction in RVB2 expression 8 hr after treatment with anhydrotetracycline (ATc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). To investigate the necessity of Rvb1/Rvb2 in the translational repression of class II genes during glucose starvation, we C-terminal tagged two class II genes (<italic>GSY1</italic> and <italic>HXK1</italic>) and one class I gene (<italic>HSP30</italic>) and then quantified their protein induction after 30 min glucose starvation. While both class II genes had robust mRNA induction upon glucose starvation in the control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), this was associated with no significant upregulation of protein production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Here, our results demonstrate a novel function of the AAA+ATPases Rvb1/Rvb2 in the cytoplasm, and a novel mechanism of Rvb1/Rvb2 in coupling the transcription, mRNA cytoplasmic localization, and translation of specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We identified Rvb1/Rvb2 as enriched protein factors on the promoters of the class II alternative glucose metabolism genes that are upregulated in transcription but downregulated in translation during glucose starvation. Results showed that Rvb1/Rvb2 have a strong preferred interaction with both promoters and mRNAs of these genes, suggesting that Rvb1/Rvb2 are loaded from enriched promoters to the nascent mRNAs. More interestingly, when we tethered Rvb1/Rvb2 to the mRNAs, the binding of Rvb1/Rvb2 had a strong impact on reducing mRNA translation and increasing the mRNA granular localization. We are uncertain whether Rvb1/Rvb2 tethering represses translation, which directs mRNAs to mRNP granules; or Rvb1/Rvb2 binding directly targets the mRNA to the granule, which represses translation; or some combination of both â as these are very hard to disentangle. Either way, these data, along with our RVB2 depletion data, suggest the potential co-transcriptional loading of Rvb1/Rvb2 directs post-transcriptional mRNA fate in the cytoplasm. Additionally, Rvb1/Rvb2âs interaction with the mRNA can also induce transcription of the corresponding genes, further indicating that Rvb1/Rvb2 couple the transcription and translation of the interacting genes.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A working illustration of Rvb1/Rvb2âs mechanism in coupling the transcription and translation of interacting genes.</title><p>First, Rvb1/Rvb2 are recruited by specific promoters and loaded onto the nascent mRNAs during glucose starvation.

Rvb1/Rvb2 were initially found to be associated with many chromatin remodeling and transcription-related complexes. This has further been expanded on, and several studies have demonstrated a chaperone-like activity in the formation of various complexes including the assembly of chromatin remodeling complexes and RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nano and Houry, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seraphim et al., 2021</xref>). It may be that recruiting Rvb1/Rvb2 to the nascent RNA increases the local concentration, driving further enhancement of transcription-related processes. It is also intriguing to think about Rvb1/Rvb2âs reported role in escorting client proteins to large macromolecular complexes. Like their escorting protein function, it is plausible to hypothesize that they might have additional functions in escorting mRNAs to large macromolecule mRNP granule complexes in stressful conditions.</p><p>The coupling of transcription and translation of specific genes may be an important adaptation for cells to survive during stress conditions. It has been postulated that to save energy during stress mRNAs are temporarily stored in the cytoplasmic granules associated with inactive translation instead of mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guzikowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horvathova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pitchiaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">SchÃ¼tz et al., 2017</xref>). Our results show that, after replenishing glucose to the starved cells, the translation of those genes is quickly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The stress-induced phase-separated granules may serve as temporary repositories for the inactive translating mRNAs of many genes that are regulated by Rvb1/Rvb2 in glucose starvation and involved in alternative glucose metabolism pathways. From the perspective of cell needs, many alternative glucose metabolism genes are involved in glycogen synthesis, which may be superfluous for survival during times of complete glucose starvation, but the cell may want to produce them as quickly as possible upon glucose replenishment to drive quick protein synthesis. The special coupling of increased transcription but repressed translation mediated by Rvb1/Rvb2 may serve as an emergency but prospective mechanism for cells to precisely repress the translation of these alternative glucose metabolism mRNAs during stress but be able to quickly translate these pre-stored mRNAs once the cells are no longer starved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Also, the genes regulated by Rvb1/Rvb2 may be dependent on the type of stresses. We observed this mechanism of gene expression control on alternative glucose metabolism genes during glucose starvation stress. It will be interesting to test whether there is similar regulation on different sets of genes that are related to other types of stresses, such as heat shock and osmotic stress responses.</p><p>To further understand the function of Rvb1/Rvb2 mechanistically, it is crucial to understand how Rvb1/Rvb2 are recruited to these specific promoters. We prefer the hypothesis that the recruitment of Rvb1/Rvb2 is mediated by other DNA-binding proteins as we were unable to identify specific binding motifs of Rvb1/Rvb2 from our ChIP-seq data. As we found that Rvb1/Rvb2 are generally enriched on the promoters of transcriptionally upregulated mRNAs, we favor a model in which the default is for Rvb1/Rvb2 to be recruited to active transcription sites. This fits with previous data that Rvb1/Rvb2 are required to maintain expression of many inducible promoters including galactose-inducible transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">JÃ³nsson et al., 2001</xref>). While Rvb1/Rvb2 are generally recruited to the promoters of induced mRNAs during glucose starvation, we find that Hsf1-regulated promoters circumvent this recruitment through an unknown mechanism as the transcriptionally upregulated Hsf1 targets show reduced recruitment relative to non-Hsf1 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Intriguingly, Hsf1-regulated genomic regions have been found to coalesce during stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). It will be interesting to explore whether Rvb1/Rvb2 may be excluded from these coalesced regions in future studies.</p><p>This study provides new insights into how gene expression is controlled under stressful conditions, including how mRNAs can be targeted to stress-induced mRNP granules. It also identifies Rvb1/Rvb2 as key proteins connecting discrete steps of gene expression across cellular compartments.

The strains were created through genomic integration of a linear PCR product, or a plasmid linearized through restriction digest or the transformation of an episomal vector. The background strain used was W303 (EY0690), one laboratory strain that is closely related to S288C. In yeast cloning for the C-terminal fusion on the endogenous proteins (e.g., Rvb1-mNeongreen, Rvb1-PP7CP, Rvb1-TAP), we used plasmids of Pringle pFA6a and pKT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Longtine et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>), gifts from the E. K. OâShea laboratory and the K. Thorn laboratory. We modified the pFA6a and pKT plasmids by inserting in the peptides of interest into the plasmids. The primers used to amplify the fragments from these plasmids contain two parts from 3â² to 5â²: a uniform homolog sequence to amplify the plasmid and a homolog sequence to direct inserting the fragments to the genomic loci of interest. The fragments were transformed into the yeasts and integrated to the genome by homologous recombination. The integrations were confirmed by genomic DNA PCR (Yeast DNA Extraction Kit from Thermo Fisher). In the cloning of the reporter strains, we used a strain that was derived from W303 and has one-copied genomic insertion of MYOpr-MS2CP-2XGFP and an endogenous fusion Dcp2-mRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>), as the background strain. Further, we transformed the linearized MS2-loop-containing reporter plasmids into the strain by restriction digest and genomic integration. RT-qPCR was performed to verify the one-copied genomic integration. To generate the MS2-loop-containing reporter plasmids (e.g., ZP207 pRS305-HSP30prUTR-nLuc-PEST-12XMS2-tADH1), we started from the plasmid ZP15 pRS305-12XMS2-tAdh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>).

For cells cultured in the functional experiments, cells were streaked out on the yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) agarose plate (BD) from the frozen stocks and grew at 30Â°C for 2 days. Single colony was selected to start the overnight culture for each biological replicate. Cells were grown at 30Â°C in batch culture with shaking at 200 r.p.m. in synthetic complete glucose medium (SCD medium: yeast nitrogen base from RPI, glucose from Sigma-Aldrich, SC from Sunrise Science). When the OD<sub>660</sub> of cells reached 0.4, half of the culture was harvested as the pre-starved sample. The other half of the culture was transferred to the prewarmed synthetic complete medium lacking glucose (SC-G medium) by centrifugation method. Cells are centrifuged at 3000 Ã <italic>g</italic>, washed once by SC medium, and resuspended in the same volume as the pre-starvation medium of SC medium. Glucose starvation was performed at the same 200 r.p.m. shaking speed and 30Â°C. The length of the glucose starvation time varies from 10 min to 30 min depending on the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>CoTrIP and CoTrIP analysis</title><p>The protocol was developed based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Unnikrishnan et al., 2012</xref>. ZP64 PRS406-CMV-lacI-FLAG was integrated into the W303 yeast background by linearization within the <italic>URA3</italic> gene with BstBI digestion and transformation into yeast. The CoTrIP plasmid was constructed by modifying the ZP66 pUC-TALO8 plasmid that contains eight copies of the Lac operator. The EcoRI sites in ZP66 were mutated to NotI using QuikChange II Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Promoter-specific reporters driving CFP were inserted into pUC-TALO8-NotI by digesting with NheI followed by Gibson Assembly. The plasmid backbone was then digested with NotI, gel purified, ligated, and transformed into yeast using standard lithium acetate transformation. Then, 1 L of yeast were grown overnight in SCD medium-Trp to maintain selection on the CoTrIP plasmid, until an OD<sub>660</sub> 0.3â0.4. Cells were filtered, washed with SC-G -Trp media, and resuspended in 1 L of prewarmed media and grown at 30Â°C for 5 min. Cells were then refiltered, resuspended in 4 mL of PBS in a glass Petri dish, and crosslinked using UV from a Stratalinker 1800 (254 nm, 9999 microjoules Ã 100, 5 cm from the UV bulb). Crosslinked cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 mL of Buffer H 150 (25 mM HEPES KOH pH 7.6, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 150 mM KCl, 0.02% NP40) plus protease inhibitor (P8215 MilliporeSigma) and then dripped into liquid N<sub>2</sub> to be cryogenically ball milled using a Retsch PM100. Ground lysate was clarified by spinning at 3500 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4Â°C, isolating the supernatant and spinning at 12K for 5 min at 4Â°C.

To accurately describe the dynamics of induced mRNA transcription, we used an ordinary differential equation as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î²</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î±</mml:mi><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where X is the mRNA concentration, Î± is the degradation constant, and Î² is the transcription rate.</p><p>We assumed that transcription and degradation rates play essential roles in shaping the overall curve of mRNA increase, and these parameters stay constant over the course of induced expression. We then hypothesized that Rvb1/Rvb2 binding to mRNAs could either increase Î² or decrease Î±, leading to greater mRNA abundance than the PP7 control. To observe the effects of varied transcription or degradation rates on the mRNA abundance, we solved the differential equations with different parameters using ODEINT algorithm, and generated time profiles of the mRNA fold in log2 scale. Solution to the differential equation was expressed as the following function of change in X with respect to time:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>Î</mml:mi><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î²</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î±</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î±</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where X<sub>0</sub> is the mRNA level at t = 0, the initial time of mRNA induction. Since the degradation rate was proportional to the mRNA concentration, we expected the curves to have a steady increase, followed by a gradual leveling off where the mRNA concentrations stay constant over time. Closer look at the differential equation showed that at steady state (dX/dt = 0) the mRNA concentration is determined by the ratio of Î² to Î±:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î²</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î±</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>whereas for the time it takes for the curve to transition into steady state, inversely proportional to the degradation constant, is given by<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¡</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î±</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, we showed that for a log-log plot, the expected shape of the curves can be altered by varying Î± and Î². At constant Î±, increasing Î² would only shift the curve up, while at constant Î², increasing Î± would cause the mRNA abundance to enter steady state more rapidly. Through the comparison between mathematical modeling and experimental data, we could infer the actual effects of Rvb1/Rvb2 binding to mRNA on the transcription and decay rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Ribosome profiling</title><p>The ribosome profiling protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zid and OâShea, 2014</xref>.

Cells were pulverized in a PM 100 ball mill (Retsch), and extracts were digested with RNase I followed by the isolation of ribosome-protected fragments by purifying RNA from the monosome fraction of a sucrose gradient. Isolated 28-base sequences were polyadenylated, and reverse transcription was performed using OTi9pA. OTi9pA allowed samples to be multiplexed at subsequent steps. RNA-seq was performed on RNA depleted of rRNA using a yeast Ribo-Zero kit (Epicentre). Samples were multiplexed and sequenced on a HiSeq analyzer (Illumina).</p><p>To analyze the ribosomal profiling and RNA-seq sequences, reads were trimmed of the 39 run of poly(A)s and then aligned against <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> rRNA sequences using Bowtie sequence aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). Reads that did not align to rRNA sequences were aligned against the full <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome. Reads that had an unambiguous alignment with less than three mismatches were used in the measurements of ribosome occupancy and mRNA levels. Since there were many reads mapping to the initiation region (216 bp to 120 bp in relation to the AUG), the ribosome occupancy for each mRNA was calculated by taking the total number of ribosome reads (normalized to the total number of aligned reads in reads per million reads [RPM]) in the downstream region (120 bp from the AUG to the end of the ORF) and dividing this by the number of mRNA reads (RPM) in the same region. The ribosome occupancy along the mRNA was calculated by dividing the ribosome read counts at each base pair along the gene by the average number of mRNA reads per base pair for each gene.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-76965-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>ChIP-sequencing reads were deposited at GEO.

proteins preferentially associate with the promoters of a class of genes that exhibit increased mRNA expression but translational repression and association with mRNA granules in response to acute glucose starvation. They show that Rvb1/Rvb2 associate with the target mRNAs in addition to their promoters, in a manner requiring only the gene promoter. Tethering Rvb1 or Rvb2 to a reporter mRNA is sufficient to repress its translation, stimulate its synthesis, and induce its sequestration in cytoplasmic granules; whereas Rvb2 knockdown eliminates the translational repression of several reporter mRNAs. These compelling findings support the important demonstration that Rvb1/Rvb2 are loaded on transcripts co-transcriptionally and accompany them into the cytoplasm where they repress translation in a manner associated with the accumulation of the repressed mRNAs in granules.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76965.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04byxyr05</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76965.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their expertise and thorough comments on our manuscript.

However, the reviewers do suggest specific experiments to verify some of the results. Carrying out these experiments will definitely improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Rvb1/Rvb2 proteins couple transcription and translation during glucose starvation&quot;, Chen and co-authors use genetics and microscopy to demonstrate how budding yeast regulate cytoplasmic translation by their promoter sequences by two conserved ATPases Rvb1 and Rvb2 during nutrient stress. The authors show that these two ATPases repress translation of target mRNAs and then propose that these two proteins also recruit mRNAs to P bodies. The authors show that Rvb1/2 preferentially binds in the presence of Class II promoters using CoTrIP, that Rvb1/2 binds specifically at Class II promoters using ChIP-seq, that Rvb1/2 are bound to transcripts with Class II promoters using RIP-Seq, that tethering of Rvb1/2 to a transcript decreases its translatability and that Rvb1/2 binding to a transcript increases its transcript levels by increasing transcription and not slowing mRNA decay.</p><p>The CoTrIP experiment is clever and for the most part well executed. The key conclusions are largely convincing but some clarifications are nevertheless needed (see below). Overall, this paper is well written with well executed experiments that largely support the authors' model. No major additional experiments are needed to support the claims of the paper. There are a few minor concerns that should be addressed before this manuscript gets published. These are:</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Are Rvb1/2 components (enriched in) of P bodies? The model proposed by the authors suggests this but no data is show.</p></disp-quote><p>We find minimal overlap between P-bodies and Rvb1/2 by microscopy â Figure 1âfigure supplement 2. We describe this in the text, as well have added reference to previous results also not seeing overlap between cytoplasmic Rvb1/2 granules and P-bodies. âMicroscopy revealed that Rvb1/Rvb2 are predominately present in the nucleus when cells are not stressed but a portion of them becomes localized to cytoplasmic granules that are distinct from P-bodies after 30-minute glucose starvation conditions. Similar results were previously seen with 2-deoxyglucose driven glucose starvation, where Rvb1 formed cytoplasmic foci independent of P-bodies and stress granules (Rizzolo et al., 2017).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1A: The model proposed by the authors indicates that Rvb1/2 and other proteins are recruited to the mRNAs in a promoter-dependent manner and not mRNA sequence dependent manner. This is largely supported by the data presented in the paper. However the authors should also discuss the possibility that RNA sequences could nevertheless contribute as only a uniform ORF has been tested. Could the promoter recruit Rvb1/2 similarly regardless of the ORF sequence tested? Please provide a sequence of the uniform ORF, discuss what this &quot;uniformity&quot; means and how a change in RNA sequence could affect the outcome of the experiment outlined in Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>The uniform ORF is CFP, which was also used for the promoter swap experiments in Figure 3B,C. These constructs were originally used in our previous manuscript (Zid and OâShea 2014) and more detail is given there. We have also added these plasmids to Addgene, where they can be accessed (https://www.addgene.org/178307/). We see similar effects on mRNA localization and protein expression with alternative ORFs such as nanoluciferase used in Figure 4. We have also mixed the 5âUTRs and ORFs of Class I and Class II genes and seen that the promoter is the dominant factor for mRNA localization (Zid lab unpublished data).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2: The authors use Pgk 1 in their ChIP control but this is not the appropriate control for the experiment as Pgk 1 is not nuclear and thus cannot demonstrate non-specific interaction with genetic regions of tested genes. Regardless, the data is convincing enough to support the model that Rvb1/2 are specifically recruited to the promoters of Class II stress-induced genes and not Class I stress-induced genes. GFP-NLS would be a better control. The authors should discuss in their Materials and methods section why they chose a cytoplasmic protein for their normalization control but preferably perform ChIP with GFP-NLS or other nuclear protein that could bind to chromatin non-specifically to further demonstrate the specificity of Rvb1/2 enrichment at Class II promoters.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original hyper-ChIPability paper (Teytelman et al. 2015) they found enrichment on highly expressed regions even if there was no-tag present in the strain. We therefore used the highly abundant cytoplasmic protein Pgk1 as a control for pulldown specific enrichment effects, that were unrelated to actual protein binding, and added a note of this in the ChIP-seq methodology section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that Rvb1/Rvb2 binding to transcripts leads to formation of granules that are non-colocalized with P-bodies and instead co-localized to SGs, but no SG fluorescent marker is used to demonstrate this claim. The authors should provide this data or remove this claim from their manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this claim as we have had issues identifying a robust, endogenously tagged, 30-minute glucose starvation induced stress granule marker and instead refer to these granules as âP-body independent starvation-induced granulesâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Fluorescent images are fuzzy, very small and difficult to interpret. mRNA puncta are difficult to observe and it is hard to conclude which green puncta colocalize with P bodies and which do not (and how frequently). It is difficult to differentiate between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Consider adding DAPI overlay.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added clearer images of mRNA puncta showing that there is minimal overlap between P-bodies and RVB-tethering induced RNA granules (Figure 4C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The relevance of Figure 2B is not clear â please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>From the text âMore generally we found that, for genes that show a greater than 3-fold increase in mRNA levels during glucose starvation, their promoters are significantly more enriched for Rvb2 binding. Previously we had found that Hsf1-binding sequences were sufficient to exclude mRNAs from mRNP granules during glucose starvation (Zid &amp; OâShea, 2014). Interestingly we found that glucose starvation induced Hsf1-target promoters have no difference in Rvb1/Rvb2 binding than an average gene, and significantly lower Rvb1/Rvb2 enrichment than stress induced non-Hsf1 targets (Figure 2B).â This data is also referenced in the discussion âAs we found that Rvb1/Rvb2 are generally enriched on the promoters of transcriptionally upregulated mRNAs we favor a model in which the default is for Rvb1/Rvb2 to be recruited to active transcription sites. This fits with previous data that Rvb1/Rvb2 are required to maintain expression of many inducible promoters including galactose-inducible transcripts (JÃ³nsson et al., 2001). While Rvb1/Rvb2 are generally recruited to the promoters of induced mRNAs during glucose starvation, we find that Hsf1-regulated promoters circumvent this recruitment through an unknown mechanism, as the transcriptionally upregulated Hsf1 targets show reduced recruitment relative to non-Hsf1 targets (Figure 2B). Intriguingly, Hsf1-regulated genomic regions have been found to coalesce during stressful conditions (Chowdhary, Kainth, &amp; Gross, 2017; Pincus et al., 2018). It will be interesting to explore whether Rvb1/Rvb2 may be excluded from these coalesced regions in future studies.â Finally, this also serves as a control that Rvb1/Rvb2 are not just binding to transcriptionally induced promoters, as Hsf1 targets are induced just as strongly as Class II mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 5A modeling adds little supporting evidence to the entire figure. The experimental results are more convincing. Consider moving to the Supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved this to a Figure 4âfigure supplement 10A,B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 4 and 3B. The authors suggest that Rvb1/2 loaded by the promoters onto the mRNA determine accumulation of mRNAs to P bodies. To test this model, the authors tether Rvb1/2 onto the mRNA using MS2-MCP system and then look for co-localization of the mRNA with P bodies. However, if the authors' model is correct, this experiment could have been achieved already using the constructs in Figure 3B. The authors should look at the P body localization pattern using chimeras used in Figure 3B.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was performed in our previous manuscript (Zid and OâShea 2014) and showed that the promoter was sufficient to determine the cytoplasmic localization of the mRNA but did not show the mechanism for this promoter-controlled localization. One additional clarification is that our data supports Rvb1/2 driving localization to P-body independent starvation-induced granules, which is also the localization pattern we previously saw for Class II promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 6: The authors present a model where mRNAs transcribed from Class II promoters are decorated with Rvb1/2 co-transcriptionally, exported into the cytoplasm, recruited to P bodies and translationally repressed. However, this model is not fully supported by the data shown. Specifically, the authors have not shown that localization of mRNAs to P bodies induces translational repression or whether the recruitment is a consequence of this repression. The authors should revise their model to reflect this uncertainty. Also, the numbering of steps 1,2 3 is confusing. Does it imply a temporal sequences? Some of these steps could be occurring simultaneously (like 1 and 3). How does step 3 lead from step 2? Please clarify this model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the numbering system as we agree that some of these steps, like 1 and 3 are probably happening at the same time. We have updated the text of the figure legend to âThen Rvb1/Rvb2 escort the interacting mRNAs to the cytoplasm and cause repressed translation and localization to cytoplasmic granules.â We have also updated the discussion with the following text pointing to the unclear causality of translational repression and P-body independent starvation-induced granule localization in the discussion â âWe are uncertain whether Rvb1/Rvb2 tethering represses translation which directs mRNAs to mRNP granules, or if Rvb1/Rvb2 binding directly target the mRNA to the granule, which represses translation or some combination of both as these are very hard to disentangleâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Consider showing data-points in Figure 1 figure supplement 1. The box/whisker plot doesn't give a good sense of the enrichment alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the number of replicates to the figure and have also included the data points in the accompanying supplemental data file for Figure 1 figure supplement 1. They are very close and end up overlapping when plotted on a graph together.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 1 Figure supplement 2 shows that the fluorophore seems to influence the % of cells with foci. Why is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>While we canât be certain, one reason may be that mNeonGreen is ~4 times as bright as mRuby2 in yeast (Botman et al. 2019). This may make it easier to distinguish mNeonGreen Rvb foci versus non-foci fluorescence and the inherent autofluorescence of yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) List gene names in Figure 2 Figure supp 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised Figure 2 Figure supp 5 by adding gene names.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Throughout the paper the graph axis labels are very small and difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the font on many graph axis labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 4 Figure supplement 7C and 8E: on the y-axis the legend says proportion of cells (%), so the value on the y-axis might be 25, 50, 75 and not 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed these axis values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The last paragraph of the Introduction (page 2) detailed how Rvb1/Rvb2 are core components of the stress granule. Yet most experiments were conducted to relate Rvb1/Rvb2 with P-bodies. Maybe some information about the known roles Rvb1/Rvb2 play in the P-bodies in the Introduction section could help.</p></disp-quote><p>We predominantly used a P-body marker because it gives a robust mRNP granule marker during glucose starvation, even at early timepoints. We see minimal colocalization between RVB-tethering induced RNA granules and P-bodies. This is in agreement with ours and others data that RVB doesnât colocalize with P-bodies during glucose starvation. To our knowledge there is little information linking Rvb1/Rvb2 to P-bodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Ruvb helicase has been shown to regulate the formation of stress granules in human U2OS cells during oxidative stress (Parker lab, Cell, 2016). Thus, the authors suggest that Rvb proteins could have a broad and conserved role in the formation of RNA granules, which advances our understanding of how biomolecular condensates could form.</p><p>In addition, translationally-repressed mRNAs have been shown to preferentially recruit to diverse RNA granules, from stress granules P bodies in human cells as well as germ granules in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These observations have gained considerable attention in the past 5 years and exact molecular principles behind this phenomenon are not entirely clear. Long and exposed RNA sequences are thought to be sufficient for this enrichment. The authors however suggest that specific proteins (Rvb1/2) could also trigger enrichment either directly by interacting with P bodies or indirectly by repressing translation and exposing RNA sequences. This finding will be particularly relevant to the field of biomolecular condensates.</p><p>My expertise is in the area of RNA biology, mRNA decay, RNA granules and mRNA localization.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Dr. Brian Zid has previously published in Nature that, in response to glucose starvation, promoters of some genes (&quot;class II&quot;) can control synthesis of mRNAs that are sequestered in cytoplasmic P bodies or Stress granules, away from the translation apparatus. In this paper, his group reports about the underlying mechanism. They have found proteins that bind preferentially class II promoters as well as their transcripts and are capable of repressing their translation and stimulating their assembly with P bodies. They found a correlation between the capacity of Rvb1/2 binding to promoters and binding to mRNAs. Using a tethering technique, they found that Rb1/Rvb2 recruitment to reporter mRNA (not class II) led to the association of the transcript with PBs and its translation repression. Interestingly, Binding of Rvb1/Rvb2 to the studied transcript increased transcription of its own gene, probably by remodeling the nearby chromatin.</p><p>The paper uncovers a mechanism to sequester mRNAs as translationally repressed in RNA granules during starvation and warrants a publication in a good journal, after responding to various comments below.</p><p>1. CoTrIP is a method to identify proteins that differentially bind plasmids carrying different promoters/genes. However, the claim that it identifies proteins bound to nascent mRNAs is an overreach, as the proteins bind both DNA and RNA and the purified plasmid contains both types of nucleic acids.</p><p>Therefore, the title of section 1 (&quot;Rvb1/Rvb2 are identified as potential co-transcriptionally loaded protein factors on the alternative glucose metabolism genes&quot;) should be changed to something like: Rvb1/Rvb2 are identified as proteins that are co-purified with a plasmid expressing alternative glucose metabolism genes.</p><p>Description of CoTrIP and its results should be discussed throughout the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the title of the section to: âRvb1/Rvb2 co-purify with plasmids containing an alternative glucose metabolism gene promoterâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The engineered Rvb1/Rvb2 tethering to mRNAs of choice is a potentially convincing way to show the causative effect of Rvb1/Rvb2 on RNA performance. Using this method, the authors show that attachment of Rvb1/Rvb2 to an engineered mRNA mediate its association with granules and inhibits its translation. However, this experiment takes Rvb1/2 out of its natural context such that its behavior in this case may not be exemplative of its endogenous function. The authors are encouraged to support their results by depleting Rvbs with AID and examine the outcome of this depletion on PBs formation and translation of class II genes (and class I as controls).</p></disp-quote><p>We had extensively tried to use the AID system to deplete Rvbs, but had leaky depletion even without auxin addition with all AID systems we tried. We alternatively used CRISPRi and a gRNA directed to the promoter of RVB2 to downregulate expression of RVB2. This led to an almost 20-fold depletion of the RVB2 mRNA. From this strain we found increased protein induction for Class II genes during glucose starvation, but no effect on a Class I control. Even though the Class II genes had increased protein expression, we actually found decreased mRNA induction upon downregulated RVB2 expression during glucose starvation, further supporting the role of Rvb proteins affect transcription and translation. This data is presented as Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The tethering experiments, shown in Figure 4, would be more convincing by including an additional control. To rule out the possibility that any bulky protein that is recruited to the 3'-UTR by the PP7 element affects translation (not an unlikely possibility), they want to consider fusing irrelevant protein (e.g., Pgk1p) to CP, in place of Rvb1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expressed GFP-PP7-CP plasmid in the HSP30prUTR-nLuc-PP7-MS2 yeast strain and found that this tethering has no significant effect on protein synthesis induction, mRNA induction, and translatability (Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The proposal that Rvb1 binds class II transcripts during transcription is a plausible possibility (which I personally believe to represent the reality), but by no means demonstrated.

An optional suggestion: The paper can be upgraded by performing ribosome profiling, as shown in Supplemental Figure 9, after a short depletion of Rvb1/2 by AID (see comment 2). This, in combination with the results already shown in Supp Figure 9, can demonstrate the role of Rvb1/2 in mRNA storage in granules and in translation shortly after glucose refeeding. The large data sets thus produced (in particular the ratio between depleted and non-depleted signal per each gene) can be used to try correlate the extent of ribosome occupancy (or the above mentioned ratio) with cis-element(s) or known trans-acting elements within the promoters. This may identify elements within the promoters that recruit (directly or indirectly) Rvb1/2. If successful, it can pave the way to demonstrate co-transcriptional RNA binding. I also suggest moving Supp Figure 9 as an additional panel of the main Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be an interesting direction to pursue ribosome profiling on the RVB2 depletion strain.

In the previous manuscript we were not able to show the mechanism for this promoter-controlled localization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
