cells form an intricate cellular network. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in a specialized niche, which is essential for their proliferation and differentiation. However, the cellular and molecular determinants contributing to this fetal HSC niche remain largely unknown. Macrophages are the first differentiated hematopoietic cells found in the developing liver, where they are important for fetal erythropoiesis by promoting erythrocyte maturation and phagocytosing expelled nuclei. Yet, whether macrophages play a role in fetal hematopoiesis beyond serving as a niche for maturing erythroblasts remains elusive. Here, we investigate the heterogeneity of macrophage populations in the murine fetal liver to define their specific roles during hematopoiesis. Using a single-cell omics approach combined with spatial proteomics and genetic fate-mapping models, we found that fetal liver macrophages cluster into distinct yolk sac-derived subpopulations and that long-term HSCs are interacting preferentially with one of the macrophage subpopulations. Fetal livers lacking macrophages show a delay in erythropoiesis and have an increased number of granulocytes, which can be attributed to transcriptional reprogramming and altered differentiation potential of long-term HSCs. Together, our data provide a detailed map of fetal liver macrophage subpopulations and implicate macrophages as part of the fetal HSC niche.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cells</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>granulopoiesis</kwd><kwd>fetal liver</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC2151-390873048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultze</surname><given-names>Joachim L</given-names></name><name><surname>Kiermaier</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name><name><surname>Beyer</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Schlitzer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Mass</surname><given-names>Elvira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mauel</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name><name><surname>Mass</surname><given-names>Elvira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1873/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mass</surname><given-names>Elvira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultze</surname><given-names>Joachim L</given-names></name><name><surname>Beyer</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Schlitzer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name><name><surname>Mass</surname><given-names>Elvira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR5547 -

Work in mice showed that most macrophages originate from erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) in the yolk sac and are long lived, and that their maintenance in many adult tissues does not rely on definitive hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mass, 2018</xref>). All developing tissues are initially colonized by circulating pre-macrophages (pMacs), which immediately differentiate into tissue-specific macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stremmel et al., 2018</xref>), therefore, macrophages are an integral part of organogenesis.</p><p>In adult tissues, macrophages inhabit distinct anatomical niches within organs, for example, the lung harbors alveolar and interstitial macrophage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter et al., 2022</xref>), while macrophages in the adult liver are divided into Kupffer cells, liver capsular, central vein, and lipid-associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guilliams and Scott, 2022</xref>). Within these niches, resident macrophages adapt to their tissue environment and perform specific tasks to maintain organ function, such as mucus clearance by alveolar macrophages or phagocytosis of red blood cells by Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mass et al., 2023</xref>). However, the role of macrophages in organ development and function as well as their heterogeneity during embryogenesis is less well understood.</p><p>One of the few well-known functions of fetal macrophages is their involvement in erythroblast maturation. In the fetal liver, erythroblastic island (EI) macrophages serve as niches for erythroblasts. During erythropoiesis, primitive and definitive erythroblasts directly interact with EI macrophages, where they undergo final steps of maturation, including expelling of their nucleus, which is phagocytosed by EI macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Palis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palis, 2014</xref>). Previous studies identified EI macrophage heterogeneity in the fetal liver at embryonic day (E)13.5/E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mukherjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seu et al., 2017</xref>). EI macrophages were shown to express different levels of cell adhesion proteins such as Vcam1, CD169, and CD163, as well as other proteins that are important for their function as EI niche (e.g., Epor, Klf1, EMP, and DNaseII), thereby promoting erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mariani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">May and Forrester, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mukherjee et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to erythropoiesis, the E13.5/E14.5 fetal liver is at the peak of hematopoiesis, providing a niche for the expansion and differentiation of other hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the liver is a complex cellular interaction network where the role of macrophages in other hematopoietic developmental processes, such as myelopoiesis, is not fully understood.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that one of the core macrophage functions is the support of stem and progenitor cell functionality in different tissues. For instance, pericryptal macrophages in the gut interact with epithelial progenitors, thereby promoting their proliferation and differentiation via Wnt, gp130, TLR4, or NOX1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delfini et al., 2022</xref>). In the bone marrow, distinct macrophage subpopulations contribute directly and indirectly to the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. Osteoclasts are a highly specialized EMP-derived macrophage population responsible for bone resorption, whose function is necessary to generate the bone marrow and, thereby, the postnatal HSC niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacome-Galarza et al., 2019</xref>). Co-culture experiments using different combinations of hematopoietic cells indicate that osteomacs support the HSC niche in synergy with megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mohamad et al., 2017</xref>). DARC<sup>+</sup> macrophages are in direct contact with CD82<sup>+</sup> long-term (LT)-HSCs in the endosteal and arteriolar niches, where they contribute to LT-HSC dormancy via maintenance of CD82 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hur et al., 2016</xref>). Additional macrophage depletion studies via clodronate and diphtheria toxin indicate that CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the bone marrow promote HSC retention by acting specifically on the Nestin<sup>+</sup> HSC niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chow et al., 2011</xref>), as well as steady-state and stress erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chow et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>During embryogenesis, macrophages have been shown to be important for the development and proliferation of hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells in mice. In the mouse, the first HSCs develop from the aorta–gonad–mesonephros (AGM) region starting at E10.5. Here, a CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophage population actively interacts with nascent and emerging intra-aortic HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mariani et al., 2019</xref>). Macrophage depletion studies via clodronate liposomes and the Csf1r inhibitor BLZ945 using AGM explants indicate that the presence of macrophages in the AGM is influencing HSC production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mariani et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, co-culture studies of a mixture of hematopoietic stem- and multipotent-progenitor cells (HSC/MPP) with macrophages isolated from the fetal liver as well as clodronate depletion studies during embryogenesis suggest that fetal liver macrophages promote HSC/MPP proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, immunofluorescent stainings of F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages and CD150<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>) indicate that macrophages could also be part of the LT-HSC niche in the fetal liver, thereby influencing the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells at the top of the HSC hierarchy.</p><p>Studying stem cell niches and defining the molecular factors that promote stem cell proliferation and differentiation are essential to build a robust and reproducible in vitro system that may serve as a universal source of functional stem cells and/or immune cells for therapeutic purposes.

In contrast, a universal and well-defined culturing protocol for LT-HSCs allowing for continuous expansion is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar and Geiger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). Production of LT-HSCs from iPSCs represents a promising alternative, however, differentiation protocols without ectopic transcription factor expression have not been established yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demirci et al., 2020</xref>). This may be due to the complex developmental programming of adult LT-HSCs that have experienced distinct niche signals during their migration from AGM via the fetal liver to the bone marrow, resulting in functional differences observed in fetal versus mature HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora et al., 2014</xref>).

However, it remains to be investigated whether specific macrophage populations in the fetal liver contribute to LT-HSC stem-cell ness or differentiation via factors they produce in vivo.</p><p>Given the observations implicating macrophages in HSC functionality, we characterized the heterogeneity and ontogeny of fetal liver macrophage populations, providing a comprehensive macrophage atlas of the fetal liver at E14.5.

To this end, we first performed a gene ontology (GO) term analysis on the top expressed 100 genes, comparing each cluster from the scRNA-seq analysis to all other clusters. Here, cluster 2-specific genes fell into the terms ‘cell chemotaxis’, ‘positive regulation of inflammatory response’, and ‘cytokine-mediated signaling pathway’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating the activated inflammatory state already observed in the top 5 expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, cluster 7-related genes were significant for the GO terms ‘positive regulation of lipid localization’, ‘ameboidal-type cell migration’, and ‘apoptotic cell clearance’.

Using a gating strategy to detect these myeloid cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we observed a significant increase of Ly6G<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>KO</italic> livers compared to littermate controls while the number of monocytes was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Intriguingly, neutrophils numbers remained high in <italic>KO</italic> livers throughout embryonic development compared to littermates, albeit the empty macrophage niche was replenished by E16.5 and remained stable at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E, F</xref>). To test whether the change in differentiation potential of <italic>KO</italic> HSCs is cell autonomous, we first performed a CFU-C assay. While the total number of colonies was similar in both genotypes, the number of CFU-granulocyte/macrophage (GM) was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). To test the hypothesis of a cell-autonomous effect in vivo, we made use of an adoptive transfer model where we transplanted either <italic>KO</italic> or <italic>WT</italic> fetal liver cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). The chimerism was almost at 100% CD45.2 after 12 weeks indicating that HSCs of the fetal liver have completely taken over hematopoiesis of the adult host. Similar to results observed in the developing embryo and CFU assays, <italic>KO</italic> HSCs produced significantly more neutrophils compared to littermate control HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). As neutrophils originate from GMPs, which also give rise to monocytes and which are slightly increased in the E14.5 liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we additionally quantified Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes in the blood of the host. Similarly to Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils, monocytes were significantly increased in numbers in hosts harboring HSCs from KO fetal livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Together with the results from the RNA-seq analyses, our data indicate that the lack of fetal liver macrophages causes a reprogramming of LT-HSCs, leading to their preferential differentiation toward the GMP-dependent lineage in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that liver macrophages at E14.5 are heterogenous and that they play an active role in the niche of CD150<sup>+</sup> LT-HSCs. While most macrophages serve purely as EI macrophages, being only surrounded by Ter119<sup>+</sup> erythroblasts and promoting erythroblast maturation, a subset of macrophages directly interacts with other cells, such as c-Kit<sup>+</sup> and CD150<sup>+</sup> stem and progenitor cells. Being part of the HSCs niche, macrophages seem to specifically control the production of neutrophils, likely via paracrine factors that imprint the tissue environment on LT-HSCs, thereby enabling a tight balance of hematopoietic cell numbers. The increased monocyte production originating from transplanted <italic>KO</italic> HSCs suggests that the presence of macrophages may contribute specifically to the differentiation trajectory from LT-HSCs toward GMPs. The unchanged numbers of monocytes in the developing embryo are likely due to the requirement of fetal monocytes to quickly differentiate into macrophages that replenish the empty niche. Using various fate-mapping models, we could exclude any contribution of definitive HSCs to the fetal liver macrophage pool. Finally, we provide a simple gating strategy with commonly available antibodies that allow the identification of macrophage subpopulations and the discrimination from cell doublets.</p><p>CODEX analyses indicate that CD150<sup>+</sup> LT-HSCs are preferentially found in close proximity to CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages. CD169, also known as sialoadhesin, is a cell adhesion protein that has been described as an EI macrophage marker in the bone marrow and the fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seu et al., 2017</xref>), albeit with varying expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seu et al., 2017</xref>). In line with this, our flow-cytometry and in situ immunofluorescent CODEX analysis of the fetal liver indicates that the majority of macrophages express CD169, with few macrophages that are CD169-negative and small in size but that express high levels of F4/80, Tim4, and Vcam1, and can thus be considered <italic>bona fide</italic> macrophages (cluster A). CD169 has been further defined as essential for erythropoiesis by promoting erythroblast maturation in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chow et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, CD169 is not required to bind erythroblasts, as shown by studies using specific inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morris et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morris et al., 1988</xref>), but instead accumulates in contact zones between macrophages and immature granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crocker et al., 1990</xref>). However, these studies, as many others analyzing EI macrophages, were performed after flushing the bone marrow. Thus, an ultrastructural characterization of the fetal liver in situ may be helpful in addressing whether CD169 forms clusters in the plasma membrane, which may be a direct interaction zone between CD169<sup>+</sup> macrophages and LT-HSCs. However, since CD150<sup>+</sup> LT-HSCs also interacted with CD169<sup>−</sup> macrophages, the tethering mechanism may rely on another surface receptor altogether.</p><p>Recent studies have addressed the role of fetal macrophages in the development of HSPCs. Work in zebrafish shows a homing and retention mechanism controlled by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Theodore et al., 2017</xref>). Li et al. describe a Vcam1<sup>+</sup> macrophage-like cell population that interacts with HSPCs and serves as a permissive signal for HSPC entry into the embryonic caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, our work does not support an essential role of macrophages for LT-HSC homing or retention to the fetal liver since numbers of LT-HSC are not affected in <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Spi1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> embryos. Work in mouse embryos indicates that CD206<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the AGM contribute to intra-aortic HSC generation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mariani et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, macrophages have been suggested to promote HSC/MPP proliferation in the fetal liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). However, due to the lack of genetic mouse models targeting only yolk sac-derived macrophages and not the definitive wave of hematopoiesis, these studies relied on macrophage depletion via clodronate liposomes and the Csf1r inhibitor BLZ945 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mariani et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the long-term impact of these substances on the proliferation capacity of HSCs or other niche cells that promote HSC development cannot be excluded. Indeed, our model, in which we target pMacs very efficiently using the <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mass et al., 2016</xref>), leading to an almost complete depletion of macrophages while HSCs remain wildtype, we do not observe any defects in the proliferation and expansion of HSCs arguing for an unspecific off-target effect of clodronate and BLZ945.</p><p>During steady-state adulthood, macrophages have been shown to control neutrophil numbers through the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils and via the G-CSF/IL-17/IL-23 cytokine axis, which promotes granulopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stark et al., 2005</xref>). The reduction of macrophage populations in the bone marrow and spleen observed in <italic>Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup>; Cflar<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice led to neutrophilia during steady state, which was attributed to the defect in efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordy et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup>; Cflar<sup>f/f</sup></italic> model is also defined by an increase of inflammatory monocytes in the blood and spleen, indicating an alteration of myeloid progenitors leading to increased numbers of neutrophils and monocytes, likely driven by increased levels of G-CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordy et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, the maintenance and longevity of neutrophils during embryogenesis are less well understood. Yet, published work suggests a different life span of fetal and adult neutrophils, with the E14.5 fetal liver harboring only a few apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) in comparison to the adult spleen analyzed in <italic>Lyz2<sup>Cre</sup>; Cflar<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice and littermate controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordy et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, circulating neutrophils at E16.5 can be fate-mapped to an E8.5 yolk sac progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomez Perdiguero et al., 2015</xref>), and during embryogenesis, there is rather a massive increase of neutrophils between E14.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freyer et al., 2021</xref>) (and own data, not shown) instead of the steady-state turnover observed in adult mice. Thus, increased numbers of neutrophils in the fetal liver of <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Spi1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> embryos are unlikely caused by an increase of apoptotic neutrophils not being phagocytosed by macrophages.</p><p>Our RNA-seq data instead indicate that there is a transcriptional change in LT-HSCs when macrophages are lacking, supporting the hypothesis that fetal liver macrophages provide not only a niche for erythroblasts but also for LT-HSCs. In LT-HSC from <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Spi1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> fetal livers <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> were upregulated compared to littermate controls. Previous studies have shown the importance of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> transcription factors in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsayegh et al., 2019</xref>). GATA2 serves as a regulator of genes controlling the proliferative capacity of early hematopoietic cells during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsai and Orkin, 1997</xref>) and the GMP cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rodrigues et al., 2008</xref>). Here, gene dosage is also crucial for HSC functionality since <italic>Gata2</italic> heterozygote (<italic>Gata2<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) mice displayed reduced GMP numbers in the bone marrow and serial replating CFU assays of <italic>Gata2<sup>+/−</sup></italic> bone marrow produced less GMPs compared to controls +/−. Furthermore, a study in GATA2-deficient human embryonic stem cells could show that GATA2 is required for the production of granulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). These data highlight the conserved function of <italic>Gata2</italic> in regulating HSC functionality on different levels, including their differentiation into granulocytes. Similar to Gata2, Gata3 can also regulate HSC maintenance and differentiation. Different studies of fetal and adult HSCs demonstrated that Gata3 is required for maintaining the self-renewing capacity of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frelin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ku et al., 2012</xref>) and that expression of Gata3 is tightly regulating LT-HSCs to either self-renew or differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frelin et al., 2013</xref>). We could not observe an impact of <italic>Gata2/Gata3</italic> upregulation on LT-HSC numbers or their proliferation/serial replating capacity, suggesting a different mechanism in fetal livers. However, dysregulation of <italic>Gata2</italic> and/or <italic>Gata3</italic> expression may cause increasing numbers of GMPs and significantly more neutrophils in the fetal liver observed in <italic>Tnfrsf11a<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Spi1<sup>f/f</sup></italic> embryos. Whether the proliferation and differentiation trajectories of fetal liver HSPCs are regulated by similar transcriptional networks as has been published for adult bone marrow remains to be investigated. Furthermore, using CD150 as an LT-HSC marker in the fetal liver may not exclude other MPPs, which have not been as systematically analyzed for the expression of surface markers and differential potential as the MPPs in the adult bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pietras et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sommerkamp et al., 2021</xref>).Thus, to define the fetal LT-HSC niche in more detail, it will be important to examine whether macrophage-derived signals can control the expression and/or activity of Gata2 and Gata3 or other transcription factors that are known to control HSCs stem-cell ness and differentiation.</p><p>A study in zebrafish supports the notion of macrophage–HSC crosstalk requirement during development, uncovering a ‘grooming’ mechanism of embryonic macrophages that had a long-lasting impact on adult stem cells: HSPCs in the CHT often completed a cell division shortly after macrophage interactions and lack of CHT macrophages led to a decreased HSPC clonality in the adult marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wattrus et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, their data suggest that HSPC proliferation in the CHT is mediated through extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) activity, which is controlled by macrophage-derived Il1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wattrus et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, the scRNA-seq macrophage cluster 2 is specifically expressing Il1b and could have a similar effect on a subset of LT-HSCs in the mouse fetal liver. Therefore, dissecting the macrophage-derived ligands and their effect on HSPC populations on a single-cell level will shed light on the crosstalk mechanisms in mouse fetal livers in the future.</p><p>Defining factors that control the HSC niche is essential to support efforts for an in vitro expansion and targeted differentiation of HSCs. Only a few studies have focused on macrophages as HSC niche cells so far, as they are primarily viewed as interacting cells of erythroblasts in both the fetal liver and the adult bone marrow. Here, we show that macrophages provide a niche for LT-HSCs in the fetal liver, and that macrophage deficiency leads to changes in the LT-HSC transcriptional program and their differentiation capacity. Likely, not only the immediate interaction but also macrophage-derived cytokines and growth factors affect processes, such as fate decisions and stem-cell ness. Our results provide a starting point to study the impact of macrophage-derived signals on LT-HSC functionality during embryogenesis and adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CODEX conjugation kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Akoya Biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7000008</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CODEX staining kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Akoya Biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7000009</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CODEX Buffer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Akoya Biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7000001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BS3 fixative</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">21580</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CollagenaseD</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11088882001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">422801</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DNase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DN25-1G</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DRAQ7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">424001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:1000</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fetal calf serum</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio&amp;Sell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FBS.

Analysis of the spatial relationships of Iba1<sup>+</sup> and CD150<sup>+</sup> was performed using the IMARIS module Vantage, to automatically extract the distances between the cells and the mutual attraction and repulsion effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomariz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Co-detection by indexing</title><p>5 µm slices of fetal liver from E14.5 wildtype embryos were prepared and used for CODEX staining following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, sections were retrieved from the freezer, let dry on drierite beads, and fixed for 10 min in ice-cold acetone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After fixation, samples were rehydrated and photobleached twice as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2019</xref>.

A final washing step with 1× PBS was performed.</p><p>A multicycle CODEX experiment was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Observer widefield fluorescence microscope using a ×20 objective (NA 0.85) and z-spacing of 1.5 µm. The 405, 488, 568, and 647 nm channels were used. After imaging, raw files were exported using the CODEX Instrument Manager (Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA, USA) and processed with CODEX Processor v1.7 (Akoya Biosciences). Image processing included background subtraction using the DAPI signals of the first and last empty cycles of the acquisition, deconvolution, shading correction, and stitching. For cell segmentation, DAPI counterstain was used for object detection, whereas sodium-potassium ATPase antibody staining was used as a membrane marker for delineating the cell shape.</p><p>A manual cell classification was performed in CODEX MAV 1.5 (Akoya Biosciences). Annotation of the macrophage clusters was done using the same gating strategy as in flow cytometry, with the difference that F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells were not gated but F4/80<sup>+</sup> Iba1<sup>+</sup> cells. HSCs were gated as CD150<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells, erythrocytes as CD45<sup>−</sup>Ter119<sup>+</sup> cells, and blood vessels as CD45<sup>−</sup>CD31<sup>+</sup>SMA<sup>+</sup> cells.

A raster scan with a radius of 50 µm was performed to spatially segment the image. To define the cellular neighborhoods based on local composition, an SOM clustering algorithm was used, considering only the macrophage populations. Heatmaps were generated to determine the cell composition of each neighborhood. To measure the distances between macrophage clusters and erythrocytes, images were exported to QuPath v0.3 and cells were detected using DAPI signals. Single object classifiers for each marker were trained, and these were used to generate composite classifiers to identify macrophage populations, erythrocytes, and HSCs as before. The distance between the cells of each macrophage cluster and their closest erythrocyte was measured and plotted.</p><p>To validate the proximity of macrophage clusters to HSCs, images were exported to QuPath v0.3, cells were segmented, and HSCs were identified, as described above. A circle with a fixed radius of 50 µm was drawn and centered on 20 randomly selected HSCs. Next, the same composite classifiers to identify macrophage clusters were applied to the annotated circles, and the number of cells of each macrophage cluster within the defined radius was counted.</p><p>To determine the percentage of CD41<sup>+</sup>/CD150<sup>+</sup> cells, three independent sections were analyzed using CODEX MAV 1.5.

The cell culture dish was cautiously tilted until it was covered with medium and was put inside the incubator. After 12 days of cell culture, colonies were first identified by their phenotype, that is their size, shape, and density were analyzed based on representative pictures shown in the CFU assay protocol by STEMCELL Technologies. Subsequently, colonies were picked and identification was validated by the May–Grünwald–Giemsa staining (Merck) of the colonies. Prior to the staining, the colonies were picked up using a 10-μl pipet under Leica M80 microscope and collected into microtubes containing 10 μl FACS buffer. The collected colonies were transferred on slides using cytospin funnels (Hettich), centrifuged at 800 RPM by a cytospin centrifuge (Hettich) for 10 min.

The clusters were investigated using their DEGs. The DEG lists were identified using Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank Test by comparing each cluster to the rest of the clusters. The selection of the clusters of interest was done in an iterative way. Three clustering steps were performed in total to subset the cells. Briefly, the first round of clustering was done in a none-stringent manner and the resulted groups were monitored for their DEGs and were assigned to certain cell types that they resembled most. Based on the DEGs the clusters 1, 4, 5, and 9 were containing macrophages while the other groups were representing other cell types and states. This selection was assured further by exploring the expression of a set of pMac markers among the selected clusters. Clusters that could contain macrophages were subset for a second round of clustering. The subset cells were processed and clustered for a second time to have more homogenous cells regarding cell types. Again, the clusters were subjected to another round of selection using two different sets of signature markers for genes that are expressed in macrophages. The selected clusters in the second round were subset and the cells were processed for a final round of clustering resulting in distinguishable clusters of macrophage cells and their precursors from the rest.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers concluded that although the strength of the study lies in the characterization and categorization of distinct FL macrophages, and in the fate-mapping aspect, the conclusion that macrophages are regulating the hematopoietic stem cell niche and granulopoiesis is not well-supported by the data as presented. Either transplantation or co-culture experiments at a minimum would be necessary to demonstrate an effect on hematopoiesis and lineage differentiation. Alternatively, strongly adapting the language/the conclusion on the influence of the macrophages on HSCs in the fetal liver might improve the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Based on initial clustering, it seems that many other macrophages within the fetal liver are excluded from further downstream analysis. It would have been very interesting and important to investigate both fate-mapping and gene expression signatures in other clusters besides those that specifically align with pMAC signatures.</p><p>The authors might have detected the effects of macrophage depletion on HSC function if they had isolated LT-HSCs and performed transplantation assays. This would have provided much stronger evidence supporting the author's conclusion of granulocytic bias. Colony-forming assays, as presented, are not convincing of the role of fetal macrophages in regulating HSC output or function, particularly in the absence of any effects in vivo in the conditional deletion model.</p><p>Also, it may have been too early for LT-HSCs to produce granulocytes, and for them to significantly accumulate in the FL. This could be directly tested using the fate-mapping models on hand.</p><p>In general, some of the data could be more clearly presented. For example, frequencies should be shown in 1i. Data in Figure 3E don't represent data in Figure 3F – e.g., there appear to be as many macrophages of each subtype in proximity to each HSC in 3E. In 3C, Cluster C is not visible. In Figure 6, differences in cluster size between KO and WT should be quantified. These minor changes would help clarify some of the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1 and Figure S1. The analysis and identification of macrophages in the fetal liver is strong. The initial selection step reduces the number of clusters further analyzed from 11 to 4, simply based on the pMac signature, plus a subsequent reduction (Figure S1D). How robust is that reduction, as strongly influences all downstream analyses and reduces the number of cells for subsequent analyses? What might then be cells not included?</p><p>Is the analysis robust enough to then include all types of macrophages, or the majority populations?</p><p>To this reviewer, the presentation of the alignment of the flow-based analysis (informed by the gene expression data) that was also reduced in complexity aligned that likely well to the gene expression clusters could be further improved and supported by additional information and steps much better put into perspective. This alignment is critical as protein and gene-based clustering seem to align, which is central due to the high level of reduction that was applied in obtaining the results.</p><p>The authors provide a correlation matrix on surface and expression, but should that not be more than 50% in the best case? Clusters 2,7 and 8 that are bona fide macrophage clusters do actually not very well positively correlate with A-G, at least in the opinion of this reviewer. It looks more like these are the remaining ones as 1 and 11 are more linked to F,E,G? The authors might add additional information to provide less complex information to the reader to allow for understanding of the overlap. As proteins will become central for staining of tissues, that information is critical.</p><p>Figure 2 is more like a supplementary figure rather than novel information in itself. It is an interesting analysis, but any data to test or further confirm this information is not provided. And, as the authors imply that the terms and interactions listed are functionally relevant rather than simply grouping determinants, again either show additional functional data to support the analysis or list them as very interesting supplementary material that await further experimental confirmation with respect to function.</p><p>Figure 2D: In the analysis of potential ligand-receptor interactions, they use the term LT-HSC (line 254). However, the population for the receptors in Figure 2D is shown as CD150+CD48+, which doesn't represent the immunotypic CD150+CD48-LSK LT-HSC population described in the methods. What is the cell-type shown in these analyses?</p><p>Figure 3: In general, as only the CD150 antibody is used to identify HSCs, the term HSCs for CD150+ cells is not correct. Progenitor and megakaryocytic cell populations are also CD150+. The high number of CD150+ cells in the diagram (Figure 3C) likely reflects this heterogeneity of the CD150+ cells, as there should be fewer HSCs. The term HSC/MPPs might be more correct here, which though then implies that data is not fully HSC centered. The authors might want to resolve that. Please also provide readable scale bars for the histology images. In Figure 3B, please also show the SMA (vessel) staining in the enlargements.</p><p>The images in Figure 3E are difficult to follow, but are central to the publication, as they investigate the special relationship between macrophages from the clusters and HSCs. CD150 is in black? What is white? It looks like that some of the HSCs are F4/80 positive? HSCs are much larger than macrophages and multinucleated? So it remains not clear whether what is identified as HSCs is indeed HSCs or what is what. Macrophages identified in Figure 3 look different from the ones identified in S3C? The authors might want to really clarify these questions and also support their claims with additional new data.</p><p>And, would it be possible to stain for cluster A-D in one single staining, to see the extent of overlap/exclusivity?</p><p>The image for cluster C is likely not representative as the frequency of HSCs is similar to cluster A,B and D, but according to the claims there should be more HSCs. But see also comment on Figure 3F below.</p><p>If Figure 3F is interpreted correctly, most of the HSCs analyzed do not have a cell from the cluster close by. That would mean that most HSCs in the fetal liver are not surrounded by macrophages from cluster A-D. That would also mean that likely the niche function of macrophages for HSCs in the fetal liver is rather limited, which would align with the finding that specifically depleting macrophages in the fetal liver (Figure 5).</p><p>Figure legend 3A: please add Iba1. Also, change the order of the row descriptions or the images.</p><p>Figure 4: The depletion of macrophages (Figure 4B), which are highly abundant in FL tissue (Figure 3B,C) do not lead to changes in tissue architecture (HE experiments, Figure 4D) or why is there a reduction in overall cell number, but not in CD45+ cells? That is somewhat surprising, as this reviewer might actually expect a consequence upon deletion that is larger than a reduction of enucleated erythrocytes from 70 to 50%. How do the authors explain that? What is the longer-term (development) consequence of Tnfrsf11a driven deletion of Spi1 positive cells? Is there any?</p><p>Figure 5: To the best of the knowledge of this reviewer, while HSCs in E14.5 FL follow the SLAM code, whether all the types of progenitors identified by gating like adult progenitors indeed show in FL the potential that is associated with that gating strategy in the adults has not been unequivocally demonstrated. The authors might at least comment on that in the manuscript.</p><p>There seems to be an upregulation of genes linked to myeloid cell differentiation in KO cells. Were any genes associated with lymphoid differentiation also affected?</p><p>Figure 6: Why did the author not use simple co-culture experiments to test an influence of cluster A-D macrophages on HSCs? That would deliver direct interaction data.</p><p>Figure 6B. It is not clear to this reviewer how the cells have been gated, and how neutrophils have been identified etc.</p><p>Figure 6C: Technically, there is no effect on the GM population in these mice. While there is a clear trend, the authors really need to come up with additional data to test this likely difference, as this data made it into the title, and is the only functional difference they claim that lack of macrophages in fetal liver has on HSCs. An event that might be indirect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86493.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>The reviewers concluded that although the strength of the study lies in the characterization and categorization of distinct FL macrophages, and in the fate-mapping aspect, the conclusion that macrophages are regulating the hematopoietic stem cell niche and granulopoiesis is not well-supported by the data as presented.

Therefore, we performed a quite stringent analysis of the scRNA-seq data to exclude any other myeloid progenitors (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1).

Our fate-mapping of neutrophils shows that all of them are labelled by the Cxcr4-CreERT2 model but only half by the Ms4a3-Cre model. This suggests that the production of granulocytes/neutrophils is happening in at least 3 waves: 1. Yolk sac EMP-derived (labelled by Csf1r-MeriCreMer, see Gomez-Perdiguero et al., 2015, Nature), 2. Definitive HSC-derived (labelled by Ms4a3-Cre and Cxcr4-CreERT2) and 3. “Transient” HSC-derived (labelled only by Cxcr4-CreERT2). The latter hypothesis is supported by a recent paper stating that pre-HSPCs give rise to many progenitors in the E14.5 liver (Yokomizo et al. Nature 2022). However, due to the Ms4a3-Cre model we concluded that at least half of the neutrophils are LT-HSC derived. Furthermore, our new dataset showing the significant increase of neutrophils still being present at E18.5 strengthen the hypothesis that macrophages contribute to the granulopoiesis potential of LT-HSCs which are the major source of neutrophils at this time point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, some of the data could be more clearly presented.

The authors might add additional information to provide less complex information to the reader to allow for understanding of the overlap. As proteins will become central for staining of tissues, that information is critical.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation percentage depicted is indeed modest; however, it's notable given the few features utilized and the inherent complexity and disparate nature of gene and protein expression data. Achieving over 50% correlation is challenging under these circumstances. Our analysis framework was meticulously designed to accurately reflect the relationships between gene expression clusters and protein marker clusters A-G, despite these challenges. The achieved percentage, although not exceedingly high, is significant given the disparate nature of the data and the few features utilized in the analysis. This correlation, along with the robustness of our methodological approach, underscores the reliability of our findings in representing the macrophage populations within the fetal liver and their roles in the hematopoietic environment. To start with less complex information for the reader, the correlation matrix was newly scaled and moved to the Figure 1 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 is more like a supplementary figure rather than novel information in itself. It is an interesting analysis, but any data to test or further confirm this information is not provided. And, as the authors imply that the terms and interactions listed are functionally relevant rather than simply grouping determinants, again either show additional functional data to support the analysis or list them as very interesting supplementary material that await further experimental confirmation with respect to function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this Figure is characterizing the signatures of macrophage subpopulations in more detail without functional data. However, we believe that proving the functional importance of these paracrine factors, beyond the listed factors that have already been shown to be essential for LT-HSC function (see discussion), is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We aim at addressing this point in future studies. Nevertheless, we would not want this data to “disappear” into the supplements as macrophage-derived paracrine signals shown in the network are partially novel and may be interesting for the community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2D: In the analysis of potential ligand-receptor interactions, they use the term LT-HSC (line 254). However, the population for the receptors in Figure 2D is shown as CD150+CD48+, which doesn't represent the immunotypic CD150+CD48-LSK LT-HSC population described in the methods. What is the cell-type shown in these analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the mistake. In this figure, we have sorted (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1A) and analysed CD150+CD48-LSK LT-HSC</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: In general, as only the CD150 antibody is used to identify HSCs, the term HSCs for CD150+ cells is not correct. Progenitor and megakaryocytic cell populations are also CD150+. The high number of CD150+ cells in the diagram (Figure 3C) likely reflects this heterogeneity of the CD150+ cells, as there should be fewer HSCs. The term HSC/MPPs might be more correct here, which though then implies that data is not fully HSC centered. The authors might want to resolve that.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have now added CD41 into the CODEX panel and performed a new staining to distinguish between LT-HSCs and megakaryocytes/megakaryocyte progenitors using the Cxcr4-CreERT; Rosa26-YFP fate-mapping mice, which target definitive hematopoiesis, and thus also LT-HSCs. However, our quantification showed almost no CD150+ CD41+ double-positive cells (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2D, E). Together with the gating strategy shown to sort LT-HSCs form E15 livers in the study by Ghosn et al. 2016 (now cited in the respective section about CD41) we therefore concluded that cells identified by CD150 expression are mostly LT-HSCs. We have also included a paragraph on the fact that fetal HSC/MPP may be different in terms of their surface expression markers and the differentiation potential seen in adult bone marrow (lines 527-529).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please also provide readable scale bars for the histology images. In Figure 3B, please also show the SMA (vessel) staining in the enlargements.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide scale bars for all histology images, lengths are indicated in the figures and/or the legends. SMA was added in Figure 3B (now Figure 4B)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The images in Figure 3E are difficult to follow, but are central to the publication, as they investigate the special relationship between macrophages from the clusters and HSCs. CD150 is in black? What is white? It looks like that some of the HSCs are F4/80 positive? HSCs are much larger than macrophages and multinucleated? So it remains not clear whether what is identified as HSCs is indeed HSCs or what is what. Macrophages identified in Figure 3 look different from the ones identified in S3C? The authors might want to really clarify these questions and also support their claims with additional new data.</p></disp-quote><p>To improve the data of macrophage-HSC interaction we have performed 3D reconstructions and quantified the distance of CD150+ and Iba1+ cells in 3D (new Figure 3C-E) as the thin cryosectioning used for CODEX is not suitable to reconstruct these interactions properly (see also lines 328-331). Thus, Figure 3E was not able and also not meant to represent data shown in Figure 3F (now Figure 4E and 4F). Figure 3E is just meant to show examples of all clusters sitting in proximity to CD150+ HSCs. Black font (CD150) is indicating the white signal, we added this information in the legend. Since the CODEX images are too large to image them on a confocal microscope, co-localization of signals indicates a clear neighbourhood of cells.</p><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means with “Macrophages identified in Figure 3 look different from the ones identified in S3C”. In Figure S3C (now Figure 4 —figure supplement 1) we moved to a region of the liver with many Ter119+ cells, which are densely packed and where Ter119+ cells surrounding macrophages. This is likely why the appearance changes from the representations shown in Figure 3 (now Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And, would it be possible to stain for cluster A-D in one single staining, to see the extent of overlap/exclusivity?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show co-stainings for each combination of the clusters (CD169/CD106/CD206/Ter119) in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2C with most of the clusters showing only little overlap (Pearson correlation &lt;0.3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The image for cluster C is likely not representative as the frequency of HSCs is similar to cluster A,B and D, but according to the claims there should be more HSCs. But see also comment on Figure 3F below.</p><p>If Figure 3F is interpreted correctly, most of the HSCs analyzed do not have a cell from the cluster close by. That would mean that most HSCs in the fetal liver are not surrounded by macrophages from cluster A-D. That would also mean that likely the niche function of macrophages for HSCs in the fetal liver is rather limited, which would align with the finding that specifically depleting macrophages in the fetal liver (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if we did not represent the data in a way that allowed clear interpretation. We tried to address this point in the previous manuscript: “Of note, the tissue analysed via CODEX represents only cellular neighbourhoods in X and Y due to the thin sectioning technique (5 μm) and, thus, does not take neighbouring cells in the Z plane into account. This leads to an underestimation of macrophage-HSC interactions, as indicated by F4/80+ filopodia extending towards CD150+ cells in almost all cases (Figure 3E).” Furthermore, there are many more macrophages in the tissue than HSCs so that we would not expect a certain population to be interacting with more than one CD150+ cell.</p><p>We have now addressed this limitation that is inherent to CODEX technology by analysing whole mount stainings of fetal livers. We show that indeed most CD150+ HSCs are within a ~1.4-1.8µm radius of Iba1+ macrophages and that this distance is significantly shorter than for any other random cell (new Figure 3C-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure legend 3A: please add Iba1. Also, change the order of the row descriptions or the images.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Iba1 and changed the order as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The depletion of macrophages (Figure 4B), which are highly abundant in FL tissue (Figure 3B,C) do not lead to changes in tissue architecture (HE experiments, Figure 4D) or why is there a reduction in overall cell number, but not in CD45+ cells? That is somewhat surprising, as this reviewer might actually expect a consequence upon deletion that is larger than a reduction of enucleated erythrocytes from 70 to 50%. How do the authors explain that?</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm that there are no big cellular changes beyond the lack of macrophages, as suggested by the HE stainings, we analysed more fetal livers from both genotypes. We do not expect that the overall structure of the liver would change due to the lack of approx. 250.0000 macrophages (See Figure 5A and 7C) that measure via flow cytometry. The changes of enuclated erythroblasts have been analysed in the blood, while the data in Figure 4B-E (now Figure 5B-E) are showing fetal livers. We have clarified that now in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the longer-term (development) consequence of Tnfrsf11a driven deletion of Spi1 positive cells? Is there any?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now also analysed E16.5 and E18.5 fetal livers from Tnfrsf11a-Cre X Spi1fl/fl embryos.

The authors might at least comment on that in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point, and we agree that there has not been a systematic analysis addressing the potential of HCS/MPPs in the fetal liver. We added this point in the discussion (lines 527-532).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There seems to be an upregulation of genes linked to myeloid cell differentiation in KO cells. Were any genes associated with lymphoid differentiation also affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed identified a set of genes associated with lymphocyte differentiation that were upregulated in our study. Among them some have been already studied for their role in lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation.

Therefore, with the need of lengthy sorting to isolate macrophage subpopulations, we decided initially not to perform co-culture experiments since the impact of the subpopulations could not be addressed by this experiment in our opinion. Instead, we aimed at defining macrophages as an essential LT-HSC niche cell in the first place. Future experiments knocking out specific paracrine factors stemming from distinct macrophages populations will inform on the impact of these populations on LT-HSC functionality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6B.
