ninefold symmetric blade-like structures attached to the distal end of the mother centriole. These structures are critical for the formation of the primary cilium, by regulating at least four critical steps: preciliary vesicle recruitment, recruitment and initiation of intraflagellar transport (IFT), and removal of CP110. While specific proteins that localize to the distal appendages have been identified, how exactly each protein functions to achieve the multiple roles of the distal appendages is poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively analyze known and newly discovered distal appendage proteins (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, TTBK2, FBF1, CEP89, KIZ, ANKRD26, PIDD1, LRRC45, NCS1, CEP15) for their precise localization, order of recruitment, and their roles in each step of cilia formation. Using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we show that the order of the recruitment of the distal appendage proteins is highly interconnected and a more complex hierarchy. Our analysis highlights two protein modules, CEP83-SCLT1 and CEP164-TTBK2, as critical for structural assembly of distal appendages. Functional assays revealed that CEP89 selectively functions in the RAB34<sup>+</sup> vesicle recruitment, while deletion of the integral components, CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2, severely compromised all four steps of cilium formation. Collectively, our analyses provide a more comprehensive view of the organization and the function of the distal appendage, paving the way for molecular understanding of ciliary assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>distal appendage</kwd><kwd>ciliogenesis</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>super-resolution microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanie</surname><given-names>Tomoharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM151013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanie</surname><given-names>Tomoharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM134187</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustavsson</surname><given-names>Anna-Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C-2064-20210327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustavsson</surname><given-names>Anna-Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR200025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustavsson</surname><given-names>Anna-Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM155365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustavsson</surname><given-names>Anna-Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comprehensive analyses of localization, hierarchy, and function of the proteins located at the distal appendages of the centriole.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary cilium is an organelle that extends from the cell surface and consists of the ninefold microtubule-based structure (or axoneme) and the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). With specific membrane proteins (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors) accumulated on its membrane, the cilium serves as a sensor for the extracellular environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Biogenesis of the cilium is coupled to the cell cycle, such that the cilium mainly forms during G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and disassembles prior to mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vorobjev and Chentsov Yu, 1982</xref>). In G0/G1 phase, the cilium extends from the mother (or older) centriole, which is distinguished from the daughter (or younger) centriole by its possession of the two centriolar substructures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vorobjev and Chentsov Yu, 1982</xref>): distal appendages and subdistal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). The distal appendages are ninefold symmetrical blade-like structures with each blade attaching to the triplet microtubules at the distal end of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). Unlike subdistal appendages, which appear to be dispensable for the cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>), the distal appendages play crucial roles in the cilium biogenesis, through their regulation of at least four different molecular steps of the cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>): (1) ciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>), (2) recruitment of intra-flagellar transport (IFT) protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), (3) recruitment of CEP19-RABL2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dateyama et al., 2019</xref>), which is critical for IFT initiation at the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanie et al., 2017</xref>), and (4) removal of CP110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), which is believed to suppress axonemal microtubule extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>), from the distal end of the mother centriole. However, how the distal appendages modulate these molecular processes is poorly understood.</p><p>To date, ten proteins have been shown to localize to the distal appendages: CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graser et al., 2007</xref>), CEP89 (also known as CCDC123) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sillibourne et al., 2011</xref>), CEP83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), SCLT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), FBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>), INPP5E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), LRRC45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtulmus et al., 2018</xref>), ANKRD26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>), and PIDD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). These proteins are recruited to the distal appendages in hierarchical order, where CEP83 sits at the top of the hierarchy and recruits SCLT1 and CEP89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). SCLT1 recruits CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), ANKRD26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>), and LRRC45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtulmus et al., 2018</xref>). CEP164 recruits TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>). How exactly these proteins function to organize the multiple roles of the distal appendage remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Here, we identify three more distal appendage proteins (KIZ, NCS1, and CEP15). CEP15 was previously named as C3ORF14, and we renamed it to CEP15 to reflect its function. The last two will be described in an accompanying paper. With this new set of distal appendage proteins, we sought to provide a comprehensive view of the structure, including precise localization, order of recruitment, and functional role of each distal appendage protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Localization map of the new set of the distal appendage proteins</title><p>Recently, two independent studies determined the precise localization of the classical distal appendage proteins (CEP164, CEP83, SCLT1, FBF1, CEP89, TTBK2, and ANKRD26) using Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We first sought to update the localization map with the new set of distal appendage proteins using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. While the lateral (xy) resolution of 3D-SIM is inferior to that of STORM, the flexibility of fluorophore selection and sample preparation for multi-color imaging by 3D-SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valli et al., 2021</xref>) allows us to easily locate target proteins relative to multiple centriolar markers. Using 3D-SIM, we performed three-color imaging to determine the localization of each distal appendage protein relative to CEP170, a marker for the subdistal appendage and the proximal end of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the well-characterized distal appendage protein, CEP164, as references (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Differential localization of each distal appendage protein relative to CEP164 was readily observed in either top (or axial) view or side (or lateral) view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As an example, the localization of FBF1, which was positioned between adjacent CEP164 structures seen in the axial view of the published STORM picture (which the authors thus identified FBF1 as a distal appendage matrix protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), was also recapitulated in our SIM image (see FBF1 top view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We also observed localization of CEP89 near the subdistal appendage in addition to its distal appendage localization (CEP89 side view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Although localization of the classical distal appendage proteins was essentially the same as that shown by two-color direct STORM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), there was one notable difference. CEP83 was shown to localize to the innermost position of the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We recapitulated this localization (see CEP83 inner ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with the antibody used in the previous two papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), which recognizes the C-terminal region of CEP83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The peak-to-peak diameter of the inner CEP83 ring (308.6Â±4.9 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) was comparable to the previous report (313Â±20 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). However, when we detected this protein with the antibody that detects the middle part of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), we observed the ring located at the outermost part of the distal appendage with the diameter of 513.4Â±9.0 nm (see CEP83 outer ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Both antibodies recognized the specific band at 80â110 kDa that is lost in the <italic>CEP83</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). One intriguing explanation for the difference in the ring diameter is that the protein might have an extended configuration that spans 100 nm (the difference in radius between inner and outer ring) in length. Human CEP83 protein (Q9Y592) is predicted to contain two conserved coiled-coil domains, one of which may span between 40â633 amino acids. Examination of the AlphaFold model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) of CEP83 shows a consistent highly extended alpha-helical structure, conserved among most species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the model of CEP83 as a highly extended molecule. Since one alpha helix contains 3.6 residues with a distance of 0.15 nm per amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pauling et al., 1951</xref>) and contour length of an amino acid is around 0.4 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ainavarapu et al., 2007</xref>), 400 amino acids stretch of coiled-coil domain as well as a disordered region that consists of 40 amino acids (the maximum distance between antigens of the two CEP83 antibodies) could contribute at least 76 nm. Since the length of immunoglobulin G (IgG) is ~8 nm (see Figure 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan et al., 2008</xref>), the primary and secondary antibodies at the two edges could contribute another ~30 nm. The summed contribution from CEP83 and antibodies could readily account for the ~100 nm difference in radius between the two rings, deriving from the extended structure of CEP83. This model, wherein CEP83 forms an extended backbone scaffolding the distal appendage, is attractive given that CEP83 is important for localization of all the other distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>) to different positions along the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Another explanation is that the two antibodies might detect different CEP83 isoforms. We think this is less likely because we detect a single band that is lost in <italic>CEP83</italic> knockouts using the two different antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). We could also not identify different isoforms of CEP83 with similar size in the Uniprot protein database. To further support our hypothesis, we tagged Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of CEP83, and compared the relative position to CEP164 as well as the diameter of the two proteins. Consistent with the endogenous CEP83 detected with the antibody that recognizes C-terminus of the protein, GFP fused to the C-terminus of CEP83 (CEP83-GFP) localized to more inward and more basal centriolar position than CEP164 with the peak-to-peak diameter of 339.7Â±18.4 nm, when the GFP was detected by antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4AâB</xref>). GFP attached to the N-terminus of CEP83 (GFP-CEP83) was located at the similar position to CEP164 with the diameter of 425.5Â±17.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4CâD</xref>). Note that GFP-CEP83 ring was smaller than the outermost ring of endogenous CEP83, possibly because the difference between N-terminus and the region detected by antibody (somewhere between a.a. 226â568 of the CEP83 isoform 2). We observed the same trend when we detected the tagged proteins with native GFP fluorescent signal instead of antibody, while the difference between GFP-CEP83 and CEP83-GFP was less pronounced possibly due to lower fluorescent signal, which could alter image fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demmerle et al., 2017</xref>) as well as inaccurate measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4EâH</xref>). Nonetheless, these data support the model wherein CEP83 forms an extended structure that spans the innermost to the outermost region of the distal appendages to serve as a molecular scaffold. For the recently identified distal appendage protein, PIDD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>), we observe a ring with a similar diameter to CEP164 but that was displaced distally in the side view (see PIDD1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This localization is consistent with the localization of its functional partner ANKRD26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). KIZ (or Kizuna) was localized to the similar position to ANKRD26-PIDD1. LRRC45 was located at the innermost region of the distal appendage with the smallest ring diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This localization is similar to that of the inner ring of CEP83. INPP5E was reported to localize to the distal appendage in the cells grown with serum and redistribute to the cilium once cells form the organelle upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). This localization is also supported by the physical interaction between INPP5E and the distal appendage protein, CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humbert et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, we observed the INPP5E signal around the distal appendage protein CEP164 in cells grown with serum, however, we rarely observed a ninefold ring (INPP5E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), typically observed with all other distal appendage proteins. Therefore, we were unable to measure the diameter of the ring formed by INPP5E. From this result, we think INPP5E is at least not a stable component of distal appendages and instead transiently localizes around the distal appendage. This localization pattern is similar to what was observed for ARL13B (see Figure 4A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Localization of the novel distal appendage proteins, NCS1 and CEP15, are described in an accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>), but the predicted location and their diameter are shown here for convenience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping the localization of the distal appendage proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells grown to confluent in FBS-containing media were fixed without serum starvation (for INPP5E), or after the serum starvation for 30 hr (CEP83) or 24 hr (all others).

Consistent with its function in ciliogenesis, we observed enhanced centriolar localization of IFT88, which requires CEP164 and TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), upon serum removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5C</xref>). Localization of one set of the distal appendage proteins (outer ring of CEP83, TTBK2, KIZ, PIDD1, and CEP89) were significantly enhanced following the serum starvation, whereas another set of distal appendage proteins (FBF1, ANKRD26, CEP164, and LRRC45) were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). SCLT1 was the only protein that decreased its centrosomal signal upon serum deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Updating the hierarchical map of distal appendage proteins</title><p>Distal appendage proteins are recruited to their precise location in a hierarchical order. The previous work described the order of recruitment with a simple epistatic organization, where CEP83 recruits CEP89 and SCLT1, which in turn recruits CEP164 and FBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). With the updated set of distal appendage proteins, we sought to refine the hierarchical map of the distal appendage proteins. Notably, the original epistasis pathway using siRNA knockdowns for loss of function may fail to identify some strong requirements if limited amounts of protein are sufficient for pathway function. To this end, we generated CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout cells for each distal appendage protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1A and B</xref>). We then tested the localization of each distal appendage protein in each knockout cells via immunofluorescence microscopy. We combined conventional micrographs with semi-automated measurement of centrosomal signal intensity to more accurately quantify the loss of localization of the proteins (see Materials and Methods). In most cases, the centrosomal signal of distal appendage proteins were barely or not detected in their respective knockout cells (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, G, I</xref>), confirming that the antibodies detect specific proteins and that the semi-automated intensity measurement was working properly. In some cases, signal was detected even in the respective knockout cells, because of the high signal observed outside of the centrosome (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which likely results from non-specific staining of the antibodies. Centriolar FBF1 signal looked specific as it is almost completely lost in <italic>CEP83</italic> knockout cells, however, a weak signal of FBF1 was detected in <italic>FBF1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Since both two <italic>FBF1</italic> knockout clones had one nucleotide insertion in both alleles between coding DNA 151 and 152 (151_152insT) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1B</xref>), which results in a premature stop codon at the codon 61, we assumed that the knockout cells express truncated protein via either alternative translation or alternative splicing. We could not confirm the truncated protein because of the lack of an antibody that works well for immunoblotting, and currently do not know the functional significance of the truncated proteins. Nonetheless, our semi-automated workflow provides objective and quantitative data to generate an accurate hierarchical map of the distal appendage proteins. Consistent with the original study mapping new distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), the centrosomal signal intensity of all the knockout cells were greatly diminished in <italic>CEP83</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâK</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>), confirming that CEP83 is the most upstream. SCLT1 depletion also showed substantial loss of localization of all the other distal appendage proteins, including CEP83 and CEP89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâC</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that CEP83 and SCLT1 organize the distal appendage structure in a co-dependent manner. This is consistent with the previous electron micrograph showing the absence of visible distal appendages in <italic>SCLT1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells (Figure 7B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Note that the <italic>SCLT1</italic> knockout affected the localization of the outer ring of CEP83 much more strongly than the inner ring population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed a much stronger effect of <italic>SCLT1</italic> knockouts than the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), which used siRNA to deplete SCLT1, likely because of the complete absence of the protein in our knockout system. Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>), TTBK2 localization at the distal appendage was largely dependent on CEP164, as the TTBK2 signal in <italic>CEP164</italic> knockout cells was at an undetectable level similar to <italic>TTBK2</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Downstream of CEP164, <italic>TTBK2</italic> knockout affected localization of CEP164, the outer ring CEP83, FBF1, ANKRD26, PIDD1, and NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). Loss of NCS1 localization in <italic>TTBK2</italic> knockout cells is addressed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> an accompanying paper (see Figure 2âfigure supplement 4D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> an accompanying paper). The decrease of CEP164 intensity in <italic>TTBK2</italic> knockout cells is consistent with the observation that CEP164 is a substrate of TTBK2 and that centriolar CEP164 localization was markedly increased upon overexpression of wild type but not kinase-dead TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, localization of another TTBK2 substrate, CEP83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernatik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lo et al., 2019</xref>), was also affected by TTBK2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since only the outer ring of CEP83 was affected by <italic>TTBK2</italic> knockout, we predict that CEP83 phosphorylation by TTBK2 induces a conformational change of CEP83 enabling the protein to organize the backbone of the distal appendage. The localization changes of FBF1, ANKRD26, PIDD1, and NCS1 also suggest that these proteins may be potential substrates of TTBK2, or the localization of these proteins may be affected by phosphorylation of CEP83 or CEP164. In any case, the effect of TTBK2 depletion emphasizes that CEP164-TTBK2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>) organizes a positive feedback loop for other distal appendage proteins to maintain the structural integrity of the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). Interestingly, ANKRD26 depletion drastically affected not only its functional partner, PIDD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), but also the outer ring of CEP83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This might suggest that ANKRD26 may be crucial for maintaining the protein structure of CEP83 at the outer part of the distal appendages. The diminished CEP164 level in <italic>ANKRD26</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) might be explained by its direct effect or an indirect effect through the outer ring of CEP83. In contrast to a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtulmus et al., 2018</xref>), we did not see the effect of LRRC45 on FBF1 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This difference might come from the difference in the experimental setting (e.g. siRNA versus knockout). The signal intensity of a marker of the subdistal appendage, CEP170, was not affected by any of the distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) suggesting that distal appendage proteins are not required for the localization of subdistal appendage proteins at least in terms of signal intensity. The localization changes were mostly not due to the changes in the expression level except that protein KIZ was highly destabilized in <italic>SCLT1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig"

The most well-established function of the distal appendages is recruitment of the preciliary vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), a precursor for the ciliary membrane, at the early stage of the cilium biogenesis. The recruited ciliary vesicles, called the distal appendage vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), then fuse to form a larger ciliary vesicle through mechanisms organized by the Eps15 Homology Domain Protein 1 (EHD1) and Protein kinase C and Casein kinase 2 Substrate in Neurons (PACSIN1 and 2) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Insinna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Classically, the method to analyze preciliary vesicle recruitment to the distal appendage was elaborate electron microscopy analysis, largely due to the lack of a preciliary or distal appendage vesicle marker. Recently, an unconventional actin-dependent motor protein, Myosin Va (MYO5A), was discovered as the earliest marker for the preciliary/distal appendage vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). EHD1 is then recruited to the MYO5A-positive vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) to promote fusion and extension of the vesicles. However, MYO5A did not appear to be the best marker for the vesicle, because MYO5A also regulates multiple vesicle trafficking pathways including melanosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 1998</xref>) and transport of the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). In agreement with the role of MYO5A outside the cilium, mutations in MYO5A cause Griscelli syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastural et al., 1997</xref>), characterized by hypopigmentation, neurological impairment, and hypotonia, characteristics distinct from other ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). The albinism is likely due to the defect in melanosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pan et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Westbroek et al., 2003</xref>) rather than dysfunction of the cilium. When we performed immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed a single punctum of MYO5A that colocalizes with the centrosomal marker CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). We also observe strong MYO5A staining surrounding the centrosome (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

A recent paper suggested that the small GTPase RAB34, localizes to the centriole-associated vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>) and is important for preciliary vesicle recruitment/formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>) or for fusion of the distal appendage vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>). We first tested whether RAB34 works as the early vesicle marker by staining RPE cells with RAB34, MYO5A, and a centriole marker, CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that MYO5A and RAB34 localization are highly coupled. Most RAB34-positive centrioles have MYO5A at the centriole and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We confirmed the specificity of the signal using RAB34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and <italic>MYO5A</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Note that the percentage of RAB34 and MYO5A double positive centrioles was highest in the confluent cells grown with serum and was decreased upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We did not see the difference in the percentage of RAB34 positive centrioles between cells grown to 40â50% confluency (subconfluent) and 100% confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), confirming that the presence of RAB34 positive centrioles is not due to the confluency. The presence of the ciliary vesicle at the centriole before induction of cilium formation is consistent with the previous electron microscopy study (Figure 5D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Insinna et al., 2019</xref>). Vesicular fusion regulators, EHD1 and PACSIN2, were recruited to the centrosome at later time points after serum withdrawal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2BâH</xref>), confirming that both MYO5A and RAB34 are the earliest markers of the centriole-associated vesicle (likely the distal appendage vesicle) to date. Importantly, and in contrast to MYO5A, RAB34 did not localize to the pericentriolar region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This makes RAB34 a more suitable vesicle marker to assess preciliary vesicle recruitment at the distal appendages. Consistent with this, <italic>Rab34</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit polydactyly and cleft palate as well as perinatal lethality, phenotypes reminiscent of cilia defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). This further supports a cilia-specific function of RAB34. In the 3D-SIM images, RAB34 localization was distal to CEP164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and was displaced inwardly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3F</xref>). This is reminiscent of the relative positioning between the vesicle and the distal appendages seen in electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Insinna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). The shape of RAB34 positive vesicles were highly variable even before the cilium formation was induced by serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3GâJ</xref>). We also confirmed colocalization of MYO5A and RAB34 in 3D-SIM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3BâE</xref>). To more precisely define the position of RAB34 in relation to MYO5A and to the mother centriole, we turned to two-color 3D single-molecule super-resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gustavsson et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gustavsson et al., 2018b</xref>). This data showed that the MYO5A distribution was located at the edge of the RAB34 distribution on the vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3HâK</xref>), with a 3D separation between the center of masses of the distributions of 89 nm and 67 nm in samples 1 and 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We confirmed that the alternate localization of RAB34 and MYO5A is not due to channel registration by checking the complete colocalization of FOP between the two channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplement 5</xref>). We further confirmed this by testing colocalization of RAB34 stained with the two different secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) and CF568 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>). The sizes of the RAB34 distributions, reflecting the measure of vesicle sizes, were found to be 230 nm x 170 nm x 190 nm for sample 1 and 190 nm Ã 170 nm Ã 250 nm for sample 2 reported as the 1/e<sup>2</sup> of Gaussian fits of these distributions.</p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that RAB34 is a more specific marker for the centriole-associated vesicle (likely the distal appendage vesicle) than MYO5A and is located at a distinct position from MYO5A on the vesicle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Distal appendages independently regulate branched steps required for cilium formation</title><p>Distal appendages can minimally regulate four steps required for cilium formation: preciliary vesicle recruitment, IFT recruitment to the basal body, IFT initiation by recruiting CEP19-RABL2, and CP110 removal. We currently do not know whether these steps are independently regulated by distal appendages or are interconnected, so that the failure of one step may interrupt the subsequent steps of the cilium formation. In the latter case, only one of the four steps may be directly regulated by the distal appendages. To test this possibility, we inhibited one step at a time and tested if other steps are affected. To inhibit preciliary vesicle recruitment, we depleted RAB34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), which was shown to inhibit formation/recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>) or fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>) of the preciliary/distal appendage vesicle. In contrast to MYO5A depletion, which did not affect ciliogenesis, depletion of RAB34 significantly inhibited the formation of the cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oguchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>).

This suggests that RAB34 is important for initial recruitment/formation of the vesicle, in agreement with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Whether RAB34 is also involved in the fusion of the vesicle at the later time point after serum starvation, as shown by the other report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>), warrants further investigation. Using <italic>RAB34</italic> knockout cells, we tested whether disrupting the preciliary vesicle recruitment/formation affects the other steps of the cilium formation. Removal of CP110 from the mother centriole was modestly affected in <italic>RAB34</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas IFT and CEP19 recruitment was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>), suggesting that preciliary vesicle recruitment is partially important to trigger CP110 removal. This result is inconsistent with two other studies, which showed no effect on CP110 removal in <italic>RAB34</italic> knockouts, potentially because of the difference in the duration of serum starvation (24 hrin our study versus 48 hr in the other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>). We next tested whether recruitment of CEP19 or IFT affects preciliary vesicle recruitment. Note that CEP19 and IFT complex proteins localize to a compartment slightly below the distal appendage in the cells grown with serum, which infrequently show primary cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5B</xref>), while their localization is strongly enhanced upon serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanie et al., 2017</xref>). To eliminate the IFT complexes or CEP19 from the mother centriole, we depleted either IFT52, a central component of the IFT-B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taschner et al., 2014</xref>), or FGFR1OP (or FOP), which is required for centriolar localization of both IFT proteins and CEP19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanie et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, IFT52 depletion greatly diminished the localization of all the other IFT complex proteins tested and thus inhibited the cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâH</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2AâE</xref>). Similarly, FOP depletion abrogated the localization of CEP19 and IFT88 as well as cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Depletion of neither FOP nor IFT52 disrupted the preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), suggesting that preciliary vesicle recruitment can proceed independently of the IFT-CEP19 pathway. We currently do not know why the number of the vesicle-positive centrioles was increased in <italic>FOP</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). In summary, our data suggest that distal appendages independently regulate preciliary vesicle and IFT; CEP19 recruitment, whereas CP110 removal is partially downstream of preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CEP89 functions specifically in preciliary vesicle recruitment</title><p>We next sought to determine the function of each distal appendage protein. We first tested which distal appendage proteins play a role in cilium formation. The depletion of each component that is important for structural integrity of distal appendages (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, TTBK2) severely disrupted the cilium formation in either 24- or 48 hr serum-starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). FBF1, CEP89, and ANKRD26 modestly affected cilium formation at 24 hr after serum removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but the ciliation defect in the knockout cells were ameliorated by prolonged incubation (48 hr) following serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that these proteins are important for cilium formation, but that cells can compensate for the lack of these proteins and slowly catch up to form primary cilia. The distal appendage protein KIZ and LRRC45, as well as the distal appendage-associated protein, INPP5E, had no effect on cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Ciliary length was mildly affected in <italic>FBF1</italic> and <italic>INPP5E</italic> knockout cells at the earlier time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Shorter ciliary length was observed in <italic>ANKRD26</italic> knockout cells serum starved for either 24 or 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, ARL13B signal intensity inside the cilium was diminished in <italic>FBF1</italic>, <italic>CEP89</italic>, or <italic>ANKRD26</italic> knockout cells even after the cells largely caught up on cilium formation after 48 hr of serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This suggests that these knockouts can slowly form cilia, but the slowly formed cilia may not be functionally normal. The stronger defect in ciliary ARL13B signal in ANKRD26 might suggest a direct role of this protein in ARL13B recruitment around the distal appendages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Functional analysis of distal appendage proteins reveals CEP89 as a protein important for preciliary vesicle recruitment.</title><p>(<bold>AâB</bold>) Cilium formation assay in control (sgGFP) and indicated knockout retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells serum starved for 24 hr (<bold>A</bold>) or 48 hr (<bold>B</bold>).

Consistent with their critical role in the structural integrity of the distal appendages, CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, and TTBK2 severely disrupted preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, CEP89 but not the other distal appendage proteins modestly but significantly affected preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The importance of CEP89 in preciliary vesicle recruitment is largely consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>). CP110 removal was again severely affected in knockouts of the four integral components of the distal appendages (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, and TTBK2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). CEP89 depletion partially inhibited CP110 removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), correlating with the partial effect on preciliary vesicle recruitment, which is upstream of CP110 removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). IFT88 recruitment was severely disturbed in the knockouts of the four integral components (CEP83, SCLT1, CEP164, and TTBK2), but not in the other knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The effect of CEP164 or TTBK2 was slightly stronger than CEP83 or SCLT1, suggesting that CEP164 and TTBK2 may be more directly involved in this process.</p><p>CEP19 recruitment was strongly dependent on CEP164-TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), but was only mildly affected by CEP83-SCLT1, which recruit CEP164 to the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and N</xref>). This indicates that a very small amount of centriolar CEP164-TTBK2 may be sufficient to bring CEP19 near the distal appendage, and that CEP164-TTBK2, rather than CEP83-SCLT1, more directly regulates CEP19 recruitment.</p><p>In summary, the CEP83-SCLT1 structural module brings CEP164-TTBK2 to stabilize the distal appendages, and the CEP164-TTBK2 complex plays a more direct role in the cilium formation by regulating downstream processes including preciliary vesicle recruitment, IFT; CEP19 recruitment, and CP110 removal. In contrast, CEP89 is dispensable for structural integrity of the distal appendages, but it instead plays a crucial role in the preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of the function of the distal appendage proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CEP83 appears to form an extended structure that spans from the innermost region to the outermost region of the distal appendage to serve as a scaffold for the other distal appendages. SCLT1 stabilizes CEP83 especially at the outer region of the protein, and the CEP83-SCLT1 module recruits all the other distal appendage proteins. TTBK2 together with its upstream protein, CEP164, confers structural integrity to the distal appendage by stabilizing outer region of CEP83, and the other downstream proteins (ANKRD26, FBF1, and NCS1). The efficient localization of CEP164 to the distal appendage also requires TTBK2. ANKRD26 plays an important role in maintaining stability of outer region of CEP83, and recruits PIDD1. Kizuna (KIZ) is recruited to the distal appendage likely via direct interaction with SCLT1, as SCLT1 strongly affects protein stability of KIZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). LRRC45 is recruited to the innermost region of the distal appendage. The distal appendage is indispensable for cilium biogenesis by independently regulating IFT recruitment, CEP19 recruitment, CP110 removal, and preciliary vesicle recruitment, while the CP110 removal is partially downstream of preciliary vesicle recruitment. The CEP164-TTBK2 module may be the most critical regulator of these processes. The CEP89-CEP15-NCS1 module is recruited to the inner region of the distal appendage and is primarily important for the recruitment of the preciliary vesicle (described in greater detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> the accompanying paper).

While their anatomical structure was described in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Brenner, 1971</xref>), the first component, CEP164, was only found in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graser et al., 2007</xref>). Since then, the list of distal appendage proteins has grown and the detailed protein architecture has been visualized by super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, our understanding of the function of each distal appendage protein is limited.</p><p>In this study, we sought to comprehensively characterize previously known and newly identified distal appendage proteins (KIZ, NCS1, and CEP15) to deepen our understanding of the distal appendages. Among the three proteins that we identified, the last two factors will be described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> an accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). A diagram summarizing the findings of our comprehensive analyses is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The structure of the distal appendages</title><p>The distal appendages consist of twelve proteins identified so far. Each protein localizes to a different positions at the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, our current study revealed that CEP83, previously shown to locate at the innermost region of the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), localize to the outermost region of the distal appendages when detected by antibodies that recognize a different epitope of CEP83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The further analyses using N-terminally and C-terminally GFP tagged CEP83 revealed that they localize to different position at the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that CEP83 has an extended structure that stretches the entire length of each blade of the distal appendages. This model is quite intriguing given that CEP83 is important for the localization of all the other distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and its predicted structure, an extended alpha helix, would provide a perfect template to arrange components along the long axis of the distal appendage. The distal appendages may consist of stack of macromolecular complexes, each of which span the entire length of the structure. The model is also consistent with the previous observation, where C-terminal region of CEP164 locates closely at the wall of centriole and N-terminal part of the protein is spread to cover a wide region of the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, confirmation of this model needs additional investigation by crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy/tomography. SCLT1 localizes to the upper middle part of the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and was required for the localization of all the other distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>). SCLT1 also stabilizes CEP83, particularly at the outer region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that CEP83-SCLT1 module works as a structural backbone of the distal appendages. Downstream of CEP83-SCLT1, we showed that CEP164-TTBK2 complex plays an important role in maintaining the distal appendage structure. Loss of TTBK2 resulted in the decrease in the localization of several distal appendage proteins, including the most upstream CEP83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M and N</xref>). This is consistent with the previous finding that TTBK2 phosphorylates distal appendage proteins, such as CEP83 and CEP89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernatik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lo et al., 2019</xref>). Further investigations are needed to assess whether other distal appendage proteins are also phosphorylated by TTBK2 and how the phosphorylation affects the structure and function of the substrates. ANKRD26 also affected the localization of several distal appendage proteins, including the outer ring of CEP83 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, M and N</xref>). These results emphasize that a set of proteins work together to organize the structure of distal appendages. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we created a new hierarchical model of the distal appendage proteins, which is mostly consistent with the previously established model but has a number of modifications. Most of the discrepancies likely come from the differences between siRNA and CRISPR techniques. While CRISPR knockout lines may show genetic compensation, the overall consistency of our results with the previous CRISPR and siRNA results, in some cases showing only quantitative differences, do not suggest that genetic compensation is a major problem.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The function of the distal appendages</title><p>Distal appendages are indispensable for cilium formation through regulation of at least four steps required for ciliogenesis: preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), recruitment of IFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>) and CEP19-RABL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dateyama et al., 2019</xref>), and CP110 removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>). Our functional analyses revealed that all the four steps were almost completely disrupted when each of the four critical proteins (CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2) was depleted. This result might simply come from disorganization of the distal appendages, or those four proteins may be directly involved in the four ciliogenic processes. Since the IFT/CEP19 recruitment defect was milder in <italic>CEP83</italic>/<italic>SCLT1</italic> knockouts than <italic>CEP164</italic>/<italic>TTBK2</italic> knockouts, we predict that CEP164-TTBK2 complex may play more direct roles in the IFT/CEP19 recruitment. CajÃ¡nek and Nigg created a chimeric protein that consists of the distal appendage targeting region of CEP164 and the kinase domain of TTBK2. Intriguingly, this chimera was sufficient to almost fully rescue the ciliation defect of CEP164-depleted cells (Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>), suggesting that the main function of CEP164 is recruitment of TTBK2 to the distal appendages. Since the kinase activity of TTBK2 is critical for cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ÄajÃ¡nek and Nigg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>), testing whether IFT complex proteins, CEP19, or their association partners (e.g. FGFR1OP) are phosphorylation targets of TTBK2 warrant future studies.</p><p>Our study also revealed CEP89 as a protein important for preciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other processes of cilium formation. Given that CEP89 consists of two coiled-coil domains but lacks a membrane association domain, we hypothesized that CEP89 is involved in the preciliary vesicle recruitment via its interacting partner. Indeed, our further analysis revealed that Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) interacts with CEP89 and is recruited to the distal appendages by CEP89. NCS1 then captures preciliary vesicles via its myristoylation motif. This story will be described in an accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their critical functions in cilium formation, the distal appendages seem to play important roles in other biological processes. Recent studies showed that the activation of PIDD1 requires recruitment of the protein to the distal appendages by ANKRD26. The activated PIDD1 forms a complex, called PIDDsome, with CASP2 and CRADD. The PIDDsome then cleaves MDM2 and stabilizes p53 to inhibit proliferation in response to deleterious centrosomal amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burigotto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). ANKRD26 apparently has a dual function: cilia-related (stabilization of the outer ring of CEP83 and controlling ciliogenesis possibly via ARL13B regulation) and cilia-independent function (PIDD1 activation). It is currently unclear why PIDD1 activation occurs at the distal appendage. Nevertheless, it is possible that other distal appendage proteins may be involved in this process. It is also possible that distal appendages may be involved in yet unknown biological function.</p><p>Another possible role of the distal appendages is the regulation of the ciliary membrane protein composition. While there is no direct analysis, several lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, distal appendages are located at the position where the mother centrioles attach to the plasma membrane, making it a strong candidate that modulates the composition of the ciliary membrane. Second, our current study showed that several distal appendage proteins have only modest or no effect on cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), but some of them are connected to ciliopathies (e.g. KIZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Shamieh et al., 2014</xref>) and ANKRD26 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acs et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, the previous study showed that the ciliary G-protein coupled receptor, GPR161, is detained for a short period of time in the membrane compartment likely between the transition zone and the membrane anchor point of the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ye et al., 2018</xref>) before going out of the cilium in response to Hedgehog activation. This implies that the distal appendages might serve as a second diffusion or trafficking barrier besides the well-established transition zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-Gonzalo and Reiter, 2017</xref>). Future studies will test this hypothesis and define the molecular mechanisms by which the distal appendages control ciliary membrane composition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>pMCB306, a lenti-viral vector containing loxP-mU6-sgRNAs-puro resistance-EGFP-loxP cassette, and P293 Cas9-BFP were gifts from Prof. Michael Bassik.

A 40 x NA1.3 plan-apochromat objective lens (420762â9800, Zeiss) was used for ciliation assays, and a 63 x NA1.4 plan-apochromat objective lens (420780â9900, Zeiss) was used for other analyses. All the raw image data are available through BioImage Archive (accession: S-BIAD1215; DOI: 10.6019/S-BIAD1215).</p><p>For ciliation assays, cells were plated into a six-well plate at a density of 2Ã10<sup>5</sup> cells/well and grown for 66 hr. Cells were serum starved for 24 hr unless otherwise indicated and fixed in 4% PFA. After the blocking step, cells were stained for 3â4 hr at room temperature with anti-ARL13B (17711â1-AP, Proteintech), anti-CEP170 (41â3200, Invitrogen), and anti-acetylated tubulin (Ac-Tub) antibodies (T7451, SIGMA), washed, and then stained with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (711-545-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch), goat anti-mouse IgG1-Alexa Fluor 568 (A-21124, Invitrogen), and goat anti-mouse IgG2b Alexa Fluor 647 (A-21242, Invitrogen). All the images were captured by focusing CEP170 without looking at a channel of the ciliary proteins to avoid selecting specific area based on the percentage of ciliated cells. The structures extending from the centrosome and positive for ARL13B with the length of more than 1 Âµm was counted as primary cilia. At least six images from different fields per sample were captured for typical analysis. Typically, at least 200 cells were analyzed per experiment.

After the blocking step, cells were stained with anti-CP110 (12780â1-AP, Proteintech), anti-FOP (H00011116-M01, Abnova) (to mark both mother and daughter centrioles), and anti-CEP164 (sc-515403, Santa Cruz) (to mark the mother centriole) antibodies, washed, then stained with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (711-545-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch), goat anti-mouse IgG2a-Alexa Fluor 568 (A-21134, Invitrogen), and goat anti-mouse IgG2b Alexa Fluor 647 (A-21242, Invitrogen). All the images were captured by focusing FOP without looking at a channel of the other centriolar proteins to avoid selecting specific area based on the percentage of CP110 positive centrioles. CP110 localizing to both mother and daughter centrioles (as judged by colocalization with FOP) were counted as two dots, and CP110 localizing only to daughter centriole (as judged by no colocalization with CEP164) was counted as a one dot.

Excitation lasers (560 nm and 642 nm, both 1000 mW, MPB Communications) were circularly polarized (LPVISC050-MP2 polarizers, Thorlabs; 560 nm: Z-10-A-.250-B-556 and 642 nm: Z-10-A-.250-B-647 quarter-wave plates, both Tower Optical) and filtered (560 nm: FF01-554/23-25 excitation filter, 642 nm: FF01-631/36-25 excitation filter, both Semrock), and expanded and collimated using lens telescopes. Collimated light was focused by a KÃ¶hler lens and introduced into the back port of the microscope through a KÃ¶hler lens to allow for wide-field epi-illumination. The lasers were toggled with shutters (VS14S2T1 with VMM-D3 three-channel driver, Vincent Associates Uniblitz).</p><p>The sample was positioned on an xy translation stage (M26821LOJ, Physik Instrumente) and an xyz piezoelectric stage (P-545.3C8H, Physik Instrumente). The emission from the sample was collected using a high numerical aperture (NA) objective (UPLXAPO100XO, 100 x, NA 1.45, Olympus) and filtered (ZT405/488/561/640rpcV3 dichroic; ZET561NF notch filter; and ZET642NF notch filter, all Chroma) before entering a 4 f imaging system. The first lens of the 4 f imaging system (<italic>f</italic>=80 mm, AC508-080-AB, Thorlabs) was placed one focal length from the intermediate image plane in the emission path. A dichroic mirror (T660lpxr-UF3, Chroma) was placed after the first 4 f lens in order to split the light into two different spectral paths, where far red light (âred channelâ) was transmitted into one optical path and greener light (âgreen channelâ) was reflected into the other optical path. In order to reshape the point spread function (PSF) of the microscope to encode the axial position (z) of the individual fluorophores, transmissive dielectric double helix (DH) phase masks with ~2 Âµm axial range (green channel: DH1-580-3249, red channel: DH1-680-3249, both Double Helix Optics) were placed one focal length after the first 4 f lens in each path and another 4 f lens was placed one focal length after the phase masks in both paths. Bandpass filters (red channel: two ET700/75 m bandpass filters; green channel: ET605/70 m bandpass filter, both Chroma) were placed in the paths between the phase masks and the second 4 f lenses.

For calibration of the PSFs, scans over a 2 Âµm axial range with 50 nm steps were acquired using the piezoelectric xyz translation stage. For registration measurements, the stage was translated in xy to ten different positions, and stacks of 50 frames were acquired at each position. Dark frames (400) were collected with the camera shutter closed before image acquisition, and the averaged intensity was subtracted from the calibration, registration, and single-molecule data before further analysis.</p><p>Directly prior to cell imaging, a reducing and oxygen-scavenging buffer optimized for dSTORM blinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halpern et al., 2015</xref>) comprising 100 âmM Tris-HCl (pH 8, J22638-K2, Thermo Scientific), 10% (w/v) glucose (215530, BD Difco), 2 âÂµl/ml catalase (C100, Sigma-Aldrich), 560 âÂµg/ml glucose oxidase (G2133, Sigma-Aldrich), and 143 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol (M6250, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the well and the well was sealed with parafilm.

Before beginning the single-molecule super-resolution imaging, a large fraction of the fluorophores in the field of view were converted into a dark state using 560 nm and 642 nm illumination each at ~5 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>. The same laser intensities were then used for sequential acquisition of 100,000 frames of single-molecule data in each channel, first using exposure times of 50 ms for imaging of AF647 fluorophores in the red channel and then 35 ms for imaging of CF568 fluorophores in the green channel using calibrated EM gain and conversion gain of the camera of 183 and 4.41 photoelectrons/ADC count, respectively.

Stacks that were acquired of fiducial beads for calibration were averaged over 50 frames at each unique position. These DH PSF calibration scans and the single-molecule images were used for calibration and localization using fit3Dspline in the modular analysis platform SMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ries, 2020</xref>). Filter sizes and intensity count cutoffs, which serve as a threshold for template matching, were adjusted between samples based on localization previews to maximize correct localizations and minimize mislocalizations as identified by eye. Sample drift during image acquisition was accounted for by localizing fiducial beads in the same field of view as the single-molecule data. The measured motion of the fiducial bead was smoothed via cubic spline fitting (MATLAB function <italic>csaps</italic> with a smoothing parameter of 10<sup>â6</sup>) and subtracted from the single-molecule data using custom-written MATLAB scripts.</p><p>Registration between the two-color channels was completed in the x- and y-directions before correcting the z-direction. Images of dense fluorescent beads spun onto a coverslip were acquired at ten different xy positions and averaged in ImageJ. This averaged image was then cropped into the same fields of view as used for data acquisition in the two channels, and the MATLAB function <italic>imregtform</italic> was used to find the affine transformation that mapped the beads in the green channel onto the beads in the red channel. As the registration data was acquired at the coverslip while the single-molecule data could be acquired multiple microns above the coverslip through the cell, the registration was fine-tuned in an additional step by adapting a 2D cross-correlation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schnitzbauer et al., 2018</xref>) to 3D and using it to account for any residual nanoscale offsets caused by aberrations when imaging higher up in the sample and to correct for any offset in the z-direction. The protein FOP is known to localize to the region close to the subdistal appendages of the mother centriole and daughter centriole, and forms ring-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanie et al., 2017</xref>). By labeling these FOP structures with both AF647 and CF568, they served as a ground-truth for fine-tuning the channel registration. The FOP structures at the mother and daughter centrioles were manually isolated in each channel using Vutara SRX (version 7.0.00, Bruker) and cross-correlation was used to maximize the colocalization of the FOP localizations in the two registered channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>). This cross-correlation was performed over multiple iterations until the shift between the two-color channels was below 2 nm for each axis. The translational shift applied to the red channel that yielded the maximum colocalization coefficient between the FOP structures in the two channels was then applied to all single-molecule localizations in the region of interest, thereby providing a nanoscale fine-tuning of the registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>).</p><p>Following calibration, localization, drift correction, and registration of the data, localizations were rendered in Vutara SRX, where each localization was represented by a 3D Gaussian with 20 nm diameter and with variable opacities set to best visualize the localization density. The localizations were filtered to remove localizations with xy CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) values from SMAP below 20 nm, and spurious localizations were removed by means of filtering for large average distance to eight nearest neighbors. This resulted in reconstructions containing the following number of localizations: sample 1, RAB34: 12276, MYO5A: 1867, and FOP: 16093; sample 2, RAB34: 7239, MYO5A: 588, and FOP: 14255. The opacities used for visualization are as follows: sample 1, RAB34: 0.03, MYO5A: 0.08, FOP: 0.05; sample 2, RAB34: 0.02, MYO5A: 0.09, FOP: 0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and J</xref>).</p><p>Sizes of the RAB34 distributions were found by plotting histograms of the localizations along the x, y, and z axes and extracting the 1/e<sup>2</sup> values from their Gaussian fits. Threshold values for the localizations to be counted as a vesicle candidate were set at 120 nm in each direction, and clusters of localizations that had smaller dimensions were excluded. This threshold was based on the dimensions of clusters of localizations many micrometers away from the centrioles that were not likely RAB34 on vesicles compared to the dimensions of vesicle candidates within a micron from the centrioles. For RAB34-MYO5A offset measurements, histograms of the localizations along the x, y, and z axes for both RAB34 and MYO5A were fitted to two Gaussians to estimate the center-of-mass (COM) separation. The difference between the centers of the two peaks yielded the offset between RAB34 and MYO5A in each dimension, and the total distance was calculated in 3D. Distances of the RAB34 and MYO5A structures from the mother centriole FOP structure were defined by the difference in 3D distance between the COM of the FOP structure and the COM of RAB34 and MYO5A, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunoblot</title><p>For immunoblotting, cells were grown to confluent in a 6-well plate and lysed in 100 Âµl of NP-40 lysis buffer 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.5], 150 mM NaCl, and 0.3% NP-40 (11332473001, Roche Applied Science) containing 10 Âµg/ml LPC (leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymostatin), and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (P5726, SIGMA) followed by clarification of the lysate by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (21,000 g) at 4 Â°C for 10 min. 72.5 Âµl of the clarified lysates were then mixed with 25 Âµl of 4ÃLithium Dodecyl Sulfate (LDS) buffer (424 mM Tris-HCl, 564 mM Tris-base, 8% LDS, 10% glycerol, 2.04 mM EDTA, 0.26% Brilliant Blue G250, 0.025% phenol red) and 2.5 Âµl of 2-mercaptoethanol (M3148, SIGMA), and incubated at 95 Â°C for 5 min.

All the images for measurement of centrosomal signal intensity were captured by focusing CEP170 without looking at a channel of the protein of interest (POI) to avoid selecting specific area based on the signal intensity of POI. To measure the fluorescence intensity of centrosomal proteins, channels containing CEP170 and the protein of interest (POI) were individually extracted into separate images. A rolling ball background subtraction with a rolling ball radius of 5 pixels was implemented for both CEP170 and the POI to perform local background subtraction. The mask for both CEP170 and the POI was created by setting the lower threshold to the minimum level that covers only the centrosome. Each mask was then combined by converting the two masks to a stack followed by z projection. The combo mask was then dilated until the two masks were merged. After eroding the dilated masks several times, the fluorescent intensity of the POI was measured via âanalyze particlesâ command with optimal size and circularity. The size and circularity are optimized for individual POI to detect most of the centrosome in the image without capturing non-centrosomal structure. Outliers (likely non-centrosomal structure) were then excluded from the data using the ROUT method with a false discovery rate of 1% using GraphPad Prism 9 software to further remove signals from non-centrosomal structures, as the signals from those are typically extremely lower or higher than those from centrioles. Fluorescence intensity of ciliary proteins were measured similarly to centrosomal proteins but with several modifications. A mask was created for only ARL13B by setting the lower threshold to the minimum level that covers only cilia. The size and circularity are optimized for individual POI to detect only cilia without capturing non-ciliary structure. Image macros used for the automated measurement described above are found in the supplementary files.</p><p>To test whether the difference in the signal intensity is statistically different between control and test samples, the intensity measured through the described method was compared between control and test samples using nested one-way ANOVA with Dunnettâs multiple comparisons test if there are more than two replicates. In case there are less than three replicates, the statistical test was not performed in a single experiment, as the signal intensity is affected slightly by staining procedure and statistical significance is affected largely by the number of cells examined. For example, we saw statistical significance in the signal intensity with the same samples that are stained independently if we analyze the large number of the cells (more than 100 cells). Instead, we confirmed the same tendency in the change of fluorescence intensity in the test samples across two replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2"><title>Statistical analysis for ciliation, preciliary vesicle recruitment, and CP110 removal assay</title><p>For ciliation, preciliary vesicle recruitment, and CP110 removal assay, the number of ciliated cells from the indicated number of replicates were compared between control (sgGFP or sgSafe) and the test samples using Welchâs t-test.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A hierarchical pathway for assembly of the distal appendages that organize primary cilia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Gregory J Pazour as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We were all impressed with the extensive amount of analysis that was performed. The largest concern that was raised during the review and in the post-review discussion involved the lack of rescue of knockout cell lines to ensure that the phenotypes are due to the gene of interest. In most cases, I do not feel this is required, however, Cep83 is an exception. The intriguing conclusion that Cep83 is an extended molecule linking distant parts of the appendage is based on two antibodies with extensive cross-reactivity to other proteins. Further work with tagged rescue constructs is needed to support this conclusion. The additional concerns raised by the reviewers can be addressed by text revisions but we also suggest that you may want to consider adding data to address a subset of the concerns raised.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A major new finding of the work is that Cep83 is an extended protein that provides the backbone for much of the distal appendage. This conclusion is drawn from the localization of two antibodies that show extensive cross-reactivity to a ladder of cellular proteins. While I appreciate that the signal from these antibodies is reduced at the centrosome in the Cep83 knockout lines, alternative explanations could be made. To strengthen this conclusion, the authors should rescue the knockout cell line with constructs tagged at various positions. Representative images used for the quantification in Figure 2 should be shown.</p><p>The model presented in figure 6 appears to be more of a visual abstract rather than a diagram that would help to summarize the findings of the paper. Even after reading the paper and studying the figure legend, I have little understanding of what figure 6 is trying to show. This paper would have more impact if the figure showed the main points of the document. That being diagrams illustrating how the proteins are organized with respect to each other and another of the hierarchy of assembly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a number of points in this paper.</p><p>1. Throughout the paper, there is a lack of recognition of the Tanos et al. paper, which initially described a number of points discussed in this paper. Although Tanos et al. is cited, the work not only identified four novel distal appendage proteins but also molecularly showed how distal appendages mediated centriole to membrane docking through the recruitment of TTBK2 and the removal of CP110 and the recruitment of IFT molecules. In addition, her careful EM analysis of polarized IMCD3 cells using serial sections transversally cut along an apicobasal axis, and TEM clearly showed that, in the absence of CEP83, centrioles did not dock to the plasma membrane. I assume that this is an unintentional omission and I have pointed out specific points below.</p><p>2. To map the localization of centriole distal appendage proteins, the authors use 3D-SIM. Several studies have used STORM, correlated EM, and expansion microscopy to look at the structure and localization of distal appendages. This includes Yang et al. (PMID: 29789620), Bowler et al. (PMID: 30824690), and others. It, therefore, does not seem conclusive to use an inferior technique that is not properly validated by correlated EM. Controls with previously used techniques have not been carried out. Could additional cell lines be used to test these antibodies? Antibodies for centriolar proteins have been shown to frequently result in unspecific centriolar signals. Could these new antibodies be tested for immunostaining in knockout cell lines to see if the centriolar signal is specific?</p><p>3. Most of the DAP localization data shown is not new. However, three novel distal appendage proteins are described. Regarding the CEP83 localization, a novel localization in the outer rings of DAPs is found. Additional techniques should be used to confirm this. Furthermore, a number of antibodies for centriolar proteins show unspecific signals at centrioles. Has this antibody staining been tested in CEP83 knockout cells? A western blot is shown for the knockout cells but not for immunostaining. In &quot;Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 Characterization of the two CEP83 antibodies&quot;, here, the western blot is showing a band that seems to run at more than 90 KDa, the band does not seem to correspond to CEP83 and seems very unspecific. Has this localization been validated using EM? 3D-SIM has also been shown to generate artifacts, but this has not been taken into account.</p><p>4.

The hierarchy of recruitment of distal appendage proteins was published by Tanos et al. (PMID: 23348840). These results have been validated by many others. Originally, Tanos et al. used U2OS and RPE-1 cells and depleted the different proteins using siRNA to confirm this hierarchy. Please note that the updated hierarchy model has not been validated. As it is, I would suggest that Figure 2N would be updated or removed, as it does not reflect currently validated results.</p><p>6. These results shown need to be compared side by side with the results from siRNA and knockout cell lines. The authors state: &quot;Notably, the original epistasis pathway using siRNA knockdowns for loss of function may fail to identify some strong requirements if limited amounts of protein are sufficient for pathway function.&quot; A risk of using knockout cell lines is whether genetic compensation might occur. Using a validated knock-in degron system could be an alternative that could give experimental support to these conclusions. To draw the conclusions observed in this paper, experiments similar to was has been done before, in order to provide valid comparisons should be carried out.</p><p>7. The results shown need to be validated using rescue experiments.</p><p>8. The quantification of protein localization has been carried out in an automated manner, focusing on a subdistal appendage protein &quot;Cep170&quot;. In most papers examining the centriolar localization of proteins, careful attention needs to be paid to whether the image has been focused on the centriole. It is not clear how this might have been done in an automated manner. It would have been more reasonable to do the mask with a more broad centrosomal marker. It is not clear how the experiment was analyzed and normalized. Why does it say &quot;when&quot; 2 experiments were performed? It is not clear whether these results are representative of three independent experiments, two, or less. It is not clear whether a total of 100 cells were tested or 100 cells per repeat. Although the manual analysis was not performed, the data seems curated and it is not clear how this quantification was carried out.</p><p>9. Although this has not been published, we have examined CEP83 localization in SCLT1 knockout cells and we did not see that CEP83 was depleted from centrioles, which highlights the need for proper assay validation.</p><p>10. For Figure 2, the figure legend is not clear, is this representative of 3 independent experiments? How is the localization of CEP83 in SCLT1 knockout cells growing in a steady state situation, in 10% FBS, this needs to be addressed, as the experiments from Tanos et al. were conducted in 10% FBS. The data presented is not sufficient to conclude that CEP83 is not being recruited to centrioles in the absence of SCLT1. How many cells were analyzed for this experiment? How many cell lines were used? Representative images are not shown.</p><p>10. For the ANKRD26 (and for all experiments shown), no rescue experiments are shown that might validate the results.</p><p>11. The positive feedback loop by TTBK2 is not novel and was previously observed by Lo et al. (PMID: 31455668) and by Bernatik et al. (PMID: 32129703), this needs to be clearly stated in the text. Bernatik et al. showed that without Cep164, TTBK2 can't be recruited to centrioles. The model drawn in Figure 2N is confusing and misleading, as it is not supported by the data presented. I suggest the authors remove it.</p><p>12. For the FBF1 knockdown cells, it is mentioned that the FBF1 antibody does not work well for western blot. It has been shown by several papers that the FBF1 antibody works perfectly well (PMID: 23348840; PMID: 32366837; PMID: 33561696).</p><p>13. To examine the distal appendage hierarchy, they used an automated analysis of centrosomal localization. It is not clear how this was quantified and pictures are not shown. They used CEP170, a marker for subdistal appendages, to define a mask around centrioles. It is not clear how the experiment was analyzed and normalized. The techniques used can't be compared with experiments carried out by the community as those used different methods including storm and other super-resolution techniques less prone to artifacts and correlated electron microscopy. Rescue experiments should be included.</p><p>14. For the different positive feedback loops, representative images need to be shown. It is not clear how ANKRD26 can affect CEP83 localization. It is important to note that the localization of CEP83 was shown not to be affected in ANKRD26 knockout cells in a paper by the Loncarek group (PMID: 30824690).</p><p>15. Have these experiments been carried out in additional cell lines? Not only RPE-1? Careful analysis is required to reconcile all the previous models using comparable techniques and these inconsistencies need to be clearly mentioned in the text.</p><p>16. Line 224 (Kurtulmus et al., 2018), we did not see the effect of LRRC45 on FBF1 localization (Figure 2E). The authors claim that this is due to siRNA vs knockout. It is not clear that whenever possible, the explanation is siRNA vs knockout.</p><p>17. Could you test the localization of these proteins with and without 10% serum?</p><p>18. Line 257 the statement &quot;Albinism likely reflects problems in melanosome transport.&quot; Seems disconnected, and needs to be rephrased.</p><p>19. Figure 3, it is not clear in this figure where the CEP83 cells are. The description in line 263 is vague, it says: &quot;arrowhead in the bottom of Figure 3&quot; This is not clear.</p><p>20. Where it says, line 275: &quot;Note that the percentage of RAB34 and MYO5A double positive centrioles was highest in the confluent cells grown with serum and was decreased upon serum starvation (Figure 3B).&quot; why would this be? Is this all centriolar localization or pericentriolar? This would need to be addressed.</p><p>21. In figure 3, however, Rab34 ciliary vesicle seems small puncta. I would expect a larger ciliary vesicle to be recruited.</p><p>22. Figure 4: It is not clear why the Rab34 data is included. It is possible that the results are inconsistent with previous studies (Ganga, 2021, Stuck 2021) because they did the experiments for 48 hours.</p><p>It is consensus to carry out ciliogenesis studies for 48 hours. Minimally, I would expect the authors to carry out a time course. What about the recruitment of TTBK2?</p><p>23. Figure 4. It is not clear how the Rab34 recruitment was increased in FOP knockout cells. It is not a slight increase, it is a very big difference. How was this experiment quantified? Could they do a time course? Could representative images be shown? The model in the figure is confusing. Could other cell lines be used, U2OS, HeLa, and IMCD3? Could this be an artifact?</p><p>24. Line 404, Tanos et al. also showed superresolution of novel distal appendage proteins CEP83, CEP89, SCLT1, and FBF1. Why is this not being recognized here?</p><p>25. Line 439, it was Tanos et al. that showed that distal appendages, and, in particular, CEP83 were required for CP110 removal. At the time the Goetz paper came out, TTBK2 had not yet been identified as a distal appendage protein. So, Tanos et al. first showed that CEP83 (and distal appendages) were required for CP110 removal.</p><p>26. Line 474, what does the author mean by &quot;other distal appendages&quot;?</p><p>27. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, the western blot for CEP83 is not clear, the molecular weight of the CEP83 band is at almost 100 KD in the left panel in 1B. The western blot does not seem specific.</p><p>28. FBF1 knockout needs to be validated by western blot.</p><p>29. Typos in the figures, Figure 6, should say &quot;structural&quot;.</p><p>30. Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 Characterization of IFT52 depleted cell, should say &quot;cells&quot;.</p><p>31. Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, should say &quot;length&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors showed that the localization of the outer ring of CEP83 was significantly enhanced following serum starvation (Figure 1D). The authors should consider checking if the inner ring of the CEP83 signal also changes upon serum starvation. This may provide evidence if serum starvation could change the confirmation of the distal appendage.</p><p>2) In Figure 3, the authors showed that the percentage of RAB34 and MYO5A double positive centrioles was highest in the confluent cells grown with serum and was decreased upon serum starvation. Adding control analysis of RAB34 positive centrioles in non-confluent cells growing in serum could be used to evaluate the strength of promotion of ciliary vesicle formation upon serum starvation.</p><p>3) The application of single-molecule 3D super-resolution microscopy introduces an important new tool for investigating cilia membrane relationships. From the work presented only a limited number of cells were analyzed preventing quantitative analysis of vesicle docking. Including additional data from this microscope, modality could enhance conclusions that can be drawn in particular comparing cells that not undergoing ciliogenesis.</p><p>4) The authors set out to characterize the structural organization and function of the previously known and newly described complement of distal appendage protein. In agreement with previous studies, this work confirms that the four integral components of the distal appendage CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2 are not only important for structural integrity but also critical for ciliogenesis. Without either of these proteins, ciliogenesis initiation is strongly inhibited except for CEP19 recruitment in the CEP83 knockout condition. Their work also suggests additional distal appendage protein complexes have specific ciliogenesis functions. The authors predict that a very small amount of centriolar CEP164-TTBK2 may be sufficient to bring CEP19 near the distal appendage. Given the fact that CEP83 knockout strongly blocks distal appendage assembly, it doesn't rule out the possibility that CEP19 may be recruited to the other compartment of the mother centriole such as the sub-distal appendages in the absence of distal appendages. Showing the precise localization of CEP19 in the absence of CEP83 using super-resolution microscopy could strengthen their model.</p><p>5) The authors' work suggests differences in findings from knockout cells for RAB34 and MYO5A compared to previously published work. Rescue studies in knockout lines should be considered in cases where partial phenotypes were observed to ensure effects are specific, for example in the case of CP110 removal. Another important distinction in this work is the observation MYO5A knockout cells reported in this manuscript develop cilia which differs from Wu et al. (Nature Cell Biology, 2018). An explanation for this finding should be addressed in the text.</p><p>6) Additional editing of the text is suggested to improve the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85999.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A major new finding of the work is that Cep83 is an extended protein that provides the backbone for much of the distal appendage. This conclusion is drawn from the localization of two antibodies that show extensive cross-reactivity to a ladder of cellular proteins. While I appreciate that the signal from these antibodies is reduced at the centrosome in the Cep83 knockout lines, alternative explanations could be made. To strengthen this conclusion, the authors should rescue the knockout cell line with constructs tagged at various positions. Representative images used for the quantification in Figure 2 should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Although centriolar CEP83 fluorescent signals that were probed with the two different antibodies were undetectable in CEP83 knockouts cells, we agree that we cannot exclude that possibility that these antibodies are specifically detecting distal appendage proteins that are not CEP83 but the downstream of it. To exclude this possibility and support our hypothesis, we tested the localization of N-terminally GFP tagged CEP83, and C-terminally GFP-tagged CEP83. Consistent with the inner-ring localization seen using the antibody detecting the CEP83 C-terminus (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2), C-terminally GFP-tagged CEP83 (CEP83-GFP) displayed an inner-ring structure with the diameter of 339.7Â±18.4 nm (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A-B). An N-terminally GFP tagged CEP83 was located at the similar position to CEP164 with the diameter comparable to CEP164 (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 4C-D). The N-terminally tagged GFP-CEP83 ring was smaller than the outermost ring of endogenous CEP83, possibly because the difference between N-terminus and the region detected by antibody (somewhere between a.a. 226-568 of the CEP83 isoform 2). We observed the same trend when we detected the tagged proteins with native GFP fluorescent signal instead of antibody, although the difference between GFP-CEP83 and CEP83-GFP was somewhat less pronounced possibly due to lower fluorescent signal, which tends to flatten differences on the low end (new Figure 1âfigure supplement 4E-H). These results strengthen our first hypothesis that CEP83 forms an extended structure that serves as an important backbone of the distal appendage.</p><p>We hesitated to show representative images in the initial submission, as one picture cannot reflect the heterogeneity of the centriolar signal. Nevertheless, we understand that the representative images are convenient for readers, and decided to have a figure that shows representative images of the cells analyzed in Figure 2 (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). To mitigate the problem of the representative images, we uploaded all the raw image data that were analyzed in this paper to BioImage Archive (accession: S-BIAD1215; DOI: 10.6019/S-BIAD1215) and are publicly available for consideration by readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model presented in figure 6 appears to be more of a visual abstract rather than a diagram that would help to summarize the findings of the paper.

We believe the new figure better conveys what we showed in this paper (please see the new Figure 6). We appreciate the reviewer for this important comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are a number of points in this paper.</p><p>1. Throughout the paper, there is a lack of recognition of the Tanos et al. paper, which initially described a number of points discussed in this paper. Although Tanos et al. is cited, the work not only identified four novel distal appendage proteins but also molecularly showed how distal appendages mediated centriole to membrane docking through the recruitment of TTBK2 and the removal of CP110 and the recruitment of IFT molecules. In addition, her careful EM analysis of polarized IMCD3 cells using serial sections transversally cut along an apicobasal axis, and TEM clearly showed that, in the absence of CEP83, centrioles did not dock to the plasma membrane. I assume that this is an unintentional omission and I have pointed out specific points below.</p></disp-quote><p>Our current paper was clearly built upon previous studies, which established our current understanding of the distal appendages. These include but are not limited to: (1) the paper from Eric Niggâs group (PMID:17954613), which discovered the first distal appendage protein, CEP164; (2) the paper from Michel Bornensâ group (PMID: 21976302), which discovered CEP89 as the second distal appendage protein and performed the first STORM experiment on the distal appendage protein; (3) the paper from Gislene Pereiraâs group (PMID: 23253480), which showed that the distal appendage protein, CEP164, is important for IFT recruitment and ciliary vesicle capture; (4) the Tanos et al. paper (PMID: 23348840), which discovered the three novel distal appendage proteins and established the first hierarchy of the known distal appendage proteins; and (5) recent super-resolution imaging papers (PMID: 29789620)(PMID: 30824690), which determined the precise location of the distal appendage proteins. We, of course, recognize, value and greatly appreciate all these papers, and had no intention of omitting any of those papers. The Tanos et al. paper was cited eleven times in the initial manuscript and is the most cited paper among all the references, so we believe we clearly emphasized her paper. We assume the reviewer felt the lack of recognition of the paper possibly because of our criteria of referencing, where we limit the references to the most relevant papers for the statement, rather than adding all papers that did something related to the statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To map the localization of centriole distal appendage proteins, the authors use 3D-SIM. Several studies have used STORM, correlated EM, and expansion microscopy to look at the structure and localization of distal appendages. This includes Yang et al. (PMID: 29789620), Bowler et al. (PMID: 30824690), and others. It, therefore, does not seem conclusive to use an inferior technique that is not properly validated by correlated EM. Controls with previously used techniques have not been carried out. Could additional cell lines be used to test these antibodies? Antibodies for centriolar proteins have been shown to frequently result in unspecific centriolar signals. Could these new antibodies be tested for immunostaining in knockout cell lines to see if the centriolar signal is specific?</p></disp-quote><p>The lateral resolution of 3D-SIM is indeed inferior to STORM; however, each super-resolution technique has its own merits and problems, and 3D-SIM has several advantages over other super-resolution techniques. One notable advantage is its flexibility of fluorophore selection, which allows us to perform the multi-color imaging to locate target proteins relative to multiple centriolar markers, which we use in the paper. In contrast, the success of STORM experiments highly relies on blinking status of the dye, and multi-color STORM imaging is always challenging, as second dye often has inferior blinking property compared with the gold standard, AlexaFluor647/CF647.</p><p>Importantly, we recapitulated many of the previous finding, including the distal appendage matrix localization of FBF1 (PMID: 29789620), and relative position of the previously known distal appendage proteins (please compare Figure 1B with the previously established architecture (PMID: 29789620)).</p><p>All the antibodies used in this paper were rigorously tested for both immunostaining and immunoblot. We confirmed that all the antibodies specifically recognize the respective proteins at least at the centriole (Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Most of the DAP localization data shown is not new. However, three novel distal appendage proteins are described. Regarding the CEP83 localization, a novel localization in the outer rings of DAPs is found. Additional techniques should be used to confirm this. Furthermore, a number of antibodies for centriolar proteins show unspecific signals at centrioles. Has this antibody staining been tested in CEP83 knockout cells? A western blot is shown for the knockout cells but not for immunostaining. In &quot;Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 Characterization of the two CEP83 antibodies&quot;, here, the western blot is showing a band that seems to run at more than 90 KDa, the band does not seem to correspond to CEP83 and seems very unspecific. Has this localization been validated using EM? 3D-SIM has also been shown to generate artifacts, but this has not been taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>We confirmed that the centriolar signal that was detected by either of the two CEP83 antibodies was undetectable in CEP83 knockout cells (please see Figure 2B and 2C). For the sake of convenience, we also included the representative images of the data analyzed in Figure 2 in the revised manuscript (new Figure 2-fgure supplement 1). We also uploaded all the raw images in the BioImage Archive (accession: S-BIAD1215; DOI: 10.6019/S-BIAD1215).</p><p>Further, we tested our hypothesis for the extended CEP83 structure by tagging the protein with GFP at either N-terminus or the C-terminus as we explained in the response to the comment 1 of the reviewer #1 (please see above). This experiment has its own limitation (e.g., the exact motifs predominantly recognized by the antibodies are unknown, N/C-terminally GFP tagged CEP83 does not necessarily mimic the motif recognized by the antibodies), but generally agree with the idea that CEP83 forms an extended structure that may span from inner to the outer region of the distal appendage.</p><p>Regarding the molecular weight of CEP83, estimated molecular weight using immunoblot is often different from the calculated molecular weight, as the migration speed on a protein gel is affected by numerous factors, including amino acid composition and efficacy of SDS binding, and post translational modification.</p><p>Nevertheless, we rechecked the figure (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2) and noticed that the molecular weight for the outer ring was slightly displaced. As you can see in the original image âSource Data- the original files of the full raw unedited immunoblotâ, which was included in the initial submission, the two membranes were slightly displaced when the image was taken. When we labeled the molecular weight during the manuscript preparation, we accidentally copied the molecular weight marker of the right panel (inner ring) and pasted them to the left panel, which caused the displacement of the molecular weight marker in the left panel. The figure was now updated (new Figure 1-fgure supplement 2B). The accuracy of this change can be confirmed with the original image (please see âSource Data- the original files of the full raw unedited immunoblotâ).

The hierarchy of recruitment of distal appendage proteins was published by Tanos et al. (PMID: 23348840). These results have been validated by many others. Originally, Tanos et al. used U2OS and RPE-1 cells and depleted the different proteins using siRNA to confirm this hierarchy. Please note that the updated hierarchy model has not been validated. As it is, I would suggest that Figure 2N would be updated or removed, as it does not reflect currently validated results.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2N shows a model based on our study. We believe this model helps readers to better understand our study. However, we thought having CEP83 and SCLT1 at the same hierarchy (the original Figure 2N) may cause a confusion, as the inner ring CEP83 was much less affected in SCLT1 knockout cells (Figure 2B) while the outer ring CEP83 was almost undetectable (Figure 2C) in SCLT1 knockout cells. Therefore, we decided to update our model (please see the updated Figure 2N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. These results shown need to be compared side by side with the results from siRNA and knockout cell lines. The authors state: &quot;Notably, the original epistasis pathway using siRNA knockdowns for loss of function may fail to identify some strong requirements if limited amounts of protein are sufficient for pathway function.&quot; A risk of using knockout cell lines is whether genetic compensation might occur. Using a validated knock-in degron system could be an alternative that could give experimental support to these conclusions. To draw the conclusions observed in this paper, experiments similar to was has been done before, in order to provide valid comparisons should be carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>Each technique has its own advantage(s) and disadvantage(s). We understand the potential risk of analyzing knockout cells (e.g., compensation). A degron system may be powerful in terms of temporal regulation, but the reduction of the protein level may not be sufficient to completely shut off function of the proteins. The issue of genetic compensation is well-understood and should not confuse readers. We provide a short statement to address this issue. In the discussion, we wrote âUsing the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we created a new hierarchical model of the distal appendage proteins, which is mostly consistent with the previously established model but has a number of differences. Most of the discrepancies likely come from the differences between siRNA and CRISPR techniques. While CRISPR knockout lines may show genetic compensation, the consistency of our results with the previous CRISPR and siRNA results, in some cases showing only quantitative differences, do not suggest that genetic compensation is a major problem.â</p><p>Importantly, our knockout cells reproduced most of the previously published results with some differences. We believe that it is fair to state that stronger phenotypes that we observed may likely come from complete absence of the proteins in the knockout cells. For example, our CEP83 knockout cells, SCLT1 knockout cells, and CEP164 knockout cells had slightly stronger ciliation defects (Figure 5A-B) than what were observed in the Tanos et al. paper (PMID: 23348840). The very similar stronger ciliation defects were observed in another paper that analyzed CEP164 knockout cells and SCLT1 knockout cells (please see the Figure EV1 of PMID: 33350486).</p><p>Nevertheless, we believe the different techniques provide generally interpretable views of the importance of the distal appendage proteins.

The results shown need to be validated using rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree that perfect experiments that confirm the results are rescue experiments. We wish we could perform rescue experiments for all the knockout cells, however, it could take additional 2-3 years to complete the rescue experiments especially because we had &gt;15 knockout cells in this study. Nevertheless, we understand that knockout cells may have off target effect and mitigated this problem using an alternative way. To reduce the risk of off-target effect, we generated multiple single cell clones from each knockout cells, and the same number of the single cell clones were mixed to generate pooled single cell clone knockout cells. The pooled single cell clones were used in all the experiments shown in this paper, and the number of clones used to generate each knockout line was reported in the âSource Data_List of cell lines used in this paperâ. With this strategy, each knockout clone should have similar on-target effect, but likely have different off-target effects. Therefore, the phenotypes observed in majority of the cells are likely attributable to the depletion of the target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The quantification of protein localization has been carried out in an automated manner, focusing on a subdistal appendage protein &quot;Cep170&quot;. In most papers examining the centriolar localization of proteins, careful attention needs to be paid to whether the image has been focused on the centriole. It is not clear how this might have been done in an automated manner. It would have been more reasonable to do the mask with a more broad centrosomal marker. It is not clear how the experiment was analyzed and normalized. Why does it say &quot;when&quot; 2 experiments were performed? It is not clear whether these results are representative of three independent experiments, two, or less. It is not clear whether a total of 100 cells were tested or 100 cells per repeat. Although the manual analysis was not performed, the data seems curated and it is not clear how this quantification was carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>We are afraid that we may not have understood the reviewerâs questions correctly. Quantification was carried out in an automated manner, but each image was manually captured by adjusting the focus to CEP170 without looking at a channel of the protein of interest (POI) to avoid selecting specific area based on the signal intensity of POI. Distal appendage proteins are typically in the same focal plane as CEP170, because the subdistal appendage protein is in proximity to distal appendage proteins. All the images analyzed were single-plane pictures (not z-stacks). We removed the unfocused centrioles by removing outliers using the ROUT method. The exact workflow used for the quantification was described in the âFluorescence intensity measurementsâ of the Materials and methods, and the macro used for the analysis was provided in âSource Data- Macro for measuring fluorescent intensity of centrosomal proteinsâ. In the typical analyses, 50-100 centrioles per cell line were analyzed in each experiment. Exact numbers of the centrioles analyzed, and the raw signal intensity can be found in the âSource Dataâ of the corresponding figures. The raw images can be found through the BioImage Archive (accession: S-BIAD1215; DOI: 10.6019/S-BIAD1215). In majority of the case, including CEP164, CEP89, SCLT1, CEP83, and TTBK2, we performed more than three independent experiments (four to six) to confirm our observation.

(PMID: 31455668) showed that CEP83 is phosphorylated by TTBK2, and the phosphorylation of CEP83 promotes cilium formation without affecting localization of other distal appendage proteins.

In figure 3, however, Rab34 ciliary vesicle seems small puncta. I would expect a larger ciliary vesicle to be recruited.</p></disp-quote><p>In the 1962 paper, Dr. Sorokin named a vesicle that covers the entire width of the centriole as a primary ciliary vesicle (PMID: 13978319). In the follow-up study in 1968, he observed small vesicles, which may attach to one of the nine blades of the distal appendage (PMID: 5661997). He did not clearly name these smaller vesicles, but when he explained ciliogenesis of multi-ciliated cells, he stated &quot; it is possible to observe several small vesicles at the distal end, or a single vesicle covering that end, of a mature basal body (Figures 51, 53-55); and this may be interpreted to be either a rudimentary ciliary sheath (the primary ciliary vesicle) or an invagination from the plasma membrane.&quot; So, the small vesicle can be considered as a ciliary vesicle from this paper. Westlake lab named this smaller vesicle as a distal appendage vesicle, when they described the role of EHD1, which converts smaller vesicles to a larger ciliary vesicle (PMID: 25686250). Since RAB34 is recruited to the centriole earlier than EHD1, RAB34 may be classified as a distal appendage vesicle protein. However, we hesitate to use the word âdistal appendage vesicleâ from several reasons. First, we think that the current definition of the ciliary vesicle/distal appendage vesicle is not very clear. When we analyzed serial section electron micrographs in RPE-hTERT cells, we found a number of different-sized vesicles attached to the mother centrioles. Some vesicles occupied only several of the nine blades of the distal appendage. Please see electron micrographs of the Figure 3D of the accompanying paper. Some middle-sized vesicles formed tubule-like structure, reminiscent of the MC membrane tubule described by the Westlake group. Some vesicles are large even though it attaches to only one blade of the distal appendage. Even one centriole can have multiple of those different sized vesicles. We were not sure how we should call those vesicles. Second, when we analyze the RAB34 positive vesicles using wide-field microscopy, we cannot distinguish small and large vesicles because of the diffraction limit. Therefore, we prefer to use the word âciliary vesicleâ to all the vesicles that are attached to the mother centriole without shaft.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23.

Minimally, I would expect the authors to carry out a time course. What about the recruitment of TTBK2?</p></disp-quote><p>Distal appendages regulate at least four steps required for cilium formation: IFT/CEP19 recruitment, ciliary vesicle recruitment, and CP110 removal. We wanted to determine whether distal appendage regulates these steps independently, or these steps are interconnected. To determine the relationship, we wanted to individually inhibit each step and tested whether the perturbation of one process affects the others. To this end, we depleted RAB34 to inhibit ciliary vesicle formation.</p><p>In terms of the assay time point after serum starvation, we highly recommend analyzing the cilium formation at or earlier than 24 hours after serum removal, or perform kinetic experiments. As shown in many previous papers, RPE1-hTERT cells complete cilium formation sometime closer to 24 hours rather than 48 hours (please see Figure 3C of PMID: 28625565, for example). If the cilium formation or other processes are assessed at 48 hours, we may miss kinetic defects.</p><p>TTBK2 recruitment was not affected by RAB34 depletion (our unpublished data)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24. Figure 4. It is not clear how the Rab34 recruitment was increased in FOP knockout cells. It is not a slight increase, it is a very big difference. How was this experiment quantified? Could they do a time course? Could representative images be shown? The model in the figure is confusing. Could other cell lines be used, U2OS, HeLa, and IMCD3? Could this be an artifact?</p></disp-quote><p>FOP plays an important role for CEP19 and IFT88 recruitment to the centriole. An intriguing possibility is that RAB34 positive ciliary vesicle is stuck at the centriole when the other processes do not proceed. However, this hypothesis conflicts with the data where neither depletion of IFT52 (Figure 4L), which abrogated localization of all the IFT-B complex proteins that we tested, nor CEP19 (not shown) affected the percentage of RAB34 positive centrioles. Another possibility is that RAB34 recruitment occurs at specific cell cycle stage, as depletion of FOP causes a growth defect, possibly via regulation of PPP2R3C-MAP3K1 module (PMID: 38617270). This is very interesting phenomenon, but substantial amount of work is needed to understand exactly why RAB34 recruitment is increased in FOP knockout cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25.

The authors should consider checking if the inner ring of the CEP83 signal also changes upon serum starvation. This may provide evidence if serum starvation could change the confirmation of the distal appendage.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not include the inner ring localization of CEP83 in the absence of serum in either Figure 1D or Figure 2B, because the antibody that recognizes inner ring of CEP83 showed strong signal surrounding the centriole (likely the Golgi apparatus) only in the absence of serum. We confirmed that the Golgi-like localization is likely non-specific, as this staining persists in the CEP83 knockout cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3, the authors showed that the percentage of RAB34 and MYO5A double positive centrioles was highest in the confluent cells grown with serum and was decreased upon serum starvation. Adding control analysis of RAB34 positive centrioles in non-confluent cells growing in serum could be used to evaluate the strength of promotion of ciliary vesicle formation upon serum starvation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to show whether the centriolar localization is affected by confluency. To test this possibility, we analyzed the percentage of RAB34 positive centrioles in either cells grown to 40-50% confluency (subconfluent) or 100% confluency (confluent). As shown in the new Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, we did not observe any difference between the two conditions. This result confirmed that the RAB34 positive ciliary vesicles can attach to the mother centriole in cycling cells, and the number of the RAB34-positive centrioles decreases over time during the time course of serum starvation.

In agreement with previous studies, this work confirms that the four integral components of the distal appendage CEP83-SCLT1-CEP164-TTBK2 are not only important for structural integrity but also critical for ciliogenesis. Without either of these proteins, ciliogenesis initiation is strongly inhibited except for CEP19 recruitment in the CEP83 knockout condition. Their work also suggests additional distal appendage protein complexes have specific ciliogenesis functions. The authors predict that a very small amount of centriolar CEP164-TTBK2 may be sufficient to bring CEP19 near the distal appendage. Given the fact that CEP83 knockout strongly blocks distal appendage assembly, it doesn't rule out the possibility that CEP19 may be recruited to the other compartment of the mother centriole such as the sub-distal appendages in the absence of distal appendages. Showing the precise localization of CEP19 in the absence of CEP83 using super-resolution microscopy could strengthen their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We reported that CEP19 localizes to the position between subdistal appendage and distal appendage, and the localization requires FGFR1OP (or FOP) [PMID: 28625565]. In FGFR1OP knockout cells, CEP19 almost completely fails to localize to the centriole (Figure 4I). As we showed in Figure 5F, CEP19 centriolar localization is highly dependent on the CEP164-TTBK2 module. This indicates that CEP19 requires both CEP164-TTBK2 and FOP to properly localize to the centriole. An interesting possibility is that CEP164 may be required for FOP localization and vice versa. We tested this possibility. Quantification data from the immunostaining of CEP164 showed that FGFR1OP is not required for CEP164 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). While quantification and more careful analysis is needed, immunostaining image showed that there is no obvious difference in centriolar FGFR1OP intensity in control, CEP164 knockout, and CEP83 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). Therefore, the difference in CEP19 intensity between CEP164 and CEP83 knockouts is independent of FGFR1OP regulation. We believe this further supports our hypothesis that the residual amount (5-10%, please see Figure 2A) of CEP164 may be sufficient for CEP19 localization in CEP83 knockout cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85999-sa2-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors' work suggests differences in findings from knockout cells for RAB34 and MYO5A compared to previously published work.
