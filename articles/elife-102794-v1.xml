To sustain the barrier continuously, it’s essential to preserve the ‘old’ tight junctions (TJs) between cells being excluded from the sheet and their neighbors while simultaneously forming de novo TJs between newly adjacent cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of de novo TJs remain largely unknown. This study investigates two scenarios: the formation of de novo TJs during the removal of apoptotic cells from mouse monolayer epithelial sheets and during the differentiation of the granular layer in mouse stratified epidermis. We revealed that rapid claudin assembly is achieved by actively regulating the dissociation of the EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex in both situations. Furthermore, we found that the Rho-ROCK pathway initiates the activation of matriptase, which cleaves EpCAM/TROP2, resulting in the supply of polymerizable claudin from the stockpiled EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex at the plasma membrane to induce rapid de novo TJ formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tight junction</kwd><kwd>Claudin</kwd><kwd>EpCAM</kwd><kwd>Trop2</kwd><kwd>matriptase</kwd><kwd>epidermis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP22H02618</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23K18141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP25H01325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP25H00994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23KJ1689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Yuma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/JPMJFR204L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KOSÉ Cosmetology Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikenouchi</surname><given-names>Junichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Rho-ROCK–matriptase signaling axis promotes claudin release from EpCAM/TROP2 complexes, enabling tight junction reassembly during epithelial remodeling to preserve barrier integrity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The surfaces of our body and its organs are covered by epithelial cell sheets, which serve to prevent the entry of antigens and pathogens from the outside and the leakage of substances such as water and glucose from the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piontek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horowitz et al., 2023</xref>). This barrier function is achieved through the close attachment of the plasma membranes of neighboring epithelial cells by intercellular adhesion structures called TJs. The major component of TJs is claudin, a four-transmembrane protein of around 25 kDa. Claudin binds in cis on the plasma membrane and in trans between neighboring cells, forming a membrane structure called TJ strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsukita et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In both simple epithelia, such as the gastrointestinal tract, and stratified epithelia, such as skin, the barrier is continuously maintained by various mechanisms that regulate the homeostasis of the epithelial cell sheet, including the wound healing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu and Rosenblatt, 2012</xref>). For example, unnecessary inflammatory responses are suppressed by mechanisms that rapidly eliminate apoptotic cells generated by constant cell turnover or exposure to external stresses in the epithelial cell sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duszyc et al., 2023</xref>). During the process of apoptotic cell extrusion, the apoptotic cells are physically pushed towards the apical side by an increase in actomyosin contractility of cells adjacent to the apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeuchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</xref>). The barrier function of the epithelial sheet is maintained during this process of apical extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</xref>). In parallel with rapid apoptotic cell elimination, it is necessary to maintain the integrity of TJs between apoptotic cells and neighboring cells, while rapidly forming de novo TJs between newly adjacent cells that result from apoptotic cell elimination. However, the mechanism for the formation of such rapid de novo TJs is largely unknown.</p><p>In the epidermis, TJs form only between keratinocytes in the granular layer and act as a barrier separating the inside and outside of the body. Claudin-1 knockout mice die within a day of birth due to abnormal stratum corneum differentiation and disrupted granular layer barrier function, resulting in severe dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furuse et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugawara et al., 2013</xref>). In the epidermis, stem cells in the basal layer divide to give rise to new keratinocytes, which differentiate towards the body surface into keratinocytes constituting the spinous layer, granular layer, and stratum corneum, forming a multilayered epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kulukian and Fuchs, 2013</xref>). TJs are only formed in the second layer of the granular layer (SG2), even though claudin is also expressed in cells of the basal and spinous layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yokouchi et al., 2016</xref>). In the turnover of keratinocytes in the SG2 layer, the epidermal barrier is continuously maintained by the simultaneous formation of ‘new’ TJs between newly differentiating SG2 keratinocytes and pre-existing SG2 keratinocytes, before the ‘old’ TJs between SG2 keratinocytes that are differentiating into keratinocytes of the stratum corneum and neighboring SG2 keratinocytes are lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yokouchi et al., 2016</xref>). It has recently been reported that an E-cadherin-dependent increase of intercellular tension at adherens junctions (AJs) and inhibition of EGFR activity are required for induction of TJ formation in the SG2 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>). However, how these E-cadherin-mediated changes regulate TJ formation in the SG2 layer and why TJs are never formed in keratinocytes other than the SG2 layer that express claudin remain open questions.</p><p>The formation of de novo tight junctions, which is common in these two phenomena, is rapid, suggesting that the formation of functional TJs is not regulated through de novo transcription or translation of claudin, but rather by controlling the polymerization state of claudin. In heterogeneous cells, such as L cells and COS-7 cells, forced expression of claudin alone is known to be sufficient to induce TJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furuse et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonschior et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, in the lateral membranes of simple epithelial cells and keratinocytes, excess claudin is present in an unpolymerized. The molecular mechanisms that strictly regulate the polymerization of claudin at the presumptive TJ region are largely unknown.</p><p>Recently, a single transmembrane protein, EpCAM, was identified as an interacting protein of claudin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ladwein et al., 2005</xref>). EpCAM binds to claudin in the lateral membrane of epithelial cells through the interactions between transmembrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nübel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barth et al., 2018</xref>). By binding to EpCAM, claudin is stabilized at the plasma membrane, preventing it from being endocytosed and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Knockout of EpCAM in cultured cells does not affect claudin accumulation at TJs but selectively reduces claudin in the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higashi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Another single transmembrane protein, TROP2, which shows 67% similarity in amino acid sequence to EpCAM, also binds to claudin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenárt et al., 2020</xref>). In the small intestine, only EpCAM is expressed, while in the epidermis, both EpCAM and TROP2 are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabo et al., 2022</xref>). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the EpCAM gene cause a disruption in the barrier function of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, resulting in congenital tufted enteropathy (CTE), characterized by chronic diarrhea and growth delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sivagnanam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozan et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>EpCAM</italic> knockout mice also show similar phenotypes and die within two weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guerra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lei et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, TACSTD2, which encodes the TROP2 protein, is the causative gene for human gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDLD), which causes photophobia and vision loss due to amyloid deposition under the corneal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsujikawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takaoka et al., 2007</xref>). This is because the barrier function of the corneal epithelium is impaired due to TROP2 dysfunction, allowing lactoferrin and apolipoproteins in the tear fluid to penetrate and form amyloid deposits. It was also recently shown that the epidermal barrier function is impaired in TROP2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szabo et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>EpCAM and TROP2 are cleaved in their extracellular regions by matriptase, a transmembrane serine protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Cleavage of EpCAM disrupts the EpCAM-claudin complex, making available unpolymerized claudin for TJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higashi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Higashi et al. proposed the physiological significance of this molecular mechanism, suggesting that when TJs are locally disrupted, serine proteases on the apical side shift their localization to the basolateral side and cleave EpCAM at the basolateral membrane, releasing unpolymerized claudin to repair TJs. In other words, local disruption of TJs allows passive translocation of proteases due to the partial loss of the fence function of TJs, leading to the breakdown of the EpCAM-claudin complex. In this study, we examined in detail the regulation of the EpCAM-claudin complex in the mechanisms to induce de novo TJs during the elimination of apoptotic cells and turnover of the SG2 layer of the epidermis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid de novo TJ formation occurs during apoptotic cell elimination in a Rho-ROCK pathway-dependent manner</title><p> The pioneering work by Rosenblatt and colleagues established that the barrier function of the epithelial cell sheet is preserved even in the face of a mass cell death event triggered by acute UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</xref>). This observation suggests that the epithelium is capable of removing apoptotic cells while maintaining the continuity of TJs uninterrupted. However, the complex logistics of simultaneously breaking down the TJ between apoptotic and neighbor cells and assembling them anew between formally non-interacting cells are not sufficiently known. We first examined claudin dynamics among relevant cells during apoptotic cell elimination in order to understand how these incongruous processes are carried out. Apoptosis was induced in a confluent monolayer of a representative epithelial cell line, EpH4 stably expressing GFP-claudin-3 by pulsed laser irradiation of the nucleus in a targeted cell. Apical extrusion of the apoptotic cell and bicellular accumulation of claudin between newly formed contacts were typically observed over the course of an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Throughout, GFP-claudin-3 remained enriched to some degree between the apoptotic and neighbor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, purple arrowheads). Additionally, linear accumulation of GFP-claudin-3 could be observed more basally by about 40 min post-irradiation and steadily grew more pronounced over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green arrowheads). Immunofluorescence staining showed that other TJ proteins, such as ZO-1 and occludin, colocalize with the basally-enriched claudin, indicating the de novo formation of functional TJs between the newly neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, green arrowheads) before the complete loss of the apoptotic cell-neighbor cell TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, purple arrowheads). Together, these data demonstrate that old and new TJs exist concurrently among the cells involved in apoptotic cell removal to ensure that there is no period of TJ absence that could compromise the epithelial barrier.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rho-ROCK controls de novo tight junction assembly between newly adjacent cells during apical extrusion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the elimination of an apoptotic cell by apical extrusion and de novo tight junction (TJ) formation.

RhoA is also required for the maturation of epithelial cell adhesions through its effect on the underlying circumferential actomyosin and recent reports implicate it in the repair of TJ microinjuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stephenson et al., 2019</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that RhoA could play a role in the rapid de novo TJ formation, such as we see during apoptotic cell removal. Observation of active RhoA in neighbor cells using an effector domain biosensor (GFP-AnillinC) showed sustained activation at the apoptotic cell-neighbor cell interface as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, white arrowheads). Importantly, RhoA activity persisted at newly formed cell contacts after full expulsion of the apoptotic cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, yellow arrowheads). Furthermore, immunostaining revealed phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (ppMLC), a substrate of the RhoA effector ROCK, at such contacts that are clearly located beneath the extruded cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Since contact between protrusions from separated cells is necessary to initiate adhesion formation, we wondered if these lamellipodia alone, previously shown to be independent of both the Rho-ROCK pathway and myosin contractility, could instigate claudin enrichment at newly formed contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonfim-Melo et al., 2022</xref>). By imaging the plasma membrane (mScarlet-PLCδ PH) together with GFP-claudin-3 under ROCK inhibition, we found that claudin no longer accumulated at bicellular contacts once the old apoptotic cell-neighbor cell TJs broke down, despite the completion of basal closure by neighbor cell lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). This observation suggests that de novo TJ formation is impaired by ROCK inhibition. Accordingly, inducing mass apoptosis in the epithelial monolayer by treatment with the anticancer drug doxorubicin caused a significant increase in the leakage of 70 kDa FITC-Dextran when ROCK was simultaneously inhibited, compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Signaling through Rho-ROCK is clearly required for apical extrusion, since the apoptotic cell typically remains loosely embedded in the cell sheet. However, these results collectively hint that its importance in epithelial barrier homeostasis associated with apoptotic cell removal is not limited to this process: it is also critically important for claudin enrichment and/or engagement at new cell-cell contacts, the failure of which precludes the de novo formation of TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-102794-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>EpH4 cells co-expressing GFP-claudin-3 and mScarlet-PLCδPH (membrane marker) in cells neighboring laser-wounded were imaged.</title><p>Cells were pre-treated with H1152 (ROCK inhibitor).

They are thought to protect unpolymerized claudin from degradation to maintain a stable reserve apart from the TJ strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). This prompted us to consider whether they could play a greater role, not only in protecting unpolymerized claudin from degradation but also in inhibiting unregulated claudin polymerization by interfering with the interaction between claudins. Matriptase, a transmembrane serine protease, cleaves the extracellular region of EpCAM and TROP2 to sever their interaction with claudin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). It was recently reported that, of the two, TROP2 plays a greater role in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that Rho-ROCK signaling releases TROP2-bound claudin by activating matriptase.</p><p>Matriptase is normally present at the plasma membrane in an inactive state but it is activated by autocleavage in response to external signals.

To assess the activation state of Matriptase, we employed two mouse monoclonal antibodies: M24, which detects total Matriptase protein levels, and M69, which specifically recognizes the activated form of matriptase. These antibodies have been widely used in previous studies on matriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benaud et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaymon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tseng et al., 2010</xref>). One such study showed that matriptase is activated by simply placing cells in an acidic medium at pH 6.0 for 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tseng et al., 2010</xref>). Addition of acid medium to undifferentiated HaCaT cells decreased the total amount of matriptase and increased the amount of cleaved TROP2 compared to the control, indicating that matriptase is activated and cleaves TROP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This was accompanied by claudin accumulation at cell-cell contacts and an increase in insoluble, i.e., polymerized, claudin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). In an intriguing contrast to the results of Rho-ROCK activation by pharmacological means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>) where we saw development of junction-associated F-actin and AJ maturation simultaneous with claudin polymerization, neither was observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This observation suggests that bypassing Rho-ROCK and activating matriptase directly is sufficient to induce claudin strand assembly. However, treatment with Rho-ROCK activators increased matriptase activity and enhanced TROP2 cleavage, indicating that matriptase is a bona fide effector of Rho-ROCK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of matriptase activity with Camostat treatment suppressed claudin accumulation at cell-cell contacts induced by Rho-ROCK activation, which further supports the notion that activation of matriptase occurs downstream of Rho-ROCK pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that activation of matriptase by Rho-ROCK signaling liberates claudin from sequestration by TROP2 and acts as the rate limiting process in de novo TJ formation; indeed, TROP2 was uniformly present throughout the plasma membrane in undifferentiated cells but it was specifically excluded from the region where claudin was polymerized between cells expressing Rho CA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Rho-ROCK pathway acts upstream of matriptase activation in de novo tight junction (TJ) formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Whole-cell lysates of wild-type (WT) treated with Rho activator (CN-03), Narciclasine, or acid medium (pH 6.0) were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

In wild-type cells, TROP2 is cleaved by matriptase activated via the Rho-ROCK pathway.

We next performed a series of experiments to verify this hypothesis.

Consistent with the result of our experiment with Rho CA overexpression, claudin failed to accumulate at cell-cell junctions in Camostat-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and H</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that an increase in intercellular tension at AJs is indispensable for the formation of TJs in the SG2 layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rübsam et al., 2017</xref>). To assess AJ tension, we stained with the α–18 monoclonal antibody, sensitive to the tension-dependent conformational change of α-catenin, a core AJ component. In control cells, differentiation into granular-layer-like cells led to a marked increase in α–18 signal at cell–cell adhesions. Importantly, when HaCaT cells were treated with Camostat to inhibit matriptase before induction, we observed an equivalent increase in α–18 signal at AJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). However, we did not detect claudin enrichment at cell-cell contacts under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and H</xref>).

Lastly, we sought to extend our findings to the granular layer differentiation of the epidermis. As in undifferentiated HaCaT cells, TROP2 was distributed throughout the plasma membrane of the spinous layer but was progressively lost within the granular layer—particularly at the SG2 layer—as TJs appeared and matured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

However, upon activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway, which activates matriptase, EpCAM or TROP2 is cleaved by matriptase.

It is known to increase the contractile force of cells adjacent to apoptotic cells to enable efficient apoptotic cell elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosenblatt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duszyc et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Slattum et al., 2009</xref>), and recent research using Xenopus embryos showed that local activation of Rho (referred to as Rho Flare) upregulates the contractility of TJ-associated actomyosin at the site of TJ rupture, minimizing TJ disruption and thus barrier breach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stephenson et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we utilized monolayer and stratified epithelial cells, which enabled us to distinguish a novel role of signaling through Rho-ROCK, distinct from its effect on the cytoskeleton: to release the stockpiled claudin—complexed with EpCAM/TROP2—from the lateral membrane to promote rapid de novo TJ assembly. Several previous studies support our proposal. For one, overexpression of constitutively activated RhoA induces ectopic TJs at the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takaishi et al., 1997</xref>). For a more physiologically relevant example, hyperosmotic stress induces rapid expansion of TJs at the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madara, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shiomi et al., 2015</xref>). Considering that Rho-ROCK pathway is known to be hyper-activated by the hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thirone et al., 2009</xref>), the mechanism of supplying polymerizable claudin via the Rho-ROCK pathway is likely to contribute to the adaptive expansion of TJs to hyperosmotic stress in epithelial cells.</p><p>While our results make clear that the cascade of reactions leading to claudin release is triggered by Rho-ROCK-dependent activation of matriptase, the precise mechanism of this step is unclear. A previous study showed that matriptase binds the actin cross-linking protein filamin, the depletion of which severely impairs its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that actin reorganization associated with Rho-ROCK activation allows filamin to engage matriptase and activate it. Alternatively, Rho-ROCK may alter signaling pathways that regulate matriptase activity. Matriptase is intrinsically inhibited by Hai1; Hai1 is cleaved by the membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteases MMP14 and MMP7, which can stably activate matriptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Domoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, MMP14 is targeted to invadopodia in invasive cancer cells via RhoA-dependent exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakurai-Yageta et al., 2008</xref>). The Rho-ROCK pathway may similarly facilitate the delivery of MMP14 and/or MMP7 to the plasma membrane to activate matriptase through Hai1 cleavage. Still another possibility involves the type II transmembrane serine protease Tmprss2, the loss of which results in a significant decrease in matriptase expression and disruption of the TJ barrier but the relationship between Rho-ROCK and Tmprss2 is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rickman et al., 2024</xref>). Clearly, further studies are needed to elucidate how the Rho-ROCK pathway activates matriptase.</p><p>Our analysis focused on matriptase as the protease that cleaves EpCAM/TROP2, but other proteases that process EpCAM/TROP2 have been reported. Recently, Higashi et al. showed that membrane-anchored serine proteinases (MASPs) cleave EpCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higashi et al., 2023</xref>); MASPs are present at the apical surface in polarized epithelial cells. Rupture of TJs results in a partial loss of the TJ fence function, leading to a change in the localization of MASPs from the apical membrane to the lateral membrane. This allows MASPs to cleave the EpCAM-claudin complex at the lateral membrane. By contrast, we found that matriptase is always present in the lateral membrane and actively regulates de novo TJ formation under the control of Rho-ROCK signaling. Whether these two pathways work independently or in parallel, or whether each of these pathway functions only in specific tissues or contexts, needs to be investigated in the future. Additionally, EpCAM is reportedly cleaved by A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 and ADAM17 but it is unknown whether this contributes to de novo TJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maetzel et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, overexpression of Hai1, which specifically inhibits matriptase activity, inhibited the formation of de novo TJs in both apoptotic cell elimination and granular layer differentiation, suggesting that the primary means of freeing sequestered claudin from EpCAM/TROP2 in these contexts is through matriptase.</p><p>In this paper, we show that Rho-ROCK-dependent matriptase activation enables de novo TJ formation in the SG2 layer of the epidermis. Prior studies have shown that applying the ROCK activator Narciclasine to mice with psoriatic dermatitis reduces inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kong et al., 2022</xref>).

However, the molecular basis for the activation of Rho-ROCK pathways to improve the epidermal barrier was not elucidated. Our findings provide a rationale for the validity of these treatments.</p><p>Finally, we revealed that EpCAM/TROP2, besides its role in maintaining a stable pool of unpolymerized claudin at the plasma membrane, functions as a chaperone to facilitate intracellular transport of claudin from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanism of claudin transport to the plasma membrane remains largely unknown. In the future, it will be necessary to further investigate how the interaction of EpCAM/TROP2 and claudin at the trans-Golgi networks helps the intracellular transport of claudin.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and other reagents</title><p>The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting: rabbit anti-claudin-3 pAb (34–1700; Thermo Fisher Scientific); mouse anti-claudin-4 mAb (32–9400; Thermo Fisher Scientific); and rabbit anti-claudin-7 pAb (34–9100; Thermo Fisher Scientific); rabbit anti-α-catenin pAb (C2081; Sigma Aldrich); rabbit anti-claudin-1 pAb (SAB4200534; Sigma Aldrich); rat anti-E-cadherin mAb (ECCD2; Takara Bio); rabbit anti-RhoA mAb (2117; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-phospho-Myosin Light Chain 2 (Thr18/Thr19) mAb (95777; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit anti-TROP2 mAb (ab214488; abcam); rabbit anti-EpCAM pAb (ab71916; abcam); mouse anti-GM130 mAb (610822; BD).

As Reviewer 2 points out, the precise mechanism by which the Rho/ROCK pathway activates matriptase remains unclear. We have discussed the possible molecular mechanisms in the Discussion section. Elucidating the detailed mechanism of matriptase activation will be the focus of our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Comment 1-1 - Matriptase activation by Rho: The authors show activation of Matriptase in western blots by the simple reduction of (full-length?) protein level in Figures 5 and 7. Most publications however show activated Matriptase either by antibodies detecting specifically the active form (including the publication referenced in this manuscript), or the appearance of the activated form next to the inactive form (based on different molecular weights). Therefore, it is not completely clear whether the treatment with Rho activators (Figure 5) results in an overall decrease of Matriptase, or really in an increase in the activated form. Therefore, the authors should show the actual increase of the active form. As a control, the impact of camostat treatment and overexpression of Hai1 on the active form of Matriptase could be included. It also should be indicated in the figure legend how long cells had been treated with the drugs before being subjected to lysis. Moreover, the western blots need to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a more rigorous analysis using the M69 antibody, which specifically recognizes the activated form of matriptase and has been widely used in previous studies（e.g. Benaud et al., 2001; Hung et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2009）. We likewise confirmed a significant increase in M69 signals by both western blotting and immunostaining from samples in which matriptase was activated by acid medium treatment (Figure 5A). Crucially, we also observed matriptase activation with the M69 antibody both in Rho/ROCK activator-treated cells (Figure 5A) and in differentiated granular-layer-like cells (Figures 7A and 7D). These findings strongly support the conclusion that matriptase is activated downstream of the Rho/ROCK pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1-2 - Based on their results, the authors conclude that Matriptase cleaves TROP2 in the SG2 layer of the epidermis, which is a little contradictory to former studies, which have shown Matriptase to be most prominently expressed and active in the basal layer and only little in the spinous layer (e.g Chen et al., Matriptase regulates proliferation and early, but not terminal, differentiation of human keratinocytes. J Invest Dermatol.2013). In this light, one could also argue that inhibiting Matriptase &quot;simply&quot; reduces epidermal differentiation. Can other differentiation markers be tested to rule that the effects on tight junctions are secondary consequences of interferences with earlier / more global steps of keratinocyte differentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, previous studies have demonstrated that matriptase is essential for keratinocyte differentiation, and that it cleaves substrates beyond EpCAM and TROP2—any of which could potentially influence the differentiation process. To test this possibility, we chose to monitor maturation of adherens junction (AJ) as an indicator of keratinocyte differentiation into granular-layer cells. Prior work has shown that during differentiation into granular-layer cells, AJs develop and experience increased intercellular mechanical tension, and that this rise in mechanical tension at AJs is critical for subsequent TJ formation (Rübsam et al., 2017). To assess AJ tension, we stained with the α-18 monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes the tension-dependent conformational change of α-catenin, a core AJ component. In control cells, differentiation into granular-layer like cells led to a marked increase in α-18 signal at cell–cell adhesion sites. Importantly, when HaCaT cells were treated with Camostat to inhibit matriptase and then induced to differentiate, we observed an equivalent increase in α-18 signal at AJs (Figure 7F). However, we did not detect claudin enrichment at cell-cell contacts under these conditions (Figures 7F and 7H). These results suggest that matriptase inhibition does not impair AJ maturation during granular-layer differentiation, but does profoundly disrupt TJ formation. While we cannot rule out the possibility that matriptase acts more broadly from these results, we judged that a comprehensive substrate survey lies outside the scope of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1-3 - In addition, as in Figure 5, full-length levels of Matriptase in Figure 7A need to be complemented by the active version to demonstrate more convincingly that TROP2 processing coincides with (and is most likely caused by) increased Matriptase activation. In the quantification in 7B, levels actually go up again after 2 and 4 hours. How is that explained, and what would this mean with respect to tight junction formation seen at 24 h of differentiation? The TROP2 cleavage shown in Figure 7A should be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is related to Comment 1-1. Using the M69 antibody, which specifically recognizes the activated matriptase, we directly demonstrated that matriptase activation occurs during the differentiation of granular layer-like cells (Figures 7A and 7D). Furthermore, we performed quantitative analysis of TROP2 cleavage and found that, compared with undifferentiated cells, differentiation into granular-layer like cells was accompanied by an increase in the cleaved TROP2 fragments (Figures 7A and 7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Comment 1-4 - Figure 1B and C: Including orthogonal views would be a nice add-on to appreciate the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have added the corresponding orthogonal views to Figure 1B and Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1-5 - Figure 2D: last row: indication of orthogonal view.</p></disp-quote><p>We stated that the bottom panels are orthogonal views in the figure legend of Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1-6 - Figure 3A: quantification is missing.

We also found that matriptase consistently localizes to the basolateral membrane but more crucially that it becomes activated there during differentiation into granular layer cells. We added these new data as Figures 7C-7E in the revised manuscript.
