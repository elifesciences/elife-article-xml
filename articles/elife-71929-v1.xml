tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be overcome during transformation. We previously demonstrated that AKT-induced senescence (AIS) is associated with profound transcriptional and metabolic changes. Here, we demonstrate that human fibroblasts undergoing AIS display upregulated cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression and enhanced uptake of exogenous cysteine, which lead to increased hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and glutathione (GSH) production, consequently protecting senescent cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. CBS depletion allows AIS cells to escape senescence and re-enter the cell cycle, indicating the importance of CBS activity in maintaining AIS. Mechanistically, we show this restoration of proliferation is mediated through suppressing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by reducing mitochondrial localized CBS while retaining antioxidant capacity of transsulfuration pathway. These findings implicate a potential tumor-suppressive role for CBS in cells with aberrant PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Consistent with this concept, in human gastric cancer cells with activated PI3K/AKT signaling, we demonstrate that CBS expression is suppressed due to promoter hypermethylation. CBS loss cooperates with activated PI3K/AKT signaling in promoting anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells, while CBS restoration suppresses the growth of gastric tumors in vivo. Taken together, we find that CBS is a novel regulator of AIS and a potential tumor suppressor in PI3K/AKT-driven gastric cancers, providing a new exploitable metabolic vulnerability in these cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>PI3K/AKT signaling</kwd><kwd>cystathionine-β-synthase</kwd><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>glutathione</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant#1053792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant#1162052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000951</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council Victoria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project grant#1184873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship#1058586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008018</institution-id><institution>Victorian Cancer Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellowship (MCRF19007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanij</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cystathionine-β-synthase is a novel metabolic regulator of AKT-induced senescence and a potential tumor suppressor in gastric cancer pathogenesis which can be harnessed to target PI3K/AKT-driven cancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperactivation of oncogenic pathways such as RAS/ERK or PI3K/AKT can cause cellular senescence in non-transformed cells, termed oncogene-induced senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to the well-studied RAS-induced senescence (RIS), we and others have demonstrated that hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway causes a senescence-like phenotype, referred to as AKT-induced senescence (AIS) or PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alimonti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jung et al., 2019</xref>). AIS is characterized by the common senescence hallmarks including cell cycle arrest, a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), global transcriptional changes, and metabolic hyperactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). Distinct from RIS, AIS does not display either p16 upregulation, a DNA damage response or senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Instead, AIS is associated with elevated p53 expression through increased mTORC1-dependent translation and reduced human double minute 2 (HDM2) dependent destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astle et al., 2012</xref>). Disruption of the critical mechanisms that regulate maintenance of oncogene-induced senescence can lead to tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collado et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate AIS and how they are subverted will provide opportunities to identify therapeutic strategies for suppressing PI3K/AKT-driven cancer development.</p><p>We identified 98 key regulators in a whole-genome siRNA AIS escape screen and validated a subset of these genes in the functional studies to confirm their role in AIS maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, 11 genes were associated with the regulation of metabolism, suggesting that an altered metabolism could be integral for maintaining AIS. In particular, the cystathionine-β-synthase (<italic>CBS</italic>) was ranked as one of the top metabolic gene candidates with loss of expression leading to AIS escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>), but how it does so is not known.</p><p>CBS is an enzyme involved in the transsulfuration metabolic pathway. CBS converts homocysteine (Hcy), a key metabolite in the transmethylation pathway, to cystathionine which is subsequently hydrolyzed by cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) to form cysteine, the crucial precursor for GSH production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). CBS also catalyzes the production of H<sub>2</sub>S, a diffusible gaseous transmitter that modulates mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Módis et al., 2014</xref>), exerts antioxidant effects through inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wen et al., 2013</xref>), and stimulates antioxidant production via sulfhydration of key proteins involved in antioxidant defense such as Keap1 and p66Shc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paul and Snyder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, CBS acts through control of Hcy, H<sub>2</sub>S, and GSH metabolism and exerts diverse biological functions including regulating DNA methylation, mitochondrial respiration, and redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) expression and transsulfuration pathway activity are elevated in AKT-induced senescence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram illustrating that the cytoplasmic localized CBS regulates transmethylation and transsulfuration metabolic pathways, and mitochondrial localized CBS regulates oxidative phosphorylation.

We thus examined the expression levels of CTH, a key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway and xCT, the Xc- amino acid antiporter responsible for the uptake of cystine (an oxidized form of cysteine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both CTH and xCT were upregulated in AIS cells compared to proliferating control cells, suggesting an elevated cysteine synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway and cysteine uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, senescent cells expressing HRAS<sup>V12</sup> cells exhibited a moderate increase of CBS and CTH expression levels. The expression level of xCT was also slightly upregulated during RIS, albeit to a lesser extent than during AIS, in line with the finding that upregulation of xCT facilitates RAS-mediated transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To assess transsulfuration pathway activity, we measured H<sub>2</sub>S production. A significant increase in transsulfuration pathway activity was observed in BJ-TERT fibroblasts upon AKT but not HRAS hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that activation of transsulfuration pathway is a specific cellular response to constitutive activation of AKT.

Loss of CBS in AIS cells significantly decreased the proportion of cells with SA-βGal activity, increased EdU incorporation, and enhanced colony formation, demonstrating an essential role of CBS in AIS maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further confirm the on-target specificity of the knockdown, we generated BJ-TERT cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible <italic>CBS</italic> shRNA and an shRNA-resistant 4-OHT-inducible estrogen receptor (ER)-tagged CBS fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon expressing myrAKT1, these cells underwent AIS, as indicated by a significant increase in SA-βGal-positive cells and decrease in EdU-positive cells and, consistent with the finding in the AIS escape siRNA screen, CBS depletion induced by doxycycline decreased SA-βGal activity, and increased EdU incorporation in AIS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

While loss of CBS released AIS cells from cell cycle arrest, knockdown of <italic>CBS</italic> did not significantly change the mRNA and protein expression level of several key SASP-related genes including <italic>IL1A</italic>, <italic>IL1B</italic>, <italic>IL6,</italic> and <italic>IL8</italic>, which are upregulated during AIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Astle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Given the p53 and Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) pathways predominantly control senescence-mediated cell cycle arrest, we examined signaling downstream of AKT activation in the presence and absence of CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, p53 and its downstream target p21 were upregulated during AIS, but depletion of CBS had no effect on these levels. Furthermore, total Rb, a key regulator of the G1/S phase transition, and its inhibitory phosphorylated form at serine 807/811 were markedly suppressed in AIS and partially rescued upon CBS knockdown. Cyclin A, which mediates S to G2/M phase cell cycle progression, was also upregulated upon depleting CBS in AIS cells. These results demonstrate that CBS depletion can restore the proliferation of cells that have undergone AIS in a p53-independent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Depletion of CBS in AIS cells does not affect cysteine and GSH abundance in cysteine-replete conditions</title><p>CBS is the key enzyme regulating the transsulfuration and transmethylation pathways. By analysis of the data from the AIS escape siRNA screen, we found that except <italic>CBS</italic>, siRNA knockdown of other genes involved in the transsulfuration and transmethylation pathway did not significantly affect AIS cell numbers (robust Z score &lt;2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that AIS escape in cysteine-replete conditions upon CBS loss is through a transsulfuration/transmethylation pathway-independent mechanism. In addition, knockdown of <italic>CBS</italic> did not affect the expression levels of CTH and xCT when BJ-TERT cells were grown in cysteine-replete culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To explore metabolic alterations that are associated with CBS-mediated AIS maintenance, we performed gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based untargeted metabolomics. AIS (myrAKT1-shCtrl), AIS-escaped (myrAKT1-sh<italic>CBS</italic>), and control proliferating cells (pBabe-shCtrl) displayed distinct metabolic profiles, as indicated by principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). AIS cells showed increased abundance of serine, glycine, and glutamate, the metabolites involved in transsulfuration pathway and GSH synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Loss of CBS did not affect abundance of these metabolites but resulted in an increased level of Hcy, suggesting loss of CBS causes an accumulation of the upstream substrate Hcy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To further determine the activity of the transsulfuration pathway in AIS cells and the impact of CBS loss, we performed a stable isotope tracing assay using serine labeled at the third carbon position ([3–13C] L-serine) followed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) after thiol derivatization with <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This tracer has been reported to incorporate into the cellular GSH pool via transsulfuration-derived cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). We replaced all the serine in the culture medium with [3–13C] L-serine. After 6 hr of labeling, a substantial fraction of [3–13C] L-serine was detected intracellularly and in the cystathionine pool in proliferating (pBabe-siOTP), AIS (myrAKT1-siOTP), and AIS-escaped (myrAKT1-si<italic>CBS</italic>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). We did not detect [3–13C] L-serine incorporation into cysteine and GSH in proliferating cells, possibly due to the short time period of metabolic labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). However, AIS cells displayed a small but significant fraction of 13C labeled cysteine and GSH along with a significant increase of total levels of serine, cysteine, and GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-E</xref>), indicating upregulation of transsulfuration pathway activity during AIS. Consistent with the role of CBS in catalyzing de novo cystathionine synthesis, a significant decrease of cystathionine abundance was observed in CBS-depleted AIS cells. Notably, the abundance of cysteine and GSH was not affected by CBS depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>) and neither was H<sub>2</sub>S production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We hypothesized that CBS-depleted cells maintained the cysteine and GSH pools via increase of cysteine uptake from the culture medium. Indeed, deprivation of cysteine from the medium markedly diminished the intracellular cysteine and GSH abundance in AIS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). On the other hand, increase of cystathionine was observed in the cysteine-depleted conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), possibly attributed to a marked upregulation of CBS expression observed in AIS cells after cysteine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This result suggests that cells enhance CBS-mediated transsulfuration pathway activity in response to cysteine deficiency. If cells rely on exogenous cysteine to maintain cysteine and GSH pools, blocking cysteine import would impair GSH synthesis and antioxidant capacity and consequently reduce cell viability. Consistent with this hypothesis, the viability of both proliferating cells and AIS cells was decreased after treatment with erastin, an inhibitor of cystine-glutamate antiporter Xc-, and further suppressed by <italic>CBS</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these results conclusively demonstrate that exogenous cysteine is the major source for GSH synthesis and AKT overexpression increases cysteine import and the subsequent GSH abundance. As the loss of CBS does not affect intracellular cysteine and GSH levels, senescence escape upon CBS depletion is mediated by the mechanisms independent of the transsulfuration pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Depletion of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) in AKT-induced senescence (AIS) cells does not affect cysteine and glutathione (GSH) abundance in cysteine-replete conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of [3–13C] serine isotope tracing.

Subsequent genetic or epigenetic changes can disengage this brake and lead to oncogenic transformation. Deregulated metabolism along with cell cycle withdrawal, SASP, and macromolecular damage are hallmarks of the senescence phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorgoulis et al., 2019</xref>). Oxidative stress is a key metabolic feature of RAS-induced senescence and ROS triggers DNA damage and proliferative arrest in RIS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irani et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogrunc et al., 2014</xref>). Activation of AKT can also increase intracellular ROS levels by stimulating oxidative phosphorylation and impairing ROS scavenging by inhibition of FoxO transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nogueira et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we demonstrate increased mitochondrial abundance and respiratory activity, as well as ROS production in the senescent-like cells resulting from AKT hyperactivation. Alleviation of oxidative stress by antioxidant treatment partially releases AIS cells from cell division arrest, supporting that ROS is required for AIS maintenance.</p><p>On the other hand, activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been observed to induce a potent antioxidant response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoxhaj and Manning, 2020</xref>) that may antagonize the tumor-suppressive AIS. One major ROS-scavenging mechanism by the PI3K/AKT pathway is through sustained activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mitsuishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rada et al., 2011</xref>). In this study we uncovered another mechanism of AKT-mediated ROS detoxification occurring through increased cysteine import and enhanced GSH and H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). We found that AKT activation markedly increased xCT protein expression, a cystine-glutamate antiporter encoded by <italic>SLC7A11</italic>, indicating the increase of extracellular cystine uptake in AIS. Isotope tracing coupled with LC-MS analysis revealed that in cysteine-replete conditions AIS cells exhibited an elevated intracellular cysteine level and subsequent increased production of GSH and H<sub>2</sub>S, the critical components in the antioxidant system, which was abrogated by cysteine deprivation. Previous studies have shown that H<sub>2</sub>S inhibits H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction by preserving the protein expression levels and activity of key antioxidant enzymes, inhibiting ROS production and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wen et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, these effects may be associated with sulfhydration of Keap1 and activation of Nrf2 or increased production of the antioxidant GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koike et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to antioxidant effects, H<sub>2</sub>S can modulate mitochondrial functions and cellular bioenergetics in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations, H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a mitochondrial electron donor to mitochondrial complex II, resulting in bioenergetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szabo et al., 2013</xref>). At high concentrations, H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a mitochondrial poison via the inhibition of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase in mitochondrial complex IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panagaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>). Our finding that suppression of H<sub>2</sub>S by AOAA exacerbates proliferative arrest of AKT-hyperactivated cells supports a protective effect of H<sub>2</sub>S from oxidative stress-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The protective role of the transsulfuration pathway in AIS is further supported by the finding that myrAKT1-expressing cells are resistant to exogenous cysteine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, we propose that increased levels of GSH and H<sub>2</sub>S through the transsulfuration pathway during AIS maintenance enhance the antioxidant capacity of AIS cells, protecting senescent cells from ROS-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).</p><p>Paradoxically, depletion of CBS, a key enzyme involved in the transsulfuration pathway, led to AIS escape, indicating that CBS is required for AIS maintenance. Indeed, we found that under cysteine-replete conditions, CBS depletion did not affect the production of antioxidants (GSH and H<sub>2</sub>S) downstream of the transsulfuration pathway. Instead, in AIS cells CBS mitochondrial localization was enhanced, resulting in an increase of ROS production through upregulated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which contributes to maintenance of AIS status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Intriguingly, a recent publication reported that overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>S by increased mitochondrial-localized CBS expression results in suppression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production in the fibroblasts from Down syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panagaki et al., 2019</xref>). This discrepancy could be partially explained by the bell-shaped or biphasic biological effect of H<sub>2</sub>S as described above.</p><p>Oncogene-induced senescence acts as a critical tumor-suppressive brake and this senescence brake is disengaged during tumorigenesis. Based on our observation that loss of CBS promoted AIS escape in normal cells, we propose a potential tumor-suppressive role for CBS in cancers harboring PI3K/AKT pathway activation. We demonstrated suppression of <italic>CBS</italic> expression in primary gastric tumor tissues and a panel of human gastric cancer cell lines through epigenetic silencing. In parallel, a negative correlation between CBS and xCT expression was observed in gastric cancer cell lines, which is consistent with a recent report that cancer cells maintain intracellular cysteine levels and sustain cell proliferation by increasing xCT-mediated cysteine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). We further demonstrated that loss of CBS cooperates with AKT hyperactivation to promote anchorage-independent growth of gastric epithelial cells and restoration of CBS expression inhibited PI3K/AKT hyperactive gastric tumor growth. Induction of apoptosis and impairment of gastric cancer cell metastasis by increasing H<sub>2</sub>S production upon NaHS treatment has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Whether the tumor-suppressive effect of CBS in gastric cancer cells is mediated through H<sub>2</sub>S requires further investigation.</p><p>Taken together, our study identifies CBS as a novel regulator of AIS maintenance and a potential tumor suppressor in gastric cancer pathogenesis, potentially providing a new metabolic vulnerability that can be harnessed to target PI3K/AKT/mTORC1-driven cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>BJ-TERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts were a gift from Robert Weinberg (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA).

After cystine depletion/repletion for 2 days, the culture medium was replaced with the basal isotope labelling medium containing 400 μM [3–13C] serine or unlabeled serine and 10% dialyzed FBS, in the absence and presence of cystine for 6 hr. After washing cells with saline, liquid nitrogen was immediately poured into plates. Once liquid nitrogen was evaporated, the plates were stored at –80°C.</p><p>To collect and analyze metabolites, we optimized thiol derivatization using <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and LC/MS-based detection as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ortmayr et al., 2015</xref>). Plates were transferred from –80°C and the ice-cold extraction buffer containing 50 mM NEM (Sigma-Aldrich, #E3876) in 80% v/v methanol and 20% v/v 10 mM ammonium formate (Sigma-Aldrich, #516961) at pH 7 was added.

Samples were mixed at 4°C on a vortex mixer for at 1 hr at 1000 rpm before centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were stored on ice and sent for LC-MS analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ortmayr et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, metabolites were separated on an Dionex Ultimate 3000RS HPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using an InfinityLab Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.9 µm) HPLC column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) maintained at 25°C with buffer A (20 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 9.0; Sigma-Aldrich) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 300 μl/min. Chromatographic gradient started at 90% B, decreased gradually over 10 min to 65% B, then to 20% B at 11.5 min, stayed at 20% B until 13 min, returned to 90% B at 14 min and equilibrated at 90% B until 20 min. Metabolites were detected by mass spectrometry on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a heated electrospray ionization source. LC-MS data was collected using full-scan acquisition in positive and negative ion mode utilizing polarity switching. Data processing was performed using Tracefinder application for quantitative analysis (Thermo Scientific). NEM-derivatized thiols were detected in negative ion mode. Metabolite identification was based on accurate mass, retention time, and authentic reference standards. Peak intensities were normalized with cell numbers, and the statistical analyses were carried out using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bioenergetics analysis using the Seahorse XF96 extracellular flux analyzer</title><p>All bioenergetics analyses were performed using the Seahorse Bioscience XF96 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard White as the Senior Editor.

All three Reviewers commented on this.</p></disp-quote><p>To more thoroughly assess the activity of the transsulfuration pathway in AKT-induced senescent (AIS) cells and the impact of loss of CBS, we performed a stable isotope tracing assay using ([3-13C] L-serine) followed by LC/MS after thiol derivatization with NEthylmaleimide in proliferating cells, AIS cells and AIS cells with CBS knockdown. We performed the experiments in cysteine-replete and depleted conditions. The data is shown in Figure 3A-3E in the revised manuscript. These results conclusively demonstrate that exogenous cysteine is the major source for GSH synthesis and AKT overexpression increases cysteine import and the subsequent GSH abundance. Loss of CBS does not affect intracellular cysteine and GSH level. Therefore, senescence escape upon CBS depletion is mediated by the mechanisms independent of the transsulfuration pathway.</p><p>Please see our detailed responses to the question #1 from Reviewer 1, the question #3 from Reviewer 2 and the question #1 from Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More convincing evidence of mitochondrial localization of CBS and of the importance of mitochondrial CBS in senescence. See in particular the comments from Reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that providing additional evidence of mitochondrial localization of CBS will further highlight the importance of mitochondrial CBS in AKT-induced senescence maintenance. We provide new data in the revised manuscript including (1) Figure 4C showing increased CBS expression in mitochondrial fractions isolated from AIS cells; (2) Figure 4D showing Cterminally FLAG-tagged CBS was resistant to the protease treatment of intact mitochondria and only digested when the mitochondrial membrane was solubilized by Triton-X detergent in a protease protection assay.

Figure 4G and 4H showed that in contrast to the finding that expression of wild type CBS could re-instate senescence, cells expressing C-terminal truncated CBS protein failed to do so. Accordingly, Figure 5D, 5E and 5F showed that expression of wild type CBS in CBS-depleted AIS escaped cells increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation while expression of C-terminal truncated CBS did not affect its activity. Therefore, CBS mitochondrial localization is required for CBS-dependent changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Our results thus strongly support AKT overexpression promotes CBS translocation to mitochondria and induces oxidative stress by increasing oxidative phosphorylation to sustain senescence state.</p><p>Please see our detailed response to the questions #1 and #2 from the Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In Figure 2F, the text states that p53 is upregulated by AIS, but this is not clear from the western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated the Western blot for p53 to more clearly show upregulation of p53 in AIS cells (Figure 2F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The validation of mitochondrial localized CBS in Figure 4 is not convincing, based on the resolution of the images, the few cells presented, and the single region evaluated.

C-terminally FLAG-tagged CBS was present in intact mitochondria and was resistant to protease treatment. It was only digested when the membrane was solubilized by Triton X-100 detergent, in a manner similar to that of mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit α ATP5A protein. These results thus strongly support a mitochondrial localization of CBS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To demonstrate the requirement for mitochondrial CBS, the authors should rescue their knockdown cell lines with version of CBS in which the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) is deleted, and test the effects on oxygen consumption and ROS, escape from AIS, and tumorigenesis.

A non-canonical mitochondrial targeting signal has been reported to reside within the C-terminal CBSD2 motif (Teng et al., PNAS 2013). To confirm the CBSD2 motif is required for CBS residing on mitochondria, we expressed wild type CBS and mutants with deletion of the heme-binding domain (Δ1-70) or C-terminal regulatory domain CBSD2 (Δ468-551) in BJ-TERT cells depleted of endogenous CBS. Consistent with previous finding (Teng et al., PNAS 2013), loss of CBSD2 motif abrogated CBS mitochondrial localization <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-71929-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To test sufficiency, we also generated CBS mutants with synthetic mitochondrial targeting sequences (Chin RM et al., Cell Reports 2018; Kang YC et al., Experimental and Molecular Medicine 2018) but found they did not express (Lane 10 and 11 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-71929-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To evaluate the functional significance of mitochondrial localization of CBS-dependent on AIS maintenance, we reconstituted CBS-depleted AIS escaped cells with wild type CBS or the CBSD2 truncation mutant. Expression of wild type CBS prevented AIS escape as evidenced by a decrease of EdU positive cells and increase of SA-βGal-positive cells. In contrast, cells expressing the C-terminally truncated CBS protein escaped from AIS (Figure 4G and 4H in the revised manuscript), demonstrating that mitochondrial localization of CBS is required to maintain AIS.To further confirm that in AIS cells, CBS-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation requires mitochondrial localization, we performed Seahorse analysis in AIS cells expressing either wild type or C-terminal truncation mutant CBS protein (Figure 5C in the revised manuscript). Reconstitution with wild type CBS rescued basal OCR and ATP production levels in CBSdepleted AIS cells. In contrast, AIS cells expressing the C-terminal truncated CBS protein failed to restore basal OCR and ATP production (Figure 5E and 5F). Collectively, our results strongly support the concept that AKT overexpression promotes CBS translocation to mitochondria and subsequently increases energy metabolism to sustain the senescence state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Import of cysteine (via the xCT transporter) potentially compensates for the abundance of transsulfuration and glutathione-related metabolites in the setting of CBS loss.

The results showed that the abundance of cysteine and GSH was not affected by CBS depletion (Figure 3D and 3E in the revised manuscript). However, deprivation of cysteine from the medium markedly diminished the intracellular cysteine and GSH abundance in AIS cells. Our results support the concept that AIS cells rely on exogenous cysteine to maintain cysteine and GSH pools. Please see the details in our response to the question #1 from Reviewer 1.</p><p>Furthermore, as suggested we treated cells with erastin and showed that the viability of both proliferating cells and AIS cells was decreased after treatment with erastin, and further suppressed by CBS knockdown (Figure 3-supplement 1F). Collectively, our results suggest that cells rely on exogenous cysteine for GSH synthesis and AKT overexpression increases cysteine import and the subsequent GSH abundance which is not affected by loss of CBS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

As [3-13C] L-serine is known to be incorporated into the cellular GSH pool via transulfuration pathway-derived cysteine (Zhu et al., Cell Metabolism 2019), we therefore established the conditions for [3-13C] L-serine isotope tracing experiment and performed LC-MS analysis rather than using C13-glutamine. We demonstrated that GSH abundance was increased in AIS cells. CBS knockdown in cysteine-replete medium diminished cystathionine synthesis but did not affect the abundance of cysteine and GSH due to an increased uptake of exogenous cysteine (Figure 3A-3E). We believe that these data strongly support the finding that senescence escape upon CBS knockdown is mediated by a transsulfuration pathway-independent mechanism. Therefore, we did not perform C13-glutamine isotope tracing experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The data analysis showed that PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signaling pathway alterations occur in 33% of gastric cancer (142 of 441 samples) with PIK3CA, AKT and PTEN alterations being the most common genetic alterations (Figure 6-supplement 1A). CBS genetic alterations were found in 18 of 441 gastric cancers with 12 cases cooccurring with mutations in PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway. There was a significant association between CBS mutations and PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway activation in gastric cancer (P-value = 0.0031, 95% CI=1.5202 to 14.9139 and odds ratio 4.4905).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

In Figure 1 we demonstrated that the antioxidant capacity derived from transsulfuration pathway protected AIS cells from cysteine deprivation-induced cell death. While CBS is the key enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, in Figure 2 we showed that loss of CBS does not affect AIS cell viability but rather allows AIS cells to escape senescence and re-enter the cell cycle. In Figure 3, 4 and 5, we characterized the mechanisms underlying CBS knockdown-mediated AIS escape. In the revised manuscript, we generated new data including Figure 3A-3E by [3-13C] L-serine isotope tracing and LC-MS analysis and Figure 4C-4H and Figure 5D-5F together with our original data to strongly support the finding that the CBS knockdown-mediated AIS escape occurs through suppressing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation while retaining antioxidant capacity of the transsulfuration pathway.</p><p>We have now summarized our findings in the revised manuscript as:</p><p>“Together, these results strongly support the concept that increased oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production sustain AIS status that require CBS. In parallel, AKT activation increases exogenous cysteine import and transsulfuration pathway activity, which consequently stimulates GSH and H2S production, thereby protecting AIS cells from ROS-induced cell death. Importantly, this AKT-dependent increase of the antioxidant capacity is retained in CBS-deficient cells and thus contributes to escape of AIS cells from cell cycle arrest (Figure 4J).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
