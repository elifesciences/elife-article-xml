aging-related diseases. Tetrapeptides with alternating cationic and aromatic residues such as SS-31 (elamipretide) show promise as therapeutic compounds for mitochondrial disorders. In this study, we conducted a quantitative structure-activity analysis of three alternative tetrapeptide analogs, benchmarked against SS-31, that differ with respect to aromatic side chain composition and sequence register. We present the first structural models for this class of compounds, obtained with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics approaches, showing that all analogs except for SS-31 form compact reverse turn conformations in the membrane-bound state. All peptide analogs bound cardiolipin-containing membranes, yet they had significant differences in equilibrium binding behavior and membrane interactions. Notably, analogs had markedly different effects on membrane surface charge, supporting a mechanism in which modulation of membrane electrostatics is a key feature of their mechanism of action. The peptides had no strict requirement for side chain composition or sequence register to permeate cells and target mitochondria in mammalian cell culture assays. All four peptides were pharmacologically active in serum withdrawal cell stress models yet showed significant differences in their abilities to restore mitochondrial membrane potential, preserve ATP content, and promote cell survival. Within our peptide set, the analog containing tryptophan side chains, SPN10, had the strongest impact on most membrane properties and showed greatest efficacy in cell culture studies. Taken together, these results show that side chain composition and register influence the activity of these mitochondria-targeted peptides, helping provide a framework for the rational design of next-generation therapeutics with enhanced potency.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>peptide therapeutics</kwd><kwd>membrane interactions</kwd><kwd>NMR structure</kwd><kwd>structure-activity relationship</kwd><kwd>cardiolipin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AG065879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alder</surname><given-names>Nathan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM119762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>Eric R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002651</institution-id><institution>Barth Syndrome Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Idea Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alder</surname><given-names>Nathan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequence-variant analogs of mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptides have distinct patterns of membrane-bound conformations, effects on membrane properties, and abilities to protect mitochondria subject to stress, illuminating how side chain variation can be leveraged in the development of more effective therapeutic compounds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As regulators of energy metabolism, mitochondria house the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes that produce &gt;90% of cellular ATP. Mitochondria also coordinate key cellular processes including lipid biosynthesis, ion homeostasis, and cell death. Consequently, mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in tissues with high energy demand, is central to the etiology of many complex pathologies including cancer, cardiopathy, neurodegeneration, aging-related ailments, and heritable (primary) mitochondrial disease. Despite this, there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases.</p><p>Mitochondria-targeted cationic-aromatic tetrapeptides are among the most promising pharmacological interventions under development for the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction. Also termed Szeto-Schiller (SS) peptides, these first-in-class compounds are synthetic C-terminally amidated tetrapeptides with a motif of alternating cationic and aromatic residues that is thought to be important for their ability to traverse membranes in a variety of cell types and to concentrate in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>). Many in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies, primarily with the lead compound SS-31 (elamipretide), support the therapeutic efficacy of these peptides. Studies with isolated mitochondria and cell cultures show that SS-31 improves electron transfer efficiency and increases ATP production while reducing electron leak and reactive oxygen species production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Siegel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>). Animal studies have demonstrated the ability of SS-31 to maintain cellular bioenergetics under stress conditions such as ischemia, hypoxia, and aging-related dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campbell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szeto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The clinical efficacy of SS-31 has been demonstrated for primary mitochondrial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Reid Thompson et al., 2021</xref>) and for age-related chronic diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Roshanravan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Progress toward elucidating the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of these peptides has come on several fronts. Early studies suggested that SS peptides target the lipid bilayers of mitochondrial membranes through interactions with cardiolipin (CL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Birk et al., 2015</xref>), the anionic phospholipid that is enriched in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and required for proper membrane morphology and function of membrane-bound complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paradies et al., 2019</xref>). This bilayer-mediated mechanism is supported by work with model systems in which peptide inhibited peroxidase activity of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birk et al., 2014</xref>) and improved cristae ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Szeto and Liu, 2018</xref>). Recent work from our group quantitatively evaluated SS-31 interactions with CL-containing membranes, showing that the peptide affected lamellar bilayer properties (e.g. lipid lateral diffusion and packing interactions), with the most notable effect being on membrane electrostatics based on down-regulation of the surface potential (ψ<sub>s</sub>) that originates from the negatively-charged membrane interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Other recent work has focused on the interactions of SS-31 with mitochondrial proteins. Based on a crosslinking/mass-spectrometry approach with a biotinylated SS-31 analog, the SS-31 interactome was shown to include a subset of membrane complexes primarily involved in ATP-generating processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chavez et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, in aged cardiomyocytes, SS-31 was shown to reduce proton leak mediated by the adenosine nucleotide transporter (ANT1) and stabilize the ATP synthasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, almost all of these SS-31-interactive proteins are known to themselves bind CL. Therefore, mitochondrial lipid composition plays a key role in modulating the molecular interactions of SS-31.</p><p>Despite these insights, the lack of information relating the structure and function of these mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptides presents a barrier to a full understanding of their MoA. An effective strategy to address this mechanistic knowledge gap is to test the effects of expanding the sequence space of mitochondria-targeted peptides using structure-activity analyses. In this study, we evaluated three sequence-variant peptides that differed with respect to aromatic side chain content and cationic/aromatic register, compared with the SS-31 benchmark. Our results provide a direct assessment of the tetrapeptides with respect to their membrane-bound conformations, effects on membrane properties, and relative efficacies in preserving cellular viability under stress. This work reveals that side chain composition has a profound effect on the structure and activity of these mitochondria-targeted peptides. Notably, the analog containing tryptophan side chains had the greatest potency in cell stress models, which we can correlate with many of its molecular-level interactions and effects on reductionist membrane systems. This work establishes potential directions for the rational design of next-generation tetrapeptide analogs with enhanced efficacy as mitochondrial therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tetrapeptide analog set: design and rationale</title><p>In this study, we compared a test set of four tetrapeptides with different sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An alphabet of two basic residues (Arg and Lys) and three aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr and Trp) gives 3<sup>2</sup> × 2<sup>2</sup> × 2=72 possible sequence permutations with an alternating aromatic (φ)/basic (B) sequence periodicity (B-φ-B-φ or φ-B-φ-B). However, the number of sequences becomes much larger if D-amino acids (which can extend the medicinal lifetimes of peptides) and/or unnatural amino acids (which increase functional versatility) are included. A large library of peptides precludes detailed structural and functional studies, so we focused on a limited test set of peptides to investigate two fundamental properties: (i) the side chain register (B-φ-B-φ vs. φ-B-φ-B) and (ii) the types of aromatic side chains. The cationic/aromatic register has potential structural ramifications, e.g., in determining the polar interactions between peptide basic groups and CL. Aromatic amino acid type can modulate hydrophobicity, aromaticity, polarity, and hydrogen bonding capacities, which in turn can affect both peptide structure and peptide-membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McDonald and Fleming, 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Peptide structures and membrane-driven peptide folding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peptide sequences and chemical structures.

The radius of hydration for the SS-20 peptide was calculated as R<sub>h,SS-20</sub> = (D<sub>DSS</sub>/D<sub>SS-20</sub>)*R<sub>h,DSS</sub> = 5.31±0.64, using a value of 3.34 Å for the R<sub>h,DSS</sub> of the reference standard. As a further test, we did a 1:100 dilution of the SS-peptide from 10 mM to 0.1 mM and also obtained a similar R<sub>h,SS-20</sub> of 5.7±0.7 Å (not shown). From literature peptide calibration studies (ref. 32), the expected R<sub>h</sub> values are 4.9 Å for a four-residue peptide and 7.2 Å for a peptide twice as large (eight residues).

These two analogs differ only with respect to the second-position aromatic residue. SS-31 contains the unnatural amino acid 2,6-dimethyl tyrosine (Dmt), known to be important for free radical scavenging by this peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, SPN4 replaces Dmt with Tyr. Proteinogenic Tyr also has the phenolic OH group that can scavenge radicals and mediate H-bond interactions but allows us to evaluate the effect of the two tyrosine methyl groups on peptide structure and function. Additionally, our test set included two analogs with φ-B-φ-B register, SS-20, and SPN10. With its Phe/Phe aromatic composition, SS-20 does not possess the free radical scavenging properties of SS-31; however, SS-20 is known to target mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alta et al., 2017</xref>) and has also demonstrated efficacy with many mitochondrial disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Szeto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). This confirms that scavenging activity is not an essential feature of the MoA of this class of compounds. Finally, SPN10 is unique in our test set in that it contains only L-enantiomer side chains, and it has two Trp residues that combine a bulky bicyclic indole group with a pyrrole-like NH that can mediate H-bond interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The free peptides are extended but have some residual structure due to aromatic interactions</title><p>As a first step toward comparing the four peptides, we determined their NMR structures in solution.

Furthermore, using SS-20 as a representative peptide, we used pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR diffusion experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whitehead et al., 2022</xref>) to confirm that the free peptides are in a monomeric state under the conditions used for NMR analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To characterize distance contacts in solution, we therefore collected rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Williamson, 2009</xref>), as the signs of crosspeaks in this experiment are invariant to molecular size (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel B). We obtained roughly 30–50 distance constraints per peptide for NMR structure calculations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, although the free peptide NMR structures are relatively disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we did observe some residual structure influenced by the side chain register. Specifically, tetrapeptides with a B-φ-B-φ motif (SS-31 and SPN4) had lower root mean square deviation (RMSD) values (better structural precision) and three non-sequential NOEs, whereas those with a φ-B-φ-B motif (SS-20 and SPN10) lacked non-sequential NOEs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Importantly, the non-sequential NOEs in SS-31 and SPN4 occurred between the two aromatic residues, consistent with previous observations that residual structure is more common in short peptides containing aromatic side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Neri et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith et al., 1994</xref>). Additional interactions that appear to stabilize the tetrapeptide structures in solution are cation-π interactions between neighboring basic and aromatic amino acids. These are supported by significant upfield ring current shifts for some of the basic residue side chain nuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), for all peptides except SS-31.</p><p>As a second approach to assessing peptide solution structures, we performed all-atom MD simulations (200 ns each) of the peptides in an aqueous environment. To initiate each simulation, the solution structure of each peptide closest to the average structure of the NMR ensemble was used. To directly compare the ensemble of structures from our NMR- and MD-based approaches, we calculated the RMSD to the ensemble average, as well as the radius of gyration (R<sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) of each peptide. The MD-derived ensembles had greater structural variability (higher RMSD) and were less compact (higher R<sub><italic>g</italic></sub>) than their cognate NMR-derived structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare black squares and circles). However, consistent with our NMR results, the RMSD values calculated by MD simulations were lower for SS-31 and SPN4 than for SS-20 and SPN10 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, all of the RMSDs from membrane MD simulations were lower than the limiting RMSDs for tetrapeptides in solution MD simulations, which can deviate up to 5 Å from the initial structures (see Materials and methods). Taken together, the results of our NMR and MD analyses suggest that the free peptides are largely disordered but retain some residual structure due to cation-π and aromatic ring stacking interactions. We next proceeded to empirically evaluate the interaction of our tetrapeptides with biomimetic membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tetrapeptide analogs have distinct equilibrium binding behavior to CL-containing membranes</title><p>To assess the membrane-binding properties of the peptide analogs, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) of peptides titrated with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing a 80:20 molar ratio of 16:0/18:1 phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and 18:1 CL (tetraoleoyl-CL, TOCL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This approach provides a full thermodynamic characterization of the peptide-membrane interaction. Fits to binding isotherms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) provided equilibrium binding parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that revealed key similarities and differences among the membrane-interactive properties of our test set. First, all tetrapeptides bound CL-containing membranes with roughly similar binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> 27.5 µM to 39.5 µM; Δ<italic>G</italic> –26.2 kJ/mol to –25.9 kJ/mol). These binding affinity values did not differ significantly among the analogs. However, the lipid-to-peptide binding stoichiometry, <italic>n</italic>, did differ among peptides. To calculate this value, we used the ‘effective’ lipid concentration ([lipid]<sup>eff</sup>) that represents lipids on the outer leaflet of the liposomes to which peptides have access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). Compared with the benchmark SS-31 (n=5.4; i.e. an average of 5.4 lipids per bound peptide), SPN4 had a similar value (n=5.7), SS-20 had a significantly higher value (n=7.4), and SPN10 had a significantly lower value (n=3.3). These results indicate that SPN10 and SS-20 bind membranes, respectively, at higher and lower surface densities than SS-31.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Microcalorimetry of peptide binding to large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Equilibrium binding isotherms.

As Δ<italic>H</italic> is a function of polar contacts made during binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seelig, 2004</xref>), this trend in Δ<italic>H</italic> is consistent with the number of aromatic side chains containing polar groups (SPN10, two indole NH groups; SPN4/SS-31, one phenol OH group; SS-20, none). Binding entropy, which in this system is largely a function of aromatic side chain partitioning into the acyl chain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seelig, 2004</xref>), did not differ significantly among peptides (TΔ<italic>S</italic> ranged from 19.0 to 22.1 kJ/mol). However, the relative enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding, quantified by the ratio TΔ<italic>S</italic>/|Δ<italic>H</italic>|, indicate that in comparison with SS-31, membrane binding of SS-20 is more entropy-driven and that of SPN10 is more enthalpy-driven.

We hypothesized that moving from a high to a low dielectric environment would promote a more uniform structure and that the measured differences in the membrane-binding thermodynamics of these peptides could have a structural basis. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Birk et al., 2014</xref>), in the presence of CL-containing bicelles, the NMR signals of SS-31 broaden at low peptide:lipid ratios and then sharpen again at a molar excess of peptide to CL. This indicates that the free and bicelle-bound states of the peptides are in fast exchange on the NMR time-scale and should be amenable to transferred NOE (trNOE) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Post, 2003</xref>). The structures of all four peptides bound to bicelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were calculated based on a large number of negative NOEs, consistent with a high MW peptide-bicelle complex, that are transferred to the free peptide (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

This gives the peptides a markedly asymmetric charge distribution (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), with the cationic face of the peptides likely poised for binding to the negatively charged lipid phosphates of CL-containing membranes. To form the reverse turn structures, the φ-B-φ-B peptides have CO(1) to NH(4) H-bonds. However, for the B-φ-B-φ peptide SPN4, the H-bond is formed with the capping NH<sub>2</sub> group that essentially acts as the amide proton donor of a non-existent fifth residue in a CO(2) to NH<sub>2</sub>(5) pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, the other B-φ-B-φ peptide SS-31 adopts an extended conformation due to steric restraints induced by the methyl groups on Dmt2 that preclude the turn conformation from forming. For the peptides that form a reverse turn, intra-peptide cation-π interactions are observed, and the backbone H-bond NH donor in the turn structure is always an aromatic residue. For the φ-B-φ-B peptides SS-20 and SPN10, cation-π interactions form between Arg2, Phe3 and Trp3, Lys4, respectively. Although these cation-π interactions may arise simply from sequence proximity, they could play a critical role in reducing the overall polar character of these peptides, allowing them to reside within the low-dielectric membrane interface.

This low degree of structural overlap motivated the extension of each simulation for an additional 1 μs, during which NOE distance restraints between residues <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i+2</italic> and <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i+3</italic> were imposed for each peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hess et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hess and Scheek, 2003</xref>). Imposing the NMR restraints yielded considerable improvements in structural similarity to the NMR structure for all peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). NOE violations were computed over the MD simulations using time and ensemble averaging and violations occurred less than 20% of the time for the majority (~71%) of the applied restraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, all subsequent MD analyses were performed using NOE restrained MD data, unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Peptide analogs have different membrane insertion profiles and lipid interactions</title><p>We next analyzed our MD simulations for the membrane insertion depth of each peptide side chain. Side chain insertion depth (Z<sup>pos</sup>) for each peptide analog was measured by averaging the distance in the Z-direction (bilayer normal) from each side chain’s C<sup>β</sup> atom to the bilayer center of mass (COM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). Generally, the residues of SS-31 tended to bury deepest, followed sequentially by SPN10, SS-20, and SPN4.</p><p>In the trNOE experiments, we also observed NOEs between the peptides and the bicelle lipids, for which we used lipid proton assignments from the literature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liebau et al., 2017</xref>). Most of the peptide-lipid NOEs were from aromatic residues to lipid protons close to the headgroup region. This suggests peptides are superficially buried in the interfacial region of lipid bilayers, in agreement with the MD results. Interestingly, the peptide-lipid NOEs for SPN10 were generally weaker than those of the other peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although we saw few, if any, trNOEs from lipid to the basic groups, this could be explained by the fact that the TOCL <sup>1</sup>H signals were largely overlapped and dominated by the ~40-fold molar excess of DHPC and POPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, given the 1/r distance dependence of charge-charge interactions, long-range electrostatic effects could be missed by the ~5 Å detection threshold of the NOE.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SPN10 minimizes membrane surface area and CL self-interactions</title><p>We next used MD simulations to obtain insights into the effects of peptide binding on bilayer properties. We first considered molecular exposure at the membrane-solvent interface by calculating the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). We measured the total membrane and peptide SASA of a given system in addition to its component headgroup, acyl chain, and peptide SASA values in the presence and absence of peptides. In the absence of peptides, total membrane SASA can be parsed into headgroups, which constitute the majority of solvent-exposed area, and acyl chains, whose exposure can be interpreted as interfacial lipid packing defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyd et al., 2018</xref>). As expected, the presence of all peptides at the bilayer interface reduced both lipid headgroup and acyl chain SASA, due to peptides ‘covering’ the bilayer surface. Among the four analogs, SS-20 and SPN4 were more solvent exposed, consistent with their more superficial binding near the solvent interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By comparison, SS-31 and SPN10 caused the greatest decrease in acyl chain SASA, consistent with their deeper burial into the non-polar core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), filling the ‘voids’ of solvent-exposed hydrocarbon chains. The most notable distinction between the more deeply buried SS-31 and SPN10 was that SPN10 also caused a significantly lower headgroup SASA. Hence, SPN10-containing bilayers had the lowest total SASA among all peptide analogs, and SPN10 was the only peptide to not significantly change the total SASA compared to the bilayer-only system. The observation that total SASA is unchanged when SPN10 binds the bilayer indicates that the total amount of surface that is ‘created’ by this bound peptide is approximately equal to the total amount of bilayer surface area that is ‘buried’ by it.</p><p>Second, we considered peptide-induced elastic deformations of the bilayer, namely cross-sectional area per lipid and bilayer thickness (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>). Our measurements of these parameters before peptide binding (i.e. peptides restrained in solution) were consistent with previous MD work from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boyd et al., 2017</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Upon peptide binding, we observed an inverse trend between bilayer thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>, panels A and B) and mean lipid area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>, panels C and D). SS-31 and SPN10 expanded mean lipid area (decreased bilayer thickness) to a greater extent than did SPN4 and SS-20, which is likely related to the deeper burial of SS-31 and SPN10 aromatic side chains into the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The combined observations that SPN10 both expanded membrane area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>) and maintained the lowest total SASA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) suggest that even though this analog causes elastic bilayer expansion, it maintains a low ‘ruggedness’ of exposed membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tüchsen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we constructed radial distribution profiles to determine peptide-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions in the lateral (x-y) plane of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). As a proxy for peptide-lipid association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>, upper panels), we chose the C<sup>ζ</sup> atom of the Arg at the first (SS-31/SPN4) or second (SS-20/SPN10) position. We observed three radial shells of POPC and TOCL phosphates around each Arg. SS-31 and SPN4 had a greater density of CL phosphates in the closest shells, whereas CL phosphates of distal radial shells were more populated for SS-20 and SPN10. This may be related to the proximity of the Arg to the cationic NH<sub>3</sub> terminus in the B-φ-B-φ peptides causing greater local density of anionic CL. The distribution profiles of Arg-PC were, by comparison, much more similar among peptides. Our analysis of lipid-lipid radial distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>, lower panels) revealed four radial densities of lipid phosphates around corresponding phosphates of CL or PC. CL phosphates in the same Z-plane do not often approach closer than ~5 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>), likely due to charge-charge repulsion. Notably, SS-31 caused an increased density of CL around itself at distances &lt;6 Å, suggesting that SS-31 may draw CL phosphates out of their respective Z-plane more than other analogs, perhaps consistent with this peptide’s membrane-thinning effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). By comparison, SPN10 disfavored close contact of CL, which may be related to its large aromatic Trp side chains inhibiting close approach of sterically bulky CL.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>SPN10 has a markedly greater effect on membrane electrostatics</title><p>Our previous work showed that SS-31 modulates membrane surface electrostatics as a key part of its molecular MoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of our four peptide analogs on membrane electrostatic potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We first analyzed ψ<sub>s</sub>, which originates from fixed charges at the membrane interface and is strongly negative for CL-rich mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ohshima, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Robertson and Rottenberg, 1983</xref>). To this end, we used the fluorescent reporter probe 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS), which reversibly binds anionic membranes, with corresponding increase in quantum yield, in a manner that is promoted by ψ<sub>s</sub> attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Robertson and Rottenberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gibrat et al., 1983</xref>). As we have shown, ANS profiles are consistent with zeta potential readouts of membrane surface charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). We first measured the effect of peptide analogs on the surface charge of mitochondrial membranes by titrating mitoplasts (mitochondria with disrupted outer membrane) with peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). All peptides caused a saturable decrease in membrane surface charge, with SPN10 causing markedly higher attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left); by comparison, within the resolution of this assay, there was no discernible difference in saturation binding among peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right). These results support that the highest ψ<sub>s</sub> down-regulation is caused by SPN10 in organello, but do not rule out that this could be caused by peptide interaction with mitochondrial proteins. We therefore repeated this analysis in a more reductionist system with CL-containing LUVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Again, SPN10 showed the greatest effect on ψ<sub>s</sub> in this lipid-only system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left) despite all analogs having similar saturation curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, right). Control experiments conducted in the absence of membranes confirmed that peptides alone had no effect on ANS fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test this, we used the potentiometric probe TMRM in quench mode, whereby probe fluorescence quenches upon accumulation in the matrix of energized mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>).

Extensive studies have shown that SS-31 promotes cell survival under a variety of stress challenges, including ischemic, hypoxic, metabolic, and oxidative stress conditions, but has no effect under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szeto, 2018</xref>). Serum starvation is frequently used as a stress model in cell cultures, as it causes decreases in ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> and cellular ATP, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Charles et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patten et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Experiments in the present study were conducted by growing cells in serum-containing media (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium [DMEM] or DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) and subjecting them to stress by growing in serum-free media (DMEM or DMEM/F12 only) for a specified length of time with or without peptide treatment.</p><p>We first tested the ability of the peptides to restore ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> in cells subjected to serum withdrawal. To this end, we used the potentiometric reporter TMRM in non-quench mode, whereby the probe accumulation in mitochondria is positively correlated with ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Cells grown in the absence of serum for 3 days showed a clear mitochondrial depolarization relative to positive controls grown with serum (p&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, three peptides showed partial restoration of ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> on a remarkably short timescale, within 2 hr of treatment. Following the treatment of serum-deprived cell culture with 10 nM peptide, the benchmark SS-31 caused a significant increase in TMRM signal (p&lt;0.05). By comparison, the TMRM signal of SPN4-treated cells was not significantly higher than serum-deprived cells, whereas that of cells treated with SS-20 (p&lt;0.01) and SPN10 (p&lt;0.001) was significantly higher than those treated with SS-31.</p><p>We next addressed the potential restorative effects of these peptides on the structure of the mitochondrial network irrespective of their energized state. To this end, we subjected HK-2 cells to the same conditions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and co-stained mitochondria with TMRM and MitoView Green, a probe that is widely used as a ΔΨ<sub>m</sub>-independent marker of mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chaudhry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel A). Cells grown in the absence of serum showed fragmentation of the mitochondrial reticular network with perinuclear clustering in comparison with the extended network observed with non-stressed cells in the presence of serum. Consistent with the rapid kinetics observed for TMRM measurements, treatment with any of the four peptides for 2 hr before observation resulted in restoration of the reticular network pattern seen in the absence of stress. Taken together, these results strongly support that the mode of action of these peptides entails a rapid repolarization of the IMM and restoration of the mitochondrial network when challenged with serum withdrawal stress.</p><p>We then tested the ability of our peptides to promote cell viability by growing them under serum depletion conditions with and without peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Control tests confirmed that when grown with serum-containing media for 3 days, the presence of peptide had no effect on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, left), consistent with previous observations that SS-31 has no effect under non-stressed conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szeto, 2018</xref>). However, when cells were subject to serum deprivation conditions for 7 days, the presence of peptide strongly improved cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right); in this case, we observed marked differences in potency among the peptides, with SPN10 significantly outperforming SS-31 (p&lt;0.001). To evaluate how our peptides affect general energy metabolism with serum withdrawal stress, we measured cellular ATP content following serum starvation for 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We observed a striking parallel with the results from our viability tests, wherein peptides show the same trends in cellular ATP with SPN10 significantly better than SS-31 (p&lt;0.001). In addition, SPN10 significantly raised ATP levels in ARPE-19 cells with serum starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel B).</p><p>Taken together, our cell culture studies show that, under the serum-free conditions tested, all four peptide analogs displayed mitochondrial protection to varying degrees. Based on our quantified cell culture measurements, the rank order of peptide analog effectiveness was SPN4&lt;SS-31&lt;SS-20&lt;SPN10 for ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> restoration, SS-31=SS-20&lt;SPN4&lt;SPN10 for cell viability, and SS-31&lt;SS-20=SPN4&lt;SPN10 for cellular ATP. How these trends in stressed cells may relate to our structural and biophysical analyses will be discussed below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of modifying two key features of mitochondria-targeted peptides, side chain composition and sequence register, to better understand what chemical properties are important for their therapeutic efficacy. SS-31 and SS-20, which have both been validated in pre-clinical and clinical tests, feature different aromatic side chains and ordering of cationic and aromatic groups. The efficacy of these compositionally distinct peptides motivated us to test the structural and functional consequences of further modifications within the cationic-aromatic motif of these peptides. All four analogs were found to bind CL-containing bilayers, modulate membrane electrostatics, and show mitochondrial protection in cell stress models. Collectively, these observations support the concept that this general motif is sufficient for the molecular action of these mitochondria-targeted compounds. Yet there were also marked differences in their structures and molecular behaviors. These differences could provide critical insights into the MoA of this class of compounds that can be leveraged to develop more effective mitochondrial therapeutics. A summary of the key similarities and differences among the four tetrapeptides analyzed in this study is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p><p>A central aim of this study was the structural characterization of these peptides in solution and in the membrane-bound state. To this end, we used complementary approaches of NMR spectroscopy and MD simulations, providing the first models of the structures of these compounds. As expected, all peptides are largely disordered in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1–</xref>) and assumed a more compact and well-defined structure when membrane-bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This trend is reflected by the general decrease in the calculated RMSD and R<italic><sub>g</sub></italic> seen for the bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Intra-peptide aromatic ring stacking and cation-π interactions are stabilizing features of both the solution and membrane-bound states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This point is significant because cation-π complexes are known to lower the energetic cost of partitioning basic side chains into the non-polar membrane core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hohlweg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Infield et al., 2021</xref>), which likely contributes to the ability of these tetrapeptide analogs to traverse cell membranes, including those of the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reddy et al., 2017</xref>), and to reside stably at the membrane interface.</p><p>The most notable structural feature of these tetrapeptides is the membrane-bound reverse-turn conformation observed for all analogs other than SS-31. These conformers can all be formally classified as four-residue beta turns stabilized by an <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i</italic>+3 main chain H-bond with an Cα(1) to Cα(4) distance of ~7 Å or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Venkatachalam, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lewis et al., 1973</xref>). The dihedral angles of the <italic>i</italic>+1 and <italic>i</italic>+2 residues of these structures deviated from the canonical phi/psi values for the most common beta turns; however, with increasing availability of high-resolution protein structures, it is becoming clear that the central residues of beta turns can occupy a wider diversity of Ramachandran space than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shapovalov et al., 2019</xref>). The φ-B-φ-B peptides (SS-20 and SPN10) are stabilized by a CO(1) to NH(4) H-bond, whereas the B-φ-B-φ peptide (SPN4) is stabilized by an H-bond between CO (2) and the C-terminal amide group (in lieu of a ‘fifth’ residue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This latter feature underscores the importance of C-terminal amidation in these compounds: not only does the amide remove the C-terminal carboxyl function to maintain the net +3 charge of these compounds, but as shown in this study, it also provides an H-bond donor to stabilize the turn structure of peptides with B-φ-B-φ register. Given that the H-bonds of these reverse turn structures reside in the low-dielectric microenvironment of the membrane interface, they are likely to be more stabilizing than when in bulk aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2009</xref>). By partially satisfying the H-bonding capacity of main chain atoms, this <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i</italic>+3 polar interaction partially offsets the energetic penalty of dehydration of polar backbone functional groups at the membrane, which may in turn allow the peptides to reside near the polar-apolar boundary of the membrane. From these findings, one possibility to explore is the synthesis of cyclized forms of these peptides, given that forcing the peptides to adopt the bioactive pose may lessen the entropic penalty of membrane binding.</p><p>Our results provide several insights into the nature of the interaction between the tetrapeptides and lipid bilayers. The first insight pertains to peptide-binding density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on the lipid:peptide stoichiometries (<italic>n</italic>) from our ITC analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), coupled with the known cross-sectional areas of POPC (70 Å<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leftin et al., 2014</xref>) and TOCL (129 Å<sup>2</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyd et al., 2018</xref>), one can calculate the binding footprint of peptides in the bilayers (80:20 POPC:TOCL) used for ITC. In increasing order, the per-peptide membrane areas are: 270 Å<sup>2</sup> (SPN10) &lt;434 Å<sup>2</sup> (SS-31)&lt;466 Å<sup>2</sup> (SPN4) &lt;605 Å<sup>2</sup> (SS-20). Hence, SPN10 has a greater binding density, and SS-20 has a lower binding density compared with SS-31/SPN4. Given that the mitochondrial IMM is protein-rich with little free exposed bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Capaldi, 1982</xref>), the greater per-peptide membrane coverage of SPN10 may relate to its enhanced efficacy by increased occupancy of the limited lipid area of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This leads to a second related insight from this work regarding the effects of these peptides on membrane surface area. Our previous work showed that SS-31 caused a decrease in acyl chain SASA, likely related to a decrease of interfacial hydration and increased lipid packing density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, we found that SPN10 stood apart from the other peptides in that it minimized solvent exposure of both lipid aliphatic chains and headgroups, thereby resulting in total membrane SASA similar to membranes in the absence of peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This ability of SPN10 to fill packing defects is likely related to a combination of factors, including its large aromatic side chain volume, its deeper binding in the membrane interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and its high surface coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Within the IMM, the inverted conical geometry of CL creates lateral packing defects of lamellar bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyd et al., 2018</xref>), which could be related to transient pore-like defects that allow small molecule permeation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shinoda, 2016</xref>) and/or accessibility of acyl groups to pro-oxidants that cause lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bour et al., 2019</xref>). Reducing lipid packing voids could be part of the MoA of these tetrapeptides, contributing to the observed decrease in proton leak across the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) and lipid oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Min et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) that occurs with SS-31 treatment. A final related point pertains to specific peptide-lipid interactions. Our trNOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>) and MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) results both indicate that bound peptides reside in the membrane interface, likely within the boundaries of the lipid phosphate and ester groups. Yet the peptide analogs may mediate different lipid interactions. Compared with other peptides, the NOEs of SPN10 to lipid protons were notably fewer and weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This may be related to our MD radial distribution profiles showing that the Arg of SPN10 has a preferential lateral accumulation of POPC over TOCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Understanding exactly how specific side chain-lipid chemical interactions relate to the efficacy of these tetrapeptide analogs will require further investigation.</p><p>Our calorimetric binding analysis showed unexpected differences in the thermodynamics of the interactions of these peptides with CL-containing membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). All analogs had roughly equal <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (Δ<italic>G</italic>) values, with binding dominated by favorable changes in entropy (mean TΔ<italic>S</italic>/|Δ<italic>H</italic>| ranged from 2.7 to 6.9). However, compared with SS-31/SPN4, the binding of SPN10 and SS-20 had larger and smaller enthalpic-binding components, respectively. These features may be interpreted in terms of the origins of ΔS and ΔH for peptide-membrane interactions. First, the entropic cost of small peptide binding that comes from restricting conformational, translational, and rotational degrees of freedom (adsorption entropy) is likely to be small based on theoretical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Tal et al., 2000</xref>). Instead, the large and favorable binding entropy we observe originates largely from the classical hydrophobic effect: membrane penetration of aromatic side chains is attendant with increased solvent mobility that accompanies the desolvation of the peptide and the release of ordered waters from non-polar acyl surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seelig, 2004</xref>). We propose that membrane binding of SS-20 is dominated by entropically favored burial of its aromatic Phe side chains, which lack polar groups, in the non-polar membrane core. This may facilitate deeper burial of SS-20 aromatic rings in the acyl chain region, consistent with its larger binding footprint. By comparison, binding enthalpy originates largely from polar interactions between peptide and lipid headgroups. We propose that membrane binding of SPN10 is strongly favored by polar interactions involving the indole NH hydrogen bond donors of its Trp side chains. Trp is known to remain partially in the interfacial region due to its large rigid paddle-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aliste et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Jesus and Allen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Planque et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Petersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Yau et al., 1998</xref>), which may be consistent with its higher observed binding density. Finally, our analysis suggests that the interaction of these peptides with membranes shows enthalpy-entropy compensation, wherein the binding energy of a congeneric series of compounds remains relatively constant due to opposing changes in Δ<italic>H</italic> and Δ<italic>S</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fox et al., 2018</xref>), as observed with the surface interactions of different peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Meier and Seelig, 2008</xref>). Hence, from a molecular engineering perspective, optimizing the efficacy of these tetrapeptides might be directed less toward enhancing binding affinity per se and more toward enhancing the enthalpic contribution, particularly by modulating polar contacts among aromatic groups.</p><p>This work revealed striking differences among the peptides in terms of their effects on membrane electrostatic potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, the ψ<sub>s</sub> of negatively-charged membranes (biomimetic liposomes and mitoplasts) was attenuated by all peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>); however, SPN10 had the greatest effect by far. This may be related in part to the higher binding density of SPN10. However, it may also be related to SPN10 uniquely having two aromatic side chains with polar (indole NH) groups that can each mediate H-bond interactions with lipid phosphates, which can alter ionization behavior and reduce headgroup charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kooijman et al., 2009</xref>). Second, the ψ<sub>d</sub> of bilayers, related to the ordering of lipid polar groups and interfacial waters, was down-regulated by all peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This may be due to a general effect of bound peptide causing disorganization of interfacial water dipoles. However, as a group, those peptides with polar groups on their aromatic side chains (SPN4, SS-31, and SPN10) attenuated ψ<sub>d</sub> much more than the peptide lacking aromatic polar groups (SS-20); hence, it is possible that polar contacts with lipid mediated by aromatic side chains may alter the orientation of lipid headgroup dipoles, e.g., the P-N vector of the phosphate-choline dipole of PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Scherer and Seelig, 1989</xref>). Finally, it is notable that no peptide affected the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), supporting that they do not depolarize or hyperpolarize mitochondrial membrane potentials, consistent with the strong safety profile of SS-31 and SS-20. This point is particularly relevant in comparison with other mitochondria-targeted compounds such as the antioxidant MitoQ, which is known to cause IMM depolarization in some tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gottwald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pokrzywinski et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, the effects of our peptide analogs on membrane electrostatics may be a key underpinning of their relative efficacies. Our working model posits that the tuning of ψ<sub>s</sub> is an important part of the MoA of these peptides, potentially by modulating interactions of cations and polybasic proteins with CL-containing membranes or facilitating curvature by lowering headgroup anionic repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). The fact that these peptides also affect ψ<sub>d</sub> may be relevant for their activity in mitochondria, as ψ<sub>d</sub> modifiers can modulate membrane elastic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chulkov et al., 2015</xref>) and channel gating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pearlstein et al., 2017</xref>). The results of the present study show that the ability of peptide analogs to modulate membrane surface charge can vary greatly with side chain composition, supporting that this could be a key functional parameter for optimization in the rational design of new tetrapeptide analogs.</p><p>Our evaluation of the four peptide analogs in cell culture studies provided the most direct insights into their potential effectiveness as mitochondrial therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On one hand, the peptides showed many functional similarities in mammalian cell lines: (i) both biotinylated variants of SS-31 and SPN10 accumulated in the mitochondrial network when added to two different types of human endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that cell permeation and mitochondria targeting are sequence-promiscuous, without strict requirement for a specific side chain register or identity of aromatic side chains; (ii) all peptides were pharmacologically active, showing some degree of protection against serum deprivation stress through a mechanism involving mitochondrial energetics and network integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>); and (iii) none of the peptides affected viability of non-stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, the four peptides showed significant differences in our cell stress models regarding partial ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and cellular ATP content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Three points are noteworthy regarding the measured differences among the peptides in cell culture and the potential underlying mechanisms. First, peptide treatment recovered the ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> within a time scale of 2 hr. This suggests that the primary mode of action, at least under the conditions tested, entailed rapid repolarization of the IMM. Consistent with our findings, it has been recently shown that treatment of aged cardiomyocytes with SS-31 reduced IMM proton leak after acute 2-hr treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The fast-acting effects of these mitochondria-targeted compounds do not, of course, rule out the possibility that they may also elicit longer-term changes (e.g. gene expression, protein and lipid turnover, and epigenetic modifications) following improvements in cellular bioenergetics. Second, although the biophysical and structural work of the present study focused on lipid bilayer interactions of these peptides, SS-31 has also been shown to interact with specific mitochondrial proteins in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chavez et al., 2020</xref>); hence, peptide-protein interactions may contribute to the efficacy of these peptides in cell culture that would not be observed with lipid-only models. Because only the interactome of SS-31 has been analyzed to date, addressing the interactions of other tetrapeptides with mitochondrial proteins will shed light on this issue. Third, we note that the trend in which the peptide analogs restore ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) does not follow the rank order in which they improve cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and ATP content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) with serum deprivation stress. Given the numerous interconnected biochemical pathways that link ΔΨ<sub>m</sub> with ATP content and cell viability, it is likely that the peptides could have measurably different effects on processes not considered here that would impact mitochondrial function.</p><p>In summary, as the first structure-activity analysis for this class of compounds, this study provides new insights to guide their potential optimization. Given the complexity of membrane interactions in the molecular MoA of these compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>), coupled with the fact that membrane protein interactions are involved in their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chavez et al., 2020</xref>), our limited test set of four analogs could not unequivocally address all chemical features that may enhance function. But insofar as the composition and activity of SPN10 could provide a direction for optimization, the engineering of future analogs may be guided by: (i) greater bulk of aromatic R groups (which, among proteinogenic amino acids, means emphasizing Trp); (ii) ability to form compact (reverse-turn) structures when membrane-bound; (iii) polar groups on aromatic side chains that enhance enthalpy of membrane interactions; (iv) ability to decrease SASA of lipid groups; and (v) ability to down-regulate membrane ψ<sub>s</sub>. Together, modulation of these features will help pave the way for rational design of next-generation variants of this class of mitochondria-targeted therapeutic compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Peptides SS-31, SS-20, SPN4, and SPN10 were prepared by solid-phase synthesis as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) salts by Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Burlingame, CA).

Bilayers were generated with TOCL and POPC lipids at a molar ratio of 20:80 TOCL:POPC. Each system contained a total of 150 lipids (75 per leaflet). Peptide-bilayer systems were constructed by removing solvent from the bilayer systems generated by CHARMM-GUI, resizing the box’s Z-dimension to 16 nm, placing 20 peptides (10 peptides on either side) 2–3 nm away from the bilayer’s headgroup region, and then re-solvating to ~75% water by mass, and raising the salt concentration to 100 mM NaCl. Each system contained ~93,000 atoms. A representation of the initial setup of the peptide-bilayer systems is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Following the CHARMM-GUI standard protocol for protein-bilayer systems, all systems were energy minimized for 5000 steepest descent steps, followed by canonical ensemble (NVT) equilibration for 100 ps with a 1 fs timestep, 200 ps of NPT (constant-NPT; N = number of particles, P = pressure, T = temperature) equilibration with a 1 fs timestep, and ~100 ns of NPT equilibration with a 2 fs timestep. The NPT equilibration steps were performed with semi-isotropic pressure coupling and the Berendsen barostat and the Berendsen thermostat. Position and dihedral restraints were used during equilibration on the lipids and peptides to maintain lipid geometry and bilayer morphology and to prevent the peptides from interacting with the bilayers during equilibration. To enforce an equal number of peptides interacting with each side of the bilayer (10 peptides per leaflet; 7.5:1 lipid-to-peptide ratio and a 1.5:1 CL-to-peptide ratio), two inverted flat-bottom restraints in the Z-direction were placed at the bottom of the box (Z=0 nm). A restraint was placed on the peptides’ Cα atoms with a force constant of 200 kJ/(mol*nm) and a radius of 3 nm, which served to maintain a constant lipid-to-peptide ratio on either side of the bilayer. A second restraint was placed on the POPC phosphates with a force constant of 50 kJ/(mol*nm) and a radius of 4.5 nm to prevent the upper and lower leaflet from drifting in the Z-direction, while still allowing for natural membrane deformations.</p><p>Production simulations were run for 2 μs and saved every 1 ps. In all production simulations electrostatic and Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions were cut off at 1.2 nm, with electrostatics shifted from 0 nm to the cutoff, and LJ interactions shifted from 1.0 nm to the cutoff. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the particle mesh Ewald method and a fourier spacing of 0.12 nm. All bilayer system production runs were simulated in the NPT ensemble using the Nose-Hoover thermostat, Parrinello-Rahman barostat, and semi-isotropic coupling scheme, with the temperature maintained at 303.15 K and pressure kept at 1.0 bar with semi-isotropic coupling. The time constants for pressure and temperature coupling were 5.0 and 1.0 ps, respectively, and the compressibility value was 4.5 E-5/bar. Simulations were performed using periodic boundary conditions in all dimensions, and the simulation time step was 2 fs.</p><p>Following the 2 μs unrestrained production simulations, additional 1 μs simulations were performed using NMR-derived NOE distance-restraints. Only those NOE restraints between residues <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i+2</italic> and <italic>i</italic> to <italic>i+3</italic> NOEs were imposed in the MD simulations. By only including ‘long-range’ restraints, we aimed to enforce the long-distance NOEs while still allowing for natural dynamics and not over-restraining the ensemble. A force constant of 5000 kJ/(mol*nm) was applied equally to each peptide (to promote sampling of more conformations) and averaged over the ensemble of 20 peptides. Since distance restraints based on instantaneous distances can heavily reduce conformational dynamics, the 20 peptides were restrained to a time-averaged distance with a decay time of 10 ps. The initial configuration for the NMR-restrained simulations was the final configuration of the 2 μs unrestrained simulations. An example.mdp file for the 20-peptide system with NOE restraints is included in the supporting information.</p><p>Simulations of single peptides in solution were also performed.

Images were collected from n=3 independent experiments, using 4–6 random fields for each treatment group, and fluorescence intensity was analyzed using ImageJ (NIH). TMRM fluorescence was normalized to Hoechst fluorescence to account for differences in cell number in each field. Differences among groups were compared by one-way ANOVA. Post hoc analyses were carried out using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Effects of peptides on cell viability and intracellular ATP after 7 days of serum deprivation</title><p>HK-2 and ARPE-19 cells (5 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells) were seeded in 96-well culture plates in DMEM (HK-2) or DMEM/F12 (ARPE-19) medium containing 10% FBS for 24 hr. Cells were then switched to corresponding serum-free medium with or without 10 nM peptides for 7 days. Medium was replaced once every 3 days. All treatments were carried out with n=4–6 independent samples for each experiment. Cell viability was measured by resazurin fluorescence using the alamarBlue assay (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Cellular ATP was measured using the ApoSENSOR ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA). Luminescence was measured using a microplate reader (SpecraMax iD3, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Results in each experiment were normalized to serum-free control, and all data are presented as mean ± SEM from four experiments. Differences among groups were compared by one-way ANOVA. Post hoc analyses were carried out using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analyses and scientific rigor</title><p>All means reported represent a minimum of n=3 independently prepared sample replicates and are reported as means ± SD or SEM, as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVAs or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as indicated. Differences among sample populations were considered significant at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>HHS does not hold any position in Stealth Biotherapeutics but has financial interests in the company.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Naresh Babu V. Sepuri (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are of unanimous opinion that the structural part of tripeptides targeted mitochondria and their association with membrane is well done. However, results on the activity part of the MS are nearly non-existant. We feel that additional data on activity relationship is required before the paper can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers acknowledge the robustness of the data on the structures of various tripeptides and the nature of side chains on targeting efficiency and membrane association. It is also interesting that many of these peptides induce mitochondrial ATP pools. However, a crucial point on mechanism of increased ATP pool is missing. Is it due to direct binding of targeted peptides to mitochondrial electron transfer complexes? If so, is mitochondrial respiratory control affected? The authors should provide data on these important questions. These questions are particularly important for assessing the clinical relevance of the MS.</p><p>The manuscript also fails to mention about a major pathway of targeting inhibitors, antioxidants and drugs to mitochondria that has been used by many groups for targeting compounds and clinically important drugs to mitochondria. It is important to site Murphy's and Kalyanaraman's work and discuss how the tripeptide system may be superior to the TPP+ targeting system.</p><p>We collectively feel that inclusion of additional data on above mentioned aspects would significantly strengthen the manuscript and therefore return the MS for updating.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>i. Description of NMR structural analyses is rather specialized (including the use of acronyms), and difficult to follow by the readers without appropriate expertise.</p><p>ii. Figure 1C – RMSD value for SS-20 seems similar to those of SS-21 and SPN4. Therefore, the order of amino acids does not seem to be the major predicting feature for RMSD (structural precision/dynamics) in solution. In addition, in membranes all four peptides show low values of RMSD.</p><p>iii. The experiments testing the effect of the peptides on membrane electrostatic potentials would benefit from appropriate controls to demonstrate that the increase in AND fluorescence in fact is due to changes in membrane potential, e.g. showing the effect of the peptides on ANS fluorescence in the absence of membranes (mitoplasts, LUVs).</p><p>iv.

SS-31, which carries unusual amino acid, quenches the ROS and might be helping in the restoration of mitochondrial health.

The reviewer is correct that SS-20 does not follow this observation with respect to RMSDs. We have therefore clarified this point in the Results section.</p><p>To the second point, we believe that any effect of sequence register on residual conformation will be more apparent in solution.

In our previous work (Mitchell, et al. [2020] <italic>J. Biol. Chem.</italic> 295: 7452-7469), we confirmed that SS-31 by itself did not affect ANS fluorescence.

SS-31, which carries unusual amino acid, quenches the ROS and might be helping in the restoration of mitochondrial health. These peptides lack this amino acid, and it would be interesting to check cellular ROS levels in the presence and absence of these peptides. How do these peptides increase cell survival and ATP production without quenching ROS? Besides, some of the following points shall be addressed to improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>There are many past studies demonstrating that peptides lacking the 2,4-dimethyltyrosine moiety, such as SS-20, can reduce ROS burden originating from mitochondrial OXPHOS machinery (e.g., Birk et al. [2015] <italic>BBA Bioenerg.</italic> 1847: 1075-1084; Szeto et al. [2015] <italic>Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol.</italic> 308: F11-F21; Sun et al. [2020] <italic>Aging</italic> 12: 1823818250). It should be noted that a therapeutic compound can act as an antioxidant not only through scavenging ROS, but also by keeping ROS from forming in the first place (e.g., by enhancing efficiency of electron transport complexes, by promoting supercomplex assembly and stability, and/or stabilizing cristae morphology). So these peptides could in principle be curtailing ROS either before or after such compounds are produced. Importantly, in our starvation stress response studies, the peptides may be functioning in a way that does not involve ROS curtailment at all, such as mitigating proton leak across the inner membrane. This is discussed in the revised version of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. As these peptides also have hydrophobic residues, are they prone to form aggregates in higher concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s point, we addressed this question experimentally using NMR translational diffusion. The size of the SS-20 peptide from the diffusion measurements (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript) is consistent with it being a monomer under the conditions of the structural studies for the free peptide (10 mM peptide concentration, pH 6, 25<sup>o</sup>C). We expect from our results with SS-20 that the other three peptides are monomers in solution because all four of our peptides have reasonably similar hydrophobic character, judged by several calculated qSAR parameters, including LogP(o/w), the log of the octanol-water partition coefficient; qPolariz, the predicted polarizability; and FOSA, the hydrophobic component of the total solvent accessible surface area (attached H and saturated C) (calculated by Schrödinger Maestro QikProp calculations):</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Peptide</th><th valign="bottom">LogP(o/w)</th><th valign="bottom">qPolariz (Å<sup>3</sup>)</th><th valign="bottom">FOSA (Å2)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SS-31</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">-1.868</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">55.768</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">326.69</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SS-20</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">-1.852</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">54.319</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">278.69</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPN04</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">-2.278</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">55.375</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">234.03</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPN10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">-1.798</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">57.984</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">243.73</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Fig: 6A, Mitotracker or mitochondrial marker will be helpful to show that peptides are all localized to mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>The colocalization of compounds belonging to this peptide class has been shown previously (e.g., in Delco et al. [2018] <italic>J. Orthopaedic Res.</italic> 8: 2147-2156) using MitoTracker and bio-SS-31 (the same variant used in the present study) and visualizing with streptavidin staining by confocal microscopy. Given that: (i) there is precedent for such colocalization studies with biotinylated peptide analogs and mitochondria-staining dyes, and (ii) the biotinylated variants in the present study (bio-SS-31 and bio-SPN10) show patterns consistent with mitochondrial localization, we feel that there is ample evidence to support mitochondrial localization of this class of tetrapeptides.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Since there is a significant change in cellular ATP levels (in Figure 6C &amp; 6D), authors may consider doing Oxygen consumption rate to rule out the non-mitochondrial ATP (Glycolysis).</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential to evaluate the ability of peptides to restore mitochondrial energetics following serum deprivation stress (Figure 6B). These measurements were taken using an established fluorescence microscopy-based approach with the potentiometric probe TMRM. Our new results confirm that the peptides not only partially restore the significant membrane depolarization following starvation stress, but do so with exceptionally fast kinetics (on a ~2 h timescale) that to our knowledge has not been observed with any other mitochondria-targeted therapeutic.</p><p>Membrane potential is arguably the single most critical determinant of proper mitochondrial function because it encompasses both respiratory chain activity and membrane coupling efficiency. We therefore believe that membrane potential measurements represent a more direct way to assess mitochondrial health than respirometry measurements of oxygen consumption.</p><p>The fact that these peptides show partial recovery of membrane potential strongly supports a model in which they work through a mitochondrial mode of action. Furthermore, the fast kinetics of membrane potential restoration sheds new light on the mechanism of these peptides, at least with respect to serum deprivation stress, that likely includes rapid restoration of membrane coupling (e.g., by decreasing transmembrane proton leak). These ideas will be pursued by our team in subsequent studies.</p><p>Importantly, these new experiments are based on a single time point (two hours post peptide addition), and with a single peptide concentration (10 nM). Hence, while these results are sufficient to address the reviewer’s question regarding a mitochondria-related mode of action, they do not represent a comprehensive kinetic analysis of the pharmacological activity of these peptide analogs. A more detailed assessment of this issue will be forthcoming in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
