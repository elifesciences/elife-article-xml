In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the X-chromosome harbors a specialized condensin that participates in dosage compensation (DC). Condensin DC is recruited to and spreads from a small number of <italic>r</italic>ecruitment <italic>e</italic>lements on the <italic>X</italic>-chromosome (<italic>rex</italic>) and is required for the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs). We take advantage of autosomes that are largely devoid of condensin DC and TADs to address how <italic>rex</italic> sites and condensin DC give rise to the formation of TADs. When an autosome and X-chromosome are physically fused, despite the spreading of condensin DC into the autosome, no TAD was created. Insertion of a strong <italic>rex</italic> on the X-chromosome results in the TAD boundary formation regardless of sequence orientation. When the same <italic>rex</italic> is inserted on an autosome, despite condensin DC recruitment, there was no spreading or features of a TAD. On the other hand, when a ‘<italic>super rex</italic>’ composed of six <italic>rex</italic> sites or three separate <italic>rex</italic> sites are inserted on an autosome, recruitment and spreading of condensin DC led to the formation of TADs. Therefore, recruitment to and spreading from <italic>rex</italic> sites are necessary and sufficient for recapitulating loop-anchored TADs observed on the X-chromosome. Together our data suggest a model in which <italic>rex</italic> sites are both loading sites and bidirectional barriers for condensin DC, a one-sided loop-extruder with movable inactive anchor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>Hi-C</kwd><kwd>3D genome organization</kwd><kwd>loop extrusion</kwd><kwd>X-chromosome</kwd><kwd>TADs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM130311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ercan</surname><given-names>Sevinc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33EB019784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC005991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loading and linear translocation of condensin dosage compensation along the X-chromosomes create the loop-anchored topologically associating domains detected by Hi-C.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic chromosome structure is dynamically regulated across the cell cycle.

Cohesin loading and processivity are promoted by the Adherin complex (in yeast Scc2-Scc4, in mammals Nipbl &amp; Mau2), and its unloading is mediated by Wapl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters and Nishiyama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haarhuis and Rowland, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>). Cohesin translocation on DNA is also controlled by insulator proteins, including the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF, which creates TAD boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nora et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While in vitro and in silico experiments suggest similar molecular activities for condensins and cohesin, it is less clear how condensin binding and movement on eukaryotic chromosomes are regulated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Ruiten and Rowland, 2018</xref>). In yeast, condensin regulates chromosomal interactions across the ribosomal DNA and form gene loops involved in repression of the quiescent genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swygert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paul et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). However, since yeast chromosomes support much smaller interaction domains and lack clear TAD boundaries, how condensin binding regulates larger eukaryotic genomes remains unknown. An excellent model to address this gap is a specialized condensin that functions within the X-chromosome dosage compensation complex (DCC) in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p><p>In addition to the canonical condensins I and II, <italic>C. elegans</italic> possess condensin I<sup>DC</sup> (hereafter condensin dosage compensation [DC]) that differs from condensins I by a single subunit, the SMC-4 variant DPY-27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csankovszki et al., 2009</xref>). Condensin DC binds to both X-chromosomes in hermaphrodites to repress their transcription by a factor of two, equalizing overall X chromosomal transcripts between XX hermaphrodites and XO males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kruesi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kramer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kramer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albritton and Ercan, 2018</xref>). Several features make condensin DC a powerful system to address mechanisms of condensin binding and spreading. First, unlike canonical condensins, the sequence elements important for condensin DC recruitment to the X-chromosomes are identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albritton et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the spreading of the complex can be distinguished from recruitment using X to autosome (X;A) fusion chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>). Third, since the complex only binds to the X-chromosomes, autosomes serve as internal controls, allowing sensitive measurement using genomics approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albritton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vielle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Street et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ercan and Lieb, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Condensin DC recruitment to the X-chromosomes is mediated by ~60 <italic>r</italic>ecruitment <italic>e</italic>lements on the <italic>X-</italic>chromosome (<italic>rex</italic> sites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albritton et al., 2017</xref>). A number of these elements was validated to autonomously recruit the DCC on extrachromosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csankovszki et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, due to the repetitive nature of the extrachromosomal arrays, strong <italic>rex</italic> sequences depleted condensin DC from the X-chromosomes, demonstrating their recruitment activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonel et al., 2006</xref>). Hi-C analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos indicated that eight strong <italic>rex</italic> sites function as TAD boundaries and form long-range <italic>rex-rex</italic> loops on the X-chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rowley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane et al., 2015</xref>). Recruitment of condensin DC leads to spreading to the entire chromosome, accumulating at hundreds of enhancers, promoters, and other accessible gene regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Street et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we addressed the mechanism by which <italic>rex</italic> sites and condensin DC form TADs. Without <italic>rex</italic> sites, spreading of condensin DC to the autosomal region of the X;V fusion chromosome increases 3D DNA contacts but fails to form TADs. Insertion of a <italic>rex</italic> site on X-chromosome sufficiently leads to the formation of a loop-anchored TAD irrespective of orientation, suggesting that <italic>rex</italic> sites are bidirectional barriers to loop extrusion. However, insertion of the same single strong <italic>rex</italic> to chromosome-II, which is largely devoid of condensin DC, did not form a TAD boundary, suggesting that <italic>rex</italic> sites are barriers largely specific to condensin DC. The insertion of ‘<italic>super rex</italic>’ composed of an array of strong <italic>rex</italic> elements was capable of creating a spreading domain and forming a boundary between two domains of interaction on either side of the insertion. Insertion of three <italic>rex</italic> sites on an autosome led to recruitment and spreading of condensin DC and formed a loop-anchored TAD. Together our data suggest that <italic>rex</italic> sites are both loading sites and bidirectional barriers for condensin DC, a one-sided loop extruder with movable inactive anchor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Condensin DC is a developmentally maintained loop-extruding factor targeted to the X-chromosome</title><p>We performed Hi-C analysis in hermaphrodite mixed developmental stage embryos and L3 larvae and describe three notable observations indicating that X-chromosome harbors an additional loop-extruding factor (LEF), condensin DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), throughout the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developmentally conserved evidence of X-chromosome enriched loop extruding factor, condensin dosage compensation (DC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of the dosage compensation complex in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

As randomly distributed LEFs track along DNA, pairs of increasingly distant genomic loci are looped in 3D space except when LEFs encounter a barrier. This results in the observed insulation effect, whereby contacts within TADs are enriched more than contacts across TADs. In the mammalian system, the essential components of TAD formation consist of cohesin and CTCF, which correspond to LEFs and barriers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fudenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, while cohesin is present, a CTCF homolog is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heger et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, no strong TAD structures are present on autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, chromosome-I) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, X-chromosome is globally bound by condensin DC and organized into distinct TADs separated by <italic>rex</italic> sites, which are strongly bound by the DCC subunits, including SDC-2 and SDC-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike the CTCF removal experiments where cohesin remains bound, the loss of SDC-2 results in the failure of condensin DC to localize to the X-chromosome and dissolution of TADs, suggesting that SDC-2 function as both LEF loader and barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Second, X-chromosome show a characteristic enrichment of 3D DNA contacts compared to autosomes.

Experimental perturbations of cohesin and its regulator proteins (NIPBL/WAPL) in the mammalian system led to the conclusion that the decrease in the steepness of the P(s), or the characteristic shoulder, observed in the unperturbed state is indicative of loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fudenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haarhuis and Rowland, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we observe the similar characteristic shoulder for the X-chromosome compared to the autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). LEF modeling of Hi-C data proposes that the peak position on the log-derivative of P(s) corresponds to the mean loop size and that increasing the number of LEFs in loop dense regime would decrease the mean loop size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Polovnikov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goloborodko et al., 2016</xref>). Using the same metric, we find that the mean loop size for <italic>C. elegans</italic> X-chromosomes is 200 kb in embryo and 125 kb in L3s and 400 kb for autosomes. The X-chromosomes thus have a smaller loop size than autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with condensin DC being an LEF, the loss of SDC-2 abolishes both condensin DC binding and this characteristic shoulder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Third, the X-chromosome shows weaker A/B sub-compartmentalization than autosomes. The checker-board pattern of the Hi-C matrix, also known as A/B compartmentalization, indicates the spatial segregation between transcriptionally active and inactive regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Imakaev et al., 2012</xref>). The loss of cohesin or the cohesin-unloader WAPL results in respective increase or decrease in compartmentalization, suggesting that the activity of cohesin regulates compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nuebler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haarhuis and Rowland, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). Previous compartment analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has shown that each chromosome is largely divided into three sections: two flanking arms and the center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bian et al., 2020</xref>). This division has been assigned the term A/B compartments, with the center being the singular A segment and the two arms making up the two segments of B compartment. However, upon zooming in, we observe a more fine-scale checker-board pattern that coincides with orthogonal data such as H3K27ac/me3 and chromHMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>). The comparison of autosomes and the X-chromosome reveals that the sub-compartment strength of X-chromosome is weaker than that of autosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with X-chromosome harboring additional LEFs, as additional active movement of chromatin imposed by condensin DC would further antagonize compartmentalization.</p><p>In summary, the strong <italic>rex</italic> sites acting as TAD boundaries, characteristic shoulder in contact frequency plots, and weaker sub-compartments of the X-chromosome suggest that condensin DC is an LEF that binds to and organizes X-chromosome structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spreading of condensin DC entails loop extrusion but cannot sufficiently form TADs without <italic>rex</italic> sites</title><p>In the mammalian system, the two components of TAD formation are genetically separable, namely cohesin and CTCF. This allows one to study the effect of LEFs in the absence of barriers by removing CTCF. However, in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DC system, a protein that uniquely corresponds to the barrier component of the model has not been isolated. Therefore, to address the function of condensin DC in the absence of barrier elements, we performed Hi-C on a strain in which chromosome-X and V are fused, where condensin DC ‘spreads’ into chromosome-V, which does not have any <italic>rex</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We make three observations on the Hi-C matrix. First, there are no noticeable TADs on chromosome-V side of the fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that <italic>rex</italic> sites are unique elements of the X-chromosome that are required for TAD formation. Second, enrichment of DNA contacts closer to the main diagonal occur specifically for the chromosome-V side of the fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, third panel), which coincides with the decrease in mean loop size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Third, weakening of checker-board pattern on chromosome-V side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset), which coincides with the local decrease in sub-compartment strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Hi-C features on the chromosome-V side becoming more similar to the X-chromosome are consistent with the generalized model that the activity of LEFs, and not the presence of barriers, modulates chromosome loop size and compartments. In summary, the spreading of condensin DC is partially a reflection of loop extrusion, which cannot sufficiently create TADs without the presence of <italic>rex</italic> sites.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Spreading of condensin dosage compensation (DC) coincides with decrease in loop size and weakening of compartments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Condensin DC spreads ~3 MB into the autosomal region of X;V fusion chromosome. 12-MB region snapshot of Hi-C contacts in the wildtype karyotype and X;V fusion strain.

In the bacterial <italic>parS</italic>/parB system, condensin is recruited to and spreads from the <italic>parS</italic> site to form a secondary diagonal on Hi-C matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stigler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). This pattern suggests an effective two-sided loop extrusion initiating from <italic>parS</italic> site. Alternatively, in simulation, one-sided loop extrusion from a loading site results in ‘flames’ (also referred to as ‘stripes’). This is observed as a ‘+’ centered at the loading site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banigan et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with one-sided extrusion, we observe flames emanating from <italic>super rex</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The flames off the endogenous strong <italic>rex</italic> sites are also apparent on the X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, we observe an insulation effect at the <italic>super rex</italic>. Given that <italic>rex</italic> sites do not function as indiscriminate barriers for other SMC complexes, the insulation effect implies that condensin DC also facilitates contacts between non-<italic>rex</italic> elements on the same side of the <italic>rex</italic> site.</p><p>Third, the three <italic>rex</italic> insertion, where there are both recruitment and spreading from multiple sources. In the three-<italic>rex</italic> insertion, we observe all features of TADs, including enriched square contacts, insulation, flame, and corner peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that the presence of multiple <italic>rex</italic> sites can sufficiently recapitulate TADs observed on X-chromosome. A flame that extends past the right <italic>rex-8</italic> implies that a subset of one-sided LEFs loaded on the left <italic>rex-8</italic> can move past the right <italic>rex-8</italic>, suggesting a probabilistic barrier function by the <italic>rex</italic> sites.</p><p>When zoomed out, the spreading of condensin DC observed in <italic>super rex</italic> and three <italic>rex</italic> insertions coincides with the local increase in the insulation score compared to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, red arrows). This suggests that observed changes in 3D structure are not simply a redistribution of existing contact frequencies but rather a formation of additional contacts. Such effects are not observed in the control region on chromosome-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In summary, the facilitation of 3D contacts that coincides with the spreading of condensin DC along with the relative insulation at the ectopic <italic>rex</italic> sites supports a model based on loop extrusion by condensin DC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The cooperativity of <italic>rex</italic> sites contributes to the X-specific recruitment and spreading of condensin DC</title><p>In previous work, we proposed that cooperation between <italic>rex</italic> sites ensures X-specific and robust binding of condensin DC to an entire chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albritton and Ercan, 2018</xref>). Our ChIP-seq analysis of spreading in ectopic insertion strains suggests that the cooperativity is also involved in spreading. The insertion of a single strong <italic>rex-8</italic> on chromosome-II resulted in recruitment but not spreading of condensin DC. This lack of spreading was ‘rescued’ by the use of engineered <italic>super rex</italic> (an array of six strong <italic>rex</italic> sites) or insertion of additional <italic>rex</italic> sites (<italic>rex-1</italic> and <italic>rex-8</italic>), suggesting that the cooperative function of <italic>rex</italic> sites is reflected in both recruitment and spreading.</p><p>In this study, insertion of three <italic>rex</italic> sites in close proximity (within 100 kb) recapitulated the Hi-C features of the loop-anchored TADs on the X-chromosomes. A previous attempt of three <italic>rex</italic> insertions spaced far apart (within 3 MB) resulted in weak recruitment of DCC and no changes on Hi-C matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, cooperativity must be distance dependent. On the autosome, the inserted <italic>rex</italic> sites may have to compete against the X. Indeed, even with a <italic>super rex</italic> insertion that recruited at a level comparable <italic>rex</italic> sites on the X, the level of spreading remained lower than that of the endogenous X-chromosome. On the X, activity of many weaker <italic>rex</italic> sites in between the 1 MB distance (average between strong <italic>rex</italic> sites) may contribute to the robust recruitment and spreading of condensin DC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Previous models of condensin DC binding on the X-chromosomes</title><p>Currently, there are two seemingly contradictory models for how condensin DC binding occurs on the X-chromosome. The first one is the recruitment to and spreading from <italic>rex</italic> sites some of which include a 12 bp sequence motif required for their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albritton and Ercan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer, 2022b</xref>). It is not clear what protein binds directly to the motif, but the candidates are the SDC proteins required for condensin recruitment to the X. Unlike <italic>rex</italic> sites, many other segments of the X-chromosomes cannot autonomously recruit condensin DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jans et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csankovszki et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, condensin DC must ‘spread’ from <italic>rex</italic> to other sites on the X-chromosomes. Such ‘spreading’ phenomenon was later observed on X;A fusion chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ercan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The second model is the uniform loading and stalling of condensin DC at <italic>rex</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer, 2022b</xref>). This model is derived from the cohesin-related experiments in the mammalian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fudenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Golfier et al., 2020</xref>). If <italic>rex</italic> sites were preferential loading sites for a two-sided LEF, one would observe a secondary perpendicular diagonal which is not present in the Hi-C data. It was thus proposed that condensin DC loads uniformly across the X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer, 2022b</xref>). The strength of this model is in its ability to explain TADs observed on the X-chromosome using minimalistic properties. However, unlike the mammalian cohesin, condensin DC lacks in vitro evidence showing that it is a two-sided LEF. Additionally, this model necessitates an added complexity in order to explain how condensin DC is specifically targeted to the X-chromosome. In the following section, we reconcile the two models by proposing that the loading of condensin DC at <italic>rex</italic> sites can result in TAD formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A model to explain X-specific recruitment of condensin DC and formation of loop-anchored TADs by <italic>rex</italic> sites</title><p>We consider three non-mutually exclusive features of the DCC system each with increasing complexity in order to explain how <italic>rex</italic> sites give rise to TADs observed on X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of condensin dosage compensation (DC) recruitment and spreading forming loop-anchored topologically associating domains (TADs).</title><p>Shown are three conceptually distinct features that contribute to TAD formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> dosage compensation complex (DCC) system. The model as a group contains the following properties: (i) <italic>rex</italic> is a bidirectional barrier, (ii) <italic>rex</italic> is a loading site, (iii) <italic>rex</italic> can activate/enhance weaker ‘secondary loading sites,’ (iv) condensin DC is a one-sided loop extruder, and (v) condensin DC’s loop-anchor is prone to displacement.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-68745-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>1) One-sided loop extrusion from <italic>rex</italic> sites: We observe that <italic>rex</italic> sites are both loading sites acting as the source of condensin DC spreading and bidirectional barriers. We begin by proposing that condensin DC is a one-sided LEF based on the presence of flames and the absence of a perpendicular diagonal. In simulation, one-sided LEFs cannot form corner-peaks due to high frequency of gaps between two oppositely oriented LEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banigan et al., 2020</xref>). This is unlikely to be a limitation in our system, because (i) in simulation, the corner-peaks can be ‘rescued’ with strong preferential loading at the boundary and (ii) a recent preprint reported that the cleavage of DPY-26, a kleisin subunit shared by condensin I and DC, did not eliminate <italic>rex-rex</italic> corner-peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das, 2022</xref>). Therefore, the corner-peak does not necessitate an explanation based on loop extrusion.</p><p>The main limitation of condensin DC loading and extruding only from the <italic>re</italic>x sites is the inability to explain condensin-DC-mediated contacts within TADs (i.e. form transient loops between two non-<italic>rex</italic> elements). While it is possible that <italic>rex</italic> sites are merely preferential loading sites, how non-<italic>rex</italic> loading evades autosomes raises more questions. One explanation is that such off-target loading is skewed toward the X-chromosome by the increased condensin DC ‘local concentration’ produced by SDCs. However, the loss of SDC-2 does not result in global redistribution of condensin DC; in the absence of SDC-2, the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) recovery of condensin DC shows similar dynamics to that of free-floating molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breimann et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the simplest conclusion reconciling many observations is that the <italic>rex</italic> sites act as condensin DC loading sites, and additional features of the DCC system explain the non-<italic>rex</italic> loops within TADs.</p><p>2) Loader spreading from the <italic>rex</italic> sites: It has been proposed that the condensin DC loaders also ‘spread,’ although to a lesser extent than condensin DC, leading to SDC-2, SDC-3, and DPY-30 enrichment at active promoters on the X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albritton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Street et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pferdehirt et al., 2011</xref>). One possible model is that these SDC-bound promoters function as secondary loading sites. However, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and previous peak analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albritton et al., 2017</xref>), the number of SDC-2 (the hermaphrodite specific protein that initiates condensin DC recruitment to the X) binding sites on X-chromosome is an order of magnitude below that of condensin DC subunits. In other words, SDC-2 distribution may contribute but is too sparse to mimic uniform loading across X-chromosome, a necessary feature in order to enrich contacts within a TAD.</p><p>3) Loop-anchor displacement from the <italic>rex</italic> sites: We propose that upon loading, condensin DC may begin one-sided loop extrusion, but the inactive loop-anchor at the <italic>rex</italic> site is prone to being displaced. This model is inspired from the simulation work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banigan et al., 2020</xref>, which informs that one-sided loop extrusion from a loading site whose inactive anchor is prone to displacement by diffusion (semi-diffusive one-sided loop extrusion (LE) model with a loading site) results in an increasingly murkier flame with increasing rate of diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banigan et al., 2020</xref>). Movement of the inactive anchor would allow condensin DC to form transient loops between two non-<italic>rex</italic> elements forming increased contacts within TADs. It is possible that the anchor displacement is promoted by another SMC complex, subsequent loading of condensin DC, intermittent translocation without loop formation, or diffusion.</p><p>A candidate SMC complex displacing condensin DC loop anchor is cohesin, whose loader/processivity factor PQN-85 (NIPBL homolog in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) is enriched at the <italic>rex</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>). The hypothesis that incoming condensin DC molecules leading to anchor displacement is based on the idea that a one-sided LEF uses the loading site as loop extrusion anchor. This puts the currently extruding and free-floating LEFs at a competition for the loading site. One possible outcome of this competition is that the subsequent loading event displaces the inactive anchor of currently extruding LEF, which is then further pushed away from the loading site by the initiation of loop extrusion by newly loaded LEF. Anchor displacement could also happen through ATP-dependent directional translocation without loop formation as observed in double tethered assay where DNA is tightly anchored at two ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>). This observation was explained by combining loop-capture and power-stroke model, in which the mode of translocation converts from loop extrusion to linear translocation with increasing DNA tension, suggesting that the two different modes of active translocation, LE and non-LE, can be embedded in the same SMC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nomidis et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Establishment and maintenance of the X-chromosome 3D structure</title><p>In this paper, we used genome editing and performed ChIP-seq and Hi-C to analyze the binding and function of condensin DC. The limitation of our study is the lack of a temporal component, addressing how the structure of the X-chromosome is initialized and maintained. Previous work showed that DCC localizes to and represses X-chromosome in the early stages of embryo development (~40 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kramer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawes et al., 1999</xref>). In mixed stage embryos and L3 worms, we may be analyzing a maintenance/equilibrium state of X-chromosome organization. Hi-C data in a recent preprint presented that upon degradation of SDC-3 or cleavage of kleisin subunit DPY-26, TADs disappear but the <italic>rex-rex</italic> corner peaks remain unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das, 2022</xref>). This is in contrast to the genetic loss of SDC-2 resulting in the complete loss of all features of TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that <italic>rex-rex</italic> interactions initiated by SDC-2 mediated recruitment and condensin DC loop extrusion in early embryogenesis are maintained by a different mechanism during later development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The role of condensin DC loop extrusion and TADs in transcription repression of the X-chromosomes</title><p>Previously, we showed that genes located at the autosomal spreading region in the X;V fusion chromosome are repressed due to condensin DC spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Street et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we show that this repression does not coincide with TAD formation on the chromosome-V side, and despite a clear loop-anchored TAD in three <italic>rex</italic> insertions, there was minimal effect on transcription. One hypothesis is that the process of loop extrusion by condensin DC is necessary for repression rather than insulation of 3D contacts by <italic>rex</italic> sites. Consistent with this idea, deletion of the eight strong <italic>rex</italic> sites did not result in changes in Hi-C distance decay curve, implying that the loop extrusion activity of condensin DC is largely unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, shortening of 3D contacts indicative of condensin DC loop extrusion in the X;V fusion chromosome coincides with repression. Alternatively, condensin DC loop extrusion is a mechanism evolved to distribute the complex across long distances from the <italic>rex</italic> sites to accomplish chromosome-wide dosage compensation. Consistent with this idea, upon TOP-2 depletion, the processivity of condensin DC loop extrusion reduces, and the spreading of the complex to the chromosome also reduces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morao et al., 2021</xref>). The repressive effect of condensin DC may be local and loop extrusion independent. In agreement with this, a null mutant of <italic>dpy-21</italic> (a non condensin DCC subunit) results in X upregulation without significantly altering Hi-C interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breimann et al., 2022</xref>).

The rationale for this rescaling is that DPY-27 ChIP-seq experiment has a technical variability with regards to the enrichment of reads across the chromosome-X. If ChIP-seq ‘works well,’ proportionally more reads are mapped to the X-chromosome, which is necessarily coupled with proportionally less reads mapping to autosomes. This variability makes ChIP-seq hard to compare across conditions. Therefore, we use total signal on autosomes (excluding chromosome-II) and that of X-chromosome as biologically reliable data points. The chromosome-II was excluded because chromosome-II is the ‘experimental’ chromosome where <italic>rex</italic> sites are inserted thus the signal may differ between conditions. This makes chromosome-II not a reliable biological data point across experimental conditions. For chip-chip data from Ercan 2009 used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we use the distal (farthest away from the fusion site) 5 MB of chrX side as X and distal 5 MB of chrV side as A. For SDC-3 ChIP-seq data, input normalized signal is simply autosome centered since <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> have a difference of near 0. For any other ChIP-seq data used in the paper, simply input normalized data is used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hi-C</title><p>Worms were grown on standard NGM plates, and gravid adults were bleached to obtain embryos, which were crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde and stored at –80°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ercan et al., 2007</xref>). Frozen embryos were then resuspended in and crosslinked with 2% formaldehyde in M9 for another 30 min. The embryos were spun down at 6000 g for 30 s and washed once with 100 mM Tris Cl pH 7.5 and twice with M9. The embryo pellet was resuspended in 1 mL embryo buffer (110 mM NaCl, 40 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, and 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5) containing one unit chitinase (Sigma), digested approximately 15 min, and blastomeres were washed with embryo buffer twice by spinning at 1000 g 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in Nuclei Buffer A (15 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.34 M Sucrose, 0.15 mM Spermine, 0.5 mM Spermidine, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF [1× Calbiochem Protease Inhibitor cocktail I], 0.25% NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100), centrifuged at 1000 g for 5 min at 4°C then resuspended in 1.5 mL Nuclei Buffer A. The embryos were then dounced 10× with a loose pestle and 10× with a tight pestle. The nuclei were separated from the cellular debris through spinning down the dounced material at 200 G, then collecting the supernatant containing the nuclei into a separate tube. The pellet was resuspended in 1.5 mL, and the douncing process was repeated four times. Each individual supernatant containing nuclei was checked for quality by DAPI staining, and those without debris were pooled and spun down at 1000 G for 10 min at 4°C. Approximately 20 µL nuclei pellet were used to proceed to Arima Hi-C per the manufacturer’s instructions. Library preparation was performed using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit using the protocol provided by Arima. Paired-end Illumina sequencing was performed with Nextseq or Novaseq.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hi-C data processing and analysis</title><p>Hi-C data analysis: The Hi-C data was mapped to ce10 (WS220) reference genome using default parameters of the Juicer pipeline version 1.5.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Durand et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that the manuscript has potential, but extensive revision and new experiments and analysis are needed to make the case for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and move forward. The reviewers raised concerns about (i) the novelty of the study (as compared to Albritton et al. 2018, and Anderson et al. 2019, and other studies); and (I) validity of the conclusions drawn from presented data. Nevertheless, the study is unique in its approach of inserting rex sites into largely DCC-free autosomes, and can be improved and developed to become an impactful publication.</p><p>Reviewers and the Reviewing Editor feel that suggested mechanisms, i.e. (i) loading of DCC at rex sites, and (ii) function of rex sites as extrusion boundaries, cannot fully explain presented data. While ChIP-seq data support the loading of DCC but less of its spreading, the Hi-C data indicates the boundary role and shows no indication of the loading. I.e. Hi-C and ChIP-seq data are hard to reconcile with each other. If DCC indeed loads at integrated rex sites, one would expect to see accumulation at these sites in ChIP-seq (that may to some extent be present) and stripes emanating from rex sites on Hi-C as observed at condensin loading sites in bacteria (in the case of bidirectional extrusion) or as computed in simulation (Banigan et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2020;9:e53558). Such stripes are clearly absent in presented data, putting the loading at rex in question. Reviewers didn't find the author's explanations coherent and convincing.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) If the authors want to pursue the double-function of rex sites they need to find support for the loading process in Hi-C. Potential ways of doing this would be to generate Hi-C data for single insertions. To increase the effect, authors may want to insert a strong rex site into an autosome. Or insert many rex sites (~5-10) spaced far from each other and examine an average Hi-C map at rex sites. Deeper sequencing and high-quality Hi-C (new MNase-involving or similar protocols) can help to reveal patterns of loading. Horizontal or 45-degree lines or other structures emanating from rex sites would be indicative of loading.</p><p>(*) The Reviewing Editor would also recommend considering a possibility of depleting non-DCC condensin I (or other suspected SMCs) that may be abundant at autosomes and masks the effect of DCC loading. In fact, abundance of another SMC may explain apparent disagreement between ChIP-seq and Hi-C: i.e. rex sites of DCC loading would block extrusion by another SMC, while having little effect on Hi-C maps otherwise. It's presence could be quantified by IP for another component of the condensin complex. And relative abundance of DCC and non-DCC condensin I could reveal loading.</p><p>2) The authors should consider the alternative that peaks on DCC ChIP-seq are mere reflection of stopping at rex rather than loading there. Demonstrating spreading of DCC from rex is essential. The Reviewing Editor suggests examining the level of DCC at non-rex sites, proximal to rex: an increasing level of DCC at such non-rex sites upon insertion of more and more potent rex sites would support loading at rex. Perhaps a series of single-site insertions could be better than inserting two sites as they could be mutually blocking each other.</p><p>3) Analysis: ChIP-seq analysis and quantification appears to have several issues. The scale on ChIP-seq plots appear to be insistent and disagree with each other (Figure 1A: Y scale goes to 1.5 and peaks at rex are &lt;1.5, while in the inset up to 3, and several peaks exceed 3.) Figure S1A is more telling as it shows X-chromosome on the same scale. Quantitative ChIP-seq (with spike-in) may be the best solution for comparative analysis, but authors could use signal (peaks or total) on X-chromosome for normalization of non-X signals, making non-X ChIP-seq data comparable with each other. Figure 3B ChIPseq also appears all on different Y-scales, normalizing the distal part of X-chromosome can help with comparative analysis. Similarly, reviewers were concerned about quantification of 4C, its agreement with Hi-C. Analysis on Figure 4B wasn't clear and raised several concerns.

In Figure 4, a zoom-in on the affected portion of the chromosome V (17.5-20Mb of the fusion chromsome) may more convincingly support the claims.

Many of the claims – insulation by individual rex sites, formation of loops/dots between rex sites on Hi-C maps, spreading of condensins on autosomes fused with the chromosome X – were already made in or could be inferred from the previous studies (e.g. Anderson et al. 2019, Crane et al. 2015). Of course, the authors do cite these studies in a complete and honest fashion; moreover, if I understand correctly, this study for the first time showed the effect of rex site insertions into a &quot;clean slate&quot; of an autosome, which is an important achievement. However, for a person who is not deeply engaged with the field of dosage compensation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the novelty of this paper may not be immediately obvious.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68745.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers and the Reviewing Editor agree that the manuscript has potential, but extensive revision and new experiments and analysis are needed to make the case for publication in eLife and move forward. The reviewers raised concerns about (i) the novelty of the study (as compared to Albritton et al. 2018, and Anderson et al. 2019, and other studies); and (I) validity of the conclusions drawn from presented data. Nevertheless, the study is unique in its approach of inserting rex sites into largely DCC-free autosomes, and can be improved and developed to become an impactful publication.</p></disp-quote><p>The novelty of the study:</p><p>Our work combines the strengths and addresses the weaknesses of models that were put forward in previous publications and tests several predictions using ectopic insertion experiments, presenting a new model that reconciles contradictory observations from previous work. More specifically:</p><p>Compared to qChIP data in Albritton et al. 2018 (Figure 6), our work adds a key experimental test for loop extrusion hypothesis (the <italic>super rex</italic> insertion on chromosome-II) and provides ChIP-seq data in the insertions, which (unlike qChIP) enabled analysis of condensin DC spreading (see section on Condensin DC is loaded at rex sites and spreads in either direction). Albritton et al. 2018 demonstrates the ectopically inserted rex sites cooperatively enhances binding at <italic>rex</italic>. Here we demonstrate that their cooperative function is also important for spreading and changes in 3D structure of DNA.</p><p>Compared to the <italic>rex</italic> deletion or <italic>rex</italic> insertion on X-chromosome in Anderson et al. 2019, our work shows the sufficiency of <italic>rex</italic> sites, when functioning as a cooperative unit, to recapitulate features of the X-chromosome TADs on autosome (see section on Ectopic insertion of rex elements leads to condensin DC spreading and formation of loop-anchored TADs). While the similar attempt was made in Anderson et al. 2019 (Figure S4), the authors inserted <italic>rex</italic> sites megabase apart from each other on chromosome-I, resulting in minimal binding and no changes in Hi-C matrix, likely due to the lack of cooperation between <italic>rex</italic> sites.</p><p>Validity of the conclusions drawn from presented data:</p><p>The reviewers were concerned by the lack of a stripe/flame emanating from the <italic>rex</italic> sites. The original Hi-C data using mixed developmental stage embryos (also used in Anderson et al. paper) provides patterns from a more heterogeneous cell population compared to staged L3 larvae, which we added to this manuscript where Hi-C patterns are ‘sharper.’ This led to the observation of ‘stripes’ and TADs (Figure 1). In the text we discuss the results and interpretation of each of our ectopic insertion experiments and published data in light of different models of loop extrusion to clarify the validity of the conclusions drawn from presented data. At the end, we add a model that condensin DC is a one-sided LEF with a movable inactive anchor (see section on A model to explain X-specific recruitment of condensin DC and formation of loop-anchored TADs by rex sites). Aside from the limitation of Hi-C resolution, our reasoning is in agreement with the simulation in Banigan et al. 2020.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewers and the Reviewing Editor feel that suggested mechanisms, i.e. (i) loading of DCC at rex sites, and (ii) function of rex sites as extrusion boundaries, cannot fully explain presented data. While ChIP-seq data support the loading of DCC but less of its spreading, the Hi-C data indicates the boundary role and shows no indication of the loading. I.e. Hi-C and ChIP-seq data are hard to reconcile with each other. If DCC indeed loads at integrated rex sites, one would expect to see accumulation at these sites in ChIP-seq (that may to some extent be present) and stripes emanating from rex sites on Hi-C as observed at condensin loading sites in bacteria (in the case of bidirectional extrusion) or as computed in simulation (Banigan et al. eLife 2020;9:e53558). Such stripes are clearly absent in presented data, putting the loading at rex in question. Reviewers didn't find the author's explanations coherent and convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>To summarize, the reviewers comment that the model of <italic>rex</italic> sites acting as loading (i) and barrier (ii) sites cannot fully explain data. We argue that:</p><p>1) ChIP-seq data from <italic>rex</italic> insertions does not result in spreading: Because robust recruitment of condensin DC requires multiple strong <italic>rex</italic> sites, we engineered a more potent version of an existing <italic>rex</italic> site by stringing together six truncated <italic>rex</italic> elements, which we call <italic>super rex</italic>. In this strain, spreading from a point source is clearly apparent and diminishes with increasing distance away from the insertion site. This spreading is also observable in conditions with more than one <italic>rex</italic> inserted (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure 5). We surmise that the lack of spreading in the original data had more to do with the initial ChIP analysis, mapping reads to the normal reference genome (here we made “corresponding edited genomes with the inserted sequence included” and not using a normalization method that minimized technical variation between replicates (here we used scaling to make ChIP data between strains comparable to each other). Please see the methods section for updated analyses.</p><p>2) Hi-C lack of stripe: In three <italic>rex</italic> insertion and <italic>super rex</italic> insertion, the stripe is weak but visible, particularly when data is analyzed compared to the wild type control (Figure 6). In addition, the stripes from averaged Hi-C data plotted across strong <italic>rex</italic> sites are more visible in the L3 at the endogenous X chromosome (Figure 1). The lack of stripes in the original data is likely due to doing Hi-C experiment in embryo where the patterns are murky, mapping to the reference genome (instead of updated genome with inserted sequence), and not providing the comparison data to wild type (division of Hi-C matrix between insertion/wildtype), and not using a more dynamic color range. All of which has been fixed in the revision (Figure 6). We thank the reviewers/editor for their specific suggestions while solving these problems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) If the authors want to pursue the double-function of rex sites they need to find support for the loading process in Hi-C. Potential ways of doing this would be to generate Hi-C data for single insertions. To increase the effect, authors may want to insert a strong rex site into an autosome. Or insert many rex sites (~5-10) spaced far from each other and examine an average Hi-C map at rex sites. Deeper sequencing and high-quality Hi-C (new MNase-involving or similar protocols) can help to reveal patterns of loading. Horizontal or 45-degree lines or other structures emanating from rex sites would be indicative of loading.</p></disp-quote><p>Generate Hi-C data for single insertions:</p><p>Previously, in Albritton et al. 2019, <italic>rex-8</italic> was computationally categorized as the strongest of all <italic>rex</italic> sites based on ChIP-seq data. We performed ChIP-seq and Hi-C in single <italic>rex</italic> (<italic>rex-8</italic>) insertion on chromosome-II, where there was no spreading and no changes in Hi-C matrix. This is in agreement with Anderson et al. 2019 (Figure S4), where the authors inserted 3 <italic>rex</italic> sites spaced a megabase apart from each other only to observe no changes on Hi-C matrix. Thus, the problem with inserting a single strong <italic>rex</italic> is that it is not enough to create a domain of condensin DC binding on an autosome. To address this problem, we devised a stronger <italic>rex</italic> (see also response to summarized editor comments above).</p><p>In revision, we generated a <italic>super rex</italic> containing six 150bp truncated strong <italic>rex</italic> sites, which gave a robust spreading and observable stripes emanating to both sides from the insertion site. While we note that <italic>super rex</italic> is not a naturally occurring DNA element, it is simply a combination of existing <italic>rex</italic> sites, which do not have a clear definition other than they harbor one or more of the 12-bp motifs. We attribute the lack of ‘spreading’ or effect on Hi-C data in single <italic>rex</italic> insertion experiments to the autosomes being outcompeted by the X-chromosome for access to condensin DC (see in Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(*) The Reviewing Editor would also recommend considering a possibility of depleting non-DCC condensin I (or other suspected SMCs) that may be abundant at autosomes and masks the effect of DCC loading. In fact, abundance of another SMC may explain apparent disagreement between ChIP-seq and Hi-C: i.e. rex sites of DCC loading would block extrusion by another SMC, while having little effect on Hi-C maps otherwise. It's presence could be quantified by IP for another component of the condensin complex. And relative abundance of DCC and non-DCC condensin I could reveal loading.</p></disp-quote><p>Comment on a non-DCC SMC complex masking the effect of loading/depleting non-DCC SMC complexes:</p><p>The potential interactions between different SMC complexes is a new avenue of research that we are currently pursuing. While we did not deplete other SMC complexes in the current study, we agree that the experiments make a powerful prediction. If condensin DC is being pushed around by another SMC complex, then removal of such protein would enhance ‘stripes’ at <italic>rex</italic> sites. This is incorporated into our model as a possibility (Figure 7), but we would like to keep this as part of the future direction of our study.</p><p>Comment on <italic>rex</italic> sites of DCC loading would block extrusion by another SMC:</p><p><italic>Rex-8</italic> insertion on chromosome-II is an interesting situation where there is condensin DC binding at the <italic>rex</italic> but no spreading. Here, binding without spreading resulted in no observable insulation effect on Hi-C, suggesting that condensin DC binding at <italic>rex</italic> sites do not function as indiscriminate barriers to other SMC complexes on autosomes.</p><p>Comment on relative abundance of DCC and non-DCC condensin I could reveal loading:</p><p>Given the conclusion that <italic>rex-8</italic> does not act as a boundary, we did not ChIP for other SMC complexes. Note that DPY-27 is a subunit unique to condensin DC and is not part of condensin-I/II (Csankovszki 2009).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should consider the alternative that peaks on DCC ChIP-seq are mere reflection of stopping at rex rather than loading there. Demonstrating spreading of DCC from rex is essential. The Reviewing Editor suggests examining the level of DCC at non-rex sites, proximal to rex: an increasing level of DCC at such non-rex sites upon insertion of more and more potent rex sites would support loading at rex. Perhaps a series of single-site insertions could be better than inserting two sites as they could be mutually blocking each other.</p></disp-quote><p>Demonstrating spreading from <italic>rex</italic> by analyzing insertion of more and more potent single <italic>rex</italic> site:</p><p>We performed ChIP-seq upon insertion of weaker (<italic>rex-1</italic>), strong rex (<italic>rex-8</italic>) and <italic>super rex</italic> (an array of 6 strong <italic>rex</italic>), which showed no recruitment, recruitment and recruitment and spreading respectively (see section on Condensin DC is loaded at rex sites and spreads in either direction). The reviewer’s prediction that addition of more potent <italic>rex</italic> resulting in increasing DCC level at surrounding regions is qualitatively met. A conceptually similar prediction that adding more <italic>rex</italic> would increase DCC level at surrounding regions is also met t (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 5-1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Analysis: ChIP-seq analysis and quantification appears to have several issues. The scale on ChIP-seq plots appear to be insistent and disagree with each other (Figure 1A: Y scale goes to 1.5 and peaks at rex are &lt;1.5, while in the inset up to 3, and several peaks exceed 3.) Figure S1A is more telling as it shows X-chromosome on the same scale. Quantitative ChIP-seq (with spike-in) may be the best solution for comparative analysis, but authors could use signal (peaks or total) on X-chromosome for normalization of non-X signals, making non-X ChIP-seq data comparable with each other. Figure 3B ChIPseq also appears all on different Y-scales, normalizing the distal part of X-chromosome can help with comparative analysis. Similarly, reviewers were concerned about quantification of 4C, its agreement with Hi-C. Analysis on Figure 4B wasn't clear and raised several concerns. It was also surprising that visual inspection of Hi-C in Figure 4A doesn't indicate or support findings in Figure 4B.</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis ChIP-seq scales inconsistent:</p><p>The original ChIP scores did not do further normalization to deal with the variability between the biological replicates of ChIPs, particularly in embryos. To address this problem, we used the mean signal on autosomes (excluding chromosome-II where <italic>rex</italic> sites are inserted) and the X-chromosome to rescale the input normalized ChIP-seq data such that the mean of autosomes is 0 and the mean of the X is 1 (see method section mRNA-seq and ChIP-seq). Similar method was used for X-V fusion. This normalization recapitulates the patterns in non normalized data while taking care of the values on the y axis such that they are similar between biological replicates. The revised manuscript provides the details of the analysis and better figures representing the ChIP data.</p><p>Hi-C analysis concerns regarding Hi-C quantification and visualization of XV fusion:</p><p>We did additional analyses of the X;V data. In revision, we provide log2ratio plot, which shows increased ‘shorter-range’ interactions in the XV fusion strain that is the most pronounced on the chromosome-V side of the fusion where the spreading occurs. We also adopted the method of computing the log-derivative of log-binned P(s) to infer mean loop size (see section on Spreading of condensin DC entails loop extrusion but cannot sufficiently form TADs without rex sites). The quantification shows that the mean loop size of the fusion side becomes similar to that of the mean loop size of the X-chromosome (Figure 2C). We have also included compartment analysis, which shows decreased compartmentalization specifically at the autosomal spreading region (Figure 2D), and suggested increased loop extrusion at this area due to condensin DC spreading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers raised concerns with results and interpretation of dCas9-targeted boundary. The lack of the insulation on Hi-C argues against not in favor of the stopping function of dCas9-recruited proteins.

However, computing log2ratio of the matrix and insulation scores, we note a slight increase in the insulation effect at the targeted locus relative to the surrounding.</p><p>Loading of DCC/over-ChIPability due to accessibility:</p><p>We performed IgG ChIP, and as the reviewer had predicted, the targeting of dCas9 resulted in the loci becoming hyper-chippable. We also show that this is not an artifact of cross-reactivity with protein A or G. This ChIP-seq artifact could not be computationally ‘removed’ by division, as IgG signal at the loci is much greater than that of DPY-27 (see section on A dCas9-based block failed to recapitulate rex-like boundary on the X-chromosome). We thus refrained from making any conclusions about condensin DC binding at the block.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Presentation: presenting Hi-C in grayscale is suboptimal as colors would allow one to see the dynamic range of the data.
