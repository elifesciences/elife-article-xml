chinensis</italic> exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, specifically in the form of summer-form and winter-form, which have distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underling neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remains largely unknown. Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Firstly, we identified <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> as two typical subunits of Bursicon in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, which were regulated by low temperature (10 °C) and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. Subsequently, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. In summary, these findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A bug known as pear psylla is a common pest on pear trees in China and other East Asian countries. It feeds off the sap of young leaves and shoots, causing damage to the trees and decreasing the amount of fruit they produce. To survive all-year round, pear psylla changes its body between distinct summer- and winter-forms, a phenomenon known as seasonal polyphenism. In winter, cooler temperatures trigger young pear psylla to darken and thicken the protective cuticle layer coating their bodies. However, the mechanisms behind this seasonal transformation are not fully understood.</p><p>One possible regulator of this process is the hormone Bursicon which is known to control cuticle development in juvenile insects. The hormone has two subunits that join to form dimers, which then activate specific receptors that initiate signaling pathways within the insect’s body. Here, Zhang et al. used molecular biology and genetic techniques to study the role of Bursicon dimers in seasonal polyphenism in pear psylla.</p><p>Bursicon can assemble either as a homodimer (made up of two identical subunits), or a heterodimer (made up two different subunits). Zhang et al. found that low temperatures triggered the formation of both homodimers and heterodimers of Bursicon. However, only the heterodimers activated a receptor, called <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, which enabled the pear psylla to transition into their winter-form. The team also identified a small molecule called a micro RNA that regulates this switch by decreasing the production of the <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> receptor.</p><p>The findings by Zhang et al. advance our understanding of how seasonal polyphenism operates in pear psylla. Many other insects display seasonal polyphenism, and further research could reveal whether Bursicon plays a similar regulatory role across different species.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic></kwd><kwd>seasonal polyphenism</kwd><kwd>Neuropeptide</kwd><kwd>Bursicon</kwd><kwd>CcBurs-R</kwd><kwd>miR-6012</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32202291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Songdou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012453</institution-id><institution>China Agricultural Research System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARS-28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaoxia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrated ecological and genetic methods show that Bursicon signaling pathway and miR-6012 regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> through affecting cuticle pigment and cuticle thickness.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polyphenism is a transformation phenomenon of phenotypic plasticity, where a single genome produces multiple distinct phenotypes in response to environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). In recent years, polyphenism has garnered increasing attention and has become a focal point of research, such as ecology, evolutionary biology, epigenetics, and entomology. Nature presents us with numerous remarkable examples of polyphenism. For instance, we observe seasonal polyphenism in psylla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>) and butterflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daniels et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudach and Vilcinskas, 2021</xref>), sexual and wing polyphenism in aphids and planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shang et al., 2020</xref>), caste polyphenism in ants and honeybees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kucharski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonasio et al., 2012</xref>), sex determination in reptiles and fish regulated by temperature and social factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janzen and Phillips, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and environmentally induced polyphenism in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gratani, 2014</xref>). Undoubtedly, polyphenism plays a major contributor to the population dynamics of insects worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Noor et al., 2008</xref>). Numerous studies have reported that insect polyphenism is influenced by a range of external environment factors, such as temperature, population density, photoperiod, and dietary nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, internal neuro-hormones, including insulin, dopamine, and ecdysone, have been found to play crucial roles in insect polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Uehara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>). However, the specific molecular mechanism underling temperature-dependent polyphenism still requires further clarification.</p><p><italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li) is a pear psylla belonging to the Hemiptera order, which causes severe damage to trees and fruits in the major pear production areas across East Asian countries, including China and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hildebrand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). This phloem-sucking psylla inflicts harm on young shoots and leaves in both adult and nymph stages, leading to stunted and withered pear trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>C. chinensis</italic> secretes a substantial amount of honeydew and acts as a vector for plant pathogenic microorganisms, such as the phytoplasma of pear decline disease and <italic>Erwinia amovora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hildebrand et al., 2000</xref>). Importantly, this pest demonstrates strong adaptability to its environment and exhibits seasonal polyphenism, manifesting as summer-form (SF) and winter-form (WF), which display significant differences in morphological characteristics throughout the seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). The summer-form has a lighter body color and causes more severe damage, while the winter-form, in contrast, has a brown to dark brown body color, a larger body size, and stronger resistance to weather conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>). In a previous study, Zhang et al. demonstrated that a low temperature of 10 °C and the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> regulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle thickness and chitin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Up to now, no insect hormones or neuropeptides underling this seasonal polyphenism in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> have been identified.</p><p>Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, was initially discovered in the 1960s through neck-ligated assays. It serves a highly conserved function in insects by inducing the clerotization and melanization of the new cuticle in larvae and facilitating wing expansion in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dewey et al., 2004</xref>). Bursicon is a heterodimer neuropeptide composed of two subunits, Bursicon-α and Bursicon-β, which exert their effects through the leucine-rich repeats-containing G- protein-coupled receptor, also known as the Bursicon receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, flies with mutated Bursicon receptor, such as the <italic>rk</italic> gene, or deficient in one of the Bursicon subunits, exhibit improper tanning and altered body shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luan et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the model insect <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>, RNA interference experiments have demonstrated that the Bursicon receptor (<italic>Tcrk</italic>) is not only required for cuticle tanning, but also crucial for the development and expansion of integumentary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai and Palli, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, it has been reported that Bursicon homodimers can activate the NF-kB transcription factor <italic>Relish</italic>, leading to the induction of innate immune and stress genes during molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2012b</xref>). Consequently, insects exposed to cold conditions exhibit larger body size and darker cuticular melanization than those reared in warmer environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shearer et al., 2016</xref>). Given this background, Bursicon and its receptor are expected to play a significant role in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are approximately 23 nucleotides in length and belong to a class of small noncoding RNAs, play a crucial role in the regulation of posttranscriptional gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucas and Raikhel, 2013</xref>). Increasing studies have shown that miRNAs are important in insect polyphenism, such as miR-31, miR-9, and miR-252, as well as hormone signaling, for example, miR-133 in dopamine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, there have been no reports on miRNAs targeting Bursicon and its receptor. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanism of miRNA regulation of the Bursicon receptor at the post-transcriptional level would be highly innovation. In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis, qRT-PCR, and western blot to identify two Bursicon subunits (<italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>) and their association with low temperature of 10 °C. We then employed RNAi, cuticle staining, and transmission electron microscopy to study the effects of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> on cuticle content, cuticle thickness, and the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Furthermore, we identified <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> as the Bursicon receptor and investigated its role in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, through in vivo and in vitro assays, we discovered that miR-6012 targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and is involved in the seasonal polyphenism. These efforts not only shed light on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, but also enhance our understanding of the neuroendocrine basis of insect seasonal polyphenism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Investigation of the relationship between nymph phenotype, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness during the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title><p>In <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, exposure to a low temperature of 10 °C triggers the activation of the temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, leading to the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle tanning and cuticle thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). To elucidate the association between these parameters and the cuticle tanning threshold, we investigated nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance levels, and cuticle thickness in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> over varying time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under either 10 °C or 25 °C temperature conditions. Nymphs exhibited a light yellow and transparent hue at 3, 6, and 9 days, while those at 12 and 15 days displayed shades of yellow-green or blue-yellow under 25 °C conditions. Conversely, under 10 °C conditions, nymphs darkened at the abdomen’s end at 3, 6, and 9 days, developed numerous light black stripes on their thorax and abdomen at 12 days, and presented an overall black-brown appearance with dark brown stripes on the left and right sides of each thorax and abdominal section at 15 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, the dorsal and ventral sides of the abdomen exhibited a pronounced black-brown coloration at 10 °C. The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at a wavelength of 300 nm significantly increased following 10 °C exposure for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25 °C treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, cuticle thicknesses exhibited an increase following 10 °C exposure for 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25 °C treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular identification of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title><p>Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> (GenBank: OR488624) is 480 bp long, encoding a predicted polypeptide of 159 amino acids.

Seasonal polyphenism can provide overwintering species with better adaptability to extreme climates through beneficial shifts in morphology, physiology, or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>).

Having a good model is extremely important for answering specific scientific questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhardwaj et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, cuticle pigment absorbance and cuticle thickness, both have an increasing trend over time under 10 °C conditions, and showed very high correlation with the nymph phenotype of cuticle tanning during the transition from summer-form to winter-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To clarify the role of neuropeptide Bursicon in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we identified two Bursicon subunits, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, in this study. The SDS-PAGE results of non-reduced and reduced gels showed that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> can form both homodimers (α+α or β+β) and a heterodimer (α+β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). During the transition of the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> between two forms, this study focused on the overall phenotypic changes. Therefore, for qPCR experiments, whole <italic>C. chinensis</italic> samples were selected for analysis. Temporal expression patterns showed that <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> have very similar gradually increasing expression trends and higher expression in winter-form than summer-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>), indicating that Bursicon may play a significant role in winter-form. This result is consistent with the report on gypsy moths, where transcript levels of <italic>Ldbursicon</italic> in adult stages were higher than in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). The transcript levels of both subunits were higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compared to summer-form, implying a potential role of Bursicon in seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luan et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>As the transition of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> from summer-form to winter-form is regulated by a low temperature of 10 °C and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, we next determined the effect of 10 °C treatment and <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi on the expression of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>. As expected, 10 °C treatment significantly increased the expression of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, while <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi markedly decreased their mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). This is the first report on the relationship between the neuropeptide Bursicon and low temperature. Further results from RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>,<italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, or both showed that Bursicon prominently regulates the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–I</xref>). Moreover, the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). It is notable that during the process of cuticle staining, the chitin located in the midgut and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> may exhibit green fluorescence, leading to the appearance of a thin chitin layer.In many insects, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>T. castaneum</italic>, Bursicon is believed to be the main hormone responsible for cuticle tanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai and Palli, 2010</xref>). However, the knockdown of Bursicon subunits did not cause visible defects in cuticle sclerotisation or pigmentation of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>Lymantria dispar</italic> adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). The insect cuticle typically comprises three distinct layers (endocuticle, exocuticle, and epicuticle), with the thickness of each layer varying among different insect species. Cuticle differentiation is closely linked to the molting cycle of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mrak et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, nymphal cuticles exhibited normal differentiation patterns, characterized by a thin epicuticle and comparable widths of the endocuticle and exocuticle following dsEGFP treatment, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>. Conversely, nymphs treated with dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, and dsCcburs-R displayed impaired development, manifesting only the exocuticle without a discernible endocuticle layer. These findings suggest that bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). These researches indicate that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. Although the reactions involved in cuticle tanning are well-known, further studies are needed to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p><p>To further elucidate the role of the Bursicon signal in seasonal polyphenism, we identified the Bursicon receptor of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> were very similar to those of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, and it also had higher expression in winter-form than summer-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). By comparing its expression profiles with those in other insects, we can conclude that the spatio-temporal expression of the Bursicon receptor is related to the specificity of insect species. The activation of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by the burs α-β heterodimer exhibited a robust dose-dependent pattern. Conversely, no activation was observed when <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> was transfected with an empty vector or exposed to burs α-α and burs β-β homodimers or AKH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, Bursicon comprises two cystine knot polypeptides, pburs and burs, which are known to stimulate a G protein-coupled receptor, <italic>DLGR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). Through a radioligand receptor assay, specific and high-affinity interactions between <italic>C. chinensis</italic> burs α-β heterodimer and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> were successfully confirmed. A recent study indicated that silencing of <italic>Burs-α</italic>,<italic>Burs-β</italic>,or its receptor significantly affected the reproduction of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai and Palli, 2010</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic>,<italic>CcBurs-β</italic>, or both obviously decreased the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, while feeding the heterodimer protein of α+β fully rescued <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression after knockdown of <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> together, which further confirmed the relationship between subunits and the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). 10 °C treatment clearly improved the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, but <italic>CcTRPM</italic> RNAi sharply reduced its mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Notably, the elimination of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> obviously affected cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness, leading to the failure of the transition from summer-form to winter-form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–H</xref>). Feeding the α+β heterodimer protein fully rescued the defect in the transition percent and morphological phenotype after <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). Following the administration of dsCcBur-R to <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> exhibited a reduction of approximately 66–82% as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, rather than complete suppression. Activation of endogenous <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> through feeding of the α+β heterodimer protein results in an increase in <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression, with the effectiveness of the rescue effect contingent upon the dosage of the α+β heterodimer protein. Consequently, the capacity of the α+β heterodimer protein to effectively mitigate the impacts of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown on the conversion rate is clearly demonstrated. Therefore, these findings strongly support our hypothesis that Bursicon and its receptor are essential for the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Actually, seasonal polyphenism is a complex process that may be regulated by multiple cascade reactions. Further studies are needed to clarify the regulatory mechanism of Bursicon and its receptor in mediating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p><p>In animals, miRNAs are essential for tissue development and behavioral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lucas and Raikhel, 2013</xref>). Previous studies have reported that many miRNAs function upstream of the neurohormone signaling pathway in insect polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Suderman et al., 2006</xref>). For example, miR-133 controls behavioral aggregation by targeting the dopamine synthesis gene in Locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and miR-9b targets insulin receptors to mediate dimorphism and wing development in aphids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we identified miR-6012 as a regulator of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in the Bursicon hormone signaling pathway for the first time. We found that miR-6012 was inhibited by a low temperature of 10 °C and targeted <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> by binding to its 3’UTR. When nymphs were treated with agomir-6012, they exhibited lower cuticle pigment content, reduced cuticle chitin content, and thinner cuticle thickness compared to the agomir-NC control under 10 °C condition. In addition, agomir-6012 treatment markedly decreased the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form and affected the morphological phenotype compared to the control. The significant decreased in <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic> expression after agomir-6012 treatment suggested that miR-6012 also functions as the upstream regulator of chitin biosynthesis signaling.</p><p>In conclusion, our study uncovered a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, in addition to their known functions in cuticle-hardening of nymphs and wing expansion of adults. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we proposed a molecular working model to describe this novel mechanism. Under 10 °C conditions, the Bursicon signaling pathway is first activated in the head of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by low temperature and <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. Then, <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> form a heterodimeric neuropeptide that acts on its receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, miR-6012 targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> to modulate the function of the Bursicon signaling pathway in this seasonal polyphenism. As a result, the first instar nymphs of summer-form develop into third instar nymphs of winter-form to better adapt to low-temperature adversity. Future research will focus on: (1) studying the combined effect of Bursicon with other neuro-hormones on the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, (2) identifying the down-stream signaling of Bursicon in mediating this phenomenon through multi-omics and RNAi approaches.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of the novel functions of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>chinensis</italic> in response to low temperature.</title><p>Under 10 °C conditions, low temperature significantly upregulated the expression of the Bursicon signaling pathway. <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic> then formed a heterodimeric neuropeptide to activate their receptor <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, which mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> by acting on the chitin biosynthesis pathway.

The cuticle tissues were then ground and placed in a thermostatic oscillator at 200 rpm for 24 hr under 25 °C conditions. The total pigment extraction was obtained after filtering and centrifuging the supernatants through a 0.45 μm filter membrane.

The samples were then dehydrated in a standard ethanol/acetone series, infiltrated, and embedded in a spurr medium. Subsequently, super thin sections (–70 nm) of the thorax were cut and stained with 5% uranyl acetate followed by Reynolds’ lead citrate solution. The same dorsal region of the thorax was specifically chosen for subsequent fluorescence imaging or transmission electron microscopy assessments aimed at quantifying cuticle thickness. Lastly, the sections were observed, photographed, and measured using an HT7800 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 120 kv. Regarding the measurement of cuticle thickness, use the built-in measuring ruler on the software to select the top and bottom of the same horizontal line on the cuticle.

Therefore, it still falls short of the claims made, since the claims were not revised either. Specifically, the authors now include a time series of tanning at two different temperatures, demonstrating the time points at which the induced tanning proceeds (Fig. S1). However, the appropriate response to that comment would have temperatures on the x-axis, not time. Intermediate temperatures are needed to test whether the induction is a threshold response or simply a continuous norm of reaction.</p><p>(2) The authors also did not respond to the major comment regarding environmental induction of miR-6012 expression. Rather, Fig. 5E shows a time series under two temperatures, similar to the tanning time series. To test whether its induction is a threshold response (again, what defines polyphenism), a series of induction conditions is needed. Fig. 5E simply shows changes in expression over time under one induction temperature (25 ºC).</p><p>(3) Although the manuscript title has been changed, little to nothing else in the revised text addresses the concern that this study is about tanning in psyllids, not seasonal polyphenism. The other traits making up the polyphenism, as well as their threshold response, were not measured.</p><p>In summary, this revision failed to address most of the chief concerns of the review summary. This manuscript should be reframed as a study of tanning in a species other than <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and any claims about polyphenism (that is, an environmentally induced threshold trait) still need to be tested.</p><p>Regarding the other concerns raised by the reviewers:</p><p>(4) Issues related to the assignment of the receptor used as a bursicon receptor were satisfactorily addressed.</p><p>(5) Experiments regarding the timing of cuticle production presented in Supplementary Figure 1 are valuable, albeit, there are still some inaccuracies: (i) the layering of the cuticle is not given accurately as there are more than the 3 layers indicated in the manuscript; (ii), the reduced endocuticle in all relevant dsRNA cases suggests a massive molting defect that may underline the involvement of bursicon in molting in general, potentially masking its effect on morph transition. In other words, the phenotype is too strong to allow for the interpretation of its function with respect to morph transition. It would have been necessary to apply different concentrations of dsRNA in order to address this point. (iii) The developmental timing at 10oC vs. 25oC seem to be similar, although duration would be expected to be longer at 10oC; (iv) It would have been nice to see the days of development also for dsRNA injected animals.</p><p>(6) Another unresolved point regards the source and target tissue of bursicon signaling. Admittedly, this problem is difficult to solve in a small insect species.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97298.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhixian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yilin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaoxia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Songdou</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>China Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Review:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Bursicon is a key hormone regulating cuticle tanning in insects. While the molecular mechanisms of its function are rather well studied--especially in the model insect <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, its effects and functions in different tissues are less well understood. Here, the authors show that bursicon and its receptor play a role in regulating aspects of the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic>. They found that low temperature treatment activated the bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from summer form to winter form and affect cuticle pigment and chitin content, and cuticle thickness.

This discovery expands our knowledge of the roles of neuropeptide bursicon action in arthropod biology.</p><p>However, the study falls short of its claim that it reveals the molecular mechanisms of a seasonal polyphenism. While cuticle tanning is an important part of the pear psyllid polyphenism, it is not the equivalent of it. First, there are other traits that distinguish between the two morphs, such as ovarian diapause (Oldfield, 1970), and the role of bursicon signaling in regulating these aspects of polyphenism were not measured. Thus, the phenotype in pear psyllids, whereby knockdown bursicon reduces cuticle tanning seems to simply demonstrate the phenotypes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants for bursicon receptor (Loveall and Deitcher, 2010, BMC Dev Biol) in another species (Fig. 2I, 4H). Second, the study fails to address the threshold nature of cuticular tanning in this species, although it is the threshold response (specifically, to temperature and photoperiod) that distinguishes this trait as a part of a polyphenism. Whereas miR-6012 was found to regulate bursicon expression, there no evidence is provided that this microRNA either responds to or initiates a threshold response to temperature. In principle, miR-6012 could regulate bursicon whether or not it is part of a polyphenism. Thus, the impact of this work would be significantly increased if it could distinguish between seasonal changes of the cuticle and a bona fide reflection of polyphenism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable suggestion. We concur with the review’s comment that cuticle tanning does not equate to the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> polyphenism. To better reflect the core focus of our research, we have revised the title to &quot;Neuropeptide Bursicon and its receptor mediated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic>&quot;.</p><p>In response to the reviewer's inquiry regarding the threshold nature of cuticular tanning in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, we have included a detailed analysis of the phenotypic changes (including nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness) during the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> at distinct time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperature conditions (10°C and 25°C). As shown in Figure S1, nymphs exhibit a light yellow and transparent coloration at 3, 6, and 9 days, while nymphs at 12 and 15 days display shades of yellow-green or blue-yellow under 25°C conditions. At 10°C conditions, the abdomen end turns black at 3, 6, and 9 days. By the 12 days, numerous light black stripes appear on the chest and abdomen of nymphs at 10°C. At 15 days, nymphs exhibit an overall black-brown appearance, featuring dark brown stripes on the left and right sides of each chest and abdominal section. Furthermore, the end of the abdomen and back display a large black-brown coloration at 10°C (Figure S1A). The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at a 300 nm wavelength markedly increases following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1B). Cuticle thicknesses also increased following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1C). The detailed results (L122-143), materials and methods (L647-652), and discussion (L319-322) have been added in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the response of miR-6012 to temperature, we have already determined its expression at 3, 6, 10 days under different temperatures in the previous Figure 5E. We now included additional time intervals (9, 12, 15 days) in the updated Figure 5E. Our results indicate a significant decrease in the expression levels of miR-6012 after 10°C treatment for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group. Detailed information regarding this has been integrated into the Materials and Methods (Line 608-610) of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study convincingly identifies homologs of the genes encoding the bursicon subunits and its receptor, showing an alignment with those of another psyllid as well as more distant species. It also demonstrates that the stage- and tissue-specific levels of bursicon follow the expected patterns, as informed by other insect models, thus validating the identity of these genes in this species. They provide strong evidence that the expression of bursicon and its receptor depend on temperature, thereby showing that this trait is regulated through both parts of the signaling mechanism.</p><p>Several parallel measurements of the phenotype were performed to show the effects of this hormone, its receptor, and an upstream regulator (miR-6012), on cuticle deposition and pigmentation (if not polyphenism per se, as claimed). Specifically, chitin staining and TEM of the cuticle qualitatively show difference between controls and knockdowns, and this is supported by some statistical tests of quantitative measurements (although see comments below). Thus, this study provides strong evidence that bursicon and its receptor play an important role in cuticle deposition and pigmentation in this psyllid.</p><p>The study identified four miRNAs which might affect bursicon due to sequence motifs. By manipulating levels of synthetic miRNA agonists, the study successfully identified one of them (miR-6012) to cause a cuticle phenotype. Moreover, this miRNA was localized (by FISH) to the cuticle, body-wide. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstrated function for this miRNA, and this study provides a good example of using a gene of known function as an entry point to discovering others influencing a trait. Thus, this finding reveals another level of regulation of cuticle formation in insects.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The introduction to this manuscript does not accurately reflect progress in the field of mechanisms underlying polyphenism (e.g., line 60). There are several models for polyphenism that have been used to uncover molecular mechanisms in at least some detail, and this includes seasonal polyphenisms in Hemiptera. Therefore, the justification for this study cannot be predicated on a lack of knowledge, nor is the present study original or unique in this line of research (e.g., as reviewed by Zhang et al. 2019; DOI: 10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-112448). The authors are apparently aware of this, because they even provide other examples (lines 104-108); thus the introduction seems misleading as framed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your excellent suggestion. We have added the paper of Zhang et al. 2019 which recommended by reviewer (DOI: 10.1146/annurev-ento-011118-112448) in Line 57 of our revised manuscript. The statement has been revised to “However, the specific molecular mechanism underling temperature-dependent polyphenism still require further clarification” in Line 60-61 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The data in Figure 2H show &quot;percent of transition.&quot; However, the images in 2I show insects with tanned cuticle (control) vs. those without (knockdown). Yet, based on the description of the Methods provided, there appears to be no distinction between &quot;percent of transition&quot; and &quot;percent with tanning defects&quot;. This an important distinction to make if the authors are going to interpret cuticle defects as a defect in the polyphenism. Furthermore, there is no mention of intermediate phenotypes. The data in 2H are binned as either present or absent, and these are the phenotypes shown in 2I. Was the phenotype really an all-or-nothing response? Instead of binning, which masks any quantitative differences in the tanning phenotypes, the authors should objectively quantify the degree of tanning and plot that. This would show if and to what degree intermediate tanning phenotypes occurred, which would test how bursicon affects the threshold response. This comment also applies to the data in Figures 4G and 6G. Since cuticle tanning is present in more insect than just those with seasonal polyphenism, showing how this responds as a threshold is needed to make claims about polyphenism.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your insightful comments. As shown in Figure 1 of our published paper (Zhang et al., 2013; doi.org/10.7554/eLife.88744.3) and Figure 2C-2I of the current manuscript, the transition from summer-form to winter-form entails not only external cuticular tanning but also alterations in internal cuticular chitin levels and cuticle thickness. While external cuticular tanning serves as a prominent and easily observable indicator of this transition, it is crucial to acknowledge that internal changes also play a significant role and should be taken into consideration. Therefore, we propose that the term &quot;percent of transition&quot; may be more suitable than &quot;percent with tanning defects&quot; to describe this process accurately.</p><p>In order to provide a more visually comprehensive understanding of the phenotypic changes during the transition from summer-form to winter-form, we have included images at different time points (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperature conditions in Figure S1A of our revised manuscript. Specifically, under the 10°C condition, nymphs exhibit abdomen tanning after 6 and 9 days of treatment, while the thorax remains untanned. By days 12 to 15, both the abdomen and thorax of the nymphs show tanning, resulting in the majority of summer-form nymphs transitioning into winter-form, as depicted in Figure 2I for comparison. This observation indicates the presence of a critical threshold for cuticle tanning of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> following exposure to 10°C. Nymphs that did not undergo the transition to winter-form succumbed to the cold, highlighting the absence of intermediate phenotypes at 12-15 days under the 10°C condition. The UV absorbance of the total pigment extraction at a 300 nm wavelength markedly increases following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1B). Additionally, cuticle thickness shows an increase following 10°C exposure for 6, 9, 12, and 15 days compared to the 25°C treatment group (Figure S1C). These results highlight the relationship between the threshold of cuticular tanning and the transition process. The detailed description and information have been added in Results (L122-143), Materials and Methods (L647-652), and Discussion (L319-322) of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) This study also does not test the threshold response of cuticle phenotypes to levels of bursicon, its receptor, or miR-6012. Hormone thresholds are the most widespread and, in most systems where polyphenism has been studied, the defining characteristic of a polyphenism (e.g., Nijhout, 2003, Evol Dev). Quantitative (not binned) measurements of a polyphenism marker (e.g., chitin) should be demonstrated to result as a threshold titer (or in the case of the receptor, expression level) to distinguish defects in polyphenism from those of its component trait.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your valuable feedback. We have supplemented additional data on the phenotypes (Figure S1A), cuticle pigment absorbance (Figure S1B), cuticle thickness (Figure S1C), expression levels of bursicon (Figure 1E and 1F), its receptors (Figure 3G), and miR-6012 (Figure 5E) corresponding to nymphs treated over different time periods (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under both 10°C and 25°C conditions in our revised manuscript.</p><p>While all these identified markers exhibit a strong correlation with the transition from summer-form to winter-form, it is important to note that they are not suitable as definitive thresholds due to the nature of relative gene expression quantification and chitin content assessment, rather than absolute quantitation. Further, given that tanning hormones are neuropeptides present in trace amounts in insects, unlike steroid hormones, determining their titers poses a considerable challenge.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Cuticle issue:</p><p>(a) Unlike Fig. 6D and F, Figs. 2D and F do not correspond to each other. Especially the lack and reduction of chitin in ds-a+b! By fluorescence microscopy there is hardly any signal, whereas by TEM there is a decent cuticle. Additionally, the dsGFP control cuticle in 2D is cut obliquely with a thick and a thin chitin layer. This is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful feedback. We have replaced the previous WGA chitin staining images in the dsCcbursα+β treatment of Figure 2D with new representative images aligning with Figure 2F. Furthermore, the presence of both thin and thick chitin layers observed in the dsEGFP treatment of Figure 2D could potentially be ascribed to the chitin content in the insect midgut or fat body as previously discussed (Zhu et al., 2016). It is notable that during the process of cuticle staining, the chitin located in the midgut and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> may exhibit green fluorescence, leading to the appearance of a thin chitin layer. A detailed analysis and elucidation of these observations have been added in the discussion section (Lines 347-352) of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Zhu KY, Merzendorfer H, Zhang W, Zhang J, Muthukrishnan S.

As tanning is also occurring post-molting, there seems to be a general problem with cuticle differentiation at this time point. This may be a timing issue. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The insect cuticle typically comprises three distinct layers (endocuticle, exocuticle, and epicuticle), with the thickness of each layer varying among different insect species. Cuticle differentiation is closely linked to the molting cycle of insects (Mrak et al., 2017). In our study, nymphal cuticles exhibited normal differentiation patterns, characterized by a thin epicuticle and comparable widths of the endocuticle and exocuticle following dsEGFP treatment, as illustrated in Figure 2F and 4F. Conversely, nymphs treated with dsCcBurs-α, dsCcBurs-β, and dsCcburs-R displayed impaired development, manifesting only the exocuticle without a discernible endocuticle layer. These findings suggest that bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development (Costa et al., 2016). We have added some discussion about these results in Lines 356-367 of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Mrak, P., Bogataj, U., Štrus, J., &amp; Žnidaršič, N. (2017).

To provide more background information about cuticle formation, we supplied the results of nymph phenotypes, cuticle pigment absorbance, and cuticle thickness at distinct time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperatures of 10°C and 25°C in Figure S1 of our revised manuscript. Hope these results can help better understand the baseline data on these two morphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) For the TEM study, it is not clear whether the same part of the insect's thorax is being sectioned each time, or if that matters. There is not an obvious difference in the number of cuticular layers, but only the relative widths of those layers, so it is difficult to know how comparable those images are. This raises two questions that the authors should clarify. First, is it possible that certain parts of the thoracic cuticle, such as those closer to the intersegmental membrane, are naturally thinner than other parts of the body? Second, is the tanning phenotype based on the thickness or on the number of chitin layers, or both? The data shown later in Figure 4I, J convincingly shows that the biosynthesis pathway for chitin is repressed, but any clarification of what this might mean for deposition of chitin would help to understand the phenotypes reported. Also, more details on how the data in Fig. 2G were collected would be helpful. This also goes for the data in Fig. 4 (bursicon receptor knockdowns).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great comment. The TEM investigation adhered to a standardized protocol was used as previous description (Zhang et al., 2023), Initially, insect heads were uniformly excised and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, a consistent cutting and staining procedure was executed at a uniform distance above the insect's thorax. The dorsal region of the thorax was specifically chosen for subsequent fluorescence imaging or transmission electron microscopy assessments with the specific objective of quantifying cuticle thickness. Regarding the measurement of cuticle thickness, use the built-in measuring ruler on the software to select the top and bottom of the same horizontal line on the cuticle. Measure the cuticle of each nymph at two close locations. Six nymphs were used for each sample. Randomly select 9 values and plot them.

This result seems contradictory. If <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> is the receptor of bursicon, the heterodimer protein of CcBurs α+β should not be able to rescue the effect of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown insects. How can a neuropeptide protein rescue the effect when its receptor is not there! If these results are valid, then the <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> would not be the (sole) receptor for CcBurs α+β heterodimer. This is a critical issue for this manuscript and needs to be addressed (also in L337 in Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful suggestion. Following the administration of dsCcBur-R to <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, the expression of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> exhibited a reduction of approximately 66-82% as depicted in Figure 4A, rather than complete suppression. Activation of endogenous <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> through feeding of the α+β heterodimer protein results in an increase in <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> expression, with the effectiveness of the rescue effect contingent upon the dosage of the α+β heterodimer protein. Consequently, the capacity of the α+β heterodimer protein to effectively mitigate the impacts of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> knockdown on the conversion rate is clearly demonstrated.

In order to enhance the resolution of the magnified images, we conducted FISH co-localization of miR-6012 and <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> in 3rd instar nymphs and obtained detailed zoomed-in images.

During the FISH assays, epidermis transparency of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> was achieved via decolorization treatment. Noteworthy observations from Figure 3G and Figure 5E reveal an inverse correlation in the expression profiles of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and miR-6012. Consequently, the FISH results distinctly highlight a significant disparity in the expression levels of <italic>CcBurs-R</italic> and miR-6012 within the same tissue. We have added related explanation and discussion in Line 291-293 of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The schematic in Fig. 7 is a useful summary, but there is a part of the logic that is unsupported by the data, specifically in terms of environmental influence on cuticle formation (i.e., plasticity). What is the evidence that lower temperatures influence expression of miR-6012? The study measures its expression over life stages, whether with an agonist or not, over a single temperature. Measuring levels of expression under summer form-inducing temperature is necessary to test the dependence of miR-6012 expression on temperature. Otherwise, this result cannot be interpreted as polyphenism control, but rather the control of a specific trait.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your great suggestion. We actually conducted the assessment of miR-6012 expression at specific time intervals (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) under different temperatures of 10°C and 25°C. As depicted in Figure 5E, the expression levels of miR-6012 were notably reduced at 10°C compared to 25°C. Additionally, the evaluation of agomir-6012 expression level of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> under 25°C conditions at various time points (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 days) revealed no significant changes. Hence, we suggest that the impact of miR-6012 on the seasonal morphological transition is influenced upon temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The authors report a novel role of Bursicon and its receptor in regulating the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic>. They found that low temperature treatment (10°C) activated the Bursicon signaling pathway during the transition from summer-form to winter-form, which influences cuticle pigment content, cuticle chitin content, and cuticle thickness. Moreover, the authors identified miR-6012 and show that it targets <italic>CcBurs-R</italic>, thereby modulating the function of Bursicon signaling pathway in the seasonal polyphenism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. This discovery expands our knowledge of multiple roles of neuropeptide bursicon action in arthropod biology. However, the m</p><p>anuscript does have several major weaknesses, described under &quot;Public review&quot;, which the authors need to address.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>(1) L152-154 Fig S2E and S2F: Bursicon has been shown to be expressed in the CNS in a specific set of neurons. For example, In the larval CNS of <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, bursicon expression is restricted to the subesophageal ganglion (SG), thoracic ganglia, and first abdominal ganglion. Pharate pupae and pharate adults show expression of this heterodimer in all ganglia. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, expression of a bursicon heterodimer is confined to abdominal ganglia. The additional neurons in the ventral nerve cord express only burs. In pharate adults, bursicon is produced by neurons in the SG and abdominal ganglia. I am wondering where bursicon subunits are expressed in the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> CNS? Since the authors have the antibodies, it would be useful to include immunocytochemical staining of bursicon alpha and beta in the CNS. The qPCR results from head or other tissues (Fig S2E and S2F) is not the most informative way to document localization of gene expression. Regarding the qPCR results, they show that the cuticle and the fat body express <italic>CcBurs-α</italic> and <italic>CcBurs-β</italic>. Can the authors confirm this unexpected results independently?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your insightful comment. In this study, we did not directly used antibodies targeting bursicon subunits, instead, the bursicon subunits along with a histidine tag were integrated into the expression vector pcDNA3.1 using homologous recombination. The experimental procedures were executed as follows: initially, the histidine tag was fused to the pcDNA3.1-mCherry vector through homologous recombination to generate the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-his-mCherry. Subsequently, the amino acid sequences of the two bursicon subunits were introduced into the pcDNA3.1-his-mCherry vector via homologous recombination to produce the recombinant plasmids pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-α-his-mCherry and pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-β-his-mCherry. Finally, the P2A sequence was incorporated into the vector using reverse PCR to yield the recombinant plasmids pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-α-his-P2A-mCherry and pcDNA3.1-CcBurs-β-his-P2A-mCherry. Consequently, the bursicon subunits, along with the histidine tag, were capable of generating fusion proteins with the histidine tag. Western blot analysis was conducted using antibodies targeting the histidine tag, enabling the detection of histidine expression, which corresponds to the expression of the bursicon subunits. However, they are not suitable to conduct the in vivo immunocytochemical staining of bursicon alpha and beta in the CNS.</p><p>Due to the diminutive size of the <italic>C. chinensis</italic> nymphs, dissection of the central nervous system (CNS) was unfeasible, precluding specific assessment of bursicon expression in the CNS. Prior literature has documented the expression of bursicon subunits in the epidermis and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Studies suggest that bursicon subunits not only play a role in the melanization and sclerotization processes of insect epidermis but also have significant roles in insect immunity (An et al., 2012). The presence of bursicon subunits in the epidermis, gut, and fat body of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> may indicate their crucial roles in the immune functions of these tissues.
