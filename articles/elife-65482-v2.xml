transcriptomic characterization of individual neurons. To generate Patch-seq datasets at scale, we identified and refined key factors that contribute to the efficient collection of high-quality data. We developed patch-clamp electrophysiology software with analysis functions specifically designed to automate acquisition with online quality control. We recognized the importance of extracting the nucleus for transcriptomic success and maximizing membrane integrity during nucleus extraction for morphology success. The protocol is generalizable to different species and brain regions, as demonstrated by capturing multimodal data from human and macaque brain slices. The protocol, analysis and acquisition software are compiled at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools">https://githubcom/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools</ext-link>.

Neurons exhibit stereotyped yet diverse electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>) and understanding how each of these distinct features relate to one another may provide us with mechanistic insight into the roles of these neuron types. The introduction of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the field of transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). Dissociated cells or nuclei are isolated in a high-throughput manner to provide a comprehensive analysis of the molecular underpinnings of a single cell. Systematic and large-scale scRNA-seq approaches have been successful at characterizing brain cell types across mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashikawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mickelsen et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>). These large-scale studies often include data from tens of thousands to millions of neurons, whereas electrophysiological or morphological studies are limited to tens or hundreds of neurons. Despite scRNA-seq providing an in-depth look into gene expression and cell type classification, relationships to the morpho-electric neuron types described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>) can only be inferred. Studies with triple modality data are rare and lack the scale to capture the true biological variability.</p><p>The Patch-seq recording technique is a powerful approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuzik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van den Hurk et al., 2018</xref>) that can provide morphology (M), electrophysiology (E), and transcriptome (T) data from single neuron, that is triple modality MET data. These data are an important tool toward establishing ‘correspondence’ of these properties through analysis. This technique is a modification of the well-established slice patch-clamp electrophysiology approach, where intrinsic properties are recorded from neurons in acute brain slices while simultaneously filling the neuron with biocytin. Following fixation, the biocytin is reacted with DAB as chromogen to generate a dark precipitate that fills the neuron, enabling imaging and a digital morphological reconstruction. In the Patch-seq technique, the neuron’s cytoplasm is collected at the end of the recording, then processed via RNA-seq to identify its gene expression patterns. The technique has been used successfully to characterize both cortical and subcortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scala et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hashikawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muñoz-Manchado et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite its promise, early Patch-seq data suffered from three primary issues: (1) inconsistent quality, with non-specific cellular contamination and low yield of genes critical to accurate mapping to transcriptomic types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripathy et al., 2018</xref>), (2) little to no recovery of neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadwell et al., 2015</xref>), and (3) low throughput, with adequate cell fills requiring up to an hour of recording per cell. To address these issues, we refined the Patch-seq technique to increase the efficiency of each step to minimize data attrition and increase the throughput to facilitate a more comprehensive analysis of cell type characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2020</xref>). In a large-scale manner, we systematically modified the existing Patch-seq protocols, using feedback from experimental metadata to reveal the key determinants of success, including nucleus extraction and slow withdrawal of the recording electrode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipovsek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuzik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadwell et al., 2017</xref>). Using a customizable electrophysiology acquisition package, we created specialized adaptive stimulus sets and online quality control to reduce experiment duration and increase throughput. Together with these adaptations, we demonstrate how high-quality triple modality information may be gathered across diverse neuronal types, different species and at scale.</p><p>Adopting the Patch-seq technique in an existing or new laboratory can be daunting due to the complexity of multiple data streams. To make adoption as simple as possible, we have created a resource, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools">https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:5d2841393a75abbe8e723564c53f94b8d47ce412;origin=https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools;visit=swh:1:snp:57a65d339120bda54ca2a816e55a0b3fc1234172;anchor=swh:1:rev:d1afcd4d5203564979a29f2891e03cba7733b726">swh:1:rev:d1afcd4d5203564979a29f2891e03cba7733b726</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2021</xref>), as a starting point for labs interested in using the Patch-seq technique or refining their existing technique. Specifically, this resource consists of three components: (1) a step-by-step optimized Patch-seq protocol, including helpful tips and a troubleshooting guide; (2) the Multichannel Igor Electrophysiology Suite (MIES) software package, including built-in analysis functions to increase the efficiency and robustness of Patch-seq data; and (3) an R library that uses a modified workflow from the patchSeqQC R library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripathy et al., 2018</xref>) to process and assay the quality of Patch-seq transcriptomic data. Here, we highlight the components of this resource and detail the background behind critical protocol decisions. The resource balances detailed internal standards with flexibility to adjust to a specific user’s experimental approach. In the end, data generated using this resource can be benchmarked against the data from the over 7000 publicly available Patch-seq neuron experiments that can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://celltypes.brain-map.org/">https://celltypes.brain-map.org/</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A Patch-seq protocol optimized for fast, high-quality data generation</title><p>We used broad and specific transgenic Cre driver mouse lines to target over 8000 excitatory and inhibitory neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex (VISp). Of these neurons, 4309 were previously included in a study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>) to characterize the morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties of interneurons from the mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The expanded dataset used for the analysis presented here includes cells that did not pass the stringent quality control (QC) metrics required to be part of that previous study. This is intentional, as it allows us to evaluate and demonstrate the utility of these QC metrics, and their predictors, as well as protocol modifications that can maximize success. In addition, the current study includes excitatory neurons to demonstrate the generalizability of the metrics and protocol to different neocortical cell types.</p><p>To compare neurons within similar neuron types, we focused on four established Cre lines: <italic>retinol binding protein 4</italic> (Rbp4)-Cre for glutamatergic (excitatory) neurons and <italic>parvalbumin</italic> (Pvalb)-Cre, <italic>somatostatin</italic> (Sst)-Cre, and <italic>vasoactive intestinal peptide</italic> (Vip)-Cre for GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons.

Although we provide internal thresholds for each metric, they each exist along a continuum and could be differentially applied depending on the circumstances of each individual user. Given these criteria, the established protocol described here has a pass rate of 97%, 93%, and 46% for electrophysiology, transcriptomics, and morphology, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), with a final rate of successful triple modality, MET, data collection of 39%. With morphological recovery having the highest rate of attrition, Patch-seq neurons that fail at this point but pass electrophysiology and transcriptomics (91% in total) can still be used for spatial/anatomical, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic characterization and classification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Patch-seq is a powerful technique that allows for the characterization of a neuron based on electrophysiology (<bold>E</bold>), transcriptomics (<bold>T</bold>), and morphology (<bold>M</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A neuron is patched to characterize the intrinsic properties of a neuron while biocytin and Alexa dye diffuses throughout the soma, dendrites, and axon.

As the nucleus is pulled further from the soma, the cell membrane stretches around the nucleus and ultimately breaks, forming distinct seals around the nucleus (a ‘nucleated’ patch) and the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sather et al., 1992</xref>). During this phase, constant monitoring of the membrane seal resistance is critical; the seal formation is observed electrically as a rapid rise in resistance, ideally above 1 GΩ, and referred to as end pipette resistance (endR). It is important that this stage is performed slowly and methodically; achieving the seal can take several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref> are time series of images and the corresponding test pulse resistance which illustrate the slow pipette retraction with an attached nucleus.

A combination of ramp and square step current injection stimulus profiles is effective at revealing discrete electrophysiological neuron types, as well as the continuum of properties between related types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). The small differences in properties between types underscores the need for (1) a large dataset to separate related groups and (2) consistent high-quality data. We used the data from this study, now found here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://celltypes.brain-map.org">https://celltypes.brain-map.org</ext-link>, as a foundation to modify the custom data acquisition system to accommodate online analysis to increase the speed of data acquisition and data quality.</p><p>To facilitate flexible patch-clamp data acquisition, we used MIES, a data acquisition package built on top of the Igor Pro software platform. Originally designed to facilitate multichannel synaptic physiology experiments, which require easy multitasking to be performed at scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>), MIES can also be used to acquire intrinsic properties from single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). We further adapted the MIES software package using custom 'analysis functions' designed to rapidly, automatically acquire valid electrophysiology data sweeps required for cell type classification. We asked two fundamental questions about each sweep: (1) was the baseline prior to stimulus application stable - within and across experiments? and (2) did the cell’s membrane potential return to ’baseline’ following stimulus application? Only sweeps where both of the above conditions were true were considered for data analysis. Although we can manually exclude data during acquisition when issues arise, we find that most problems can be identified using these two criteria.</p><p>To avoid acquiring a sweep with an unstable baseline, we verified that the resting membrane potential (RMP) in a 500 ms pre-stimulus window at the beginning of the experiment was within 1 mV of the target membrane potential. To further determine the stability of the RMP, we used a threshold for the root mean square (RMS) noise of the RMP during the 500 ms baseline evaluation period. If the sweep failed either measure, it was terminated, the bias current was automatically adjusted if necessary, and the sweep was initiated again. If the number of passing sweeps required to pass the stimulus set, plus the number of failed sweeps exceeded the total number of sweeps in the stimulus set, acquisition was terminated, the stimulus set failed and the user was prompted to rerun or abort the experiment. The stimulus set could only proceed as designed once the baseline evaluation passed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Online analysis during electrophysiology recording allows for fast, high-quality data generation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Baseline Evaluation failed.

The time period for this ‘recovery’ can vary between cell types and can depend on the intensity of the stimulus so a ‘one size fits all’ approach, designed to accommodate the longest possible recovery time, is inefficient. To compensate, we designed a recovery period analysis function that would extend to 10 s but shortened once the target RMP was reached. We enforced an absolute 500 ms minimal recovery period immediately after the end of the stimulus, followed by a continuous RMP assay in 500 ms evaluation periods. Once an evaluation period with a recovered baseline was detected, the sweep was completed and considered ‘Passed’, ultimately completing this sweep in the minimal amount of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). If none of the evaluation periods passed before the end of the sweep at 10 s, the sweep failed quality control (QC) and was repeated, or the user was prompted. In most instances, a stimulus set ran without triggering the repeat of a sweep (64% of Ramp, 51% of Subthreshold Long Square, 70% of Suprathreshold Long Square, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, a substantial fraction of sweeps in a stimulus set did fail, on average &lt;20%. If these sweeps had been identified as failing after the conclusion of the experiment, key sweeps may have been lost. By automatically detecting failed sweeps and repeating them sweeps during acquisition, the online analysis functions in MIES maximize the chance of a successful and complete electrophysiology experiment.</p><p>Analysis functions can also be designed to change data acquisition during a stimulus period. One such function is the automated detection of action potentials during a ramp stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), followed by the termination of the current injection. This function ends the ramp stimulus after a predefined number (5) of action potentials have been detected, thus increasing efficiency by allowing a more standardized neuronal response. Without the analysis function, the ramp stimulus would continue to depolarize the neuron until it is aborted, ceasing data collection, regardless of when it reached the spiking threshold. With the ramp analysis function, data acquisition continues after the stimulus pulse ends, allowing the afterhyperpolarization to be recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Without the analysis function, unabated depolarization may change the state, potentially fatally, of the neuron thereby altering subsequent measurements.</p><p>By default, MIES is packaged with the analysis functions described here. The stimuli are linked such that a single click generates the entire dataset in &lt;3 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The data can be saved directly from MIES as an NWB:N 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruebel et al., 2019</xref>) file, an emerging, accessible data standard for neurophysiology.</p><p>To evaluate how the modified internal solution as well as the rapid data acquisition of the Patch-seq protocol may affect extracted electrophysiological features, we compared data acquired using the Patch-seq protocol (most data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>) with data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>, which was acquired using a more traditional patch clamp approach. On the whole, features extracted from electrophysiology data from three major inhibitory subclass Cre-lines are remarkably consistent. A small number of features show small differences between the datasets, a shift that is consistent with adjustments made to the internal solution composition to compensate for the addition of RNase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>, a sparse principal components analysis (sPCA) was applied to sets of feature vectors computed from the responses to current steps and pulses.

This variability necessitates the use of a robust, quantitative, and automated measure of mRNA quality that is independent of cell type and that can be used as an indicator for lower quality cells. To address this issue, we utilized a published methodology for assessing transcriptome quality in Patch-seq data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripathy et al., 2018</xref>). The premise of this method is that gene expression patterns of cells from matched fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based data sets can serve as ground truth profiles for comparison to Patch-seq cells, where Patch-seq cells with technical issues are more likely to diverge from these patterns.</p><p>Three metrics are presented for assessing quality, which all rely on defining marker genes for broad cell classes of interest (‘on’ markers; e.g. Parvalbumin+ interneurons), as well as for cell types that may indicate mRNA contamination from adjacent cell bodies (‘off’ markers; e.g. astrocytes). First, the normalized marker sum (or NMS) is a ratio of the average expression of ‘on’ marker genes for a Patch-seq cell relative to the same median expression of these genes in the matched FACS data set for the cell class with highest marker expression. This metric measures the extent to which expected genes of at least one class are expressed. Second, the contamination score assesses off-target contamination by taking the summed NMS score of all broad cell types (except the assigned class). Higher values of this metric indicate a higher likelihood that mRNA measured from a single neuron also includes RNA from adjacent neurons. Finally, the ‘quality score’ is a metric aimed at capturing both types of technical issues by measuring the correlation of ‘on’ and ‘off’ marker genes in Patch-seq cells with the average expression profile of dissociated cells of the same type.</p><p>Here, we expand on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripathy et al., 2018</xref> by defining marker genes for class using a more recent study of single neurons collected from mouse primary visual cortex (VISp) and anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). We chose 50 marker genes for each class, defining ‘on’ markers by subclass, and ‘off’ markers by subclass for non-neuronal cells and by class for neuronal cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> displays gene expression data (counts per million and log<sub>2</sub>-transformed) and a corresponding high NMS score, from neurons targeted by specific Cre lines and their representative ‘on’ marker genes.

Additionally, a low NMS score is more reflective of a lack of detectable genes and not necessarily an increase in ‘off’ marker expression (genes highlighted in gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We sought to investigate the relationship of the ‘on’ marker genes of an assigned subclass and how they relate to neurons that were patched from a matching Cre line. Neurons with a higher NMS score from a Cre line are generally assigned to the appropriate subclass, whereas those with a low NMS score have more promiscuous assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Normalized marker sum is a measure for transcriptomic quality.</title><p>To examine the quality of Patch-seq samples we used NMS.

This assignment is classically made using data from dissociated neurons, due to the combination of large cell numbers with high quality transcriptomic data.

To understand how the markers of transcriptome quality predict the ability of the neuron to map to a t-type, we mapped inhibitory neurons from mouse VISp and assessed the quality of mapping described in this manuscript and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref> Patch-seq neurons with an NMS &lt;0.4 typically mapped poorly – often to multiple types across multiple sub-types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>), a majority of neurons with an NMS ≥ 0.4 mapped to a single type, and those that didn’t typically mapped to types within the same subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some mapping to multiple types is expected, even in FACS data, due to the presence of some neurons identified as ’intermediate’ between two types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>), the reference mapping probability matrix can be used to differentiate between this expected uncertainty due to biological variability, and that which could be due to poor transcriptomic data. Neurons are characterized as highly consistent, moderately consistent, or inconsistent based on the degree of discrepancy from the reference mapping distribution. As expected, neurons with an NMS &lt;0.4 overwhelmingly fall into the ‘low consistency’ category. In contrast, a majority of neurons with an NMS ≥ 0.4 are mapped in a highly consistent or moderately consistent way. Ultimately, NMS score is very predictive of mapping success, as an NMS of 0.4 allows us to retain the maximum highly/moderately consistently mapping neurons, while accepting relatively few inconsistently mapping neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Extracting the nucleus is key to optimize transcriptomic data quality</title><p>Using the marker gene list and NMS score to evaluate transcriptomic quality, we have determined that Patch-seq experiments where we collect the cytosol and nucleus (nucleus+) have significantly higher NMS scores than cytosol-only (nucleus-) samples, t(2803) = 32.2, p &lt; 0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The histograms to the right of each scatter plot quantify the average subclass-specific gene expression for nucleus+ samples and how they relate to their FACS (gray) counterparts. One important item to note is the higher detection of glia-related genes in Patch-seq samples compared to FACS. This is expected due to the inherent nature of the Patch-seq process as the patch pipette navigates through the tissue. We can conclude from these plots that the detection of subclass-specific gene expression in nucleus+ samples is similar to that of FACS-isolated samples.</p><p>Due to the sensitivity and potential instability of the neuron in the dialyzed whole-cell configuration, we sought to determine if there was a relationship between the experiment duration and the quality of extracted mRNA and subsequent cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sucher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Veys et al., 2012</xref>). To do this, we tracked the time spent at each of the Patch-seq stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). We found that time had no effect on the quality of the transcriptomic content, as assessed with NMS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and D</xref>, nucleus+ conditions have a significantly higher NMS with no effect of patch duration. Additionally, the time of nucleus retrieval and extraction phases did not affect NMS. This corroborates other findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadwell et al., 2017</xref>) that the integrity of the RNA is preserved during the Patch-seq recordings. Note that that the extraction times can range from less than 1 minute up to 8 minutes to successfully extract the nucleus. Despite the lack of an effect, it may still be advisable to keep the duration shorter for other reasons such as increasing throughput or optimizing morphological recovery. In addition to the patch duration, we also investigated the role of the initial whole-cell patch clamp parameters (access resistance to the neuron and depth of neuron within the slice) to determine a role in the quality of the Patch-seq sample. Surprisingly, there was no effect with the initial access resistance or neuron depth on NMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the cDNA can be evaluated to inform the quality of the Patch-seq samples. Electrophoretograms are obtained from a fragment or bioanalyzer and can provide unique metrics about the amplified cDNA. Quantitatively, two parameters can be obtained: (1) the amount of amplifiable content, and (2) the quality of the cDNA, measured as the ratio of high base pair to total material. Qualitative analysis can provide confirmation about the quantitative data obtained, such as proper distributions and shape of the electrophoretogram, positive controls, and artifacts. We found that NMS score is highly correlated with each metric and that there is a clear separation between nucleus+ and nucleus- samples. The difference between the two outcomes (nucleus+ vs. nucleus-) was found to be highly significant for each metric: cDNA quantity, t = 11.53, p &lt; 0.0001 and cDNA quality, t = 18.84, p &lt; 0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the cDNA for the presence or absence of the nucleus in Patch-seq samples. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, both the quantity and quality of the cDNA achieved an area under the curve (AUC) was ≥0.80, demonstrating that the presence of the nucleus is strongly associate with high-quality data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Optimizing morphology success with Patch-seq recordings</title><p>The shape and morphological features of a neuron are important for its function and can be used to classify and define types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lodato and Arlotta, 2015</xref>). Obtaining morphologies from Patch-seq samples has been a challenge and strategies for improving recovery have not been thoroughly examined. Early Patch-seq studies were unable to recover the morphology of the patched neuron and had to rely on electrophysiological classifiers to infer the morphological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuzik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadwell et al., 2015</xref>).

We have shown that extracting the nucleus (nucleated-patch) is key for transcriptomic success; historically, this paradigm has been used for studies of membrane biophysics. In previous studies using nucleated patches for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekkers, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gurkiewicz and Korngreen, 2006</xref>), morphological recovery of the neuron has not been well studied.

A single coronal slice with multiple Patch-seq recordings can lead to varying outcomes for morphological quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that factors prior to the slice processing phase are critical determinants of morphological recovery.

To maximize throughput, we targeted a recording duration &lt;10 mins. Surprisingly, we found no effect of the recording duration (range: 3–12 min) on the fraction of neurons that were deemed optimal for morphology reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The duration dependence of morphology output was mostly flat for other phases of the recording process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>), with perhaps a slight upward trend in outcome for longer retrieval times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). To investigate the effect that recording multiple neurons per slice has on morphology outcomes, we compared the morphologies of neurons from brain slices that had 1, 2, 3, or 4 recordings before slice fixation. We found that multiple Patch-seq recordings could be obtained in a single slice with no deleterious effects as the prior patched neuron(s) remained intact during subsequent recordings. We did observe a trend in which the last neuron recorded in the slice had the poorest outcome for ‘high quality’ with an increase in ‘insufficient axon’ or ‘failed’ outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>), indicating the possibility of insufficient time for complete diffusion of biocytin throughout the neuron prior to fixation. This is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadwell et al., 2017</xref>) showing that when the slice is fixed immediately after a single neuron is recorded, longer recording durations are required for sufficient fill.</p><p>We next asked how the resistance of the nucleated patch membrane (the end pipette resistance, endR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) predicts the ultimate neuron morphology, as it likely reflects how well the membrane reseals around both the extracted nucleus and the neuron remaining in the slice. We found the endR to be highly predictive of the final morphology outcome for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. When comparing the outcome of high and medium quality fills (combined) versus failed fills using a ROC curve, we find an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.62 for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively. Most interestingly, there is a prominent shoulder in the ROC curve at an endR of 100 MΩ. Using this value as a cutoff can reduce the fraction of morphology failures by about 30% at a cost of &lt;5% of high and medium morphologies for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). EndR did not impact the insufficient filling of the neuron, which is likely influenced by the recording duration or positioning of the neuron within the slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). This demonstrates that recordings that end with a pipette with a high endR are more successful at retaining the morphological fill. Access resistance during a recording may reflect the continuity of the internal solution between the electrode and cell. Interestingly, we found that the value of that electrical access does not relate to the cell’s morphology outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Unsurprisingly, cell health is also a significant factor in the ability to retain the morphology of the recorded neuron. We performed a qualitative rating on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best) of cell health. This rating is multifaceted including a visual assessment, using metrics such as soma shape and sharpness of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), and a recording quality assessment, using metrics such as baseline stability and number of failed sweeps. We found that cells ranked one or 2, had a lower chance of a ‘high quality’ score than cells with rank of 3, 4, or 5. Interestingly, there was little to no improvement of ‘high quality’ fills between rankings of 3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref> shows representative 63 x resolution minimum image projections (MIPs) of biocytin fills and their resultant morphological calls compared to the cell health assessment score.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Application to other species and cell types</title><p>A powerful aspect of the FACS-based transcriptomic studies is the ability to use similar methods to profile and compare neurons from different brain regions or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalmbach et al., 2020</xref>). With that in mind, we co-developed this protocol in both mouse tissue and tissue from human surgical resections. We sampled 103 human neocortical neurons across the four lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), 330 of which were described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The expanded dataset used for the analysis presented here includes neurons that did not pass the stringent quality control (QC) metrics required to be part of that previous study in addition to human inhibitory neurons to demonstrate the generalizability of the metrics and protocol to different neocortical cell types. We observed a pass rate of 76%, 77%, and 47% for electrophysiology, transcriptomics and morphology, respectively; with an ultimate final rate of 69% for ET and 28% for MET characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>) – all of which are comparable to mouse rates of success. Importantly, the key predictors of success – collecting the nucleus for transcriptomics and end electrode resistance for morphology, were consistent between mouse and human experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In one example, we recorded from 10 neurons in the same human cortical slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) – for each neuron, the nucleus was extracted, and the end electrode resistance was &gt;1 GΩ. The fact that a single human slice can yield 100% success despite lower population averages highlights that higher success rates are feasible, especially in human tissue, which has several experimental variables such as age of the patient, preexisting conditions, etc. Gene expression was consistent with the mapped transcriptomic types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and morphoelectric properties of each neuron are consistent with the cell types to which they are mapped. Glutamatergic neurons are pyramidal and have regular, adapting spiking patterns, while the GABAergic neurons show a greater diversity in their morphologies and firing patterns. To further demonstrate the generalizability of the approach, we targeted pyramidal neurons in macaque ex vivo acute brain slices from the temporal cortex region. We collected high-quality, morphoelectric, and transcriptomic data from 36 neurons that show that quality metrics were similarly correlated with nucleus extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) as shown with mouse and human Patch-seq experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Exemplar human neocortical slice with 10 successful Patch-seq recordings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) is a 20 x bright field image of a human acute neocortical slice containing biocytin reacted fills with overlaid digital reconstructions from ten Patch-seq recordings.

These findings build upon key components of previous detailed Patch-seq protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuzik et al., 2015</xref>) to increase throughput using custom software by identifying key predictors of data quality, most critically extracting the nucleus and maintaining membrane integrity as the electrode is retracted. The large size of the dataset (combined mouse and human N = 9664) has allowed us to examine the relationship between specific QC metrics and experimental outcomes. We have provided a guide for each metric including the range and what type of data to expect. For example, due to the high costs of sequencing, it might be in researchers’ financial interests to use the cDNA metrics and be judicious about which samples to send for sequencing. More importantly, these metrics can and allow users to make predictions and to optimize approaches for specific applications.</p><p>This protocol has resulted in the successful collection of large-scale Patch-seq data from mouse and human brain neuron types, and these data are publicly accessible as part of the Allen Cell Types Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://celltypes.brain-map.org/">https://celltypes.brain-map.org/</ext-link>) as well as the NIH’s Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative - Cell Census Network (BICCN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biccn.org">https://biccn.org</ext-link>). To accelerate data collection in the scientific community, we identified two use cases for an independent researcher who may want to generate comparable data:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Determining the morphoelectric phenotype of neurons corresponding to a large (FACS-based) transcriptomics dataset. The Patch-seq platform makes morphoelectric data accessible to a transcriptomics community that is accustomed to using large datasets to probe biological variance within a population. However, previous descriptions of the Patch-seq method have detailed a lower-throughput technique, suitable for targeted small studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipovsek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cadwell et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we describe an approach that can be used to generate combined morphoelectric and transcriptomic data at a scale that approaches recent transcriptomic studies. Indeed, the number of Patch-seq neurons in a recent manuscript using this protocol (4270 neurons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>) was more than 2.5 times the number of neurons in a FACS-based single-cell transcriptomics study just a few years ago (1679 cells, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>A smaller study that ‘extends’ the Allen Institute data sets to answer a specific research question. Building upon large, standardized datasets has been a successful way to address challenging questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>). However, in the case of Patch-seq, combined analysis of electrophysiological data generated in different labs has proved challenging to integrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tripathy et al., 2018</xref>). To combat this, here we detail both the approach and any quality metrics we use to exclude data. Another advantage using the tools described here is that MIES saves data in NWB:N 2.0, the open data format adopted by a number of labs, including all electrophysiology data deposited in the Allen Cell Types Database and BICCN. Pre-saved stimulus sets and the ability to save data in a standardized format will facilitate combined analysis of new and archived data.</p></list-item></list><p>Despite the improvements described here, there is room for additional optimization of the Patch-seq technique, primarily in morphological recovery, where ~ 46% of experiments result in neurons fit for digital reconstruction. Since morphological recovery is related to the qualitative ranking of cell health, additional optimization of the tissue slicing protocol tailored to specific mouse age, region, or cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ting et al., 2018</xref>) could lead to improved recovery. An additional area for further investigation is the effect of the size of the electrode on electrophysiological, transcriptomic, and morphological data quality. Since the seal resistance following retraction is a strong predictor of morphology outcome, it may be that smaller electrodes, which would disturb less of the total cell membrane, would be predicted to improve morphological recovery success. However, we initially found that smaller electrodes made it difficult to collect the nucleus, so we did not pursue this strategy further. Depending on the scientific question being asked, one can make different trade-offs between potentially conflicting data modalities.</p><p>To improve throughput, the patch-clamp process could be further automated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kodandaramaiah et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holst et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, here we have shown that automated analysis of electrophysiological features improves both the speed of acquisition and the quality of the ultimate data set. Automation could improve throughput by allowing the user to focus on getting the next neuron while the automated patch-clamp device initiates a recording. Implementing automation could also improve the data quality in other modalities in Patch-seq. For example, automated retraction of the pipette during nucleus extraction, with endR feedback, may result in a slower, more standardized movement with the potential to improve the rate of morphological recovery.</p><p>The protocol described here is focused on the interrogation of each neuron’s intrinsic electrical properties, but an obvious extension would be to incorporate Patch-seq with measurement of synaptic properties. Characterizing the connectivity and synaptic dynamics has been shown to differentiate classes of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Földy et al., 2016</xref>) and linking the rates or strength of synaptic connections with genes of interest and subsequent transcriptomic types would further our understanding of the functional role of cell types.</p><p>Large-scale transcriptomic studies have led to an incredible amount of progress in understanding the degrees of cell type differences between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yao et al., 2021</xref>) and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakken et al., 2016</xref>). To probe the phenotypic consequences of this differentiation, a platform is required that is robust to these dimensions. We have successfully used the Patch-seq protocol described here to study non-human primate and human excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalmbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakken, 2020</xref>), mouse cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keaveney et al., 2020</xref>), and hippocampal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>) interneurons. Here, we demonstrate that the key to successfully adapting the protocol to a new system, like the human or non-human primate, is to focus on consistency in a few aspects, including nucleus extraction and maintaining membrane integrity during retraction. By dividing the protocol into segments with clear metrics and benchmarks, other researchers can adapt critical parts of the protocol while monitoring trade-offs in other modalities. Intriguingly, in some human cases, we can achieve high-quality triple modality data from many neurons in a single slice.</p><p>As FACS-based single-cell transcriptomics establishes a foundation for studying neuronal cell types using large, standardized datasets with common tools, complementary techniques must adapt to facilitate faster data acquisition that can be applied to diverse tissues, along with transparent quality metrics. Patch-seq, although a relatively young technique, has shown scalability that holds promise for accelerating progress toward understanding of the phenotypic consequences of transcriptomic variability. The protocol described here details the keys to that scalability and provides the tools that allow others to adapt the approach for their own diverse research programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Committee at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Animals (&lt; 5 mice per cage) were provided food and water ad libitum and were maintained on a regular 12 hr light–dark cycle. Animals were maintained on the C57BL/6 J background, and newly received or generated transgenic lines were backcrossed to C57BL/6 J. Experimental animals were heterozygous for the recombinase transgenes and the reporter transgenes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Human tissue acquisition</title><p>Human tissue acquisition details can be found here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, surgical specimens were obtained from local hospitals (Harborview Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center and University of Washington Medical Center) in collaboration with local neurosurgeons. All patients provided informed consent and experimental procedures were approved by hospital institute review boards before commencing the study. Human surgical tissue specimens were immediately transported (15–35 min) from the hospital site to the laboratory for further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tissue processing</title><p>For mouse experiments male and females were used between the ages of P45 and P70 and anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and intracardially perfused with 25 mL of 0–4°C slicing ACSF.</p><p>Human, mouse or macaque slices (350  μm) were generated (Compresstome VF-300 vibrating microtome, Precisionary Instruments or VT1200S Vibratome, Leica Biosystems), with a block-face image acquired (Mako G125B PoE camera with custom integrated software) before each section to aid in registration to the common mouse reference atlas. Brains were mounted for slicing either coronally or 17° off-coronal to preserve intactness of neuronal processes in primary visual cortex.</p><p>Slices were transferred to an oxygenated and warmed (34 °C) slicing ACSF for 10  min, then transferred to room temperature holding ACSF (continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for the remainder of the day until transferred for patch-clamp recordings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Patch-clamp recording</title><p>Slices were bathed in warm (34 °C) recording ACSF and continuously bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The bath solution contained blockers of fast glutamatergic (1  mM kynurenic acid) and GABAergic synaptic transmission (0.1  mM picrotoxin). Thick-walled borosilicate glass (Warner Instruments, G150F-3) electrodes were manufactured (Narishige PC-10) with a resistance of 4–5  MΩ. Before recording, the electrodes were filled with ~1.0–1.5  µL of internal solution with biocytin (110  mM potassium gluconate, 10.0  mM HEPES, 0.2  mM ethylene glycol-bis (2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 4  mM potassium chloride, 0.3  mM guanosine 5′-triphosphate sodium salt hydrate, 10  mM phosphocreatine disodium salt hydrate, 1  mM adenosine 5′-triphosphate magnesium salt, 20 µg/mL glycogen, 0.5 U/µL RNAse inhibitor (Takara, 2,313A) and 0.5 % biocytin (Sigma B4261), pH 7.3). The pipette was mounted on a Multiclamp 700B amplifier headstage (Molecular Devices) fixed to a micromanipulator (PatchStar, Scientifica).</p><p>The composition of bath and internal solution as well as preparation methods were made to maximize the tissue quality of slices from adult mice, to align with solution compositions typically used in the field (to maximize the chance of comparison to previous studies), modified to reduce RNAse activity and ensure maximal gain of mRNA content.</p><p>Electrophysiology signals were recorded using an ITC-18 Data Acquisition Interface (HEKA). Commands were generated, signals processed, and amplifier metadata were acquired using MIES written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Data were filtered (Bessel) at 10  kHz and digitized at 50  kHz. Data were reported uncorrected for the measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neher, 1992</xref>)–14  mV liquid junction potential between the electrode and bath solutions.</p><p>Prior to data collection, all surfaces, equipment and materials were thoroughly cleaned in the following manner: a wipe down with DNA away (Thermo Scientific), RNAse Zap (Sigma-Aldrich), and finally nuclease-free water.</p><p>After formation of a stable seal and break-in, the resting membrane potential of the neuron was recorded (typically within the first minute). A bias current was injected, either manually or automatically using algorithms within the MIES data acquisition package, for the remainder of the experiment to maintain that initial resting membrane potential. Bias currents remained stable for a minimum of 1  s before each stimulus current injection.</p><p>To be included in analysis, a neuron needed to have a &gt; 1  GΩ seal recorded before break-in and an initial access resistance &lt;20  MΩ and &lt;15 % of the R<sub>input</sub>. To stay below this access resistance cut-off, neurons with a low input resistance were successfully targeted with larger electrodes. For an individual sweep to be included, the following criteria were applied: (1) the bridge balance was &lt;20  MΩ and &lt;15 % of the R<sub>input</sub>; (2) bias (leak) current 0  ±  100  pA; and (3) root mean square noise measurements in a short window (1.5  ms, to gauge high frequency noise) and longer window (500  ms, to measure patch instability) were &lt;0.07  mV and 0.5  mV, respectively.</p><p>Cell health rating is a subjective call ranked on a scale of 1–5, with one corresponding to poor health and five corresponding to healthy. Scores were based on the unique visible features of neuron prior to patching. Cells ranked one included shriveled and/or dark edges or swollen appearances. Whereas a cell that ranked five included features such as a well-defined soma, soft edges, and a three-dimensional appearance.</p><p>Extracting the nucleus at the conclusion of the electrophysiology experiment led to a substantial increase in transcriptomic data quality. Upon completion of electrophysiological examination, the pipette was centered on the soma or placed near the nucleus (if visible). A small amount of negative pressure was applied (~–30 mbar) to begin cytosol extraction and attract the nucleus to the tip of the pipette. After approximately one minute, the soma had visibly shrunk and/or the nucleus was near the tip of the pipette. While maintaining the negative pressure, the pipette was slowly retracted in the x and z direction. Slow, continuous movement was maintained while monitoring pipette seal. Once the pipette seal reached &gt;1 GΩ and the nucleus was visible on the tip of the pipette, the speed was increased to remove the pipette from the slice. The pipette containing internal solution, cytosol, and nucleus was removed from the pipette holder and contents were expelled into a PCR tube containing lysis buffer (Takara, 634894).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology feature analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological responses were elicited by short (3 ms) current pulses, (1 s) current steps, and a slow ramp (25 pA/s). These stimulation protocols and the following feature extraction methods were previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, AP locations were identified where the smoothed derivative of the membrane potential (dV/dt) exceeded 20 mV/ms, and were further refined based on threshold-to-peak voltage, time differences and absolute peak height. The AP threshold was adjusted to where the dV/dt was 5% of the average maximal dV/dt across all APs. Features including peak, width (at half-height) and upstroke/downstroke ratio (i.e. ratio of the peak upstroke dV/dt to the peak downstroke dV/dt) were calculated for each AP.</p><p>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>, a sparse principal components analysis (sPCA) was applied to sets of feature vectors that included (a) concatenated waveforms of the first APs evoked by the lowest-amplitude current steps (b) the derivatives of these waveforms, (c) interspike intervals, between the fast trough of the initial AP and the threshold of the following AP, normalized in duration and averaged, (d) binned (in 20 ms intervals) features derived from long current steps at stimulation amplitudes at rheobase and +40 pA and +80 pA above rheobase, with interpolation from neighboring sweeps if a sweep at the expected amplitude was not available, and normalization of instantaneous firing frequency to the maximum value for the step, (e) downsampled (to 10 ms bins) and concatenated subthreshold responses from –10 pA to –90 pA steps (at a –40 pA interval), (f) response to the largest available hyperpolarizing step, normalized to the minimum and baseline membrane potentials. sPCA was performed separately for the feature vector data in each of the categories described above. PCs with an adjusted explained variance greater than 1 % were kept, yielding a total of 45 components, which were then z-scored, combined and visualized using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becht et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>cDNA amplification and library construction</title><p>We used the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara, 634894) to reverse transcribe poly(A) RNA and amplify full-length cDNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We performed reverse transcription and cDNA amplification for 20 PCR cycles in 0.65 ml tubes, in sets of 88 tubes at a time. At least one control eight-strip was used per amplification set, which contained four wells without cells and four wells with 10 pg control RNA. Control RNA was either Universal Human RNA (UHR) (Takara 636538) or control RNA provided in the SMART-Seq v4 kit. All samples proceeded through Nextera XTDNA Library Preparation (Illumina FC-131–1096) using either Nextera XT Index Kit V2 Sets A-D (FC-131–2001, 2002, 2003, 2004) or custom dual-indexes provided by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies). Nextera XT DNA Library prep was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions, except that the volumes of all reagents including cDNA input were decreased to 0.2 x by volume. Each sample was sequenced to approximately 500 k reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><p>Fifty-base-pair paired-end reads were aligned to GRCm38 (mm10) using a RefSeq annotation gff file retrieved from NCBI on 18 January 2016 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/all</ext-link>). Sequence alignment was performed using STAR v2.5.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobin et al., 2012</xref>) in two pass Mode. PCR duplicates were masked and removed using STAR option ‘bamRemoveDuplicates’. Only uniquely aligned reads were used for gene quantification. Gene counts were computed using the R Genomic Alignments package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>). Overlaps function using ‘IntersectionNotEmpty’ mode for exonic and intronic regions separately. Exonic and intronic reads were added together to calculate total gene counts; this was done for both the reference dissociated cell data set and the Patch-seq data set of this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mapping to VISp reference taxonomy</title><p>As described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>, Patch-seq data was mapped to the reference taxonomy prepared from dissociated cells from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>, using only neuronal cells and their corresponding cell types from VISp region. The mapping was done in a top down manner, first resolving subclasses then types. At each branch point, the correlation between the given transcriptome and the reference cell types was computed using the marker genes associated with that branch point. The most correlated branch was chosen and the process was repeated down to the leaves. Mapping confidence was determined with 100 bootstrapped iterations at each branch point, sampling a subset (70%) of reference cells and markers (70%), as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>. The cell was assigned the cell type to which the cell had mapped with highest probability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mapping quality assessment</title><p>We used the same methodology as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref> to assess the quality of mapping and to quantify the expected versus unexpected ambiguity of mapping between cell types. First, the reference dissociated cells were mapped to the reference taxonomy, and a reference mapping probability matrix was constructed. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2009</xref>) between the mapping probability distributions of Patch-seq cells and the reference mapping probability distribution was computed. Cells with a KL divergence greater than two were categorized as ‘inconsistent’. The correlation in gene expression for each remaining cell and the reference cells from the same cell type to which that cell was assigned was the computed. If the correlation was less than 0.5, the cell was also categorized as ‘inconsistent’. Probability of mapping to one or more than one type was used to assign the quality of the remaining cells. A cell was categorized as ‘highly consistent’ if the sum of its two highest mapping probabilities exceeded 70% and if the ratio of the highest mapping probability to the second highest was more than 2. Otherwise the cell was categorized as ‘moderately consistent’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Biocytin histology</title><p>A horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme reaction using diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the chromogen was used to visualize the filled neurons after electrophysiological recording, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain was used identify cortical layers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Imaging</title><p>Mounted sections were imaged as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, operators captured images on an upright AxioImager Z2 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an Axiocam 506 monochrome camera and 0.63 x optivar. Two-dimensional tiled overview images were captured with a 20 X objective lens (Zeiss Plan-NEOFLUAR 20 X/0.5) in brightfield transmission and fluorescence channels. Tiled image stacks of individual neurons were acquired at higher resolution in the transmission channel only for the purpose of automated and manual reconstruction. Light was transmitted using an oil-immersion condenser (1.4 NA). High-resolution stacks were captured with a 63 X objective lens (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63 x/1.4 Oil or Zeiss LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 63 x/1.2 Imm Corr) at an interval of 0.28 µm (1.4 NA objective) or 0.44 µm (1.2 NA objective) along the Z axis. Tiled images were stitched in ZEN software and exported as single-plane TIFF files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Anatomical location</title><p>To characterize the position of biocytin-labeled neurons in the mouse brain, a 20 x brightfield and/or fluorescent image of DAPI-stained tissue was captured and analyzed to determine layer position and region. Soma position of reconstructed neurons was annotated and used to calculate soma depth relative to drawings of the pia and/or white matter. Individual mouse neurons were also manually placed in the appropriate cortical region and layer within the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) by matching the 20 x image of the slice with a ‘virtual’ slice at an appropriate location and orientation within the CCF. Laminar locations were calculated by finding the path connecting pia and white matter that passed through the neuron’s coordinate, identifying its distance to pia and white matter as well as position within its layer, then aligning those values to an average set of layer thicknesses. Using the DAPI image, laminar borders were also drawn for all reconstructed neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Morphological reconstruction</title><p>Reconstructions were generated based on a 3D image stack that was run through a Vaa3D-based image processing and reconstruction pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2010</xref>). Initial reconstructions were generated with an automated reconstruction of the neuron using TReMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>), using reconstruction software PyKNOSSOS (Ariadne-service) or the citizen neuroscience game Mozak (Mozak.science) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roskams and Popović, 2016</xref>). Automated or manually-initiated reconstructions were then extensively manually corrected and curated using a range of tools (e.g. virtual finger, polyline) in the Mozak extension (Zoran Popovic, Center for Game Science, University of Washington) of Terafly tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2014</xref>) in Vaa3D. Every attempt was made to generate a completely connected neuronal structure while remaining faithful to image data. If axonal processes could not be traced back to the main structure of the neuron, they were left unconnected.</p><p>Before morphological feature analysis, reconstructed neuronal morphologies were expanded in the dimension perpendicular to the cut surface to correct for shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>) after tissue processing. The amount of shrinkage was calculated by comparing the distance of the soma to the cut surface during recording and after fixation and reconstruction. A tilt angle correction was also performed based on the estimated difference (via CCF registration) between the slicing angle and the direct pia-white matter direction at the neuron’s location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Morphological quality assessments</title><p>All slices received a 20 x single image scan to evaluate the biocytin fill of patched neurons. If the soma failed to retain the biocytin and was not visible, then the morphological assessment was categorized as ‘failed’. To be strategic about which cells are imaged, high-resolution (63 x) images were collected only for Patch-seq experiments with passing cDNA (subjective call), passing NMS (&gt; 0.4) and a visible neuron in the 20 x scan. If the neuron was not determined to be suitable for digital reconstruction from 63 x stack collection, it was categorized as ‘medium quality’. Neurons that were of the highest quality and suitable for digital reconstructions were categorized as ‘high quality’. Upon detailed inspection, some neurons originally destined for high-resolution stack collection and reconstruction were determined to have an ‘insufficient axon’. Neurons that had an observable fill on the 20 x image but failed either cDNA assessment or NMS were classified as ‘not assessed’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Resources, Software, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Resources, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con21"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con22"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con23"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con24"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con25"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con26"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con27"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con28"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: De-identified human brain tissue and data used in this research was collected by local hospitals during clinically necessary surgery.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sacha B Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chris J McBain (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall, the reviewers recognize the significance of your study, which provides a detailed protocol for obtaining high quality Patch-seq data, with all the resources available to the community. The reviewers thus recommended this submission be published as a Tools and Resources piece upon successful revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers and editors were divided in their assessment of your manuscript. All saw merit in the thoroughness of the approach and the importance of fully describing the method to those seeking to emulate it. However, what was difficult to assess is precisely what is new here. The suitability for publication in eLife will depend on clarifying the data, findings and protocols that have not been previously reported.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should be entirely transparent within the paper about which (if any) data are being reported for the first time and which have been previously described. The same is true for the resources provided (e.g. the software) and for the methodological conclusions. It is fine to include material/ideas etc that were previously reported but these must be clearly indicated with phrases like &quot;as previously reported.&quot; In general it is important to make the case that new details are provided which significantly improve the ability of others to carry out the technique, over and above the material already provided as part of publication of the other papers in this series.</p><p>2) The authors should comment on the similarities and differences between the current protocol and others recently published.</p><p>3) The issue of the granularity of cell type identification should be quantitatively addressed. Was it possible to identify all cells included in terms of the finest divisions identified in prior RNAseq studies including those in this current series? To the extent that this was not possible the reasons should be addressed. There are valid reasons to expect that the reduced sampling provided by patch seq may not be able to match the granularity of whole cell studies, but this is an important issue to address in detail, given the more complete scope of the data provided.</p><p>4) Criteria used to make classifications (e.g. such as cell health) should be specified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is one of a series of recent papers from the Allen Institute using patch seq to characterize gene expression, electrophysiology and morphology of cortical neurons. The main focus of the present manuscript is to communicate improvements in the method developed in the course of acquiring large datasets that are more completely described in other papers including Gouwens et al. 2019, 2020 and Berg 2020.</p><p>What is difficult to assess is the relationship of the datasets and conclusions described here to the datasets and conclusions in these other papers. This should be communicated more clearly and transparently. Many of the points and resources presented in this paper are also presented in these other papers. For example, the availability of the electrophysiology acquisition software is noted in the 2019 Nature Neuroscience paper and the recent Cell paper and the importance of retaining the nucleus for improving transcriptome representation is described in this paper and in the Berg manuscript.</p><p>The major results that appear to be new here are:</p><p>1) A description of the electrode resistance during automated nucleus retrieval and extraction (Figure 2).</p><p>2) Perhaps, a more complete description of the automated electrophysiology software and protocol used in the recent papers (Figure 3), although this is described in some detail in the methods of Gouwens et al. 2020. If there is something new here it should be distinguished more clearly.</p><p>3) quantification of the effects of nucleus retrieval on marker expression (Figure 4)</p><p>And</p><p>4) the effects of nucleated patch resistance and recording duration on recovery of fills. (Figure. 5)</p><p>Figure 1 is a diagram and Figure 6 is a single example slice, presumably from the dataset in the Berg manuscript (but again this is hard to assess).</p><p>One important difference between the present transcriptomic/morphoelectric data and that presented in Gouwens et al. 2020, is that here there is no effort made to subdivide the Pvalb, Vip and SST subtypes of interneurons into the 28 subtypes identified in the Gouwens et al. paper. If these are an overlapping set of cells they should be organized in the same way. If instead these are a separate dataset, do they support the subtypes seen in the other study?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Simultaneous, triple-modal profiling of an individual neuron (morphology, electrophysiology, and transcriptome) using the Patch-seq is an important approach to better understand each neuron and improve their classification, but is difficult to achieve. To improve this approach, Lee and his colleagues made several modifications to the Patch-seq protocol, aiming at increasing the efficiency of each step to minimize data attrition and enhance the throughput to facilitate a more comprehensive cell type characterization. These modifications include adopting a standard automatic electrophysiology software equipped with an online analysis function, nucleated patch to increase RNA yield, and optimized variables for the morphology recovery.</p><p>The manuscript was well written with enough technical details for anyone interested to follow. In general, the conclusions and technical claims were well supported by impressive quantitative analysis, and the data and figures are high-quality and impressive. There is no doubt that this refined protocol could be a useful technical resource for the field, especially for current cell type taxonomy efforts. However, given that a similar Patch-seq approach (&quot;nucleated&quot; patch, or 'cork' of the nucleus) has been recently published (Lipovsek 2020), I would not consider this protocol a significant technical advancement in the field. In my opinion, it is more appropriate to publish this as a protocol paper in those journals focusing on the protocol and methods (Star Protocol and Nature Protocol et al), other than an article in <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition, there were a few claims that could be wrong if their data could be analyzed differently (see Suggestions).</p><p>One major concern is the success rate of morphology recovery in the Patch-seq protocol. The authors claim the patch recording time has no impact on morphology quality. Based on our experience, this may be true for excitatory neurons, but not for inhibitory neurons. The axon of excitatory neurons is inevitably cut in slice preparation and their dendrite recovery is easy to achieve with minimal recording time. The real bottleneck here is labeling the axonal tree of the inhibitory neurons, which are generally much more intact and complex. The longer the patch recording is, the more likely biocytin diffuses and reaches into the fine tip of complex and highly-arborized axonal trees. So high-quality morphology recovery of inhibitory neurons critically depends on the recording time. I would suggest authors regroup their data based on cell type and assess the relationship between recording time and morphology quality by cell type, or even by subtype. After parsing this relationship by cell type, I believe we will see the significant impact of recording time variable on the morphology quality, particularly on interneurons.</p><p>Another comment is about how to assess cell health. It does not make sense to rank cell health in slice electrophysiology on a scale of 1 to 5. This is not practical and could run into being very subjective (for instance, what is the difference between 4 and 5, which factor determines this cell is 4 other than 5?). I would recommend a scale of 1 to 3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I think this is a tremendous paper, which will be extremely useful to everyone interested in combining cell physiology (electrophysiology and morphology) with gene expression profiling approaches. The authors do a great job at laying out how to best approach this problem and facilitate this by the provision of a suite of software that will allow combining electrophysiology with gene analysis.</p><p>I don't have any major issues with the manuscript and think it could pretty much be published as is.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65482.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should be entirely transparent within the paper about which (if any) data are being reported for the first time and which have been previously described.
