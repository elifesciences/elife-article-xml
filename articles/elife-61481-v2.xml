for eukaryotic cell function. Spatial and temporal regulation of kinesin activity is essential for building these local environments via control of intracellular cargo distribution. Kinesin-binding protein (KBP) interacts with a subset of kinesins via their motor domains, inhibits their microtubule (MT) attachment, and blocks their cellular function. However, its mechanisms of inhibition and selectivity have been unclear. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of KBP and of a KBP–kinesin motor domain complex. KBP is a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing, right-handed α-solenoid that sequesters the kinesin motor domain’s tubulin-binding surface, structurally distorting the motor domain and sterically blocking its MT attachment. KBP uses its α-solenoid concave face and edge loops to bind the kinesin motor domain, and selected structure-guided mutations disrupt KBP inhibition of kinesin transport in cells. The KBP-interacting motor domain surface contains motifs exclusively conserved in KBP-interacting kinesins, suggesting a basis for kinesin selectivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

molecular motors that play important roles in cellular functions such as mitosis, cell motility, and intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klinman and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Kinesins are categorised into 14 sub-classes (kinesin-1 to kinesin-14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>]) by motor domain conservation and within these sub-classes individual family members (a total of 45 ‘KIF’ or ‘Kif’ genes in humans and mice respectively) have a wide range of functional characteristics and biological roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miki et al., 2001</xref>). Dysfunction of kinesin family members has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hirokawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2002</xref>). The kinesin motor domain is the MT-binding engine that drives these activities, converting the chemical energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis into mechanical force. While these mechanical forces are classically used to generate motility in transport kinesins, some kinesin family members drive MT organisation or depolymerisation of MTs.</p><p>Kinesins are highly regulated in order to prevent both waste of ATP and to spatially and temporally control kinesin function. This is particularly important in highly polarised and compartmentalised cells such as neurons. Kinesin regulation via inhibition of their motor domains can occur through a number of mechanisms that limit ATPase activity and/or block track binding – these include intramolecular inhibition by kinesin tail domains, post-translational modification of the motor, or through interactions with regulatory binding partners. Recently, it has been demonstrated that a subset of kinesin superfamily members, including kinesin-2s, −3 s, −8 s, and −12 s, are sequestered by kinesin-binding protein (KBP; KIF1BP; KIAA1279), which inhibits MT track attachment by their motor domains and, thus, blocks their MT-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wozniak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>KBP is expressed in multiple human tissues including brain and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wozniak et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations in the KBP have been identified as causing autosomal recessive Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dafsari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valence et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salehpour et al., 2017</xref>), which presents as congenital facial dysmorphia, nervous system pathology, and dysfunction and heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 1993</xref>). In addition, KBP gene copy number has been recently reported as predictive in paediatric neuroblastoma prognosis, prompting its suggestion as a drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suo et al., 2018</xref>). KBP was originally identified as a kinesin-3-binding partner that modulated its mitochondrial transport function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wozniak et al., 2005</xref>); however, KBP has since been shown to interact with a subset of other kinesin family members to regulate diverse cellular processes including mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brouwers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malaby et al., 2019</xref>), spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lehti et al., 2015</xref>), and neuronal differentiation, growth, and cargo distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyons et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drévillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drerup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirst et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We do not currently know what the structure of KBP is, nor understand the mechanism of KBP–kinesin inhibition. It is also completely unknown how KBP differentiates between particular kinesin family members. KBP is a 72 kDa protein, is predicted to contain several tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), and to be mainly α-helical in secondary structure content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wozniak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>). Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of KBP alone and of KBP bound to the motor domain of the human mitotic kinesin KIF15 (a 110 kDa complex). We show that KBP is a TPR-containing, right-handed α-solenoid protein composed of nine antiparallel α-helix pairs interrupted by a linker region. We also show that KBP’s concave face binds KIF15 via its MT-binding elements and induces a large displacement of the kinesin α4 helix, sterically inhibiting MT association. Finally, we show that KBPs kinesin selectivity is associated with specific kinesin sequences spread across the interaction surface.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KBP is a TPR-containing, right-handed α-solenoid</title><p>The 3D structure of the ~72 kDa KBP at 4.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) was determined using cryo-EM data collected using a Volta phase plate (VPP), and an atomic model was calculated (see Materials and methods <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Two-dimensional classification of these images revealed a number of classes with an extra-density corresponding to the size of a kinesin motor domain bound to the concave face of KBP, consistent with what was observed in the KBP–KIF15_MD6S dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Intriguingly, in addition, the extra kinesin density in the 2D classes appeared to have a somewhat flexible position relative to KBP. However, these data did allow us to confirm that indeed KIF1A_MD also interacts with KBP on its concave face in the same way as KIF15_MD6S and suggests a common mechanism of kinesin inhibition by KBP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>KIF15_MD6S binds KBP via rearrangement of its tubulin-binding subdomain</title><p>We examined the effect of KBP binding on the conformation of KIF15_MD6S.

Ala-substitutions in the TPR-containing α-helices at the KBP concave face were also introduced at particularly inter-species conserved polar residues predicted to interact with the KIF15_MD K11–Kα4–-KL12 region (Tyr-213 and Gln-216 in αHP4a, Gln-238 in αHP4b, Thr-255 and Gln-258 in αHP5a; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). All mutant constructs exhibited roughly equivalent expression patterns that were also comparable to WT KBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We first used pull-down assays. Mouse Kif15 or Kif1A constructs consisting of only the motor domain and the first coiled-coil region (Kif15_MDC or Kif1A_MDC) were fused to bioGFP and co-expressed with various HA-tagged human KBP constructs in HEK293T cells, followed by pull-down of HA–KBP by the bioGFP-KIF_MDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although there are moderate qualitative differences in binding by the two motors, the effects of KBP mutations on motor binding – described in the following – are essentially the same. Ala-substitutions in the TPR-containing α-helices at the KBP concave face (αHP4a and αHP4b), which lie at the heart of the KBP–KIF15_MD6S structural interface, strongly reduced KBP’s interaction with both KIF15_MDC and KIF1A_MDC. αHP5a mutants had a similar but less pronounced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). In contrast, mutation of L1, L3, or L5 in the KBP N-terminal subdomain or L10 or L16 in the C-terminal subdomain – none of which form directly visualised interactions with KIF15_MD6S in the cryo-EM reconstruction – has no effect on KBP’s interaction with either KIF15_MDC or KIF1A_MDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Mutation of L12 (to some extent) and of L14 (to a greater extent) – which contact both Kβ5–KL8 and KL12–Kα5–KL13 – reduced KBP interaction with KIF15_MDC and KIF1A_MDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>). Mutation of L12 + L14 additively disrupted the KBP–motor interaction, consistent with the structural proximity of these two loops in the kinesin–KBP complex. L10 + L12 and L10 + L14 mutants also had weaker interactions with KIF15_MDC/KIF1A_MDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b and c</xref>), again pointing to the additive contributions of loops in the KBP C-terminal subdomain to kinesin binding. Strikingly, mutation of L18 appears to enhance the interaction between KBP and both KIF15_MDC and KIF1A_MDC, suggesting that it may somehow contribute to negative regulation of binding in the context of WT KBP.</p><p>We then used a previously described inducible peroxisome translocation assay in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>). In this assay, dimeric mouse Kif15_MDC or Kif1A_MDC constructs with an FRB-tag (Kif15_MDC–FRB or Kif1A_MDC–FRB) are expressed together with PEX–mRFP–FKBP, a peroxisome-binding construct, along with the various KBP constructs. Addition of rapalog induces FRB–FKBP heterodimerisation and motor-driven peroxisome translocation to the cell periphery, but when the motor is inhibited by KBP, peroxisome translocation is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–c</xref>). Kinesin-mediated translocation was measured, first by quantifying the number of cells in which peroxisome translocation is seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d and e</xref>), and second, by quantifying peroxisome intensities above a threshold value in the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f and g</xref>). Because of observed differences in peroxisome translocation within the time-frame of rapalog treatment, different peroxisome intensity threshold values and peripheral areas were used for KIF1A and KIF15; this is probably due to differences in motor properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Disruption of cryo-electron microscopy defined kinesin-binding protein (KBP)–kinesin interface perturbs KBP inhibition of KIF15- and KIF1A-mediated cargo translocation in cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic depiction of the inducible peroxisome motility assay, with the kinesin motor domain fused to an FRB domain and PEX fused to an FKBP domain.

As with the pull-down assay, Ala-substitutions in the TPR-containing α-helices αHP4a and αHP4b at the KBP concave face, as well as αHP5a, all strongly reduced KBP’s inhibition of both KIF15_MDC and KIF1A_MDC peroxisome translocation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>). This can be seen by the extent of peroxisome translocation and in an increase of peroxisomes in the cell periphery after rapalog addition, similar to the control condition without KBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>). Also, as observed in the pull-down assay, mutation of L1, L3, or L5 had no effect on KBP’s inhibition of KIF15_MDC or KIF1A_MDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>). This reinforces the conclusion that while these elements are close enough to form contacts with the parts of the kinesin motor domain in our reconstruction, they do not contribute significantly to KBP inhibition of kinesin-mediated translocation in cells.</p><p>Mutation of either of L12 or L14 strongly abrogated KBP inhibition of KIF15_MDC/KIF1A_MDC-based translocation, a more pronounced effect than was seen in the pull-down assay. Similarly, although mutation of L10 and L16 had no effect on KBP–kinesin interaction in the pull-down assay, mutation of these loops disrupted KBP inhibition of KIF1A_MDC and KIF15_MDC in the translocation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>). A subset of the above described mutations was also combined to assess additive effects. Here we observed that KBP constructs containing mutations in both L10 + L12, L10 + L14, or L12 + L14 had similar effects to KBP with only one of the loops mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d–g</xref>), suggesting that KBP inhibition is more readily disrupted in the translocation assay.</p><p>Interestingly, while all the above described regions affected KBP inhibition of KIF15_MDC and KIF1A_MDC equivalently, the L18 KBP mutant inhibited KIF15_MDC equivalent to wild type, but only exhibited partial inhibition of KIF1A_MDC-mediated translocation. It should, however, be noted that fewer cells show peroxisome translocation by KIF1A_MDC when L18 is co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>), suggesting that the L18 KBP mutant also inhibits KIF1A_MDC to some extent. The L18 mutant is the single example of contradictory behaviours between the assays, because it appeared to enhance KBP–kinesin binding in the pull-down assay. Our structural data do not provide a clear rationale for this, and future studies will investigate the role of this region of KBP further and, for example, whether it is subject to post-translational regulation that could regulate KBP’s inhibitory activity.</p><p>However, taken together, the translocation and pull-down assays both demonstrate the functional importance of the kinesin interaction with the TPR-containing α-helices at the KBP concave face and the set of loops in the KBP C-terminal subdomain. The translocation and pull-down assays also reveal differences in the sensitivity of the KBP–kinesin interaction to perturbation, where translocation is more readily disrupted than the interactions detected by pull-down. These differences likely reflect the greater complexity of motor regulation during active translocation and could be a function of FRB–FKBP-mediated motor dimerisation. It might also reflect the fact that cellular MTs in the translocation assay can directly compete with KBP for kinesin binding. Overall, these mutation studies support the idea that KBP interacts with different kinesin family members in a similar way via an extended interface at KBP’s concave face that is composed of TPR-containing α-helices and α-solenoid edge loops, particularly in the C-terminal subdomain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Specific sequences in the tubulin-binding subdomain are conserved across KBP-binding kinesin family members</title><p>Given that KBP selectively binds and inhibits only a subset of kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>), we used our structural data to investigate the basis of this selectivity. Although the resolution of our reconstruction and the flexibility of some loops do not provide a detailed molecular description of the interaction interface, our structure shows that the kinesin tubulin-binding subdomain is the key KBP-interacting region. Analysis of the sequences of this region in KBP-binding and KBP-non-binding kinesins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>) revealed patterns of sequence conservation across the entire subdomain in all KBP-binding kinesins; this included both the Kβ5–KL8 and KL11–Kα4–KL12–Kα5–KL13 regions. In contrast, the equivalent regions are more variable in kinesins that are not inhibited by KBP. The length of KL8, which joins the two Kβ5 strands, was also consistently five residues long in KBP-binding kinesins, while it was variable in KBP-non-binding kinesins. From our KBP–KIF15_MD6S structure, the sensitivity of the KBP interaction to KL8 length makes sense considering the tight fit of this loop between KBP L12 and L14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). In summary, two consensus motifs in KL11–Kα4–KL12–Kα5–KL13 and Kβ5–KL8 regions of the tubulin-binding subdomain are found in KBP-binding kinesins and these are likely to form the basis of KBP’s kinesin family member selectivity. We therefore propose a model where KBP selects and inhibits target kinesins through binding and remodelling a compatible tubulin-binding subdomain, obstructing the kinesin MT-binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Conserved motifs in kinesin-binding protein (KBP)-binding kinesin MDs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequence alignment of the tubulin-binding subdomain from kinesin motor domains, made using Clustal Omega multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>).

The structure of the KBP–KIF15_MD6S complex shows how KBP binds the KIF15_MD6S via its concave face and undergoes subtle remodelling of its N-terminal domain to accommodate kinesin binding. This further reinforces the idea that the TPR-containing structures are not simply static scaffolds but can flexibly respond to ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pernigo et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the KIF15 motor domain undergoes a radical conformational change in forming a complex with KBP, in which helix α4, the major component of the motor’s tubulin-binding subdomain, is displaced from the main MD body by ~15 Å into the KBP concave face. This is consistent with previous observations that this region of the kinesin motor domain being rather malleable and able to move independently of the core structure of kinesin motor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scarabelli and Grant, 2013</xref>). Our evidence suggests this observation is not due to use of a cysteine-substituted KIF15 motor domain construct because: (i) this protein exhibited equivalent MT-stimulated ATPase activity compared to non-substituted KIF15_MD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), (ii) it exhibited structurally canonical MT binding and response to nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and (iii) the substituted residues are not well conserved among KBP-binding kinesins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The large displacement of helix α4 expands the surface area over which the normally compact tubulin-binding subdomain of the kinesin motor domain can interact with KBP, and it is through the sequence and shape of this interface that the selectivity of KBP for a subset of kinesin motors is presumably defined.</p><p>Analysis of the KBP–KIF1A_MD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>) supports the idea of a conserved mode of interaction between a subset of kinesins and the concave face of KBP. Interestingly, KIF1A_MD exhibited flexibility in its interaction with KBP, which was not observed in the KBP–KIF15_MD6S complex. Whether this reflects a physiological reality, or a result of the EM preparation method is uncertain at present, although we think it unlikely to be due to our use of KIF15_MD6S. However, our 2D classifications combined with mutation studies strongly suggest KIF15_MD6S and KIF1A_MD share an overall similar KBP-binding mode.</p><p>Targeted mutations to the various kinesin-binding KBP elements reduced complex affinity, yet no single mutation completely disrupted the interaction in our pull-down assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Although most KBP mutations that have been reported in GOSHS result in total loss of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dafsari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valence et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salehpour et al., 2017</xref>), a recent study details missense mutations that only partially reduce protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacKenzie et al., 2020</xref>). Our data illustrate that KBP’s activity is additionally sensitive to mutations in key regions that affect its ability to bind kinesins.</p><p>Our structure shows that KBP binds exclusively to the tubulin-binding subdomain of KIF15_MD6S, sterically preventing MT attachment. The interaction of kinesin motor domains with the MT surface via its tubulin-binding subdomain stimulates nucleotide exchange and kinesin ATPase activity. In contrast, on interaction with KBP, the displacement of helix α4 from the kinesin nucleotide-binding site, together with the absence of MT-mediated ordering of KL9 and KL11, means that its catalytic site is distorted and the structural changes associated with MT-stimulated ATPase cannot occur. This could be an important facet of the role of KBP in the energy economy of the cell in addition to directly blocking kinesin–MT interactions.</p><p>The concave face of TPR-containing α-solenoids commonly serve as a recognition platform for specific peptide motifs, including those forming α-helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perez-Riba and Itzhaki, 2019</xref>). Specificity and affinity for target motifs are determined in part by the shape of the α-solenoid concave face, which in turn is defined by the fold’s supertwist. In addition, particular amino acid arrangements at the concave face contribute to partner-binding affinity and specificity, together with additional interfaces formed at the convex surface or α-solenoid edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeytuni and Zarivach, 2012</xref>). KBP kinesin specificity and affinity are defined by the interaction of its concave face with the large surface area of the kinesin L11–Kα4–KL12–Kα5–KL13 region, in addition to binding the kinesin Kβ5–KL8 region at its α-solenoid edge. Interestingly, distal to the N-terminal MT-binding region of kinesin-1, C-terminally associated kinesin light chain use their unique TPR-containing α-solenoid concave face to select cargos via recognition of specific peptide motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cross and Dodding, 2019</xref>). Therefore, peptide selectivity by TPR-containing α-solenoids is a facet of both kinesin MT-binding and cargo-binding regulatory mechanisms. Such protein–protein interactions may be selectively targeted for disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Randall et al., 2017</xref>), and the insights arising from our work provide future avenues to disrupt KBP–kinesin interactions and thereby explore KBP interactions and regulatory roles.</p><p>The effective and selective kinesin inhibitory mechanism of KBP revealed by our work may fulfil specific roles in the kinesin regulatory toolbox employed by cells to spatially and temporarily orchestrate kinesin activity. Future studies will be aimed at understanding how KBP interacts with kinesins in dimeric and/or autoinhibited forms. For example, while KBP does not interact with some target kinesins in autoinhibited conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malaby et al., 2019</xref>), others that retain a structurally available tubulin-binding subdomain, such as autoinhibited kinesin-3 monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ren et al., 2018</xref>), are feasible binding partners. KBP can bind to constitutively active dimeric kinesin constructs that lack autoinhibitory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malaby et al., 2019</xref>), although the stoichiometry and structural details in this context are unclear. Furthermore, any additional effects of kinesin cargo binding on their susceptibility to KBP inhibition are not well understood. It will also be of key importance to elucidate the mechanisms of KBP activity regulation, for example, by phosphorylation of KBP and/or kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kevenaar et al., 2016</xref>) and KBP acetylation and targeted degradation by the ubiquitin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donato et al., 2017</xref>). Our structural characterisation of the KBP–kinesin inhibitory interaction provides an important mechanistic platform from which to expand our understanding of KBP’s biological roles in neuronal function and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Data were cleaned at this stage by first excluding all micrographs with gCTF resolutions worse than 4.5 Å, as estimated with a custom cross-correlation coefficient cutoff (Python script kindly shared by Radostin Danev), then manually removing micrographs with poor appearance (ice contamination, protein aggregation, or poor GO coverage) in real or reciprocal space.

Good 2D classes were then used as templates to pick the data with Gautomatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</ext-link>).</p><p>For Eman2 neural network picker or Gautomatch-derived particles from each dataset, separate multiple rounds of 2D classification were performed in RELION v3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>), cryoSPARC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>), or cisTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grant et al., 2018</xref>).

For each dataset, these six good 2D class sets for each dataset were then combined and duplicate particles removed. At this stage, for each sample (KBP-alone, KBP–KIF15_MD6S, or KBP–KIF1A_MD) good 2D classes from their constituent datasets were combined.</p><p>KBP–KIF15_MD6S or KBP–KIF1A_MD datasets composed of their respective constituent datasets were easily combined, being from the same microscope and optical set up.

For KBP–KIF15_MD6S data, a single round of 3D classification was performed in RELION v3.0 and the best class selected and auto-refined. For KBP-alone data, 3D classification in RELION v3.1 or cryoSPARC2 did not reveal different 3D structures or improve reconstructions over sorting only in 2D; therefore, particles selected with 2D classification were used as direct input for auto-refinement. The final KBP-alone map was sharpened with a B-factor of −200 to the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 cutoff (4.6 Å).

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kinesin-binding protein (KBP) is an inhibitory regulator of certain kinesin family members. In this manuscript, Atherton et al. use cryo-EM to solve the structure of KBP on its own and in complex with the Kif15 kinesin motor domain. KBP alone forms a TPR-containing α-solenoid, which unfurls to wrap around the Kif15 motor domain in the complex structure. By binding to (and remodeling) the tubulin-binding interface of the kinesin, KBP prevents any interaction between the kinesin and the microtubule, thus explaining the mechanism of inhibition. Mutagenesis experiments validate the mechanism described by the structure, and conservation between KBP-sensitive kinesins is used to describe specificity of KBP binding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim made by the title concerning kinesin selectivity is a bit too bold. Resolving the structure allows the authors to put forward a hypothesis about the mechanism of KBP-selectivity, but this still needs to be tested/validated. Please adjust the title.</p><p>2) It is a bit odd that the authors used Cys-substituted rather than wild-type KIF15 for their study and that they do mention this fact in the Material and methods section only. The authors should disclose this properly in the text (maybe the authors could name their construct something like KIF156S (?) or similar throughout the text, to avoid any misconception) and discuss possible caveats associated with these substitutions. In particular:</p><p>A) Although, many studies of kinesin proteins have used cys-substituted constructs, at least one study (Andreasson et al., 2015) has reported functional differences between a kinesin wild type and the cys-substituted version.</p><p>B) Could the substitutions affect KBP binding? One substitution is in kinesin helix 4 which is in the middle of the KBP binding site.</p><p>C) Could the mutations facilitate the large conformational change observed in KIF15? e.g. by allowing unraveling of the loops connecting the kinesin H4 helix to the rest of the motor domain?</p><p>D) The KIF15 motor domain construct is cys-substituted but the KIF1A construct is not. Could the differences observed between the KIF1A-KBP and KIF15-KBP complexes be partially related to the mutations introduced in the KIF15 motor domain?</p><p>3) The experimental setup of data shown in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 is inconsistent and not well explained (see A-D below). Experiments are not sufficiently controlled (E-H below) and data of main figure and figure supplement is at least partially contradictive (I-J below). The authors need to re-analyse existing data and provide some new data. More detail in the sub-points below.</p><p>A) Figure 5 e.g: How is &quot;transport&quot; defined here? Is transport = some mRFP intensity over threshold within the 5 µm from cell perimeter? Otherwise it is hard to believe that a biological system, which always shows some background activity, produces absolute '0' values in this assay. I would kindly ask the authors to provide a proper definition of &quot;transport&quot; to the reader here.</p><p>B) Figure 5: I assume that the assay has been performed in interphase cells. KIF15 however does not localise to microtubules in interphase cells but rather to actin stress fibres (Buster et al., 2006), presumably by interaction with myosin 2B (Feng et al., 2016). Theoretically, some of the peroxisome behaviour observed here could therefore be actin/myosin dependent as well. This is probably not the case since the myosin 2B interaction was mapped to the KIF15-tail, which is missing here and the motor domain is probably overexpressed, uncoupling it form endogenous targeting/regulation mechanisms. However, to validate the assay in the first place, it should have been tested briefly, whether the KIF15 MD localises to microtubules at all.</p><p>C) Figure 5 D/F: As far as I understand it, the authors define an intensity threshold and quantify the cell area within 7.5 or 5 µm from the cell perimeter that is 'covered' by intensity larger a certain threshold. Why 5 µm in one case and 7.5 µm in the other case? Is thresholding really a good idea here? Given a fixed total-intensity-over-threshold equally distributed along the 5 µm (center to periphery) or with a distribution highly skewed towards the periphery. The skewed distribution would indicate better transport but would cover less area. Would something like fraction from overall intensity (above threshold) in a certain distance from the cell perimeter be more accurate?</p><p>D) Please provide an explanation (e.g. in the legend or methods) for why the quantification thresholds are different for the two kinesins in Figure 5D/F. For Kif15 the periphery is defined as the outer 7.5μm of the cell, but for Kif1A it is 5μm. Does this threshold value affect the interpretation of the results?</p><p>E) Figure 5: KBP inhibits KIF15 motor domains in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The authors kind of 'control' for the KBP expression (subsection “Cell biology image analysis and quantification”: 'Images were acquired of cells that express similar levels of HA-KBP constructs based on immunostaining'), but not for the KIF15/KIF1A-MD levels. KIF15/KIF1A-MD levels might change from mutant to mutant due to different stability in vivo (and from cell to cell, transient expression). Hence, we cannot formally exclude that a drop in peroxisome transport could as well be caused by [c] KBP &gt; [c] KIF15 MD, masking positive (i.e., disruptive) hits or that false positive hits would be created when [c] KIF15 MD &gt; [c] KBP.</p><p>Thus, the authors should please provide a quantification of the KIF15-MD expression, allowing the reader to estimate, whether the KIF15/KBP ratios are the same throughout the experiment. Since the authors selected single cells based on the KBP signal, KIF15-MD quantification should also be done per cell.</p><p>F) Figure 5—figure supplement 1: The authors compared the binding of WT and mutant KBP variants by quantifying the amount of HA-KBP that coprecipitated together with bioGFP-KIF15-MD. The amount is given as &quot;intensity KBP-PD/intensity KBP input&quot; normalised to the WT KBP condition. However, it is not clear whether the PD/Input quotient has been calculated first and then been normalised to WT KBP or if the quotient has been calculated from already normalized values. First case would not be ok, as Input and PD were clearly run and quantified on different gels and are therefore obviously not directly comparable – e.g., the pull-down bands for KBP to L10m in the first panels of (b) and (c) are stronger than their corresponding input bands.</p><p>However, I did a quick quantification (ImageJ) of the blots shown in the left panel of (b) normalising each blot to WT KBP first. Still more protein was pulled down than has been put into the assay in the first place – how can this be? Also. Doing it like this, L12m would not be a positive hit any longer. While trying to quantify the other blots, I recognized that the tonal ranges for the KIF15-MD blots (b, right panel), (c, both panels) and the KBP input blot in (c, left) has massively been pushed to the higher intensities, leaving virtually no background in the lanes above and below the bands. If this happened during figure preparation – please don't do that. If this already happened due to wrong settings during data acquisition in the imager, your quantifications might not have bene accurate.</p><p>I recommend to (re-)run both input and PD sample together on the same gel (there are 26-well gels commercially available). Like this they are treated the same way during western blotting/detection – allowing a more reliable cross comparison.</p><p>G) Figure 5—figure supplement 1: comparing the PD/Input quotient only makes sense, if we assume that KIF15/ KIF1A-MD pulldown occurs from all lysates with the same efficiency and the overall KIF15/KIF1A-MD amount is not limiting KBP pulldown. This, however, is clearly not the case: in (c) lanes L14m, L16m, L18m, L12m+L14m and alphaHP4am the amount of pulled down KIF1A-MD is much less than for the other constructs, while the KBP input in comparison is even higher. Less KIF15/KIF1A-MD in the pulldown fraction might reflect a weaker KIF15/KIF1A-MD expression (mutant stability in vivo, transient transfection), less efficient biotinylation by BirA (transiently transfected as well) in vivo or less efficient pulldown by the streptavidin beads – we just can't tell from these figures. Nevertheless, if just 10% of the total KIF15/KIF1A-MD are pulled down, only 10% of total KBP should be expected to co-precipitate as well.</p><p>Hence, the authors should please show and quantify the KIF15/KIF1A-MD input as well and relate the fraction of co-precipitated KBP with the fraction of pulled down motor domain (i.e., are mutants underperforming regarding their expected pulldown efficiency?).</p><p>I would also like to encourage the authors to verify their positive hits (i.e., L12m, L14m, HP4am, HP4bm and HP5m), by co-precipitating defined amounts of recombinant KBP/KIF-MD proteins to be on the safe side. Since expression was done in bacteria and purification protocols are established this could be done in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>H) In Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, the intensity of the bait (bioGFP-Kif1A_MDC) appears to be significantly lower for the L16m and L18m lanes compared to the other lanes. A lower level of bait could explain the weaker pulldown of HA-KBP in these lanes. The data should be re-quantified to take into account the amount of bait pulled down, or the experiment should be repeated with a consistent level of bait across all lanes (as in Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Since the authors highlight the weaker interaction between the L18m KBP and Kif1A compared to Kif15 in the text, this is an important control to include.</p><p>I) Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1: The L10m and L16m mutation bind KIF15-MD like WT KBP, but fail to inhibit peroxisome transport. If this effect is real (see points above), the authors should please comment on these results, since they are in conflict with their simple binding = inhibition model.</p><p>J) The text doesn't address inconsistencies between the results of the peroxisome assay and the immunoprecipitation. For example, in Figure 5D/E, the mutation to loops 10 and 16 causes the peroxisomes to disperse to the periphery, which indicates that the inhibition of kinesin by KBP is relaxed. However, in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B the interaction between KBP and the kinesin does not appear to be significantly lower (and in the case of L10 is stronger than the control). These results appear to be directly contradictory. Can the authors provide an explanation for this effect?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61481.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The claim made by the title concerning kinesin selectivity is a bit too bold.

ATPase-related text has also been added to the Materials and methods section. While we agree that such protein engineering might alter motor function, this is not a general rule.

Experiments are not sufficiently controlled (E-H below) and data of main figure and figure supplement is at least partially contradictive (I-J below). The authors need to re-analyse existing data and provide some new data.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include more data and data re-analysis as suggested by the reviewer, described in detail below. We have also completely restructured this section of the text to enable clearer cross-comparison of the mutant and motor behaviour in the context of each assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More detail in the sub-points below.</p><p>A) Figure 5 e.g: How is &quot;transport&quot; defined here? Is transport = some mRFP intensity over threshold within the 5 µm from cell perimeter? Otherwise it is hard to believe that a biological system, which always shows some background activity, produces absolute '0' values in this assay. I would kindly ask the authors to provide a proper definition of &quot;transport&quot; to the reader here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Given the word ‘transport’ is often used to describe motor stepping, we suggest ‘translocate’- also used in previous publications describing this assay (e.g. Kapitein et al., 2010; Kevenaar et al., 2016) – is a more appropriate term in the context of the peroxisome assay. We have changed this in the main text of the revised manuscript and rearranged the text to make it clearer what is being measured. In the analysis presented in Figure 5D,E, we performed a qualitative analysis in which we classified cells as either supporting translocation – when peroxisomes relocalise to the periphery – or not – when peroxisomes remained in the cell centre. From this, we calculated the percentage of cells in which translocation of peroxisomes was observed. We have now also added a more detailed description of our approach in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Figure 5: I assume that the assay has been performed in interphase cells. KIF15 however does not localise to microtubules in interphase cells but rather to actin stress fibres (Buster et al., 2006), presumably by interaction with myosin 2B (Feng et al., 2016). Theoretically, some of the peroxisome behaviour observed here could therefore be actin/myosin dependent as well. This is probably not the case since the myosin 2B interaction was mapped to the KIF15-tail, which is missing here and the motor domain is probably overexpressed, uncoupling it form endogenous targeting/regulation mechanisms. However, to validate the assay in the first place, it should have been tested briefly, whether the KIF15 MD localises to microtubules at all.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the peroxisome translocation assay was performed in interphase cells. Although the peroxisome assay was previously used to characterise a range of kinesins including KIF15 (Kevenaar et al., 2016), we have now specifically checked the localisation of our KIF15 construct. To do this, we expressed KIF15_MDC–HA–FRB and PEX3–mRFP–FKBP1 in COS cells, added rapalog to initiate kinesin translocation, fixed and immunostained with an anti-HA antibody to visualize the motor, and either an anti-tubulin antibody to visualise microtubules or phalloidin to visualize F-actin. These data show that KIF15_MDC predominantly localises along microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, top panels), whereas almost no localisation on actin fibres or peripheral actin is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, bottom panels).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>KIF15 localizes on microtubules in the peroxisome motility assay.</title><p>(a, b) Representative images of COS-7 cells expressing KIF15_MDC–HA–FRB and PEX–mRFP–FKBP treated with rapalog for three hours and co-stained for (a) microtubules (rabbit anti-α-tubulin, 1:1000, Abcam) or (b) F-actin (Phalloidin Alexa647, 1:40, Life technologies).

Does this threshold value affect the interpretation of the results?</p></disp-quote><p>We used different threshold values and defined different peripheral areas for the two kinesins KIF1A and KIF15 in quantification of the peroxisome assay because we observed that translocation of the peroxisomes by KIF15 into the periphery is less efficient within the three-hour timeframe of rapalog treatment. This is probably due to differences in KIF1A and KIF15 motor activity such that it takes longer for KIF15 to translocate a similar number of peroxisomes to the periphery compared to KIF1A. To capture the activity of KIF15 on peroxisome translocation, we adjusted the threshold intensity and defined a slightly larger peripheral area. In the revised manuscript, we have explained this thresholding and analysis approach in the relevant parts of the Results and Materials and methods. We have now also included images of peroxisome positioning in KIF1A_MDC-transfected cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 3) to allow direct comparison with the KIF15 examples already included in Figure 5C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) Figure 5: KBP inhibits KIF15 motor domains in a 1:1 stoichiometry.

When multiple constructs are transiently transfected, the relative expression levels of each construct does differ from cell to cell. Therefore, it is very likely that the selected cells express slightly different levels of motor constructs, as well as levels of PEX. Controlling for the precise expression levels of all three constructs on a cell to cell basis, would be very time-consuming, labour intensive and never perfect. We believe that the best way to control for such different expression levels is to analyse multiple cells from different experiments, which is why our analysis includes 28-35 cells per condition from two independent experiments. We agree with the reviewer that, in principle, the expression and activity of KIF15 and KIF1A motors may change from mutant to mutant due to different KBP stability. However, when we express different KBP mutants, we do not observe a major difference in the expression pattern or localization of the mutants compared to WT KBP, and have now provided additional data to demonstrate this (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Therefore, we do not think that variable expression of KBP mutants will differentially affect motor expression, and conclude rather that the output of the assay reflects the KBP-motor interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) Figure 5—figure supplement 1: The authors compared the binding of WT and mutant KBP variants by quantifying the amount of HA-KBP that coprecipitated together with bioGFP-KIF15-MD.

Less KIF15/KIF1A-MD in the pulldown fraction might reflect a weaker KIF15/KIF1A-MD expression (mutant stability in vivo, transient transfection), less efficient biotinylation by BirA (transiently transfected as well) in vivo or less efficient pulldown by the streptavidin beads – we just can't tell from these figures.

In order to address these concerns, we have re-run all the Western blots so that input and pull-down fractions are on the same gel to allow a more reliable cross comparison between conditions. In addition, we have changed the quantification method such that we now incorporate the amount of kinesin in the pull-down fraction in the calculation, since this affects the amount of KBP that can be pulled down. Thus, we now first quantify the intensity of KBP in the pull-down fraction divided by the intensity of KBP in the input fraction. This ratio is then divided by the intensity of the kinesin in the pull-down fraction and the obtained values are normalized to the KBP control. We emphasise that these intensity calculations were performed on raw data. On the images shown in the figure the contrast has been pushed up to generate clear images that are easy to interpret by the reader.

Our western blot data show that L18m binds to both KIF1A_MDC as well as KIF15_MDC. This contradicts our results from the peroxisome assay, which indicates binding of L18m to KIF15, but not KIF1A. However, in our peroxisome assay with KIF1A we do observe that fewer cells have peroxisome translocation when L18m is expressed compared to control, suggesting that L18m may also has a weak binding to KIF1A.

However, in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B the interaction between KBP and the kinesin does not appear to be significantly lower (and in the case of L10 is stronger than the control). These results appear to be directly contradictory. Can the authors provide an explanation for this effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not properly addressing the examples of inconsistencies between the peroxisome assay and pull-down data in the previous version of our manuscript. The reanalysis of our data that we have undertaken highlights a general trend that the kinesin–KBP interaction is more susceptible to disruption in the context of the translocation assays compared to the pull-down assays. These presumably arise from the differences between cellular experiments and biochemical assays, which could lead to different outcomes when we look at binding properties of proteins. For example, this could be a function of the FRB–FKBP-mediated motor dimerization or might also reflect the fact that cellular MTs in the translocation assay can directly compete with KBP for kinesin binding. We have described these differences more clearly as part of the text restructuring mentioned above (subsection “KBP binds kinesin motor domains via conserved motifs in the α-solenoid edge loops and α-helices at the concave face”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
