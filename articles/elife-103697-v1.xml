Spatial genome organization plays a crucial role in oncogenic transformation and progression, but the extent to which chromosome architecture contributes to organ-specific metastatic traits is unclear. This work characterizes chromosome architecture changes associated with organotropic metastatic traits. By comparing a collection of human genomic data from different subtypes of localized and lung metastatic breast cancer cells with both normal and cancerous lung cells, we find important trends of genomic reorganization. The most striking differences in 3D genome compartments segregate cell types according to their epithelial vs. mesenchymal status. This epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) compartment signature occurs at genomic regions distinct from transcription-defined EMT signatures, suggesting a separate layer of regulation. Specifically querying organotropism, we find 3D genome changes consistent with adaptations needed to survive in a new microenvironment, with lung metastatic breast cancer cells exhibiting compartment switch signatures that shift the genome architecture to a lung cell-like conformation and brain metastatic prostate cancer cells showing compartment shifts toward a brain-like state. TCGA patient data reveals gene expression changes concordant with these organ-permissive compartment changes. These results suggest that genome architecture provides an additional level of cell fate specification informing organotropism and enabling survival at the metastatic site.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nearly all cancers have the potential to spread to other parts of the body. Their ability to metastasize via tissues and blood or lymph vessels depends on several factors, such as the type, size, and location of the primary tumor. But metastasis is not a random process, and tumor cells often exhibit a preference for colonizing specific organs – a phenomenon also known as organotropism<italic>.</italic> In the case of breast cancer, these preferred sites are the lungs, liver, brain, and bones.</p><p>The mechanisms by which cells survive in a new, drastically different tissue environment remain poorly understood. One theory is that the structure of chromosomes inside cells, which plays a determining role in cell function and identity, may explain how tumors adapt to different tissues.</p><p>Das et al. used a new genome-folding-centric approach to find out why breast cancer metastasizes to certain organs, such as the lung. The researchers analyzed genome compartmentalization data of various human cancer cell lines, including breast cells (both localized cancer and lung-metastatic cancer cells) and lung cells (healthy and cancerous ones).</p><p>The results showed that the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA within the cell nucleus might play a role in a tumor’s metastatic behavior. One aspect of genome structure is that the way in which long DNA strands are packed and folded inside the human nucleus is not random. Chromosome regions are spatially separated into two compartments: one active, containing genes that are available to be transcribed or used, and another inactive, where genes are tightly packed and silent. As cancer cells become invasive and enter a migratory state, specific parts of the genome switch between these compartments. This spatial reorganization influences gene accessibility and impacts the preference for metastatic sites. The most significant finding is that lung-metastatic breast cancer cells acquire a genome architecture that structurally resembles features of normal lung cells. Further, these changes in compartment identity are not always accompanied by increases in gene transcription. The study by Das et al. contributes to a broader understanding of how the three-dimensional genome may contribute to metastatic transformation of cancerous cells and their ability to colonize distant sites. It also highlights that certain genome compartmentalization signatures might be used as a prognostic biomarker. However, significant work in translational and clinical research would be required before these benefits could be realized. The next critical step is to validate these genome changes and their role in organotropism in patient-derived samples. Further studies are also needed to identify the specific mechanisms that regulate and control the compartment switches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>3D genome</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>organotropism</kwd><kwd>chromosome compartmentalization</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04q48ey07</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCord</surname><given-names>Rachel Patton</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02e463172</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>134060-PF-19-183-01-CSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>San Martin</surname><given-names>Rebeca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04q48ey07</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM149531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Tian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromosome compartment analysis of a cancer cell line cohort reveals different subsets of compartment changes where some track epithelial to mesenchymal transition while others reflect secondary metastatic organ-specific reorganizations.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the leading malignant disease in women worldwide. It is highly heterogeneous; based on molecular characteristics, it can be divided into four broad subgroups: luminal A (estrogen receptor ER+ progesterone receptor PR+/− human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2−), luminal B (ER+ PR+/− HER2+), HER2-enriched (ER− PR− HER2+), and triple-negative/basal (ER− PR− HER2−) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fragomeni et al., 2018</xref>). About 20–30% of early-stage breast cancer patients have a chance to ultimately develop distant metastasis, which accounts for 90% of all breast cancer-related deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaffer and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Overall, metastasis implies the dissemination of cancer cells from the primary tumor site into the circulation and later extravasation to a new site which leads to the formation of a secondary tumor. However, the organs affected by breast cancer metastasis vary remarkably, depending on the disease subtype, molecular features, primary tumor location, and secondary site microenvironment. This phenomenon is known as ‘metastasis organotropism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). For example, breast cancer cells can metastasize to the bone, lung, liver, and brain. However, bone metastasis accounts for a major percentage of metastatic cases compared to other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Savci-Heijink et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, luminal A and basal subtypes of breast cancer show a higher incidence of bone and lung metastasis, respectively, whereas luminal B preferentially metastasizes to both organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smid et al., 2008</xref>). Organotropic behavior is congruent with the ‘seed and soil’ hypothesis, according to which a cancer cell (seed) having specific intrinsic abilities will only be able to survive in a host local microenvironment (soil) that is favorable to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langley and Fidler, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Secondary organ colonization by circulating tumor cells is a complex process, ruled by dynamic and evolving interactions between cancer cells and the host microenvironment. In most situations, the microenvironment is unfavorable, and the disseminated cells fail to survive in that ‘soil’. Despite the low survival rate of cancer cells during the metastatic colonization process, cells with the intrinsic capabilities to interact with the host microenvironment can survive and proliferate in the secondary site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obenauf and Massagué, 2015</xref>). Alternatively, cells might arrive at the secondary site and remain dormant under the influence of the local microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taichman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shiozawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalla et al., 2023</xref>) slowly acquiring characteristics that would later allow their proliferation. Importantly, the microenvironment surrounding primary breast tumors seems to condition the cells to specific metastatic profiles. For example, if the primary tumor stroma is enriched in transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), lung metastasis prevails through the induction of angiopoietin-like 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padua et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, a tumor stroma enriched with mesenchymal cytokines like C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) predisposes primary cancer cell population to home into the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). How these different reactive microenvironments condition the origin of specific metastatic traits still poses an outstanding question.</p><p>The current view in the cancer biology field is that transcriptional gene signatures associated with organ-specific metastatic traits are regulated in part by cues from the reactive microenvironment that accompanies primary tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padua et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sceneay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). However, whether regulating those genes involves changes in 3D genome organization is still an open question. Recent advancements in imaging and molecular biology techniques have shown that the genome organizes in a non-random multi-layered fashion inside the nucleus, and each layer of organization contributes both independently and synergistically to gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCord et al., 2020</xref>). At a large scale, the reorganization of genome compartments, in which euchromatic and heterochromatic genomic regions are spatially segregated, is also found to be associated with cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achinger-Kawecka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">San Martin et al., 2022</xref>). It has been shown that as breast cancer becomes endocrine-resistant, the change in compartment organization is accompanied by gene expression changes and differential estrogen receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achinger-Kawecka et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies have also found that an unintended consequence of various drug treatments and therapies is the rearrangement of chromatin architecture at different levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achinger-Kawecka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barutcu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Though these types of studies are essential for elucidating the association between the reorganization of the genome in three dimensions and oncogenic transformation, they do not consider the genome organization changes experienced by the metastatic cell that occur as a result of the interaction with the microenvironment of the secondary site. Genome spatial compartmentalization is strongly associated with cell type definition: genomic regions segregated into the A (euchromatic) or B (heterochromatic) compartments differ among cell types and tissue origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2024</xref>). These compartmentalization profiles help encode stable cell fate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Owen et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that similar to gene expression, metastatic cancer cells experience 3D genome structure rearrangements that mimic the compartment signatures of their new host microenvironment. To test this hypothesis, here we focused on the breast cancer–lung metastasis system. We compared genome organization data from different types of breast epithelial cell lines (normal, localized cancer, and metastatic) with normal and cancerous lung cells. Our analysis revealed that metastatic breast cancer cells have a higher proportion of lung-specific spatial compartment changes than localized breast cancer cells. We find similar brain microenvironment-specific compartment changes in prostate cancer cells that have the potential to metastasize to the brain. These distal-site concordant compartment shifts often correspond to changes in gene expression in both cell lines and TCGA patient samples. However, we find that 3D genome changes do not always correlate with gene expression changes. Instead, particularly across the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) spectrum, we find a set of genes that change expression without needing spatial reorganization and then a distinct set of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotype genes that change their spatial compartment without altered gene expression. We hypothesize that spatial genome organization facilitates immediate changes in gene expression in certain loci but can also poise certain regions for future activation in a way that favors EMT and adaptation to metastatic organ microenvironments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modeling the breast cancer lung metastasis system</title><p>To investigate whether breast cancer spatial genome organization showed rearrangements specific to a distant organ metastatic microenvironment, we needed to assemble genome spatial compartment data from different types of normal and cancerous cells for both breast and a secondary organ. Since most breast cancer subtypes show a preference for lung metastasis, we first focused on this metastatic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2022</xref>). We selected a cohort of breast and lung cell lines, both normal and cancerous, for which publicly available genome organization (Hi-C) is available (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A total of 15 cell lines with available data, including primary cells and cancer cell lines from both organs, were selected. A classification of the cells used in this study based on their malignancy status and other molecular signatures is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. Briefly, for the breast cancer system, we considered both HMEC and MCF10A as normal (non-tumorigenic) breast epithelial cells and placed them at the starting node of the model. Cancer cell lines were then divided into three subcategories based on breast cancer molecular signatures: luminal (ZR751, BT474, ZR7530, MCF7, and T47D), HER2-enriched (HCC1954 and SKBR3), and triple-negative (HCC70, BT549, and MDA-MB-231). We then assigned cell lines to ‘localized’ or ‘metastatic’ status based on the site from which they were originally collected in the patient (see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel and Young, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gazdar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone et al., 1978</xref>). Specifically, within the luminal subtype, ZR751 and BT474 were designated as localized cancers, and the remaining three cell lines, ZR7530, MCF7, and T47D, were used as models for ascites, lung, and lung metastatic breast cancers, respectively. Similarly, for the HER2-enriched subcategory, HCC1954 and SKBR3 were considered localized and lung metastatic cancers, respectively. Finally, in the case of the triple-negative subtype, HCC70 and BT549 were used to model localized cancer whereas MDA-MB-231 represents lung metastatic cancer. For the lung portion of the system, HTBE primary cells represent normal lung epithelium, and both the A549 and H460 cell lines represent localized lung cancer. The valuable MetMap study in mouse has measured the organs that can be colonized by human-derived cancer cell lines when they are injected into mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). The cell lines we consider here may have different or additional ‘potential’ metastatic sites in this type of mouse model. But, it is known that species differences can lead to divergent organotropism in mouse models as compared to human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">San Martin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simons et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we use the site of collection as compared to the site of origin in the human patient as our reference point for primary and secondary site organs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial compartment identity segregates cells by subtype and epithelial–mesenchymal status.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Primary cells and cell lines used in this study are arranged depending on their molecular subtypes and malignancy status based on prior available characteristics.

Compartment identity strengths were calculated using eigenvector decomposition on the 250 kb binned Hi-C data for each cell line (Methods). In this analysis, a positive value signifies a euchromatic A compartment region, while a negative value represents a heterochromatic B compartment association.</p><p>When we applied hierarchical clustering on the genome-wide compartment data, we observed a grouping of cells that was congruent with the cell ordering constructed based on molecular and clinical features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). For example, all the normal cell types, including both the breast and lung systems, were clustered together. Similarly, cells from the luminal subtype and the lung carcinoma cells were grouped in their respective clusters. However, we also observed a few interesting exceptions from the clustering result. MDA-MB-231, a breast cancer cell line isolated from lung pleural effusion, was grouped with the lung carcinoma cell lines, suggesting its compartment organization shares more features with lung cancer than do other breast cancer cell lines. We also found that HCC70 and HCC1954, which were both derived from localized cancer, clustered relatively close to the normal epithelial cells. Collectively, this unsupervised analysis shows that the different subtypes of cancer exhibit distinctive 3D genome organization features at the compartment level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), as previous studies suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the genome-wide compartment data revealed similar trends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Interestingly, the ordering of cell types along the first principal component (PC1) captured a transition between epithelial and mesenchymal-like cells. Cells characterized as highly epithelial were found on the left extreme of the PC1 axis, and as we move toward the right along PC1, the cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. For example, MDA-MB-231 cells are derived from healthy cells of epithelial origin but have undergone an EMT and show a mesenchymal-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charafe-Jauffret et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin, 2011</xref>). In our Hi-C principal components analysis, this cell line has a highly positive PC1 value. In contrast, MCF7 cells maintain a more epithelial morphology and are found at the opposite end of the PC1 spectrum from MDA-MB-231. The organization of cell lines along PC1 from spatial compartmentalization matches quite well with the previously characterized epithelial–mesenchymal classification of these cell lines based on transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). We noticed that the PC2 axis tends to segregate cell lines according to the presence or absence of HER2. As expected for an unsupervised analysis like PCA in a complex system, the separation is not perfect, as HER2-negative cell lines like MCF7 are plotted near HER2-positive cells. But the trend of separation suggests that in breast cancer cell lines, the presence or absence of this receptor and its downstream signaling network has important effects on the genome organization at the compartment scale. To further characterize the genomic regions that showed distinctive compartment signatures across cell lines, we extracted lists of all genes that fell into genomic bins with the 200 most extreme eigenvector loadings for PC1: 100 strongest positive and 100 strongest negative bins. Gene ontology enrichment results for these gene lists coincide with the idea that PC1 represents the EMT axis: PC1 positive genes have functions related to cell adhesion (tenascin C, JAG1, ACTA2), extracellular matrix organization (APP, LAMA2, FGF2, BMP4) and positive regulation of cell migration, consistent with a mesenchymal phenotype, while PC1 negative genes show GO terms related to epithelial maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) Overall, our analyses show that the genome organization is not only able to distinguish different subtypes of cancers but also exhibits changes along the EMT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Breast cancer transcriptome profiles also exhibit epithelial–mesenchymal state-based segregation</title><p>We next analyzed the gene expression signatures that emerged across different subtypes of breast cancer (data sources described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and compared those with the patterns obtained from the compartmental analysis. We first performed PCA on the transcriptome profile of all the breast and lung system cells considered in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). From the low-dimensional PC projection result, we observed that similar breast cancer subtype cells distribute in the PC space based on their transcriptome profile. As in the compartment signature, MDA-MB-231 cells localize close to lung cancer cells A549 and H460, suggesting that this lung metastatic cell line has transcriptional similarities to lung cancer. We also noticed that along the largest PC axis (PC1), cells are ordered based on their EMT state. Performing GO term enrichment analysis using the genes from the regions with the top 100 most positive and 100 most negative eigenvector loadings for this PC1, we find that genes associated with PC1 positive values relate to epithelial organization, differentiation, and negative regulation of cell migration, denoting a more epithelial phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast, PC1 negative genes relate to the mesenchymal functions with enriched terms for wound healing, hemostasis, cell movement, and ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

Given that spatial compartmentalization is often correlated with gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2024</xref>), a simple possible explanation for the EMT segregation of cells by compartment signatures could be that genes which change expression also change compartment. An alternative hypothesis would be that transcription and 3D genome organization change represent two independent aspects of the EMT transition. To evaluate these possibilities, we compared the genes obtained from the compartmental PCA analysis, the transcriptome PCA analysis, and the curated epithelial–mesenchymal gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, gene lists found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found that the genes in regions that change spatial compartmentalization have very little overlap with the sets of genes that most varied in transcription across these cell lines or were curated as differently expressed EMT genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To further investigate this result, we examined the transcription status of genes that changed compartment across the EMT spectrum and, conversely, the compartment status of genes that changed transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>). As expected, hierarchical clustering of the detected highly varying compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, top) and highly varying transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d</xref>, bottom) resulted in clear segregation of the cell types into similar groupings (i.e., HMEC and MCF10A together, BT474 and SKBR3 together with an opposing pattern). But the genes which strongly changed compartments between cell lines showed no consistent patterns of correlated expression change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, bottom). Likewise, very few compartment differences existed across cell lines at genes whose transcription segregated cells by EMT status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d</xref>, top). Notably, for both the transcriptome PCA analysis and the curated EMT gene set, the majority of the differentially expressed genes are found in the active A compartment. Overall, our results favor the hypothesis that compartmentalization and gene expression signatures are capturing two independent factors in EMT transition. The genes that differ most in expression across these cell lines are largely already accessible (A compartment) and therefore their expression is likely not controlled by spatial compartmentalization. Meanwhile, the additional EMT relevant genes that change compartment, but not transcription, may be now spatially poised for future gene regulation given additional environmental cues, as has been shown in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leemans et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honda et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, the set of genes that changes compartments does not have as clear epithelial and mesenchymal functional enrichment as the transcription change set of genes (as shown by the analysis of these gene sets presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2b</xref>). This could indicate that some of the compartment changes that occur with EMT are not directly gene regulatory but rather enable an overall conformational change of the chromatin that is needed for the alterations in physical cell state or to accomplish long-distance gene regulation changes. Indeed, we observe specific cases where a compartment change region is located near but not at a gene expression change region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). For example, TFF3 is in the set of genes that decreases in expression in M vs. E type breast cancer cell lines. While the gene itself remains in the A compartment in most all cell types, it lies near several regions that switch from A to B in M vs. E type cancer cell lines. Therefore, some of the discordant gene expression and compartment change regions may reflect the impact of compartment shifts on gene expression in neighboring regions. Notably, this same genomic region on chr21 showed striking compartment switches with cancer progression in prostate cancer as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">San Martin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Transcription and compartment changes capture distinct sets of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genomic regions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overlap analysis of the genes obtained from the compartmental analysis PC1 (red, same genes analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), the transcriptome analysis PC1 (green, same genes analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), and a curated breast cancer epithelial–mesenchymal gene set (blue).

We hypothesized that for that to happen, the genome organization of the metastatic cell should change to resemble that of the cells at the secondary site, as a prelude to transcriptional activation. To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared the 3D genome organization of the metastatic and localized breast cancer cells with lung epithelial vs. lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, b</xref>). As a baseline, we first compared the breast cancer compartment identity data with that of the normal breast epithelial cells. For each comparison, this resulted in four possible compartment identity combinations: AA (A compartment in both normal breast and breast cancer), AB (A compartment in normal breast and B compartment in breast cancer), BA (B compartment in normal breast and A compartment in breast cancer), and BB (B compartment in both normal breast and breast cancer). Similarly, the compartment identity of lung cancer cell lines was also compared with that of the normal lung cell. We then performed a cross-comparison between the breast and lung cancer comparisons, leading to a total of 16 compartment identity combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Of these, we were particularly interested in cases where the compartment state of healthy breast epithelial cells consistently differed from lung. It is notable that this set is relatively small to begin with (on the order of 200 250-kb bins), which emphasizes the overall similarities between epithelial cell types, whether they come from breast and lung. But for these regions that differ between healthy breast and lung, we next asked whether the breast cancer compartment would retain its breast identity or switch to match lung. In all the breast cancer cell lines derived from lung metastases, we found that more than half of these genomic regions switched compartments to match the lung compartment state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We term these switches that make the breast cancer cell compartment identity more like the lung as ‘lung-permissive genome organization changes’. They include: AB_BB (genomic regions which are in the B compartment in both normal lung and localized lung cancer, and which change from A to B in the transition from normal breast to breast cancer) and BA_AA (genomic regions which switch from B to A in breast cancer compared to normal breast epithelium, and which are in the A compartment in both normal lung and lung cancer). These combinations allow us to distinguish changes that could foster lung-specific survival changes from cancer-specific traits such as AB_AB and BA_BA (compartments that change in the same direction from normal to cancer cells in both breast and lung). We then evaluated whether lung-permissive 3D genome changes occurred more frequently in lung metastatic breast cancer than in localized breast cancer.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Breast cancer cells that metastasize to the lung show increased lung-permissive compartment changes with concordant gene expression alteration in patients.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Normal breast epithelium (HMEC and MCF10A), localized breast cancer (BT474, HCC1954, and BT549), and lung metastatic breast cancer (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3, and MDA-MB-231) cells are used to model different stages of breast cancer progression.

We found that in general, the gene expression levels change concordantly with the compartment. The results show that for the regions exhibiting lung-permissive changes, the switch in compartmental identity is associated with the gene expression change from normal to tumor.

Breast cancer can metastasize to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoneda et al., 2001</xref>), but the specific metastatic cell lines for which we have data were not derived from brain metastases. Therefore, we would expect fewer ‘brain-like’ compartment changes in metastatic breast cancer that metastasizes to lung. Before comparing percent permissive changes between organs, we developed an adjusted version of the calculation to account for differing baseline probabilities of compartment change at the distant organ site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and Methods). The adjusted calculation still results in a higher level of lung-permissive changes in lung metastatic breast cancer cell lines as compared to localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2d</xref>).

Next, we asked whether a cancer type that metastasizes to the brain exhibits brain-permissive compartment changes. For this purpose, we chose prostate cancer cell lines derived from localized (lymph node) and brain metastatic sites (LNCaP and DU145) and compared their genome architecture to the non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cell line RWPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a, b</xref>). We found that the brain metastatic cells showed more brain-permissive changes than the one derived from a lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3c</xref>).

This confirms that a cancer type that metastasized to the brain matched the brain genome compartmentalization profile more often than a cancer type that had not metastasized to the brain.

This phenomenon, also shown by other types of cancer, may be explained, to some extent, by the ‘seed and soil’ hypothesis which states that cancer cells will be able to colonize a distant site if the cells have intrinsic ability to survive in the microenvironment of the secondary site. Though the process of metastasis is complex and involves other factors, the primary tumor microenvironment conveys survival capabilities to cancer cells that can potentially favor survival in other organs; for this to occur, the cancer cell must engage specific gene expression signatures. However, there are many open questions related to the rise of organ-specific survival traits. Are these gene signatures a result or consequence of genome organization changes? What is the role of genome rearrangements in metastasis organotropism for which there are no significant gene expression alterations? Does the genome organization of the metastatic cell become similar to that of the cells at the distant site? In this work, we have made a step toward answering these questions by analyzing compartmental organization data of breast cancer cell lines derived from lung metastasis in comparison to lung cell lines.</p><p>Unsupervised clustering of compartment organization data showed that compartment organization can distinguish cancer cell lines by subtype, providing the first indication that lung metastatic cell lines may show similarities to lung cell genome organization. For example, the triple-negative invasive metastatic breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 clusters close to the lung carcinoma cells (A549 and H460). The clustering result supports the conclusion that the breast cancer subtypes are not only quite different at the gene expression level, but also at the level of genome organization. Furthermore, it also shows that the genome organization is highly consistent among luminal subtype cancers, irrespective of the tissue from which the cells were collected, while the other subtypes, such as triple-negative, were more heterogeneous in their structure. This is congruent with studies involving gene expression which have shown that the triple-negative breast cancer category is highly heterogeneous, encompassing six subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>When we compared the compartmental organization changes shown by the localized and lung metastatic breast cancers to the compartment state of the lung, we found that, for luminal and triple-negative subtypes, metastatic cells exhibit higher percentages of lung-permissive changes compared to localized cancers. Given that these cancer cell lines were derived from lung pleural effusions, we cannot tell whether these metastatic cells acquired a lung-like compartmental organization at the primary tumor site or later while adapting to the metastatic site. To answer this, we would need temporal genome organization data of metastatic progression, which is not currently available. Our current study is also limited by the use of cell lines derived from multiple different patient sources and grown in culture. To validate and clarify our observations, future research would need to analyze the 3D genome structure of matched primary and metastatic tumors from the same human patient.</p><p>For the lung-permissive chromatin conformation changes, we find that shifts toward the A compartment are favored compared to the B compartment. It may be possible that shifts toward the A compartment are predominant because both activation and gene repression are possible once a region is in the A compartment, while a shift to the B compartment is not necessary to accomplish gene repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hakim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vieux-Rochas et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, this preference for shifts toward an A compartment could also be related to the general loss of heterochromatin previously observed in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carone and Lawrence, 2013</xref>). Indeed, we found that genes in these spatially reorganized regions, in patient samples, tend to change expression concordantly with their compartment changes. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that genome compartmentalization can play a role in facilitating organ-specific metastasis.</p><p>While our gene expression and compartment analyses echo the current dogma that 3D genome compartments correlate with gene expression changes, further analysis revealed that gene expression and compartment signatures across breast cancer types surprisingly capture two orthogonal sets of genomic regions. We found that compartment profiles group breast cancer cell lines according to their epithelial vs. mesenchymal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Amato et al., 2012</xref>). This observation becomes much more visible in the PCA transformed data as the cells are arranged along an epithelial–mesenchymal spectrum. Pathways of EMT such as the loss of epithelial identity and the gain of migratory ability can play important roles in facilitating metastasis, though it is important to note that EMT is only one of many complex processes involved in metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celià-Terrassa and Kang, 2024</xref>). While epithelial vs. mesenchymal states have been clearly associated with gene expression, it is also becoming clear that these states exhibit characteristic genome architectures as well. Indeed, a recent study shows that genome organization changes during EMT in ovarian cancer systems, by considering some representative epithelial and mesenchymal cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pang et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we extend this conclusion for another major cancer, the breast cancer system, by including a spectrum of breast and lung cancer and normal cell lines. Across this cohort, we find not only that both 3D genome architecture and gene expression changes occur during EMT, but also that these changes happen in different regions. The 3D genome changes that most strongly capture the differences across the epithelial and mesenchymal spectrum occur at regions where gene expression is not notably distinct between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Likewise, the signature gene expression changes occur in regions that tend to be in the A compartment across all cell types. This suggests that many genes key to EMT are regulated by local factors in the A compartment, while major spatial shifts in chromosome regions may alter long-distance regulation of genes in other regions, change the likelihood of future inducibility of genes, or represent alterations in the physical/mechanical properties of the cell during EMT, which can affect chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scott et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that genome spatial compartment changes can help encode cancer cell states that may play a role in metastasis as well as enabling survival in a new organ context.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Hi-C data processing</title><p>To process Hi-C sequencing reads, we used the HiC-Pro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro">https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Servant, 2022</xref>) pipeline with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Servant et al., 2015</xref>). The reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome. Also, for each cell type, all the available reads from all replicates were merged together to improve the quality of contact data for further downstream processing. After obtaining the valid pair interactions, we binned the interactions at 250 kb resolution for each individual chromosome and normalized the matrices using the ICE technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imakaev et al., 2012</xref>). Following that, the number of normalized contacts of each chromosome was scaled to 1M using ‘scaleMatrix.pl’ script from the cworld-dekker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dekkerlab/cworld-dekker">https://github.com/dekkerlab/cworld-dekker</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lajoie, 2019</xref>) tool suite. And finally, in order to get the compartmental organization for each individual chromosome, principal components analysis was performed on the normalized and scaled matrices using the ‘matrix2compartment.pl’ script from the cworld-dekker tool suite. The compartment analysis assigns A/B compartment identity to genomic regions based on the sign of the elements of the eigenvector (A-positive and B-negative).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA-seq data processing</title><p>The RNA-seq files were processed as per the steps described in the previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2023</xref>).

To eliminate the bias, for the secondary organ systems, we first calculate the probability of a genomic region to be in a specific compartment in localized cancer given that the region belongs to the same compartment in normal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the A compartment, p(TA|NA) represents the probability of a region in the A compartment in localized cancer cells given that the region also belongs to the A compartment in normal cells. Similarly, p(TB|NB) for the B compartment. If we have more than one cell line representing the secondary site localized cancer, the minimum probability across all the cells is considered. Once we have those, the probabilities are subtracted from one and the resultant values are multiplied with corresponding secondary organ-specific percentages. For example, (1 − p(TA|NA)) is multiplied to the percentage of BA_AA and (1 − p(TB|NB)) to the AB_BB.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Classifications of cell line models used and sources of all publicly available Hi-C and RNA-seq data used in the analyses.</title><p>Information about cell lines derived from the following sources: ATCC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel and Young, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gazdar et al., 1998</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cellosaurus.org/">Cellosaurus.org</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2021</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone et al., 1978</xref>.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-103697-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Lists of genes obtained from compartmental PCA, transcriptomics PCA, and curated epithelial–mesenchymal gene set.</title><p>Compartmental_PC1_Positive: genes found within the top 100 highly varying genomic regions in compartmental PCA analysis (positive PC1); Compartmental_PC1_Negative: genes found within the top 100 highly varying genomic regions in compartmental PCA analysis (negative PC1); RNAseq_PC1_Positive: top 100 highly varying genes in transcriptomics PCA analysis (positive PC1); RNAseq_PC1_Negative: top 100 highly varying genes in transcriptomics PCA analysis (negative PC1); Curated_Epithelial: curated epithelial genes; Curated_Mesenchymal: curated mesenchymal genes.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-103697-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-103697-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Datasets used for this project were obtained from NCBI GEO, EMBL ENA, 4DN Data Portal, and ENCODE repositories and their accession IDs are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The authors focused on lung metastasis and included several controls as the comparison including normal mammary lines, normal lung epithelial lines, and lung cancer cell lines. Due to the lower resolution at 250KB binning size, the authors only addressed the compartments (A for active compartment and B for inactive compartment) not the other 3D organization of the genome. They started by performing clustering and PCA analysis for the compartment identity and discovered that this panel of cell lines could be well separated based on Her2 and epithelial-mesenchymal features according to the compartment identity. While correlating with the transcriptomic changes, the authors noticed the existence of concordance and divergence between the compartment changes and transcriptomic changes. The authors then switched gear to tackle the core question in metastatic organotropism to the lung. They discovered a set of &quot;lung permissive compartment changes&quot; and concluded that &quot;lung metastatic breast cancer cell lines acquire lung-like genome architecture&quot; and &quot;organotropic 3D genome changes match target organ more than an unrelated organ&quot;.

The authors succeeded in the assembly of a comprehensive panel of breast cancer cell lines and the aggregation of the 3D genome structure data to conduct a hypothesis-driven computation analysis.

The authors did well in the citation of relevant references in 3D genome organization and EMT.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors should clearly indicate how they determine the patterns of spread of the breast cancer cell lines being utilized in this manuscript. How did the authors arrive at the conclusion that certain cell lines would be determined as &quot;localized spread&quot; and &quot;metastatic tropism to the lung&quot;? This definition is crucial, and I will explain why.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed a critical point to clearly define and explain what qualifies as metastatic potential to particular organs in our system. Here, we intentionally limited our scope to metastasis that had occurred within the human system. Our cell lines are chosen based on their sites of origin and etiological history in the patients from which they were derived. For example, the cancer cell line BT474 was classified as “localized” because these cells were derived from a solid tumor in the breast itself. Meanwhile, MCF7 and T47D cell lines are considered lung metastatic because these cells were collected from the pleural effusion from the lung. We therefore model human organotropism from the breast to the lung by using cells that originated from infiltrative ductal carcinoma (human breast) but were collected from pleural effusions (human lung). We then use as a comparison a human lung cancer-derived cell line that was itself purified from a pleural effusion. In this way, we can compare the genome structure of a lung cancer cell in the lung environment to a breast cancer cell that has metastasized to the lung environment.</p><p>In our revised version, we further clarify this definition in the text as well as in additional annotations in our supplemental table of all cell line information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Todd Golub's team from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard published &quot;A metastasis map of human cancer cell lines&quot; to exhaustively create a first-generation metastasis map (MetMap) that reveals organspecific patterns of metastasis. (By the way, this work was not cited in the reference in this manuscript.) The MetMap Explorer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org/metmap/vis-app/index.html">https://depmap.org/metmap/vis-app/index.html</ext-link>) is a public resource that could be openly accessed to visualize the metastatic potential of each cell line as determined by the in vivo barcoding approach as described in the MetMap paper in the format of petal plots. 5 organs were tested in the MetMap paper, including brain, lung, liver, kidney, and bone. The authors would discover that some of the organ-specific metastasis patterns defined in the MetMap Explorer would be different from the authors' classification. For example, the authors defined MCF7 as a line as lung metastatic, and rightly so the MetMap charted a signal towards lung with low penetrance and low metastatic potential. The authors defined ZR751 as a line with localized spread, however, the MetMap charted a signal towards the kidney with low penetrance and low metastatic potential, the signal strength similar to the lung metastasis in MCF7. A similar argument could be made for T47D. The TNBC line MDA-MB-231 is indeed highly metastatic, however, in MetMap data, its metastasis is not only specific to the lung but towards all 5 organs with high penetrance and metastatic potential. The 2 lung cancer cell lines mentioned in this study, A549 and H460, the authors defined them as localized spread to the lung. However, the MetMap data clearly indicated that A549 and H460 are highly metastatic to all 5 organs with high penetrance and high metastatic potential.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the valuable contributions of animal models in metastatic cancer studies, but we also want to avoid the potentially confounding variable of the animal microenvironment. The MetMap Explorer contains valuable information (and as part of our clarification on this point, we now cite the MetMap in the text), but the “metastatic potential of each cell line” for this tool is measured in a mouse environment. Knowing that a particular cell line, which originated from a human lung metastasis, can further metastasize to other organs in a mouse does not necessarily mean that those cells could do so in humans. The microenvironment responses to metastatic colonization recapitulate the events in wound repair, and these can differ among species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28916657/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28916657/</ext-link> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729995/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39729995/</ext-link>). Further, the changes a cell needs to make to adapt to a new organ system in a mouse could be confounded by the changes needed to adapt to mouse conditions in general. Finally, migration from a site of ectopic injection may not mimic migration from an initial tumor site. These factors lead to well known cases where MetMap does not reflect the metastatic potential of cancers in humans. As a classic example, prostate cancer frequently metastasizes to bone in humans, and the PC3 cell line was derived from a bone metastatic prostate cancer. However, MetMap shows no evidence of PC3 being able to metastasize to bone in a mouse.</p><p>We agree that the very best data would come from matched primary and metastatic tumors in the same human patient, but those data do not currently exist and generating them would require future work beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since results will vary among different experimental models testing metastatic organotropism, (intracardiac injection was the metastasis model being adopted in the MetMap), the authors should state more clearly which experimental model system served as the basis for their definition of organ-specific metastasis. In my opinion, this is the most crucial first step for this entire study to be sound and solid.</p></disp-quote><p>Taking all the above into account, in our revision, we have now included further clarification in the main text to more clearly explain how and why we chose the cell lines we did and what the advantages and limitations of this choice are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1b: The authors found that &quot;MDA-MB-231 cells were grouped with the lung carcinoma cells. This implies that the genome organization of this cell line is closer to that of lung cells than to other breast epithelial cell lines.&quot;. In fact, another TNBC line BT549 was also clustered under the same clade. So this clade consisted of normal-like and highly metastatic lines. Therefore, the authors should be mindful of the fact that the compartment features might not directly link to metastasis (or even metastatic organotropism).</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 1b, the grouping that includes MDA-MB-231 (lung metastatic breast cancer) connected to A549, and H460 (lung cancer) occurs at a distance of about 0.2. If the clustering tree were cut at a distance of 0.26, 6 separate clusters would result: two clusters of Luminal subtypes (all labeled red), one that includes all healthy epithelial cells (both lung and breast, all labeled green), one that links two localized breast cancers, one that links MDA-MB-231 to lung carcinoma cell lines, and then BT549 by itself. So, while BT549 appears next to MDA-MB-231 along the horizontal axis, this is just coincidence of the representation: the dendrogram shows it is quite distant from all the other cell lines in this cluster according to compartment profile.</p><p>So, it is only MDA-MB-231 that is very closely linked with the lung cancer cell types.</p><p>It is true that the healthy lung cells (HTBE) are clustered separately and are more similar to normal/non tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (HMEC and MCF10A) than to any cancer cell type. This could suggest that there are aspects of the compartment pattern that represent any healthy epithelium as compared to cancer. What we find in the compartment profile, in both the clustering and the PCA analysis, is that compartment signatures contain information about cell properties on several overlapping levels: there is an aspect of the compartment profile that distinguishes healthy from cancerous cells, an aspect that distinguishes luminal cancers from other subtypes, a part that associates with organotropism, and an aspect that captures EMT status. The final compartment status is a composite of these numerous factors.</p><p>We have clarified the text to indicate that we mean MDA-MB-231 clusters near lung cancer, not necessarily healthy lung cell models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3: In the text, the authors stated, &quot;To further investigate this result, we examined the transcription status of genes that changed compartment across the EMT spectrum and, conversely, the compartment status of genes that changed transcription (Fig. 3b, c, and d)&quot;. However, it was not apparent in the figure that the cell lines were arranged according to an EMT spectrum.</p></disp-quote><p>To display these comparisons more clearly, we have now revised figure 3b, c, and d in two ways: First, we have defined the gene and cell line clustering by one set of data (for example, compartment identity in 3b) and then displayed the other data (gene expression) with all genes and cell lines in the same order. Therefore, for each column, genes and cell lines can be compared visually between top and bottom rows. Second, we have colored cell line names from purple to yellow according to their EMT scores as shown in Supplementary Figure 1a. This allows a visual indication of how the clustering separates cell lines by EMT status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the clustering heatmaps did not provide sufficient information regarding the genes with concordant/divergent compartments vs transcription changes. It would be more informative if the authors could spend more effort in annotating these genes/pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We want to clarify that the genes plotted in the heatmaps in Figure 3 are also the genes whose functional enrichment we present in figures 1 and 2. So, the genes that segregate strongly based on A/B compartment (but not gene expression) in figure 3b are the same genes whose GO terms are annotated in Figure 1d. Likewise, the genes that segregate strongly based on gene expression, but not A/B compartment, in figure 3c and d are the same genes whose GO terms are annotated in Figure 2b. We have now made this connection clearer in the text.</p><p>But, we also agree with the reviewer that it is important to explore a bit further the relationship between these divergent sets of genes. Our explorations have led to several observations:</p><p>(1) In some cases, the compartment-segregated genes and the transcription-segregated genes are different members of the same pathways. In Author response image 1 below, for example, we show interactions (according to STRING) for genes from figure 3c that are highly expressed in the epithelial-like cell lines and are annotated as involved in epithelial development (green). We then added to the network genes from figure 3b that are specifically in the A compartment in the epithelial-like cell lines but not mesenchymal cell lines that are also annotated as involved in epithelial development (red). Most of these epithelial development genes that change expression are in the A compartment in all cell lines and therefore do not rely on spatial compartment changes for their regulation. But some additional epithelial development genes, which are interconnected in this same network, are changing compartments across the EMT spectrum. One example, FOXA1, is a key hub in the network and is known to be a pioneer transcription factor involved in development and differentiation. Controlling this gene at the level of spatial genome organization rather than local transcriptional control could be important in the stable cell fate changes that can happen with EMT.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103697-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>(2) Overall, the set of genes that change compartments does not have as strong functional enrichment as the transcription change set of genes. This could indicate that some of the compartment changes that occur with EMT are not directly gene regulatory but rather enable an overall conformational change of the chromatin that is needed for the alterations in physical cell state or to accomplish long distance gene regulation changes.</p><p>(3) Related to long distance gene regulation changes, we also see cases in which the gene that changes transcription but not compartment across EMT is adjacent to regions that switch compartments.</p><p>A good example is TFF3 (yellow, Supplementary figure 1C). TFF3 is one of the genes that strongly segregates across EMT by transcription, being more highly expressed in epithelial-like (bottom 4 tracks) but not mesenchymal-like (top 4 tracks) cancers. Despite this differential expression, it is almost always in the A compartment across all cell lines. However, it is adjacent to regions that show strong compartment change EMT signatures. So, even though this specific gene region is not changing compartment, its regulation may be influenced by the entire region being Aassociated in epithelial-like but neighboring regions becoming B-associated in mesenchymal like cancers.</p><p>TFF3 is expressed in normal breast epithelium and has been implicated as a biomarker for endocrine therapy response in breast cancer.</p><p>Meanwhile, many genes that are in these compartment switching regions (BACE2, DSCAM, PDE9A) are not among the strongest expression signature genes.</p><p>(4) Interestingly, some of the regions (such as the region shown in Supplementary figure 1C) that change compartment across the breast cancer spectrum overlap with regions that we found change compartment in the progression of prostate cancer, as shown in the string.db enrichment analysis below.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103697-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In our revised manuscript, we now include more of these explanations in the text and include the example offset compartment and transcription change region shown about as panel c of Supplementary Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 4: The title of the subheading of this section was 'Lung metastatic breast cancer cell lines acquire lung-like genome architecture&quot;. Echoing my comments in point 1, I am a bit hesitant to term it as &quot;lung metastatic&quot; but rather &quot;metastatic' in general since cell lines such as MDA-MD-231 do metastasize to other organs as well. However, I do get the point that the definition of &quot;lung metastasis&quot; is derived from the common metastasis features among the cell lines here (MCF7, T47D, SKBR3, MDAMB-231). There might be another argument about whether the &quot;lung&quot; carcinoma cell lines can be considered &quot;localized&quot; since they are also capable of metastasizing to other organs.</p></disp-quote><p>Rather than classifying cells on metastatic “potential” (as measured in a mouse), our cell lines are chosen based on their sites of origin and etiological history in the patients from which they were derived. Cancer cell lines called “lung metastasis” were collected from the pleural effusion from the human lung. Likewise, we call a cancer “localized” because it was taken from the tissue where the cancer originated, even if it might, if placed into a different context, be able to metastasize. We would argue that the genome structure features of the “localized” cancers reflect cancers that have not yet metastasized (even if they could in the future) while the “metastatic” cancers have already gone to a certain location (even if they could in theory have gone to a different location).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a way, what the authors probably were trying to leverage here is the &quot;tissue&quot; identity of that organ.</p><p>Having said this, in addition to showing the &quot;lung permissive changes&quot;, the authors should show the &quot;breast identity conservation&quot; as well. Because this section started to deal with the concept of &quot;tissue/lineage identify&quot;, the authors should also clarify whether these breast cancer cell lines capable of making lung metastasis are also preserving their original tissue identity from the compartment features (which would most likely be the case).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. We have now more explicitly checked the proportions of genomic regions that change compartments to match lung vs. maintaining breast-specific compartment identity. The graphs in Supplementary Figure 2 begin with all genomic bins that have distinctive compartment identity between non-cancerous breast and lung epithelial cells. Then, the plots show what fraction of these tissue-specific bins change compartment to match lung vs. maintaining breast identity in each breast cancer cell line category. As we have shown in other graphs, particularly for switches to the A compartment, more bins change to match lung in the metastatic vs. primary site cell lines. In most cases, more than 50% of the tissue-specific bins shift to look more like lung.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Rest of the sections: The authors started to claim that the organ-specific metastasis permissive compartmental features mimic the destinated end organ. The authors utilized additional non-breast cancer cell lines (prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP as localized and DU145 as brain metastatic) in brain metastasis to strengthen this claim. (DU145 in MetMap again is highly metastatic to lung, brain, and kidney). However, this makes one wonder that for cell lines that are capable of metastasizing to multiple organ sites (eg. MDA-MB-231, DU145, A459, H460), does it mean that they all acquire the permissive features for all these organs? This scenario is clinically relevant in Stage 4 patients who often present with not only one metastatic lesion in one single organ but multiple metastatic lesions in more than one organ (eg. concomitant liver and lung metastasis). Do the authors think that there might be different clones having different tropism-permissive 3D genome features or there might be evolutionary trajectory in this?</p></disp-quote><p>In my opinion, to further prove this point, the authors might need to consider doing in vivo experiments to collect paired primary and organ-specific metastatic samples to look at the 3D genome changes.</p><p>We agree that an ideal experimental follow up to this study would be to collect paired metastatic and primary tumors, either in mouse xenograft or, even better, from patients. This is beyond the scope of what we can do for our current paper, but we have added a statement to the discussion of further experiments that would be required to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Technically, the study utilized public Hi-C data without generating new Hi-C data. The resolution of the Hi-C data for compartments was set at 250KB as the binning size indicating that the Hi-C data was at lower resolution so it might not be ideal to address other 3D genome architecture changes such as TADs or long-range loops. It is therefore unknown whether there might be permissive TAD/loop changes associated with organotropism and this is the limitation of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Our decision to focus on A/B compartmentalization rather than TAD or loop structure in this analysis was intentional and biologically motivated, rather than solely being a reflection of data resolution. Both compartments and topologically associated domains (TADs) are key parts of genome organization and disruption of these structures has the potential to alter downstream gene regulation, as shown by numerous studies. However, compartments have been found, more so than TADs, to be strongly associated with cell type and cell fate. Therefore, in this manuscript, we decided to focus only on the compartment organization changes between different healthy and cancerous cells as they are more likely to represent the stable alterations of the genome organization malignant transformations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In the final sentence of the discussion the authors stated &quot;Overall, our results suggest that genome spatial compartment changes can help encode a cell state that favors metastasis (EMT)&quot;. The &quot;metastasis (EMT)&quot; was in fact not clearly linked inside the manuscript. The authors did not provide a strong link between metastasis and EMT in their result description. It is also unclear whether the EMTassociated compartment identity would also correlate with the organotropic compartment identity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statement involves too strong of an assumption. The literature on this topic is vast and complex, and while there is abundant evidence that pathways of EMT can play important roles in facilitating metastasis, there are other pathways at play in the metastatic process as well (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/Plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002487">https://journals.plos.org/Plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002487</ext-link>). We have made a clearer statement about this in the text now.</p><p>To address the question of whether the organotropic changes related to the EMT changes, we calculated the overlap between the genomic bins that strongly segregated cell lines in the compartment principal component analysis (PC1) with those that showed “organotropic” changes. As you can see in supplementary table 3, this overlap is actually very small, where only 3% of bins are important both for the EMT segregation of cell lines and organotropism.</p><p>We have now included this overlap information as supplementary table 3 and have addressed this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work addresses an important question of chromosome architecture changes associated with organotopic metastatic traits, showing important trends in genome reorganization. The most important observation is that 3D genome changes consistent with adaptations for new microenvironments, including lung metastatic breast cells exhibiting signatures of the genome architecture typical to a lung cell-like conformation and brain metastatic prostate cancer cells showing compartment shifts toward a brain-like state.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work presents interesting original results, which will be important for future studies and biomedical implications of epigenetic regulation in norm and pathology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors used publicly available data for 15 cell types.

The 17 datasets used come from 8 different studies. So, indeed, the reviewer is correct that many different sources of data were used. To address the question of whether our results would be consistent if data from different sources were used, we created a comparison map of the A/B compartment profiles for data from multiple sources when it was available. You can see below that the Hi-C data from different sources for the same cell lines cluster quite closely and show high correlation and are well separated from different cell lines. So, we do not think that source batch effects play a major role in our results.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103697-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 1a: This figure could be re-formatted without the arrows.

(This again highlights the importance of cell line definition and annotation).</p></disp-quote><p>It is a good point that MCF7, while generally considered HER2 negative (we indicate this negative status in Supplementary Table 1), falls near HER2 positive cells in PCA space. This indicates that PCA captures tendencies but is not a perfect classifier. In a high dimensional, complex system, it is expected that an unsupervised analysis such as this will not capture just one biological feature in a given principal component, and therefore something like HER2 status may not segregate perfectly. However, this analysis does suggest that MCF7 3D genome structure has features that are more similar to other HER2+ cell lines. This raises the interesting possibility that it may actually behave like HER2+ cells in some ways even while being HER2- itself.
