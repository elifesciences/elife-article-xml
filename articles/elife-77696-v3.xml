We took a chemical biology approach to gain further insights into its function. We developed C17, a potent small-molecule DYRK2 inhibitor, through multiple rounds of structure-based optimization guided by several co-crystallized structures. C17 displayed an effect on DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> and showed outstanding selectivity for the human kinome containing 467 other human kinases. Using C17 as a chemical probe, we further performed quantitative phosphoproteomic assays and identified several novel DYRK2 targets, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). DYRK2 phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, and the combined treatment of C17 with AKT and MEK inhibitors showed synergistic 4E-BP1 phosphorylation suppression. The phosphorylation of STIM1 by DYRK2 substantially increased the interaction of STIM1 with the ORAI1 channel, and C17 impeded the store-operated calcium entry process. These studies collectively further expand our understanding of DYRK2 and provide a valuable tool to pinpoint its biological function.</p></abstract><kwd-group

kinases (DYRKs) belong to the CMGC group of kinases together with other critical human kinases, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aranda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker and Joost, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Manning et al., 2002</xref>). DYRKs uniquely phosphorylate tyrosine residues within their activation loops in cis during biosynthesis, although mature proteins display exclusive serine/threonine kinase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lochhead et al., 2005</xref>). There are five DYRKs in humans: DYRK1A, DYRK1B, DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4. DYRK1A has been extensively studied due to its potential function in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker and Sippl, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wegiel et al., 2011</xref>). DYRK3 has been shown to function as a central ‘dissolvase’ to regulate the formation of membrane-less organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wippich et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, DYRK2 is a crucial regulator of 26S proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The 26S proteasome degrades the majority of proteins in human cells and plays a central role in many cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coux et al., 1996</xref>). Recent discoveries have revealed that the 26S proteasome is subjected to intricate regulation by reversible phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). DYRK2 phosphorylates the Rpt3 subunit in the regulatory particle of the proteasome at Thr25, leading to the upregulation of proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). DYRK2 is overexpressed in several tumors, including triple-negative breast cancer and multiple myeloma, which are known to rely heavily on proteasome activity for progression, and perturbation of DYRK2 activity impedes cancer cell proliferation and inhibits tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our knowledge of the physiological functions of DYRK2 remains in its infancy, and DYRK2 likely has cellular targets in addition to Rpt3. Substrates of many kinases, especially Ser/Thr kinases, remain insufficiently identified. A major obstacle to discovering physiologically relevant substrates of a kinase is the lack of highly specific chemical probes that allow precise modulation of kinase function. Some DYRK2 inhibitors have been reported; however, these compounds also inhibit other kinases, mostly other DYRK family members, to various degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaikuad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jouanne et al., 2017</xref>). We have recently identified LDN192960 as a selective DYRK2 inhibitor and showed that LDN192960 could alleviate multiple myeloma and triple-negative breast cancer progression by inhibiting DYRK2-mediated proteasome phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). To obtain even more potent and selective DYRK2 inhibitors, we applied a structure-guided approach to further engineer chemical compounds based on the LDN192960 scaffold. One of the best compounds we generated, compound C17 (C17), displays an effect on DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> with moderate to excellent selectivity against kinases closely related to DYRK2. Using this potent DYRK2 inhibitor as a tool, we treated U266 cells with C17. We performed quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses, which led to identifying several novel DYRK2 targets, including eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). These results demonstrate that DYRK2 plays critical regulatory roles in multiple cellular processes, including protein translation and store-operated calcium entry, and indicate that C17 can serve as a valuable probe for the study of DYRK2 function.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The Inhibitory activity and selectivity of acridine analogs of

inhibitors</title><p>LDN192960 was identified as a DYRK2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuny et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuny et al., 2012</xref>). It occupies the ATP-binding pocket of DYRK2 and mediates extensive hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, LDN192960 also inhibits other DYRK2-related kinases, especially Haspin and DYRK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). To generate DYRK2 inhibitors with better selectivity, we synthesized a series of new compounds based on the same acridine core structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The amine side chain was first changed to a protected amine (compounds 1–3), a cyano group (compound 4), or a cyclic amine (compounds 5–6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Among these candidates, compound 6 exhibited the most potent inhibitory effect towards DYRK2, with an in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> of 17 nM. In comparison, LDN192960 showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 53 nM when the same protocol was used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>)—treating HEK293T cells transiently expressing DYRK2 with increasing concentrations of compound 6 efficiently inhibited Rpt3-Thr25 phosphorylation, with the maximal effect observed at an inhibitor concentration of less than 3 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, compound 6 also displays good selectivity towards DYRK2 than other kinases, including DRYK1A, DRYK1B, DYRK3, Haspin, and MARK3 (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 889, 697, 121305, 45, and 100 nM, respectively; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, compound 6 was chosen as the lead compound for further chemical modification.</p><p>We subsequently crystallized DYRK2 in complex with compound 6 and determined the structure at a resolution of 2.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Not surprisingly, compound 6 binds the ATP-binding site of DYRK2 like LDN192960. A water molecule is located deep inside the binding pocket acting as a bridge in the interactions between LDN192960 and the protein. The newly added amino side chain displays apparent densities and adopts an extended conformation. An in-depth analysis of the crystal structure revealed several additional sites for chemical expansion that may further strengthen its interaction with DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). First, a hydrophilic group can be introduced into the acridine core to functionally replace the aforementioned water molecule and maintain constant contact with DYRK2. Second, a bulky functional group can replace the methoxy groups to mediate other interactions with DYRK2. Finally, the amine side chain can be altered to stabilize its conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). To this end, we synthesized 9 new compounds (compounds 7–15) and evaluated their inhibitory effects on DYRK2 and related kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>). We also determined the co-crystallized structures of several of these compounds with DYRK2 to visualize their detailed interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Compound 7, introducing a hydroxymethyl group to the acridine core, inhibits DRYK2 efficiently as compound 6 while displaying better selectivity against other DRYK family members (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The co-crystallized structure shows that the hydroxymethyl group directly contacts the main chain amide group of Ile367 and indirectly coordinates Glu266 and Phe369 via a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Compared to compound 7, compounds 8–10, which contain a carboxyl, aminomethyl, and fluoromethyl group, respectively, instead of a hydroxymethyl group, display reduced inhibition towards DYRK2. Compounds 11–15, designed to replace the methoxy group with a bulkier side chain, showed significantly decreased activity and selectivity and were not further pursued (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of DYRK2 bound to novel inhibitors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of DYRK2 (grey) bound to 6 (green), 7 (pink), C17 (orange), and 18 (blue).

By changing the 6-membered ring to a straight-chain or smaller ring, we synthesized compounds 16–19 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Among these compounds, C17 with an (<italic>S</italic>)–3-methylpyrrolidine side-chain exhibited the best potency and selectivity among all the analogs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that compound 18 containing an (<italic>R</italic>)–3-methylpyrrolidine side chain was not as good as C17, indicating that the chirality of the 3-methylpyrrolidine motif plays an essential role in both potency and selectivity. Further modification of compound 17 (leading to compound 20) to promote further hydrogen bond interactions with DYRK2 failed to improve the inhibitory effect. We also wondered whether acridine was the best aromatic core structure and synthesized two new compounds (compounds 21 and 22) by changing one side of the benzene group to a sulfur-containing thiazole structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), which we thought might facilitate hydrophobic interactions with DYRK2 within the ATP-binding pocket; however, they did not have as effective an inhibitory effect as compound 17 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>C17 is a potent and selective DYRK2 inhibitor</title><p>We set to comprehensively characterize the inhibitory function of compound 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), referred to as C17 hereafter. <italic>In vitro</italic>, C17 displays an effect on DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> value (9 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further evaluate the selectivity of C17, we performed kinome profiling analyses. Among the 468 human kinases tested, C17 targeted only DYRK2, Haspin, and MARK3 at a concentration of 500 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Nonetheless, the in vitro IC<sub>50</sub> values of C17 for Haspin and MARK3 (26 nM and 87 nM, respectively) were 3–10-fold higher than that for DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>). Similarly, C17 also inhibited DYRK3 to a lesser extent (IC<sub>50</sub> of 68 nM). In contrast, LDN192960 inhibited DYRK3 and Haspin more than it inhibited DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuny et al., 2010</xref>). Significantly, C17 also efficiently suppressed DYRK2 activity in the cell and abolished Rpt3-Thr25 phosphorylation at an inhibitor concentration of less than 1 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

A total of 15,755 phosphosites were identified, among which 12,818 (81%) were serine, and 2,798 (18%) were threonine. A total of 10,647 (68%) phosphosites were Class I (localization probability &gt;0.75), 2557 (16%) were Class II (0.5 &lt; localization probability ≤0.75), and 2401 (16%) were Class III (0.25 &lt; localization probability ≤0.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is a very comprehensive phosphoproteomic dataset prepared for DYRK2 substrate profiling by treating the U266 cells with 10 μM of C17. A good Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 was obtained for the phosphosite intensities among the treatment and control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the coefficient of variance of the intensities of the majority of the phosphosites was lower than 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating the high quantification precision of our label-free phosphoproteomic analysis. Remarkably, C17 treatment led to significant downregulation of 373 phosphosites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), including pThr37 of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), as well as pSer519 and pSer521 in the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Second, a previous study showed that Ser65 and Ser101 in 4E-BP1 can be phosphorylated by DYRK2 in vitro, indicating that 4E-BP1 is a potential DYRK2 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). And lastly, several phosphosite-specific antibodies for 4E-BP1 are commercially available. 4E-BP1 is a master regulator of protein synthesis. It has been well established that its phosphorylation by other kinases such as mTORC1 leads to its dissociation from eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), allowing mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Using an antibody that detects 4E-BP1 only when it is phosphorylated at Thr37 and Thr46, we found that C17 treatment significantly reduced the level of pThr37/pThr46 of endogenous 4E-BP1 in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with our mass spec analyses in U266 cells. Further investigations using two other 4E-BP1 phosphosite-specific antibodies showed that C17 also decreased the phosphorylation of Ser65 in endogenous 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) by a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; as well as Thr70.

Successful knockdown is demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, C17 suppressed DYRK2-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 when overexpressed in the HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To ascertain whether DYRK2 can directly phosphate 4E-BP1, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using purified DYRK2 and 4E-BP1 proteins.

A previous study showed that combined inhibition of AKT and MEK kinases suppressed 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">She et al., 2010</xref>).

To assess whether C17 can also elicit a synergistic effect with these kinase inhibitors, we treated HEK293A, HCT116, and U266 cells with these molecules, either alone or in combination, and examined the phosphorylation status of endogenous 4E-BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). The presence of C17 potentiated the inhibitory effect of AKTi and PD0325901 in all these cells.

STIM1 is a single-pass transmembrane protein residing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plays a vital role in the store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2013</xref>).

Oligomerized STIM1 then travels to the ER-plasma membrane contact site and activates the ORAI1 calcium channel. The cytosolic region of STIM1 contains multiple phosphorylation sites, and it has been shown that the function of STIM1 is regulated by several kinases, including ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pozo-Guisado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pozo-Guisado and Martin-Romero, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Purified wild-type DYRK2, but not the kinase-dead mutant D275N, induced mobility changes of the cytosolic region of STIM1 (STIM1<sup>235-END</sup>) in SDS-PAGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

To assess the functional outcome of STIM1 phosphorylation by DYRK2, we co-expressed STIM1 and DYRK2 in an Orai-deficient (Orai-KO) cell line, which has all three Orai genes genetically ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). DYRK2 induced the appearance of STIM1 puncta under resting conditions, indicating that DYRK2 promotes STIM1 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, the STIM1 puncta were not observed in the presence of C17. DYRK2 also failed to promote the punctate formation of STIM1-10M, a STIM1 variant with all ten potential DYRK2 phosphorylation sites mutated to Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To further understand the importance of STIM1 phosphorylation, we examined the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 using co-immunoprecipitation. Expression of WT DYRK2 significantly increased the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1, whereas expression of DYRK2-KD exerted no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Treating cells with C17 effectively abolished the DYRK2-dependent STIM1-Orai1 interaction. Notably, both STIM1-1-491, a C-terminal truncated STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and STIM1-10M displayed significantly reduced interaction with Orai1 even in the presence of WT DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that DYRK2-mediated phosphorylation is essential to promote the binding between STIM1 and Orai1. C17 also decreased the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 without exogenously expressing DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>We examined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between STIM1-YFP and CFP-Orai1 to validate the regulatory function of DYRK2 on STIM1-Orai1 interaction. The FRET signals between STIM1-YFP and CFP-Orai1 were significantly increased in HEK293 cells in the presence of WT DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). To exclude the influence of endogenous STIM1, we performed further analyses in a STIM1-STIM2 DKO cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The FRET signals between STIM1-1-491 and Orai1 were unaltered by DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that the effect of DYRK2 is dependent on the C-terminal region of STIM1. Furthermore, the FRET signals between STIM1-10M and Orai1 were unaffected by DYRK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These results are consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results and demonstrate that DYRK2 can promote the STIM1-Orai1 interaction via STIM1 phosphorylation.</p><p>Lastly, to examine the physiological relevance of the STIM1-Orai1 interaction regulated by DYRK2, we performed SOCE analyses in HEK293A cells expressing GCaMP6f, a genetically encoded calcium sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>). Treating cells grown in a calcium-free medium containing thapsigargin resulted in a transient increase in GCaMP6f fluorescence due to calcium release from the ER to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, black line). Subsequent addition of calcium to the cell culture medium resulted in a marked increase in GCaMP6f signaling, indicating calcium entry into the cells, further augmented by STIM1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, blue line). Pre-treating cells with C17 for 1 hr substantially reduced SOCE in cells with either endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, green line) or overexpressed STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, red line). Quantifications of these results are present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that DRYK2 can directly enhance SOCE by phosphorylating STIM1 and promoting its interaction with ORAI1, which can all be effectively inhibited by C17.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We used a structure-based approach to design, synthesize and evaluate a series of new analogs based on the acridine core structure and eventually identified C17 as a potent and selective DYRK2 inhibitor. We showed that C17 affects DYRK2 at a single-digit nanomolar IC50 and inhibits DYRK2 more potently than closely related kinases such as DYRK3, Haspin, and MARK3. The crystal structure of DYRK2 bound to C17 revealed critical interactions that explain its high selectivity, including a hydrogen bond between the (S)–3-methylpyrrolidine ring and Glu352 in DYRK2.</p><p>C17 provided us with a unique tool to interrogate the physiological functions of DYRK2. We treated U266 cells with C17 and performed quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses. We found that the cellular phosphorylation pattern is significantly altered by C17, suggesting that DYRK2 likely has multiple cellular targets and is involved in a network of biological processes. We then identified several leading phosphosites that are downregulated and demonstrated that 4E-BP1 and STIM1 are bona fide substrates of DYRK2. We showed that DYRK2 efficiently phosphorylated 4E-BP1 at multiple sites, including Thr37, and combined treatment of C17 with AKT and MEK inhibitors resulted in marked suppression of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Therefore, DYRK2 likely functions synergistically with other kinases to regulate protein synthesis.</p><p>For the first time, we also discovered that DYRK2 could efficiently phosphorylate STIM1, and phosphorylation of STIM1 by DYRK2 substantially increased the interaction between STIM1 and ORAI1. Treating cells with C17 suppressed SOCE, validating the critical role of DYRK2 in regulating calcium entry into cells. These data allow us to present a hypothetical model showing how DYRK2 triggers the activation of STIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Under resting conditions, the cytosolic portion of STIM1 likely adopts an inactive conformation. DYRK2 can phosphorylate STIM1 and induce its oligomerization, which then interacts with the Orai1 channel and leads to its opening. One inadequacy of our study is the lack of further insight into the regulation mechanism of this process. In particular, what is the upstream signal that triggers DYRK2 activation? Nevertheless, our data offer a valuable model that allows further investigation of the relationship between DYRK2 and SOCE.</p><p>Recently, Mehnert et al. developed a multilayered proteomic workflow and determined how different pathological-related DYRK2 mutations altered protein conformation, substrates modification, and biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). DYRK2 is implicated in regulating multiple cellular processes, and the selective DYRK2 inhibitor we developed here will serve as a valuable tool in dissecting its complex downstream pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Antibodies used in this study were: anti-4E-PB1 (Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2097841">AB_2097841</ext-link>), anti-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46) (Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_560835">AB_560835</ext-link>), anti-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Ser65) (Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_330947">AB_330947</ext-link>), anti-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Thr70) (Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2798206">AB_2798206</ext-link>), anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_1549585">AB_1549585</ext-link>), anti-Flag (Sigma, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_259529">AB_259529</ext-link>), anti-Flag (Abcam, #ab205606), anti-GFP (Proteintech, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_11182611">AB_11182611</ext-link>), Anti-GFP (Abcam, #ab183734), anti-RPT3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2781512">AB_2781512</ext-link>), anti-GAPDH (TransGen Biotech, #HC301-01).

The proteins were eluted from the FLAG–beads by addition of 500 μg FLAG peptides (Smart Lifesciences). Then the eluted proteins were digested with trypsin by the FASP digestion method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>). The peptides were analyzed on a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1 hr LC gradient. The raw files were searched against Human fasta database (downloaded from Uniprot) by MaxQuant (version 1.6.3.4). The oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), and Phospho (STY) were selected as the variable modifications for the phosphopeptide identification, while the carbamidomethyl was set as the fixed modification. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 on PTM site, peptide, and protein level. Label-free quantification (LFQ) and match between runs were set for the triplicate analysis data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Confocal imaging were carried out with a ZEISS LSM880 imaging system equipped with 65 × oil objective (NA = 1.45, Zeiss), 488- and 543 nm laser, controlled by Zen 2.3 SP1 software. YFP (505 ± 35) and mCherry (640 ± 50) emission were collected with CaAsP PMT (Optical section, 1.1 μm). Image analysis was performed using Image J Fiji (NIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Each repeat contains data from at least 6 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Fluorescence imaging</title><p>Fluorescence signals were recorded using a ZEISS obersever-7 microscope equipped with an X-Cite 120-Q (Lumen dynamics), brightline filter sets (Semrock Inc), a 40 × oil objective (NA = 1.30), and a Prime 95B Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera (Teledyne Imaging). This system was controlled by Slide book6 software (3i). For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, three-channel-corrected FRET include cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), yellow fluorescent protein(YFP) and FRET raw were collected with corresponding filters, F<sub>CFP</sub> (438 ± 12E<sub>x</sub>/ 483 ± 16 <sub>Em</sub>), F<sub>YFP</sub> (510 ± 10E<sub>x</sub>/542 ± 13.5 <sub>Em</sub>) and FRET<sub>raw</sub> (438 ± 12E<sub>x</sub>/542 ± 13.5 <sub>Em</sub>), every 10 s. Calibration of bleed through from FRET donor or acceptor to FRET channel (0.20, and 0.36, correspondingly), as well as the system-dependent factor, G (2.473) were done as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). These parameters were then used to generate calculate FRET efficiency (Eapp) values from raw fluorescent signals, similar to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). At least 16 cells were collected for each repeat. Corresponding results were calculated with Matlab 2014a software and plotted with GraphPad Prism 8.4.0 software. Representative traces of at least three independent experiments are shown as mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Confocal imaging and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement</title><p>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement was performed on a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63 × oil immersion objective lens (N.A. = 1.4) controlled by ZEN software. GCaMP6f fluorescence was excited using a 488 nm line of solid-state laser and fluorescence emission was collected with a 490- to 555 nm band-pass filter; mCherry fluorescence was excited using a 555 nm line of solid-state laser and fluorescence emission was collected with a 580 nm long-pass filter. Two high-sensitivity PMTs were used for detection. Cells were imaged at 10 s intervals for up to 20 mins. All live cell imaging experiments were performed at room temperature. Data were processed and analyzed using Zen and ImageJ software.</p><p>For intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement, HEK293A cells were plated on glass-bottom 35 mm dishes and transfected as described above. Cells were washed with Ca<sup>2+</sup> free buffer 3 times 24 hr after transfection. For DYRK2 inhibition, cells were treated with DMEM containing 1 μM of C17 at 37 for 1 hr before Ca<sup>2+</sup> free buffer rinse. Depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stores was triggered by incubating cells with 1 μM thapsigargin in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free buffer, and Store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) was induced by addition of 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to thapsigargin containing buffer. One μM C17 was added for DYRK2 inhibition assay. The intracellular free calcium concentration was measured by monitoring the fold change of GCaMP6f fluorescence, the data were shown as the mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistics and data presentation</title><p>Most experiments were repeated three times with multiple technical replicates to be eligible for the indicated statistical analyses, and representative image has been shown.

spectrometer (500 M) and Bruker-600M Hz NMR spectrometer (600 M) at ambient temperature with CDCl<sub>3</sub> as the solvent unless otherwise stated. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to CDCl<sub>3</sub> (1 H, δ 7.26; 13 C, δ 77.16) and MeOD (1 H, δ 3.31; 13 C, δ 49.00). Data for 1 H NMR are reported as follows: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, quint = quintet, sixt = sixtet, m = multiplet) and coupling constants. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained at Peking University Mass Spectrometry Laboratory using a Bruker APEX Flash chromatography. The samples were analyzed by UPLC/MS on a Waters Auto Purification LC/MS system (Waters C18 5 μm 150 × 4.6 mm SunFire separation column) or prepared by HPLC/MS on a Waters Auto Purification LC/MS system (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 17 μm 2.1 × 50 mm column). Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed using 0.25 mm silica gel 60 F plates, using 250 nm UV light as the visualizing agent and a solution of phosphomolybdic acid and heat as developing agents. Flash chromatography was performed using 200–400 mesh silica gel. Yields refer to chromatographically pure materials, unless otherwise stated.

The authors developed a selective ATP-competitive inhibitor (C17) for the kinase DYRK2 and use this reagent in combination with global phosphoproteomics to identify potential cellular substrates. Two substrate proteins, 4E-BP1 and STIM1 were biochemically validated as DYRK2 substrates. C17 will likely be a useful pharmacological reagent for exploring DYRK2 function and the phosphoproteomic dataset generated in this study serves as a good starting point for understanding the roles that DYRK2 plays in signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77696.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05bnh6r87</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05bnh6r87</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Selective inhibition reveals the regulatory function of DYRK2 in protein synthesis and calcium entry&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hening Lin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work is not suitable for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see from the review comments, although the reviewers found the work interesting and potentially important, they feel that a substantial amount of work will be needed to support the conclusions about the new substrates identified. The decision is not a reflection of a lack of interest from the reviewers, but more a reflection that the time and effort required to carryout these experiments might be exceeding what <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy permits. Thus, we would consider a future new submission after you address the review concerns, if you choose to pursue that direction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>DYRK2 is a kinase with multiple reported functions and targeting it has been shown to have potential in treating multiple myeloma and triple-negative breast cancers. The authors in this manuscript aimed to develop better small molecule inhibitors based on their previously reported inhibitor LDN192960, which has an acridine core. They also aimed to gain further information regarding the function of DYRK2 with the inhibitors they developed. By modifying the substituents on the acridine core structure, they made about two dozens of compounds and tested their effects on DYRK2 and related kinases.

Through iterative rounds of synthesis, biochemical testing, and structure determination they identified inhibitor C17, which has impressive selectivity for DYRK2 and is sufficiently potent for intracellular studies. C17 is used in combination with phosphoproteomics to identify 100s of potential substrates of DYRK2. The authors validate two potential substrates-4E-BB1 and STIM1-and use C17 to explore how inhibiting DYRK2 affects intracellular processes that STIM1 is involved with. The authors structure-based design efforts are impressive and the inhibitor generated in this study will likely be useful to researchers interested in exploring DYRK2's intracellular function. Furthermore, the phosphoproteomic dataset generated is a nice resource for future exploration.

Very high concentrations of DYRK2 (1-5 μM if my math is correct) were used and the gel shift observed with STIM1 is confusing. It appears that quantitative phosphorylation of STIM1 is observed at the lowest concentration of DYRK2 used and that increasing concentrations of this kinase lead to a greater shift, which I interpret as multiple additional phosphorylation events. Furthermore, the authors do not show which sites in their purified STIM1 construct are being phosphorylated by DYRK2.</p><p>The results in Figure 5b demonstrating that DYRK2 overexpression leads to an increased interaction between STIM1 and Orail1, which C17 reverses, is intriguing. However, no evidence is provided that the phospho-sites identified (Ser519 and Ser521) in the phosphoproteomic substrate screen are involved in this process. This limits the overall mechanistic insight provided by Figures 5b, 5c. This is also true for the SOCE studies in Figure 5d, 5e.

Structure-guided optimization based on an acridine inhibitor identified in previous studies (LDN192960) culminates in 22 compounds of which compound 17 is the most potent inhibitor of DYRK2 (9 nM). Compound 17 is most selective for DYRK2 although it still exhibits moderate activity (26-87 nM) against other kinases (haspin, DYRK3, MARK3). With compound 17 in hand, the authors perform label-free quantitative phosphoproteomics and select two proteins of the 337 significantly down-regulated phosphosites for validation and follow up.

The primary weakness is that Compound 17 is first evaluated in transfected HEK293 cells, followed by U266 cells (a myeloma cell line) for phosphoproteomics experiments, and a return to transfected HEK293 cells and a new cell line HCT116 for follow up studies on two targets eIF3E and STIM1, which makes it more difficult to conclude whether or not Compound 17 is effectively hitting DYRK2 in cells. In particular, connections between expected changes in phosphorylation due to compound 17 hitting DYRK2 are not clear when transitioning from HEK293 cells to U266 cells where the phosphoproteomics is conducted, the phosphosites that are evaluated in follow up are not entirely congruent with what was observed in the mass spectrometry experiment or cross-validated back to the different cell lines that are employed. These concerns can be allayed with additional evaluation of compound 17 across cell types and demonstration that reduced phosphorylation events are similar between Compound 17 treatment and knockdown of DRYK2 across the cell lines examined.</p><p>The authors use 10 µM of Compound 17 in the phosphoproteomics study in U266 cells, when they show the compound is effective in HEK293T cells at 1 µM concentrations; given the fact that the compound has cross reactivity at higher concentrations of compound, it is difficult to be sure that the phosphosite changes in this dataset are occurring due to DYRK2 inhibition alone. It is unclear whether the phosphosites on RPT3 as a substrate of DYRK2 and the additional phosphosites that are highlighted on eIF4E and STIM1 are observed in this dataset.</p><p>There is only Western blot data for DYRK2 in HEK293T cells, but none in U266 cells to validate the mass spectrometry data.

The authors in this manuscript aimed to develop better small molecule inhibitors based on their previously reported inhibitor LDN192960, which has an acridine core. They also aimed to gain further information regarding the function of DYRK2 with the inhibitors they developed. By modifying the substituents on the acridine core structure, they made about two dozen compounds and tested their effects on DYRK2 and related kinases. The best inhibitor, C17, is more potent and selective than previous LDN192960. They further used C17 in a phosphorproteomics study to identify potential substrate proteins of DYRK2.

To assess the functional outcome of STIM1 phosphorylation by DYRK2, we co-expressed STIM1 and DYRK2 in an Orai-deficient (Orai-KO) cell line. DYRK2 induced the appearance of STIM1 puncta under resting conditions, indicating that DYRK2 promotes STIM1 oligomerization (Figure 5C). In contrast, the STIM1 puncta were not observed in the presence of C17. DYRK2 also failed to promote punctate formation of STIM1-10M, a STIM1 variant with ten potential DYRK2 phosphorylation sites mutated to Ala.</p><p>2. We also consolidated the STIM1-Orai1 co-immunoprecipitation experiment. We showed that expression of WT DYRK2 significantly increased the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1, whereas expression of DYRK2-KD exerted no such effect (Figure 5D). Treating cells with C17 effectively abolished the DYRK2-dependent STIM1-Orai1 interaction. Notably, both STIM1-1491, a C-terminal truncated STIM1, and STIM1-10M displayed significantly reduced interaction with Orai1 even in the presence of WT DYRK2 (Figure 5E), suggesting that DYRK2-mediated phosphorylation is essential to promote the binding between STIM1 and Orai1. C17 also decreased the interaction between STIM1 and Orai1 without exogenously expressed DYRK2 (Figure 5F).</p><p>3. We further examined fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between STIM1-YFP and CFP-Orai1 to validate the regulatory function of DYRK2 on STIM1-Orai1 interaction. The FRET signals between STIM1-YFP and CFP-Orai1 were significantly increased in HEK293 cells in the presence of WT DYRK2 (Figure 5G). The FRET signals between STIM1-1-491 and Orai1 were unaltered by DYRK2 (Figure 5H), indicating that the effect of DYRK2 is dependent on the C-terminal region of STIM1. Furthermore, the FRET signals between STIM1-10M and Orai1 were unaffected by DYRK2 (Figure 5I). These results are consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation results and demonstrate that DYRK2 can promote the STIM1-Orai1 interaction via STIM1 phosphorylation.</p><p>These new results, together with the SOCE analyses we presented previously (Figure 5J, 5K), provide much more mechanistic insights into the function of DYRK2 in SOCE, and strongly suggest that DRYK2 can directly enhance SOCE by phosphorylating multiple sites in STIM1 and promoting its interaction with ORAI1, which can all be effectively inhibited by C17.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I feel that this study is a very nice starting point but is insufficiently developed in its exploration of DYRK2 function.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have performed multiple additional experiments to more rigorously test the direct function of DYRK2 in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and STIM1.

The reasons for the major discrepancy between the identified phosphosites and the sites in the volcano plot are as follows:</p><p>The raw table output from the database search software MaxQuant reported 15939 phosphosites. After filtering the reverse and contamination phosphosites, 15755 sites were identified and used to plot the pie chart in Figure 3B. Since these identified phosphosites are reliably identified by MS/MS spectra and properly filtered by wellaccepted software, we concluded the identification of &gt;15,000 phosphosites in Figure 3B.</p><p>To further localize the correct S/T/Y amino acids in the identified peptide and quantify their relative abundance, these phosphosites were further processed by Perseus software. The Class I sites with localization probability score of more than 0.75 were kept for further quantitative analysis. The phosphosites with three valid values in at least one treatment or control group were observed. Finally, 7583 sites were visualized in the volcano plot, as shown in Figure 3C.</p><p>Collectively, we presented the phosphosite data at identification and quantification levels with rigorous site localization evaluation.
