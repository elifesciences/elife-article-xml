Except for PTCL-NOS, AITL is the most common subtype of PTCL (21–36.1%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba and Sakata-Yanagimoto, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Leval et al., 2015</xref>) and is believed to arise from a subset of peripheral mature CD4+ T-cells corresponding to T-follicular helper (TFH) cells, characterized immunophenotypically by expression of a set of cellular markers like PD1, CXCR5, BCL-6, CD10, CXCL13, and ICOS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attygalle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiba and Sakata-Yanagimoto, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupuis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marafioti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mourad et al., 2008</xref>). Morphologically, AITL is typically characterized by a polymorphous lymphoid infiltrate with a proliferation of medium-sized tumor cells with clear cytoplasm (clear cell immunoblasts), associated with prominent proliferation of high endothelial venules and follicular dendritic cells. A subset of PTCL, termed PTCL with TFH phenotype in the updated WHO classification, is thought to be also derived from TFH and may be biologically related to AITL, sharing some clinical-pathological features with the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swerdlow et al., 2017</xref>). Although progress has been made in understanding AITL pathogenesis and developing new treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemonnier et al., 2018</xref>), AITL remains as an aggressive lymphoid tumor, with low estimated rates of overall and failure-free survival at 5 years (33% and 18%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Federico et al., 2013</xref>). To develop more effective therapeutic agents against AITL and PTCL in general, with TFH phenotype further understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of AITL is needed.</p><p>Genetically, AITL is characterized by a number of genomic mutations in <italic>TET2</italic>, <italic>RHOA</italic>, <italic>DNMT3A,</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiore et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamoto-Matsubara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Odejide et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakata-Yanagimoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoo et al., 2014</xref>). Cell-intrinsic and/or -extrinsic factors that facilitate the accumulation of these AITL-related mutations remain unclear. Mutations in <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> are also frequently associated with myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> are also the most commonly mutated genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis (CH) in healthy adults, especially those over 60 years of age. CH has been shown to be an aging-related process characterized by the clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells harboring one or more somatic mutations as a result of selective advantage in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells due to enhanced self-renewal and inhibition of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Challen and Goodell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gondek and DeZern, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaiswal and Ebert, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Steensma and Ebert, 2020</xref>). It has been noted that myeloid and lymphoid malignancies may co-occur in the same patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holst et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the similarities in genomic mutation profiles of AITL, myeloid malignancies, and CH, it has been postulated that there may be a biological link between these entities. To test this, the current study implemented next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to analyze neoplastic T-cells and paired bone marrow/peripheral blood (BM/PB) specimens from a cohort of 27 patients with AITL or PTCL-NOS, and explored the potential of using the genomic findings from this study to shed light into the etiology of AITL development and to predict clinical progression related to development of second hematologic neoplasms, which is one of the clinical challenges in the clinical management of these cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KAPA HyperPlus Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog #

Of these 27 study cases, 4 were initially diagnosed with PTCL with THF phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and were included in the AITL group based on their similar clinical and molecular features as recently proposed by WHO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swerdlow et al., 2017</xref>). The two PTCL-NOS cases do not show significant expression of TFH-associated markers based on immunohistology. The clinical-pathological features of these two cases are as follows: patient #2: mesenterial lymphadenopathy found on CT scan during work-up for renal transplant, no morphological features of AITL, predominantly small cells. The T-cells were positive for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD4, negative for CD8, CD10, BCL6, and PD-1, diagnosed as PTCL-NOS. Patient #18: abdominal and cervical lymphadenopathy, large pleomorphic cells. The T-cells were positive for CD2, CD3, CD5, CD8, TIA-1, granzyme B, TCR alpha-beta, negative for CD7, CD4, CD10, CD56, CD57. diagnosed as PTCL-NOS, with cytotoxic phenotype.</p><p>For tumor burden (TB) estimate in the BM/PB samples, a complementary strategy was implemented due to limitations of each histological or molecular methods. Histological examination has a low sensitivity and AITL cells might lack distinct morphological or immunophenotypic features in the BM/PB samples, potentially leading to false negativity in histological or immunophenotyping estimation in some cases (e.g., patient #1, #5, #12). To avoid these potential pitfalls, besides considering morphological findings, the TB estimate was also based on more objective and sensitive immunophenotypic findings (flow cytometry, Flow). If flow was negative and T-cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement (TCRG) was positive, we estimated TB based on the analytic sensitivity of the TCRG assay, which is about 1–5%. If both Flow and TCRG were negative, the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of the T-cell lymphoma-associated variants like RHOA p.V17A would be used for estimation by comparison (e.g., the PB or BM samples from patient #1, #22, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki regulations of the protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA (#0107004999).

The variants whose VAFs could not be attributed to AITL/PTCL-NOS involvement alone in the BM/PB, or the variants detected in BM/PB uninvolved by lymphoma were presumed to correspond to variants related to CH, which was confirmed by the presence of these CH-associated mutations in purified neutrophils in the PB of one patient (patient #24, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to the AITL/PTCL-NOS-related variants, the VAFs of the CH-associated variants (VAF<sup>CH</sup>) were significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001), ranging from 0.2% to 51.5% with a mean of 22.5% (median: 16.5%), approximately 21.2 times higher than the VAF<sup>inv</sup> on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We identified in the matched BM/PB specimens 44 variants from 14 genes, excluding the variants attributed to the BM/PB involvement by AITL/PTCL-NOS as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Among these 44 somatic mutations, 37 mutations, identified in 19 of the 27 (70.4%) cases, were shared with those found in the primary lymphoma, and 7 were BM/PB specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

A detailed description of these illustrative cases is provided in Appendix 1.

At the base substitution level, C&gt;T is found most frequently (44%), followed by C&gt;G (20%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We extracted two major de novo mutational signatures (CH_Sign.01 and 02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) from the CH-related mutations by MutSignatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fantini et al., 2020</xref>). CH_Sign.01 is characterized by the enriched C&gt;T substitutions at the trinucleotide motif Tp<bold>C</bold>pA (mutated base presented as bold), and CH_Sign.02 is enriched with C&gt;T at Cp<bold>C</bold>pA/Gp<bold>C</bold>pG plus the increased C to G substitutions at Tp<bold>C</bold>pG. A cosine correlation similarity (CCS) was used to evaluate closeness between the CH de novo and COSMIC (SBS30, version 2) signatures. CCS, measured as 1 - cosine distance, ranges from 0 to 1. 0 denotes completely different mutational signatures and 1 signifies identical signatures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, CH_Sign.01 demonstrates the best match with COSMIC Signature 2 (CCS = 0.65), which is associated with activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>). The characterized trinucleotide change in CHSign.01, Tp<bold>C</bold>pA to Tp<bold>T</bold>pA, is also the hallmark of COSMIC Signature 2.

Signature analysis identified two de novo mutation signatures (LM_Sign.01 and LM_Sign.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). LM_Sign.01 is enriched with the Tp<bold>C</bold>pC to Tp<bold>A</bold>pC mutation, which is one of the main trinucleotide motifs with the C&gt;A base substitutions identified in COSMIC Signature 4 attributed to the smoking-induced mutational process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, analysis of cosine similarity revealed that the de novo signature LM_Sign.01 had the closest match with COSMIC Signature 4 (CCS ≈ 0.5), followed by Signature 24 (CCS = 0.4, associated with aflatoxin), highly active in 75% of the tumor samples as evidenced by 50% or more of the mutations in each sample (1–8 variants, mean mutation number = 1.74) as the result of the LM_Sign.01 signature activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Like COSMIC Signature 4, LM_Sign.01 exhibited transcriptional strand bias for the C&gt;A substitutions where the mutation of C on the forward strand (C&gt;A, n = 17) exceeded the mutation of G on the reverse strand (G&gt;T, n = 5) by 2.4-folds.

The Kyoto_Sign.01 signature also exhibited the transcriptional strand bias, with the C&gt;A mutations on the forward strand exceeding those on the reverse strand by 1.9-folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Further analysis showed that it had the closest match with COSMIC Signature 4 (CCS = 0.52) and was highly active in about 32 out of 44 TFH-PTCL cases (73%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Cosine similarity reveals that Kyoto_Sign.01 was almost identical with LM_Sign.01 (CCS ≈ 0.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), validating the above signatures and the potential link to cigarette smoke.</p><p>Identification of the potential cigarette smoke-associated mutation signature in the late mutations raises the possibility that patients with AITL/PTCL-NOS might have a higher risk for lung cancer or other smoking-associated cancers. To test this hypothesis, we compared the annual incidence rate of lung cancer in patients with AITL/PTCL-NOS (the current study cohort, n = 28, including one additional PTCL-NOS case without matched PB/BM control, patient #27, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and age-matched/adjusted general US population (n = 186,293,423, estimated) as control group. The data for the control group covering 12 years (2006–2017) in the 30–85+ age groups were downloaded from the CDC website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html">https://gis.cdc.gov/Cancer/USCS/DataViz.html</ext-link> (data not available after 2017). The patients in the current study cohort were diagnosed with AITL or PTCL-NOS during 12 years (2008–2019, Weill Cornell Medicine) with an age range of 33–84 years old (median, 65; mean, 62). The weights used in the age adjustment of the data are the proportion of the 2010 US standard population within each age group. The incidence rates of lung cancer were calculated according to the following formula: new lung cancer/age-matched population * 100,000 * weight for the age adjustment. Analysis shows that the incidence rate of lung cancer in AITL/PTCL-NOS is 172.3 times higher than that in the age-matched general population (11,547 vs. 67, p&lt;0.00001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), further demonstrating that AITL/PTCL-NOS, like lung cancer, might be causatively linked to smoking or involuntary smoking.</p><p>Medical records showed that 7 (26.9%) of the AITL/PTCL-NOS patients in our cohort were smokers (one passive smoking), 19 (73.1%) non-smokers, and 2 no records. Patient #27, one of the three patients with synchronous lung cancers, was documented with smoking history of one pack per day before onset of PTCL-NOS, and the other two lung cancer patients were non-smokers. No significant difference was detected in the C&gt;A or overall Signature 4 mutation burden per sample between evaluable smokers and non-smokers (average number of the C&gt;A mutations: 1 vs. 0.92, p=0.61). However, the top mutational signature extracted from the non-smokers still matched to the smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Although no clear association was demonstrated between smoking and development of AITL/PTCL-NOS, the overall findings suggest undocumented modest SHS as a potential source of the smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 seen in the late mutations of AITL/PTCL-NOS. It was estimated that 83.9% of non-smokers in the US population were exposed to SHS to various extents as evidenced by detectable metabolite of nicotine in sera in the early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2008</xref>).

We present here the clonal evolution patterns of these tumors based on the results of the mutation profiling for three patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One of these cases provides genetic evidence for the progression of CH to overt myeloid malignancy through acquisition of additional mutations (patient #5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Patient #20 illustrates that the AITL does not necessarily have to be the initially diagnosed malignancy in patients with both AITL and a second malignancy. The third case was an unusual case in which the patient (#14) had CH, AITL, as well as DLBCL, the latter was associated with acquisition of an <italic>EZH2</italic> hotspot mutation.

This observation prompted us to investigate the relationship between <italic>TET2</italic> mutation status and occurrence of multiple hematologic malignancies, specifically through assessing effects of <italic>TET2</italic> mutation status on probability of concomitant hematologic neoplasm-free survival in AITL patients. For Kaplan–Meier analysis shown below, the CHN-free survival time is defined as duration from AITL diagnosis to date of death without CHN or date of last follow-up without CHN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The event in the Kaplan–Meier analysis is occurrence of CHN (if yes, 1, no, 0) before they die or the last follow-up (right-censored). To increase the power of the statistical analysis, the patients included in our study were combined with an outside cohort of AITL patients whose relevant genomic and survival/CHN data were recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>), leading to the total number of 47 cases for CHN-free survival analysis.</p><p>The patients were initially divided into two groups: wild-type <italic>TET2</italic> group (no <italic>TET2</italic> mutation found in the BM/PB samples) and pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> mutant groups (one or more <italic>TET2</italic> mutation detected in the BM/PB samples). Although there was a trend that AITL patients with the pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> mutations detected in the BM/PB had a worse clinical outcome, no statistically significant differences in the second hematologic malignancy-free survival were observed (p-value=0.3273, stratified hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29), consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemonnier et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We further stratified the patients into the high <italic>TET2</italic> mutation burden and no or low <italic>TET2</italic> mutation burden subgroups. The criteria for inclusion in the first subgroup (n = 11) are as follows: (1) the CH identified in the BM/PB harbored two or more pathogenic mutations in <italic>TET2</italic>, including pathogenic SNVs, nonsense and frameshift mutations interpreted as ‘Tier 1’ or ‘Tier 2’ mutations according to a published professional guideline in molecular pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2017</xref>); (2) the VAF of each of the pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> variants described in (1) was ≥15%. The cases that did not meet these two criteria were assigned to the second subgroup (n = 36). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that AITL patients carrying two or more pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> mutations with high allelic burden (the first subgroup) had significantly shorter time in development of CHN (p-value=0.0006; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Cox proportional hazards model also estimated a significantly higher HR in the first subgroup (stratified HR, 14.01, 95% CI of ratio, 3.1–63). Further analysis shows that specificity and sensitivity of this CHN biomarker reach 97.2 and 72.7%, respectively, with 88.9% of positive predictive value (PPV) and 92.1% of negative predictive value (NPV). This survival analysis indicates that harboring two or more pathological mutations in <italic>TET2</italic> with relatively high allele burden (&gt;15%) is an independent risk factor to predict the second hematologic malignancies in AITL patients.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> mutation status in the bone marrow/peripheral blood (BM/PB) samples is a predictive biomarker for concomitant hematologic neoplasms in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) patients.</title><p>Kaplan–Meier analysis of concomitant hematologic neoplasm-free survival in AITL or AITL-related patients based on <italic>TET2</italic> mutation status in the BM/PB.

We demonstrated that in about 60% of AITL/PTLC-NOS patients identical pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> and/or <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations were shared between AITL/PTCL-NOS and CH found in the BM or PB. Studies of large cohorts have demonstrated an increased risk of hematologic malignancy for CH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>), but no definitive link has been established between CH and AITL/PTCL-NOS from those studies. Our findings suggest that these <italic>TET2</italic> and/or <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations may occur very early in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) before they give rise to the common lymphoid progenitors and common myeloid progenitors and propose a possible link between CH and development of AITL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiore et al., 2020a</xref>). Interestingly, the VAF of the CH-associated mutations is 22.5% on average in our cohort and is higher compared to the average VAF of CH-related mutations in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>). This observation is in line with the higher risk of hematopoietic malignancy associated with increased VAF (&gt;10%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren and Link, 2020</xref>). It is conceivable that certain <italic>TET2</italic> or <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations are stronger drivers that can result in more expanded CH and/or higher efficient T-cell lymphoma development. For example, as seen in patient #28, there were three <italic>TET2</italic> mutations identified in the LN, each of which appears to be present in separate clones and have different capacity to generate CH based on VAF in the BM (0, 5.47, and 10.89%, respectively). In addition, our study supports a mutated HSC as potential origin for AITL. As the <italic>TET2</italic> and/or <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations are propagated to the lymphoid and myeloid progeny of the mutated HSC, it can be speculated that in the lymphoid compartment the impacts of these mutations vary depending on the developmental and differentiation stage of the T-cells, and may be most felt in the T-cells of follicular helper cell origin (TFH). Lastly, our interesting case of an AITL patient with CH and subsequent development of DLBCL and the sharing of the same TET2 mutation among all three lesions suggest that a subset of DLBCL, possibly the molecular subtype characterized by mutated <italic>TET2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lacy et al., 2020</xref>), may originate from mutated HSC. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case in which the mutated HSC developed into three distinct tumors of diverse lineages.</p><p>The findings from this investigation confirm and extend the results previously published regarding the cellular origin of AITL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couronné et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quivoron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sakata-Yanagimoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwartz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tiacci et al., 2018</xref>). Most of these previous studies presented sporadic AITL cases in which the <italic>TET2</italic> or/and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations present in AITL were also found in their BM/PB compartments. Two reports showed that AITL shared the same <italic>TET2</italic> mutations with the isolated CD20<sup>+</sup>/CD19<sup>+</sup> (B-cells) or CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couronné et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwartz et al., 2017</xref>). These studies also pointed to a mutated HSC that gives rise to lymphoid and myeloid cells harboring the same mutations. A high-risk CH was also documented as the cellular origin of AITL and <italic>NPM1</italic>-mutated AML in a patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tiacci et al., 2018</xref>). While our manuscript was under preparation, the results of a study conceptually similar to ours regarding the cellular origin of AITL were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with our observations, the report showed that the mutations related to CH (i.e., <italic>TET2</italic> or <italic>DNMT3A</italic>) were detected in both the neoplastic T-cell and myeloid compartments in 15 out of 22 AITL patients (68%), and associated with second myeloid neoplasm development after the diagnosis of AITL in 4 cases. However, in their cohort, no cases were reported where AITL developed subsequent to myeloid neoplasms. Our study presented one such case (patient #20) whose AITL developed after 10 years of PV and the two hematologic neoplasms shared three identical <italic>JAK2</italic> and <italic>TET2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The identification of cases in which myeloid neoplasms precede the diagnosis of AITL provides additional supportive evidence to the postulation that the mutated HSCs are the common origin for these hematologic neoplasms, which develop independently and divergently in tumor evolution. Whether AITL precedes or develops subsequent to the myeloid neoplasms may depend on the stochastic dynamics of the clonal evolution.</p><p>Additional late non-CH mutations are found in 68.4% of the AITL/PTCL-NOS in our cohort, consistent with the belief that CH-associated <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations are insufficient for tumorigenesis and additional genetic alterations are required. Consistent with this notion, in AITL animal models, <italic>TET2</italic> disruption or <italic>RHOA<sup>G17V</sup></italic> expression alone failed to induce AITL development; however, AITL-like lymphoma developed once <italic>TET2</italic> disruption and <italic>RHOA<sup>G17V</sup></italic> expression were combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). For the development of myeloid neoplasms, additional mutations beyond CH-associated <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutations drive further clonal expansion from CH. These mutations may be acquired early (patient #20, <italic>JAK2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or late during tumor development (patient # 24, <italic>JAK2</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We discovered that the late non-CH mutations are enriched for the missense mutations and the C&gt;A substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Further analysis identified the major mutational signatures that were very similar (CCS = 0.9) in the Cornell and Kyoto cohorts (LM_Sign.01 vs. Kyoto_Sign.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). The main features shared by these two signatures were the enriched C&gt;A mutations and the closest match with the smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 (CCS = 0.5–0.55) among all 30 established signatures (SBS30). The C&gt;A base substitutions as a result of the LM_Sign.01 or Kyoto_Sign.01 signature activity are related to critical mutations in a number of oncogenic genes, including <italic>RHOA</italic>, <italic>TET2,</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic>. This finding may have implications on treatment and prevention of AITL. It is believed that the C&gt;A mutations associated with Signature 4 are likely caused by mis-replication or mis-repairing of DNA damage induced by tobacco carcinogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandrov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>), which largely result in missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackford et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this causative link are our findings that the majority of the late non-CH mutations identified in our cohort were missense mutation (75.2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and that the patients with AITL/PTCL-NOS have a 172.3-fold increased risk for development of lung cancer compared to the age-matched/adjusted general population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Medical records showed that 19 out of 26 AITL/PTCL-NOS cases were non-smokers, but the major mutational signature extracted from them still matched with smoking-associated Signature 4 (CCS = 0.48) among SBS30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to misreporting and undocumented SHS, which were observed in 13.8% of non-smokers with lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandrov et al., 2016</xref>). In our cohort, patient #7 was recorded as a non-smoker, but carried many smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 mutations (two mutations per megabase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The CDC screening study showed that between 1988 and 1994, 20.9% of non-smokers in the US population were exposed to home SHS (at least one family member was a smoker), and 83.9% were exposed to SHS to various degrees during 1988–1994 as cotinine (the main metabolite of nicotine) could be detected at a level of &gt;0.05 ng/ml in the sera of non-smokers. This suggests that most of the patients included in this study might have been exposed to undocumented SHS for ~25–50 years when they were diagnosed with AITL/PTCL-NOS from 2008 to 2019 because 86% of the patients were 50 years old or older (median, 65). Since there is no safe level of SHS exposure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm</ext-link>), it is conceivable that exposure to undocumented SHS may lead to the gradual accumulation of Signature 4 mutations in the Cornell cohort. In the Kyoto cohort (TFH-PTCL), a similar situation might apply. In Japan, a recent study showed that the overall prevalence of SHS exposure in workplaces, restaurants, and bars were 49, 55, and 83% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sansone et al., 2020</xref>). These data may partially explain the accumulation of COSMIC Signature 4-like driver mutations in the non-smokers. Consequently, our findings suggest that cessation of smoking or avoiding exposure to SHS in home or public places may be a potential effective intervention to prevent AITL development in higher risk population, particularly those already found to harbor CH.</p><p>On the contrary, the CH-associated genetic alterations in the current cohort are characterized primarily by the C&gt;T and C&gt;G mutations (64% of all the mutations) in <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>). Analysis revealed that this mutation pattern primarily matched to COSMIC Signature 2 (CCS = 0.65, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which was reported to be associated with the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases or aging-dependent function decline of base-excision repair machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>). This mutational mechanism might also play a role in the non-CH late mutations as 35% of the non-CH mutations were C&gt;T substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Interestingly, reduced accumulation of the C to T mutations by inactivation of <italic>AID</italic> blocked development of B-cell malignancies in aging <italic>TET2</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mouly et al., 2018</xref>), implying that AID might be a therapeutic targeting candidate for lymphoma, including AITL.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that CH associated with multiple-hit <italic>TET2</italic> (defined as ≥2 pathogenic <italic>TET2</italic> mutations with VAFs of ≥15%) is an independent risk factor for development of concurrent hematologic malignancies in AITL patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Recently, certain features of CH predictive of hematopoietic malignancy development were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warren and Link, 2020</xref>). These features include &gt;1 mutated gene, VAF &gt;10%, and mutations in specific genes and variants, for example, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>IDH1/2</italic>. Our <italic>TET2</italic> biomarker includes two or more mutations and VAF of at least 15%. However, <italic>TET2</italic> has not been previously implicated as a marker for increased risk of hematologic malignancy in CH in general. It is possible that this multiple-hit TET2 biomarker is specific and only relevant in the setting of patients with AITL and CH. Mechanistically, two or more <italic>TET2</italic> mutations each with relatively high mutation burden (≥15%) correlate with increased clonal expansion and/or more severe disruption of TET2 activity, thereby increasing the global chance of acquiring additional driver mutations and hence increased risk for development of second hematologic neoplasms. Consistent with this hypothesis, aging <italic>TET2</italic>-deficient mice develop diverse hematologic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2017</xref>). A reliable predictor for concurrent hematologic malignancies may be helpful for clinical stratification and management for this subset of the AITL patients.</p><p>In summary, our study provides genomic evidence of a potential origin of AITL/PTCL-NOS from a mutated HSC clone, which can be associated with CH as well as development of myeloid and even B-cell malignancies. The development of these hematopoietic malignancies of different lineages occurs via divergent evolution from the mutated hematopoietic precursor clone, often with acquisition of additional mutations frequently induced by the C&gt;A-associated mutagenic agents like tobacco. We also identified a potential biomarker: two or more pathogenic TET2 mutations with high mutation burden for the development of second hematologic neoplasm in AITL patients. Single-cell methodology will help definitively determine the clonal architecture in lymphoma and BM with multiple mutations and enhance our understanding of the initiation of tumor induced by CH-associated mutations.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki regulations of the protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA.

rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: six illustrative cases in which common mutated HSC developed into CH and AITL or PTCL-NOS</title><p>In patient #1, identical <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> somatic mutations, p.E1089fs and p.F791L, were identified both in CH (VAFs: 48.39%, 34.62%) and in the neoplastic T-cells in the diagnostic LN specimen (VAFs: 36.87%, 27.59%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The other three pathogenic variants, <italic>TET2</italic> p.Q743*, <italic>RHOA</italic> p.G17V, and <italic>IDH2</italic> p.R172T, were detected at high VAFs in the LN but at much lower VAFs in the PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results demonstrate that the latter four mutations are likely acquired at a later time point during AITL development (late mutations) and the low-VAF variants detected in the PB represent minimal involvement in the PB and not CH. Patient #4 had no overt evidence of a myeloid neoplasm in the BM while diagnosed with AITL, and had 2.1% BM involvement by AITL according to immunophenotypic and gene rearrangement studies. The T-cell NGS panel identified seven pathogenic mutations in the primary lymphoma, of which six were also found in the matched BM. The allelic burden of the two mutations with the highest VAFs (<italic>DNMT3A</italic> p.Q678*, VAF = 6.22%; <italic>ATP1A3</italic> p.V216M, VAF = 4.47%) was 2–3 times that of the estimated TB (2.1%) in the BM, suggesting that <italic>DNMT3A</italic> p.Q678* and <italic>ATP1A3</italic> p.V216M were not only present in the neoplastic T-cells but also associated with CH. The other five mutations, including <italic>RHOA</italic> p.G17V and <italic>IDH2</italic> p.R172G, were found at the VAFs ranging from 0% to 1.5% in the BM, consistent with lymphoma involvement rather than CH. These results suggest that these five mutations were acquired subsequent to the CH-associated mutations described above. Interestingly, sequencing a relapsed lymphoma specimen from this case identified only one mutation <italic>DNMT3A</italic> p.Q678*. This mutation information in the relapsed lymphoma helps clarify the clonal architecture of both the primary AITL and CH. First, it suggests that the primary AITL harbored two clones, a dominant clone with <italic>ATP1A3</italic>, <italic>DLGAP3</italic>, <italic>TET2</italic>, <italic>RHOA,</italic> and <italic>IDH2</italic> mutations, and a minor clone with <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutation, the latter being the precursor clone for relapse. Second, it also implies that there are two clones in CH, one associated with the <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutation and the other with the <italic>ATP1A3</italic> mutation. In patient #10, the CH-associated variant shared between the primary lymphoma and the matched BM, <italic>TET2</italic> p.N1484K, was identified at high allelic burden in both the lymphoma and BM samples (VAFs in LN vs. BM, 47.33% vs. 38.26%). Another <italic>TET2</italic> mutation, p.D1378G, was also identified in both the LN and the BM, at VAFs of 16.89% and 0.32%, respectively. The large difference of the VAF in the BM of the two <italic>TET2</italic> mutations suggests that they may belong to different HSC clones, each of which has markedly different CH contribution, or the <italic>TET2</italic> p.D1378G mutation was acquired subsequent to the <italic>TET2</italic> p.N1484K mutation as a subclonal mutation in the HSC. The other three mutations, <italic>TET2</italic> p.V415fs, <italic>RHOA</italic> p.G17V, and <italic>IDH2</italic> p.R172T, were present exclusively in the lymphoma sample. In patient #29, the <italic>DNMT3A</italic> R882H hotspot mutation was shared at high VAFs in both the lymphoma and BM (46% and 35.6%), consistent with a CH-associated mutation, while the other four mutations detected in the LN were present in the BM at low VAFs, consistent with BM involvement by T-cell lymphoma. Interestingly, both the <italic>TET2</italic> N1484K mutation in patient #10 and the <italic>DNMT3A</italic> R882H mutation in patient #29 were present in the primary lymphomas at a VAF of close to 50%, about 3–4 times the allelic fractions of other mutations identified in the LN. This finding implies the presence of these mutations in almost the entire cell population in the LN. However, based on immuno-morphological evaluation and the VAF of the other mutations identified in the LN, the TB in the LN for these two cases is about 20–40%. This raises the possibility that besides the neoplastic T-cells, reactive lymphocytes in these two cases might also harbor the CH-associated mutations.</p><p>In the two PTCL-NOS cases (#2 and #18), we observed similar findings as described above for AITL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Patient #2 showed eosinophilia with 1.5% neoplastic T-cells involvement in the BM. Two pathogenic <italic>STAT3</italic> mutations were identified. One could be considered a CH-associated mutation (<italic>STAT3</italic> p.Y657_K658insALL, VAFs in LN vs. BM, 21.61% vs. 8.34%) since its VAF is considerably higher than the estimated percentage of tumor involvement in the BM. The other is most likely PTCL-NOS-related mutation (<italic>STAT3</italic> p.W474*). This <italic>STAT3</italic> nonsense mutation had the allelic burden of 18.33% in the primary lymphoma but was present at much lower level (VAF = 2%) in the matched PB, in line with the estimated TB. Patient #18 presented mildly hypercellular marrow with mild granulocytic hyperplasia while diagnosed with PTCL-NOS and had no involvement in the BM per the overall pathological studies. The NGS target panel identified a splice mutation in <italic>TET2</italic> (c.3501–1G&gt;A) and a missense mutation in <italic>SETX</italic> (p.Y2258D) shared between CH and PTCL-NOS. Two mutations (<italic>TP53</italic> p.P151T and <italic>ARID1A</italic> p.G779*) were only found in the neoplastic T-cells, presumably representing later mutations in PTCL-NOS development following acquisition of the <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>SETX</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: three AITL cases with concurrent hematologic neoplasm</title><p>Patient #5 was initially diagnosed as AITL, followed by a diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 7 months later. In the BM specimen, taken 4 months prior to the diagnosis of CMML and sequenced in this study, the overall pathological findings showed 1–5% involvement by AITL and suspected involvement by a myeloid neoplasm. Three identical mutations, including two <italic>TET2</italic> and one <italic>DNMT3A</italic> mutation, p.I274delinsISfs, p.L1830*, and p.W893S alterations, respectively, were identified in both the LN and BM with high allele burdens (VAF range, 25–50% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In addition, pathogenic <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>JAK2</italic> mutations were identified in the BM. These findings support a scenario in which AITL and CMML arose via divergent evolution from a common HSC clone mutated in the CH-associated <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>DNMT3A</italic> genes. Subsequent development involves accumulation of additional mutations: <italic>SRSF2</italic> and <italic>JAK2</italic> mutations from CH to CMML, and <italic>IDH2</italic> with other mutations to AITL.</p><p>Patient #20 was initially diagnosed with PV and progressed to post-PV PMF after 10 years. Two months later, the patient was also diagnosed with AITL. We sequenced the T-cell lymphoma in the LN and the paired BM specimen with post-PV PMF (the initial PV specimen was unavailable). The overall pathological studies showed no lymphoma involvement in the BM. The NGS revealed that the T- and myeloid malignant cells harbored two identical destructive <italic>TET2</italic> mutations with high mutant allele burdens, p.Q939* (20% VAF) and p. E1026delinsXDfs (42% VAF). The driver mutation for MPN, <italic>JAK2</italic> p.V617F, was not only present in the post-PV PMF (88% VAF), but also found in the concomitant AITL with the mutant allele burden of 54.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). No <italic>IDH2</italic> or <italic>RHOA</italic> mutation was detected in the AITL. These findings suggest that the <italic>JAK2</italic> driver mutation was acquired early in the HSC. Indeed, <italic>JAK2</italic> mutation was thought to be an early event in PV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellanné-Chantelot et al., 2006</xref>). In this particular case, the combination of <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>JAK2</italic> V617F may also be sufficient to drive AITL development as no other drivers like <italic>IDH2</italic> or <italic>RHOA</italic> were found.</p><p>Patient #14 initially presented as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and had a splenectomy in 2008. He was diagnosed with AITL 2 years later and DLBCL about 7 years later. We sequenced two diagnostic tissue samples for the AITL and DLBCL, respectively, as well as one BM sample collected from this patient in 2010. The morphological, immunophenotyping, and molecular findings confirmed that the BM sample was not involved by AITL or a myeloid neoplasm. Interestingly, two nonsense <italic>TET2</italic> mutations, p.K454* and p.K1799*, were identified in all three samples with the VAFs ranging from 32% to 51%. An additional pathological mutation <italic>EZH2</italic>, p.Y646S, was detected only in the DLBCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The results from this patient suggest that the mutated HSC clone, harboring <italic>TET2</italic> p.K454* and p.K1799* alterations, differentiates into progeny cells of three different lineages (myeloid, T lymphoid, B lymphoid), each of which gives rise to CH, or transformed to AITL or DLBCL. The additional <italic>EZH2</italic> mutation has been reported in B-cell lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Béguelin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morin et al., 2010</xref>) and likely plays a role in the DLBCL development.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66395.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Olszewski</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Brown University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gibson</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gaulard</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238220">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.25.20238220v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Through analysis of mutational signatures and observation of frequent secondary lung cancers it further raises a hypothesis of a two-hit pathogenesis of AITL (underlying age-related clonal hematopoiesis followed by smoking-induced driver mutation). It further generates a hypothesis about risk of second hematologic malignancy in patients with AITL related to high-burden TET2 mutations.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mutation analysis links angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma to clonal hematopoiesis and smoking&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Gibson (Reviewer #1); Philippe Gaulard (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper was overall reviewed favorably, although the principally novel part relates to the mutation signatures, and that part was also the one most questioned from the methodological point of view. It is not uncertain if this analysis can be made more reliable. Similar questions arose regarding the epidemiologic incidence and survival analyses.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analysis of C&gt;A mutation signature (the principal novel finding beyond the Lewis paper) will need to be presented more in-depth to assess its validity which is under question.</p><p>– Details of the analytical pipeline used for variant calling and annotation will be needed. The Fiore reference is insufficient.</p><p>– DNA changes (apart from protein changes) will need to be listed in the supplemental table 2.</p><p>– Coverage data and total read counts for the variants can help alleviate this concern. Discuss strand bias if observed.</p><p>– Consider validation in public AITL/PTCL datasets.</p><p>2) Association with smoking is undermined by lack of data on smoking history of included patients – please add to the case listing if possible, and report if the C&gt;A signature was observable preferentially in smokers.</p><p>3) The fact that origin of mutations (lymphoma, CH, other malignancy) is only hypothesized (on the basis of local VAF) and not confirmed directly is a major weakness, particularly in cases with multiple malignancies. Consider either a more reliable cell-specific confirmation (as performed in one patient), or reframe results and conclusions acknowledging the hypothetical nature of these assignments. The speculation about &quot;mutated hematopoietic stem cells&quot; is very far going without any identification of hematopoietic cells in the samples.</p><p>4) The epidemiologic analysis of association between AITL and lung cancer is methodologically questionable. The methods for calculation of &quot;prevalence&quot; of lung cancer in an &quot;aging-matched population&quot; are undefined. Prevalence is an unreliable endpoint as it depends on method/length of observation and is sensitive to ascertainment bias. The validity of statistical testing between very different cohorts shown is highly dubious. Use of standardized incidence rates would be more reliable. Similarly, the analysis of TET2 mutations and secondary cancers is questionable if it does not consider high-dose chemotherapy and differential mortality between the groups, with a suggestion of nearly 100% survival in patients in the &quot;no/low TET mutation burden&quot; which is clinically unrealistic.</p><p>5) More information is needed about the cases and samples. The criteria for including 2 PTCL, NOS patients (and not others) are confusing. The temporal origin of the samples (tumor and marrow/blood) is unclear – were these truly &quot;diagnostic&quot; (ie. both before any treatment) or were any after treatment/transplant, and what was the temporal distance between node and marrow sampling.</p><p>6) There are many comments on the wording of some conclusions, including unsupported extrapolation of risk from AITL patients to those with age-related CH, unsupported recommendations for treatment – that will need to be corrected and clarified point by point using the &quot;Recommendations for the authors&quot; sections below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I am concerned that the C&gt;A mutation signature you identify in your late mutations could be partially artifact. C&gt;A (G&gt;T) mutations are a frequent source of artifact in some library preparation methods. Characteristically, they can be identified by bias to the F1R2 read pair configuration (if G&gt;T) or the F2R1 configuration (C&gt;A)(more here: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890571-OxoG-oxidative-artifacts). Details of the analytical pipeline used for variant calling and annotation were not provided. OxoG artifacts are usually only a small number of reads, but you did not provide coverage data or total read counts for the variants reported in your supplemental table, so it's not possible to infer the number of alt reads from the VAF.</p><p>Additionally, it is not possible to tell which SNVs in the table are C&gt;A since only the amino acid changes are reported.

P6 L83: a more detailed description of the &quot;538-gene targeted NGS panel&quot; (what genes? what sequencing and capture technique? potentially a Supplementary file); the reference to Fiore et al. does not contain information about this assay. It appears that the bone marrow/blood was sequenced using a different assay – what was the overlap or quantitative comparability of these assays?</p><p>2. Please indicate (in Supplementary file 1, which would be better fitted in the main paper) the temporal origin of the samples (tumor and marrow/blood) – were these truly &quot;diagnostic&quot; (ie. both before any treatment) or were any after treatment/transplant, and what temporal distance between node and marrow.</p><p>3. In 30% of patients there were no CH mutations, although some patients apparently had also typical CH mutations (TET2). Where these cases genomically different than CH-derived AITLs? Are there undetected or regressed CH clones in these patients? (interesting particularly in the context of potential sampling time in relationship to treatment – ie. could CH clones be more/less evident in samples collected after chemotherapy)?</p><p>4. There are many figures and tables that just show the same data in the paper, and this would really benefit from a better organization. &quot;Supplementary file 2&quot;, &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 5&quot;, &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 1 C&quot; just show all the same data, including numbers, which are also the same data from Figure 1A, &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 2&quot;, and &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 3&quot;, just in various iterations. I would encourage authors to show these data in a more concise and less repetitive way.</p><p>5. The data on different SNV patterns in &quot;CH&quot; and &quot;late&quot; mutations are intriguing, although need validation, and leave some aspects open. The tobacco-related &quot;Signature 4&quot; is characterized by C&gt;A mutations with strand bias – was strand bias observed in these data? Similarly, APOBEC-related C&gt;T mutations should occur preferentially at TpC sites-was this observed?</p><p>6. The methods for calculation of &quot;prevalence&quot; of lung cancer in an &quot;aging(sic)-matched population&quot; are unclear and should be explained. Prevalence is a poor indicator of association, as it depends on length of observation and is sensitive to ascertainment bias. The validity of statistical testing between different cohorts shown is highly dubious, as data were not collected consistently. Can the authors use more standard methods (standardized incidence rate) to examine the incidence of lung cancer in patients with AITL compared with truly matched general population? (a cursory look at US registry data suggests that there may be no such association).</p><p>7. Data about &quot;evolution&quot; of mutated HSC into AITL or myeloid disorders through acquisition of additional mutations remain speculative without cell separation. In patient 5, there is no evidence that JAK2 variant is &quot;specific to CMML&quot;, and it is also unclear if in Patient #14 TET2 variants were present in DLBCL (or AITL for that matter), or were bystanders from CH cells in the tumor. This is difficult to describe as &quot;evidence&quot;, and it should be interpreted as an unconfirmed hypothesis, unless the authors can provide some cell type-specific data. The conclusion that &quot;mutated HSC developed into three distinct tumors&quot; is too far-going considering that no attempt to determine presence of mutation is specific lineages was performed.</p><p>8. The data on TET2 mutations and secondary hematologic malignancies need to take into context patients' treatment (e.g. receipt of ASCT), and rate of mortality. It is not clear how the endpoint that the authors present was defined-are deaths counted as events? It is unlikely that 80% of studied patients have 100% survival rate. Consider using a more standard method (cumulative incidence) accounting for differential rates of mortality between these groups. Patients who survive for a long time and undergo ASCT have a naturally higher probability of developing a secondary cancer. It is also not clear if patients without evidence of clonal hematopoiesis are included in this analysis, but presence of CH by itself is a known risk factor for hematologic cancers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66395.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analysis of C&gt;A mutation signature (the principal novel finding beyond the Lewis paper) will need to be presented more in-depth to assess its validity which is under question.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we agree that the C&gt;A mutation pattern should be analyzed more deeply. Five new figures were added as the supplements to Figure 2 to address this concern.</p><p>We extracted the major mutational signatures from the genomic data generated in this study (Cornell cohort, late mutations, LM) and a public targeted genomic data set from TFH-PTCL patients (n=44, referring as to Kyoto cohort hereafter) with MutSignatures (a new R package). In these two independent cohorts (Cornell vs Kyoto), the top mutational signatures (LM_Sign.01 vs Kyoto_Sign.01) (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, 3) were highly active in more than half of the cases in their cohorts, and very similar (cosine similarity ≈ 0.9, new Figure 2—figure supplement 4, p.15-17). Both LM_Sign.01 and Kyoto_Sign.01 were charactered by the enriched C&gt;A mutations at TpCpC trinucleotide motif with transcriptional strand bias (mutation rate of C&gt;A on the forward strand is 2-4 times that of G&gt;T on the reverse strand). These C&gt;A mutations often affected two critical genes (RHOA G17V and TET2 disruption), which is required for development of AITL-like lymphoma in mouse model (PMID: 32704161). Analysis shows that both LM_Sign.01 and Kyoto_Sign.01 have the closest match with smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 among all 30 established Signatures (SBS30, version 2), supporting the potential link between AITL/PTCL_NOS and active smoking or secondary exposure to cigarette smoke.

Combined with the overall deep coverage for all the variants called (Supplementary file 3, median coverage per variant = 1366 reads), the ‘fake’ variant calling due to the strand bias in sequencing were ruled out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Consider validation in public AITL/PTCL datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>As replied above, we analyzed a published targeted sequencing dataset from a large cohort of patients with TFH-PTCL (n=44) (PMID: 31092896). There are several reasons why we chose this public data set: (1) the largest TFH-PTCL sample size published to date; (2) like our T cell panel, the data set was generated by a targeted panel that covered many frequently mutated genes in hematologic neoplasms, including AITL; (3) limited availability of public evaluable exome or whole genome sequencing data in AITL. Analysis showed that the main mutational signature (Kyoto_Sign.01), which was very similar with LM_Sign.01 extracted from the AITL late mutations (CCS ≈0.9), had the closest match with the smoking-associated COSMIC signature 4 (version 2, March 2015), further strengthening the potential link between AITL/TFH-PTCL development and smoking (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2. 3, 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Association with smoking is undermined by lack of data on smoking history of included patients – please add to the case listing if possible, and report if the C&gt;A signature was observable preferentially in smokers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent point. We added the documented smoking status to the revised Supplementary file 1. Of the evaluable patients (2 patients had no records, and hence excluded), 7 (26.9%) were smokers, 19 (73.1%) non-smokers. Due to statistical limitation, MutSignatures failed to compare de-novo mutational signature from the smokers to the mutational pattern of the non-smokers. There is no significant difference in the C&gt;A or overall mutation burden per sample between these two subgroups (average number of the C&gt;A mutations in the smokers vs nonsmokers: 1 vs 0.92, p = 0.61).</p><p>However, the top mutational signature extracted from the non-smokers still matched to smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 (new Figure 2—figure supplement 5). For this discrepancy possible explanations are as follows (p.25-26): “This discrepancy may be due to misreporting and undocumented secondhand smoking (SHS), which were observed in 13.8% of lung cancers in non-smokers (PMID: 27811275). In our cohort, Pt#7 was recorded as a non-smoker, but carried many smoking-associated COSMIC Signature 4 mutations (2 mutations per megabase, new Figure 2--figure supplement 2C). The CDC screening studies showed that between 1988 and 1994, 20.9% of non-smokers in the U.S. population were exposed to home SHS (at least one family member was a smoker),and 83.9% were exposed to SHS to various degrees during 1988-1994 as cotinine (themain metabolite of nicotine) could be detected at a level of &gt; 0.05 ng/ml in the sera of non-smokers (PMID: 18614993 and PMID: 30521502). This suggests that most of the patients included in this study may have been exposed to undocumented SHS for more than 25-50 years when they were diagnosed with AITL/PTCL-NOS from 2008 to 2019, because 86% of the patients were 50 years old or older (Median, 65). Since there is nosafe level of SHS exposure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets3/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets3/secondhand_smoke/health_effects/index.htm</ext-link>), it is conceivable that exposure to undocumented SHS may lead to the accumulation of Signature 4 mutations in the Cornell cohort. In the Kyoto cohort of TFH-PTCL, a similar situation may apply. In Japan, a recent study showed that the overall prevalence of SHS exposure in workplaces, restaurants, and bars were 49%, 55%, and 83% (PMID: 32033243). These data may partially explain the accumulation of COSMIC Signature 4-like driver mutations in the non-smokers. Consequently, our findings suggest that cessation of smoking or avoiding exposure to SHS in home or public places may be a potential effective intervention to prevent AITL development in higher risk population, particularly those already found to harbor CH.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The fact that origin of mutations (lymphoma, CH, other malignancy) is only hypothesized (on the basis of local VAF) and not confirmed directly is a major weakness, particularly in cases with multiple malignancies. Consider either a more reliable cell-specific confirmation (as performed in one patient), or reframe results and conclusions acknowledging the hypothetical nature of these assignments. The speculation about &quot;mutated hematopoietic stem cells&quot; is very far going without any identification of hematopoietic cells in the samples.</p></disp-quote><p>The paper by the MSKCC team (Lewis et al., Blood advance, 2020) has demonstrated that the shared mutations between CH and AITL were indeed present in CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Unfortunately, it is difficult for us to repeat this type of experiment at this moment because we no longer have the archived BM samples for CD34 enrichment. We will certainly consider conducting this type experiment in a future study if suitable samples become available.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have reframed the results and conclusions to reflect the hypothetical nature of these assignments: “Mutation profiling of AITL/PTCL-NOS and matched BM/PB supports a potential origin of AITL/PTCL-NOS from mutated hematopoietic precursors associated with clonal hematopoiesis” (p.11, line 172-174); “Our findings suggest that these TET2 and/or DNMT3A mutations may occur very early in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) before they give rise to the common lymphoid progenitors and common myeloid progenitors “ (p.22, line 411-412); “our study supports a mutated HSC as potential origin for AITL” (p.22, line 422-423).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The epidemiologic analysis of association between AITL and lung cancer is methodologically questionable. The methods for calculation of &quot;prevalence&quot; of lung cancer in an &quot;aging-matched population&quot; are undefined. Prevalence is an unreliable endpoint as it depends on method/length of observation and is sensitive to ascertainment bias. The validity of statistical testing between very different cohorts shown is highly dubious. Use of standardized incidence rates would be more reliable.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have replaced the prevalence with incidence rates and compared the incidence rates of lung cancer between US general population and the current study cohort: “In these two independent populations, the incidence rates of lung cancer were calculated according to the following formula: new lung cancer /aging-matched population*100000* weight for the age adjustment. Analysis shows that the incidence rate of lung cancer in AITL/PTCL-NOS is 172.3 times higher than that in the age-matched general population (11547 vs 67, P&lt;0.00001) (Figure 2D)” (p.17-18).</p><p>The CLL subgroup has been removed because the published data are insufficient for calculation of its incidence rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the analysis of TET2 mutations and secondary cancers is questionable if it does not consider high-dose chemotherapy and differential mortality between the groups, with a suggestion of nearly 100% survival in patients in the &quot;no/low TET mutation burden&quot; which is clinically unrealistic.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation in this section was not very clear. It is indeed impossible that 100% of the AITL patients with no/low TET2 low mutation burden survived. The event in this analysis should have been whether AITL patients developed the concomitant hematologic neoplasm (CHN, if yes, event occurrence) before they died or the last follow-up (right-censored) rather than simply survival or death. The aim is to explore the relationship between TET2 mutations status/burden and occurrence of CHN when the patients live, hopefully to identify a potential biomarker to predict CHN development in this specific population. To clarify this, additional explanation has been added to the text: “This observation prompted us to investigate the relationship between TET2 mutation status and occurrence of multiple hematologic malignancies, specifically through assessing the effects of TET2 mutation status on the probability of concomitant hematologic neoplasm-free survival in AITL patients. […] The event in the Kaplan-Meier analysis is occurrence of CHN (if yes, 1, no, 0) before they die or the last follow-up (right-censored).” (p.19).</p><p>Additionally, this analysis has been updated according to the latest CHN status and CHN-free survival time collected on May 20,2021 (Supplementary file 1), the conclusion remains unchanged. We would like to point out that, consistent with the CHN biomarker finding, Pt #24 with high TET2 mutation burden, diagnosed with AITL in June, 2018, developed the concomitant hematologic neoplasm (PV) in November, 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) More information is needed about the cases and samples.

We will consider this type of analysis in the future once an evaluable published data set is accessible. However, we performed additional signature analysis in the CH mutations (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), further demonstrating the link between the APOBEC/AID-associated variants and AITL as described on Page 14-15: “We extracted two major de-novo mutational signatures (CH_Sign.01 and 02, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) from the CH-related mutations by MutSignatures (Fantini et al., Scientific reports, 2020). CH_Sign.01 is characterized by the enriched C&gt;T substitutions at the trinucleotide motif Tp<bold>C</bold>pA (mutated base presented as bold), and CH_Sign.02 is enriched with C&gt;T at Cp<bold>C</bold>pA/Gp<bold>C</bold>pG plus the increased C to G substitutions at Tp<bold>C</bold>pG. A cosine correlation similarity (CCS) was used to evaluate closeness between the CH de-novo and COSMIC (SBS30, version 2) signatures. CCS, measured as 1- cosine distance, ranges from zero to one. Zero denotes completely different mutational signatures and one signifies identical signatures. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, CH_Sign.01 demonstrates the best match with COSMIC Signature 2 (CCS = 0.65), which is associated with activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases (Alexandrov et al., 2013). The characterized trinucleotide change in CH¬Sign.01, TpCpA to TpTpA, is also the hallmark of COSMIC Signature 2. Analysis of the CH mutations as the consequence of each mutational signature per sample showed that the activity of CH-Sign.01 dominated in 75% (15/20) of the AITL/PTCL-NOS samples (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C), indicating a potential major role of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases in the generation of CH-associated mutations in AITL.”</p><p>For the link with lung cancer, we were unable to find evaluable public data for incidence analysis in AITL patients.

Histological examination has a low sensitivity and AITL cells might lack distinct morphological or immunophenotypic features in the BM/PB samples, potentially leading to false negativity in histological or immunophenotyping estimation in some cases (for example, Pt #1, #5, #12). To avoid these potential pitfalls, besides considering morphological findings, the TB estimate was also based on more objective and sensitive immunophenotypic findings (flow cytometry, Flow). If flow is negative and T-cell receptor γ gene rearrangement (TCRG) is positive, we estimate TB based on the analytic sensitivity of the TCRG assay, which is about 1-5%. If both Flow and TCRG are negative, the VAFs of the T cell lymphoma-associated variants like RHOA p.

It appears that the bone marrow/blood was sequenced using a different assay – what was the overlap or quantitative comparability of these assays?</p></disp-quote><p>A new Supplementary file 2 presents the genes covered by the T cell or Myeloid targeted panels.

Using an input of genomic DNA of at least 100 ng isolated from frozen tissues or FFPE samples, the next-generation sequencing (NGS) libraries were constructed using the KAPA Hyperplus Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and hybrid selection was performed with the probes from the customized Twist Library Prep Kit (Twist Biosciences, San Francisco, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Please indicate (in Supplementary file 1, which would be better fitted in the main paper) the temporal origin of the samples (tumor and marrow/blood) – were these truly &quot;diagnostic&quot; (ie. both before any treatment) or were any after treatment/transplant, and what temporal distance between node and marrow.</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal origin of the BM/PB samples were added to Supplementary file 1, including reported diagnostic or treatment status while they were sampled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In 30% of patients there were no CH mutations, although some patients apparently had also typical CH mutations (TET2). Where these cases genomically different than CH-derived AITLs? Are there undetected or regressed CH clones in these patients? (interesting particularly in the context of potential sampling time in relationship to treatment – ie could CH clones be more/less evident in samples collected after chemotherapy)?</p></disp-quote><p>In the cases with no CH mutations identifiable by the T cell panel (n=8), the genomic mutation pattern was characterized by the enriched <italic>RHOA</italic> (62.5%) and <italic>TET2</italic> (50%) mutations, similar with that of the late mutation in the CH-derived AITLs (<italic>RHOA</italic>, 67%; <italic>TET2</italic>, 48%). Thus there is no difference in major genomic mutation landscape between the cases with and without CH mutations.</p><p>Indeed, undetected CH clones in those cases without identifiable CH mutations can’t be ruled out because the T cell panel only covered 537 genes or due to cytotoxic treatment. For example, PPM1D, a gene frequently mutated in CH due to chemotherapy, was not part of the T cell panel.</p><p>Additionally, we assessed the effect of chemotherapy on CH mutation burden by comparing the number of CH mutations in the BM/PB samples collected before (n=21) or with ongoing/after (n=6) chemotherapy. For 6 BM/PB samples with chemotherapy, the time interval from start of chemotherapy to BM/PB sampling was 2.5 to 17 months. As shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), the number of the CH mutations in such two subgroups was comparable (median: 1 vs 1; mean: 1.52 vs 1.33 per sample), hence the CH mutation burden was similar with and without chemotherapy (p = 0.77, t test).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66395-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The data on different SNV patterns in &quot;CH&quot; and &quot;late&quot; mutations are intriguing, although need validation, and leave some aspects open. The tobacco-related &quot;Signature 4&quot; is characterized by C&gt;A mutations with strand bias – was strand bias observed in these data?</p></disp-quote><p>As replied to point #1 of essential revision, we observed the strand bias associated with COSMIC Signature 4 (p.16-17). More specifically, of 22 C to A mutations identified in the Cornell cohort, 17 were on the forward strand (C to A) and 5 the reverse strand (G to T). Therefore, the strand bias here is at C:G base pairs where mutation of C exceeded mutation of G by 2.4 folds (17/5=3.4). Consistent with this, among 43 C to A mutations identified in Kyoto cohort (TFH-PTCL), 32 were on the forward strand and 11 the reverse strand (the difference was 1.9 folds). These findings support the similarity among LM_Sign.01, Kyoto_Sign.01 and COSMIC Signature 4 associated with smoking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, APOBEC-related C&gt;T mutations should occur preferentially at TpC sites-was this observed?</p></disp-quote><p>The answer is Yes.

The methods for calculation of &quot;prevalence&quot; of lung cancer in an &quot;aging(sic)-matched population&quot; are unclear and should be explained. Prevalence is a poor indicator of association, as it depends on length of observation and is sensitive to ascertainment bias. The validity of statistical testing between different cohorts shown is highly dubious, as data were not collected consistently. Can the authors use more standard methods (standardized incidence rate) to examine the incidence of lung cancer in patients with AITL compared with truly matched general population? (a cursory look at US registry data suggests that there may be no such association).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Please see our reply to point #4 of essential revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Data about &quot;evolution&quot; of mutated HSC into AITL or myeloid disorders through acquisition of additional mutations remain speculative without cell separation. In patient 5, there is no evidence that JAK2 variant is &quot;specific to CMML&quot;, and it is also unclear if in Patient #14 TET2 variants were present in DLBCL (or AITL for that matter), or were bystanders from CH cells in the tumor. This is difficult to describe as &quot;evidence&quot;, and it should be interpreted as an unconfirmed hypothesis, unless the authors can provide some cell type-specific data. The conclusion that &quot;mutated HSC developed into three distinct tumors&quot; is too far-going considering that no attempt to determine presence of mutation is specific lineages was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to point #3 of essential revision</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The data on TET2 mutations and secondary hematologic malignancies need to take into context patients' treatment (e.g. receipt of ASCT), and rate of mortality. It is not clear how the endpoint that the authors present was defined-are deaths counted as events? It is unlikely that 80% of studied patients have 100% survival rate. Consider using a more standard method (cumulative incidence) accounting for differential rates of mortality between these groups. Patients who survive for a long time and undergo ASCT have a naturally higher probability of developing a secondary cancer. It is also not clear if patients without evidence of clonal hematopoiesis are included in this analysis, but presence of CH by itself is a known risk factor for hematologic cancers.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to point #4 of essential revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
