The vaccine for YF is considered safe and effective, but intervention strategies need to be optimised; one of the tools for this is mathematical modelling. We refine and expand an existing modelling framework for Africa to account for transmission in South America. We fit to YF occurrence and serology data. We then estimate the subnational forces of infection for the entire endemic region. Finally, using demographic and vaccination data, we examine the impact of vaccination activities. We estimate that there were 109,000 (95% credible interval [CrI] [67,000–173,000]) severe infections and 51,000 (95% CrI [31,000–82,000]) deaths due to YF in Africa and South America in 2018. We find that mass vaccination activities in Africa reduced deaths by 47% (95% CrI [10%–77%]). This methodology allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination and illustrates the need for continued vigilance and surveillance of YF.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yellow fever</kwd><kwd>mathematical modelling</kwd><kwd>vaccine impact</kwd><kwd>vector-borne</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1117543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaythorpe</surname><given-names>Katy AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Garske</surname><given-names>Tini</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R015600/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaythorpe</surname><given-names>Katy AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamlet</surname><given-names>Arran</given-names></name><name><surname>Garske</surname><given-names>Tini</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaythorpe</surname><given-names>Katy AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Garske</surname><given-names>Tini</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>Neil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yellow fever, a potentially deadly viral hemorrhagic fever, causes up to 82,000 deaths annually worldwide, and mass vaccination activities have reduced the burden by 47% in Africa.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Yellow fever is a flavivirus endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. In Africa, it is the third most commonly reported type of disease outbreak. In the Americas, yellow fever produces extensive epizootics in non-human primates (NHPs) and outbreaks of human cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mboussou et al., 2019</xref>). It is vaccine preventable, with a safe and effective vaccine available since the 1930s that has been introduced into the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) of many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Region V, 2003</xref>). Yellow fever is transmitted by numerous vectors including Aedes spp. and Haemogogus spp. in Africa and the Americas, respectively. A component of the sylvatic reservoir system is in NHPs, and as a result of this, yellow fever cannot be eradicated. The clinical course of yellow fever infection leads to a variety of non-specific symptoms with severe infections potentially exhibiting fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and haemorrhaging, which can result in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monath and Vasconcelos, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The transmission dynamics of yellow fever have numerous components. There are two main ‘cycles’ of transmission: urban and sylvatic. The sylvatic cycle is said to be the driver of most reported transmission with infection occurring mainly between NHPs, mediated by tree-hole breeding mosquitos. These vectors are diurnal and feed mostly on NHP; however, people can be infected if they encroach on this cycle through occupational or recreational activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monath and Vasconcelos, 2015</xref>). In South America, this accounts for the majority of cases and can potentially lead to large outbreaks; a recent yellow fever season saw over 1000 cases in Brazil alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couto-Lima et al., 2017</xref>). The urban cycle of yellow fever is less common, but the outbreaks have the potential to be devastating. Whilst urban outbreaks have largely been eradicated in South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Câmara et al., 2011</xref>), they still occur in Africa with a recent urban outbreak, in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, causing 962 reported cases. Although this is thought to be only a fraction of the actual transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Organization, WH, 2017</xref>). Large outbreaks as a result of urban transmission are due to the combination of densely populated urban areas, and large populations of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which bites humans preferentially and breeds rapidly in urban environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrington et al., 2014</xref>). The World Health Organisation (WHO) developed the Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy in order to eliminate urban yellow fever outbreaks by 2026 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). The intermediate cycle currently only occurs in Africa when tree-hole breeding anthropophilic Aedes reach particularly high densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monath and Vasconcelos, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Control of yellow fever is primarily through vaccination, and there is no specific anti-viral treatment available. The 17D vaccine is live attenuated and was developed in 1936 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monath, 2005</xref>). The vaccine is considered safe; estimates of adverse event occurrence are at most 0.6 per 100,000 doses, and reactions are generally mild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Menezes Martins et al., 2015</xref>). Immunity due to yellow fever vaccination is suggested to be lifelong with WHO recommendations recently updated to reflect this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Staples et al., 2015</xref>). Efficacy is also thought to be high with recent estimates suggesting that serological response was 97.9% (95% credible interval [CrI] [82.9–99.7]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jean et al., 2016</xref>). An issue with the vaccine is production and corresponding stockpiles. As the vaccine is live, production is slow, which has led to vaccine shortages for large outbreaks and for travellers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>). As a result of this, fractional dosing has become a recommendation in outbreak settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barrett, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Due to limited vaccine supply, efficient planning of interventions is vital to avoid large outbreaks. To facilitate this, robust estimates of disease burden and projections of future dynamics are key. Previous studies have focused on evaluating historical vaccine impact and projecting future potential impact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garske et al., 2014</xref> produced vaccine impact estimates for the African endemic region focusing on mass vaccination campaigns until 2013. They found that mass vaccination activities have averted burden by 57% (95% CI [54–59]) in countries where they took place, accounting for 27% (95% CI [22–31]) of the burden across the region. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shearer et al., 2018</xref> examined the impact of vaccination globally, across Africa and South America, and found that (all) vaccination activities averted between approximately 94,0000 and 119,000 cases each year.</p><p>In this study, we refine and extend the model of Garske et al. to encompass new geographic regions (South America) and new data (on occurrence, serology, vaccination, and NHPs), and produce updated estimates of burden and vaccine impact for yellow fever. In the following sections, we describe the new data and extension to the modelling approach, particularly focusing on the updated model of yellow fever occurrence. Then we present results of our projected transmission intensity considering uncertainty from estimation and the structural uncertainty of the models. Finally, we present burden estimates and reassess the impact of mass vaccination activities in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We expand the existing framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garske et al., 2014</xref> for Africa to account for transmission in South America as well. Countries are included in the analysis if they have been listed as at risk, endemic, or potentially at risk for yellow fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>). We fit a generalised linear model (GLM) of yellow fever reports to occurrence data available from 1984 to 2019, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. This occurrence data denotes whether yellow fever has been reported at all over the observation period, irrespective of number of cases. The GLM then provides a probability of a reported yellow fever outbreak for the entire region. In order to estimate the force of infection that would result in these outbreaks, we use serological survey data. We use this to independently estimate the seroprevalence in the survey locations and thus the force of infection. These individual estimates allow us to calculate a probability of detection over the observation period which we may then use to provide force of infection estimates for the entire region. Finally, using demographic and vaccination data, we can calculate the burden in all provinces.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global occurrence of yellow fever at province level.</title><p>Occurrence since 1984 is shown in yellow.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64670-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data</title><p>We combine multiple data sets within a Bayesian framework to account for areas with sparse data and under-reporting.

As such we perform a selection process, detailed below:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We remove covariates that are not significantly associated with the data.

For the 21 countries within the yellow fever surveillance database, specific data on reporting per capita was available. For countries not covered by the yellow fever surveillance database, and thus without an independent estimate of surveillance, individual country factors were fitted. However, countries not considered at risk were grouped together in order to have one country factor.

The estimation is divided into two phases. The GLMs are estimated using adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, whereas the seroprevalence models are estimated within a product space framework with the probability of the force of infection model set to 1; as such, the estimation becomes an adaptive MCMC with log-transformed parameters.</p><p>Prior distributions were chosen in many cases to match those of Garske et al. Country factors retain the Gaussian prior distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 2 except for the countries considered low risk, whose country factor had truncated normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 30 and limits [0, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>], designed to be uninformative and positive. The same prior was used for the GLM coefficient for the aggregated NHP species richness and the converse for the GLM coefficients for temperature range and altitude which were assumed to be negative. All other GLM coefficient priors were normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 30 to be uninformative. The force of infections for each seroprevalence study had exponential priors with rate parameter 0.001, although this was varied in earlier estimation, and the vaccine efficacy had truncated normal prior with mean 0.975 and standard deviation 0.05, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jean et al., 2016</xref>; this was truncated to [0,1].</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>Ensemble predictions</title><p>We propagate uncertainty from both the parameter estimation and model structure. This is done through sampling proportionally from the posterior distributions of all 20 of the best-fitting models to produce 500 force of infection and thus burden predictions. We sample proportional to the area under the curve (AUC) of each model fit. We also considered sampling proportional to likelihood; however, the AUC was used to compare our models with previous works such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garske et al., 2014</xref> and was more computationally efficient for larger sample sizes. In order to produce estimates of the number of severe infections and deaths per province and year, we scale the model output, infections, by sampling from the full uncertainty ranges of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2014</xref> for the proportion of infections considered severe and, of those, the proportion that will then die of yellow fever.</p><p>Whilst we propagate structural and parameter uncertainty to the predictions from the estimation of our models, the models themselves are inherently deterministic. As such, we will not capture the potential for large outbreaks, or stochastic die-out where a spillover event fails to spark an outbreak. Because of this, the burden estimates we present should be considered as an average behaviour of the <italic>potential</italic> number of deaths caused by yellow fever given the vaccination coverage estimated. This means that whilst the projected burden over time will reflect the data used, the year-on-year variation may be missed.</p><p>All analyses, estimation, and the original draft of the manuscript were performed in R version 3.5.1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>Role of funding source</title><p>This work was carried out as part of the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium, which is funded by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The majority of the burden occurs in Africa, which holds for all years shown.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Potential deaths and severe infections per year in Africa and South America from ensemble model projections.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Continent</th><th>Year</th><th>Severe infections, median</th><th>Severe infections, 95% CrI low</th><th>Severe infections, 95% CrI high</th><th>Deaths, median</th><th>Deaths, 95% CrI low</th><th>Deaths, 95% CrI high</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Africa</td><td>1995</td><td>102,972</td><td>62,162</td><td>160,700</td><td>48,474</td><td>28,672</td><td>76,998</td></tr><tr><td>Africa</td><td>2005</td><td>122,101</td><td>74,915</td><td>192,773</td><td>57,182</td><td>34,446</td><td>90,736</td></tr><tr><td>Africa</td><td>2013</td><td>98,148</td><td>62,083</td><td>150,953</td><td>45,973</td><td>28,680</td><td>72,380</td></tr><tr><td>Africa</td><td>2018</td><td>100,952</td><td>63,001</td><td>158,362</td><td>47,318</td><td>29,162</td><td>74,981</td></tr><tr><td>Americas</td><td>1995</td><td>14,349</td><td>6528</td><td>26,016</td><td>6652</td><td>3026</td><td>12,577</td></tr><tr><td>Americas</td><td>2005</td><td>10,254</td><td>4988</td><td>18,436</td><td>4827</td><td>2265</td><td>8779</td></tr><tr><td>Americas</td><td>2013</td><td>8559</td><td>4264</td><td>15,043</td><td>3999</td><td>1969</td><td>7162</td></tr><tr><td>Americas</td><td>2018</td><td>8331</td><td>4306</td><td>14,608</td><td>3883</td><td>1971</td><td>7033</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Posterior predicted potential deaths per country in 2018 from the ensemble model projections.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64670-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Impact of mass vaccination campaigns in Africa</title><p>It has been shown that mass vaccination campaigns can produce long-lasting effects on disease burden.

We calculated disease burden in terms of severe infections (or cases) and deaths from an ensemble of best-fitting GLMs of yellow fever reports between 1984 and 2019 coupled to catalytic models of seroprevalence. We used this approach to evaluate the impact of mass vaccination campaigns in Africa as well as produce updated burden estimates of yellow fever in endemic regions.</p><p>We estimate that there are between 63,000 and 158,000 severe infections of yellow fever in Africa, resulting in 29,000–75,000 deaths. In South America, we estimate there are 4000–15,000 severe infections, resulting in 2000–7000 deaths. These estimates are contained within the bounds of Garske et al. who estimated between 51,000 and 380,000 severe infections and between 19,000 and 180,000 deaths occur each year in Africa. We also compare to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shearer et al., 2018</xref> who found approximately 256,000 cases on the African continent and 28,000 within Latin America, which are at the higher end of our predicted ranges. All the above estimates fall within a similar range despite different scopes and modelling approaches.</p><p>In order to produce our burden estimates, we first estimate transmission intensity through a force of infection for each province. These estimates differ from those of Garske et al. in West Africa and the DRC. In order to account for the extended model scope, we revisited the covariates used in the GLM leading to the changes in West African forces of infection shown. This can partly be explained by the exclusion of certain covariates, such as longitude, and the inclusion of others, such as NHP species richness. The latter highlights the DRC as an area of high transmission potential, increasing the local estimates of force of infection. The former reduces the force of infection estimates in West Africa. This decrease in West Africa has led to our range of burden lying within the lower range of Garske et al., and whilst the same proportional impact of vaccination is found, the number of deaths averted is also in the lower range of previous estimates. These differences may also indicate a general sensitivity of the approach as, whilst burden is generally agreed to be higher in West Africa, it may be difficult to determine the exact magnitude from occurrence data alone. In South America, the force of infections are estimated to be highest in the Amazon region of Brazil, in part due to the high NHP species richness found there. This is consistent with vaccination efforts which have focused on this area leading to relatively low burden despite the high intensity of transmission.</p><p>In refining the GLMs of yellow fever occurrence, we expanded the pool of possible covariates. This was partly facilitated by new data becoming available, such as NHP species occurrence, and partly motivated by the need to capture more of the inherent variability of yellow fever occurrence, through a temperature suitability index. We find that certain features such as human population size and certain land cover types were consistently featured in the top models of occurrence. Similarly, primate families, Cercopithecidae, Cebidae, and Aotidae—were all found to be important to yellow fever occurrence. The collection of covariates and model choice lead to high AUCs for each model ranging from 0.935 to 0.949, higher than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaythorpe et al., 2019</xref>. One element that is omitted explicitly is vector abundance although we do include occurrence of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. In recent years, there have been a number of excellent efforts to map and predict vector distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraemer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brady et al., 2014</xref>). We utilise many of the same model covariates and as such have chosen to omit modelled vector distributions in this analysis. Additionally, yellow fever is transmitted by many vectors whose distributions have yet to be characterised.</p><p>There are a number of additional limitations with the range of covariates used. We utilise NHP species presence/absence data which we aggregate to province level through counts. As such, we do not have information of the population sizes of NHP, only diversity. This could be reassessed as further data becomes available. Additionally, as a component of the covariate selection process, we cluster our covariates based on their correlation with each other. As such, NHP families who coexist in the same geographic locations are put in the same cluster, for example Atelidae, leading the model selection process to potentially include a NHP that is present in areas with yellow fever, but not necessarily causing or carrying the virus. As with the other covariates, the selection process implies correlation not causation between the covariate and the occurrence of yellow fever.</p><p>Apart from the NHP families, we utilise the same environmental covariates for each continent. Whilst this improves consistency, we use elements such as temperature suitability for <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> as a proxy for the vectors of yellow fever and there are different species in each continent, which may differ in their own ways to <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. An additional issue is that we aggregate our environmental covariates to province level, reducing resolution and potentially biasing the results. In this study, we feel the sparsity of the data, long time window of interest, and general uncertainty in other features will eclipse biases introduced by the aggregation mechanism, but if this model were to be refined spatially, the bias from aggregation could be readdressed. Finally, whilst we include structural uncertainties from the GLM, we do not included uncertainty in the covariates themselves.</p><p>We estimate our models from two main sources of data that we have updated where possible. The occurrence data was expanded to account for additional years and locations from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garske et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaythorpe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jean et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamlet et al., 2019</xref>. Yet there are assumptions and uncertainty that are inherent in this data. Firstly, the case definition relies on a vague symptom set, which is prone to mis-attribution and may vary by location, this will affect under-reporting. We accommodate variation between countries though country-specific reporting factors in the GLMs; however, there are number of elements that contribute to surveillance which we essentially aggregate into one component. The most stark difference may be that surveillance in South America uses that the fact that some NHP species experience disease-related mortality as sentinels for yellow fever. In Africa, due to the co-evolution of NHPs and virus, NHPs are not known to be significantly affected in the same way. As such, the surveillance systems are substantially different.</p><p>One of the important components to assess inherent under-reporting of yellow fever is serology data. We have significantly expanded the data sources for this aspect of the model, with an addition of 36 studies compared to Garske et al.However, all studies are located in Africa, the high vaccination coverage in many of the provinces render conventional tests of seroprevalence uninformative in terms of assessing background infection. There are further issues that may arise in using seroprevalence. We take a positive serology test to indicate exposure to the disease but also protection, adhering to the conventional assumption that immunity to yellow fever is acquired after infection or vaccination and remains for a lifetime. However, there have been recent studies suggesting that this may not be the case in children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domingo et al., 2019</xref> found that immunity against yellow fever waned in children following vaccination. If these results are representative of infant and child vaccination across the regions and time, our estimates of population immunity may need to be readdressed.</p><p>Modelling yellow fever is inherently uncertain. We have attempted to quantify this uncertainty through a Bayesian framework and ensemble model predictions. However, there are still elements that we have not captured. Uncertainty in demography and vaccination are not propagated through our model results and yet both will be influential. Demography is captured from UNWPP and scaled according to Landscan. We assume relatively static age structures and, whilst UNWPP goes some way to accounting for population movements, we do not include them explicitly. Population movements not only effect the model directly but will also influence the resulting vaccination coverage estimates. In a similar way, vaccination activities are collated from a number of sources with all efforts made to ensure completeness. Yet there are activities that may have been omitted or not correctly parameterised could affect the results of this study. A dominant area of uncertainty is in the symptom spectrum of yellow fever. In our model, we estimate infections and then scale these to arrive at severe infections or cases and, finally, deaths. In this we use the estimates of Johannsson et al. to capture the uncertainty in the proportion of infections considered severe etc.; however, this remains an area of contention for yellow fever as previous estimates of case fatality ratio (CFR) have varied substantially and are significantly larger than other flaviruses such as dengue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oo et al., 2017</xref>). The estimates of CFR we use also differ from those in the global burden of disease study leading to substantial differences in burden estimates between the two, although under-reporting is also addressed differently in the global burden of disease study (GBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Compare, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We have refined an established model but have also inherited some of its limitations, one of which is constancy. We assume that dynamics do not change substantially over the observation period in each province. As such, the variation over time is dominated by changes in demography and vaccination. In reality, the epidemiology of yellow fever is likely to change and has seen changes over recent years. Brazil experienced some of the largest outbreaks in its history with yellow fever in 2017 and 2018; this was suggested to have been caused by changing patterns of human behaviour, such as urbanisation and movement, or changes in epidemiology in the sylvatic cycle; however, the full list of causes remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couto-Lima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreira-Soto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Possas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saúde, 2019</xref>). Spillover is also inherently stochastic, whereas, due to the focus on long-term burden, we assume a constant risk of spillover. As such, the model will not capture outbreak dynamics over a short time window but may highlight areas at most risk of outbreaks. The resulting estimates of burden and vaccine impact are thus the <italic>potential</italic> number of deaths given the conditions in each province and each country given the environmental conditions but may vary year on year due to outbreaks and stochastic spillover events.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have refined and extended an established model to update estimates of disease burden for yellow fever. We find consistent results that 92.2% (95% CrI [88.8–95%]) of global burden occurs in Africa and that mass vaccination activities have substantially reduced the number of cases and deaths we see today. We also highlight areas when burden is potentially high, in part due to lower-than-optimal vaccination coverages. The optimal route to avert deaths and potential yellow fever outbreaks is through tackling areas, and sub-populations, with low vaccination coverage. This is because vaccination is the main intervention for yellow fever, both as a preventative measure coupled with surveillance and as an outbreak response intervention. However, uncertainty in current data sources, and their interpretation, will limit the effectiveness of planning strategies. Our modelling approach underscores the need to examine background immunity, due to both natural infection and vaccination, in order to address not only the risk of future deaths but also assess how much of yellow fever is actually visible. For an old disease with an effective vaccine, yellow fever still poses new threats and, allowed to run unchecked, will provide a substantial health burden in many tropical areas as well as posing a significant global exportation risk.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Validation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64670-transrepform-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Public repository data: Vaccination cov erage: coverage is available to download from the PoLiCi shiny app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shiny.dide.imperial.ac.uk/polici/">https://shiny.dide.imperial.ac.uk/polici/</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jennifer Flegg as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alex Perkins (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports on a significant update to a leading model of the burden of yellow fever and the impact of vaccination. Some of the major updates include extending it from Africa to also include South America, and accounting for model uncertainty with different combinations of spatial covariates. Some differences with this update of the model are reported and explained, and the impact of mass vaccination campaigns is quantified. This paper is of interest to a broad range of researchers and public health practitioners engaged in the management of yellow fever. It provides estimates of the global burden of yellow fever in 2018 and the impact of vaccination activities in Africa. Given the limited volume and quality of data available on yellow fever epidemiology, the modelling approach is appropriate and supports the study conclusions.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Novelty.</p><p>The novelty of the method is oversold, particularly in the Abstract. It is not accurate to say that this manuscript &quot;develops a novel framework&quot; or &quot;newly developed methodology&quot; given that it is an update of an existing framework by Garske et al. The exact novelty of the framework should be made clear. Please cite the Garske et al. paper where you first mention the framework in the Materials and methods.</p><p>2) Data.</p><p>Insufficient details are provided on some model inputs. The authors should provide further details on the YF occurrence data used in the analysis. In particular, details on how cases were diagnosed, and discuss the potential impact of diagnostic uncertainties on the study results. Further details and justification should also be provided on the non-human primate covariate. For example:</p><p>– YF occurrence data. Please summarise the number of occurrence records used in the analysis by geographic region and time. Briefly summarise how occurrences of YF were diagnosed. PCR? Serology? Clinically? If serological and /or clinically diagnosed cases are included, please comment on the potential impact of misdiagnosed cases (e.g. due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as dengue) and how this may have impacted your results and conclusions.</p><p>– NHPs data. What is the difference between habitat suitability and occurrence of non-human primates? Also, I suggest that you do not refer to the species range maps provided by IUCN as &quot;species distributions&quot; as these are not modelled species distributions (as the authors point out in the Discussion). Perhaps refer to them as &quot;range maps&quot;. Please clarify what you mean by &quot;species richness&quot;. Did you count the number of species range maps covering at least 10% of each province? Which NHPs did you include and what was the justification?</p><p>– Vector data.

Results are presented based on ensemble model predictions. While the paper presents results of public health interest, I'm not convinced of the novelty of the approach, this is rather an extension of an existing methodology to more data and regions. For this reason, I feel like this work would be better suited in a specialist journal.</p><p>1) I'm not convinced that the contribution of this paper is novel enough for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The model framework was already largely in place, as was most of the data. I think the Abstract oversells the novelty of the methodology.</p><p>2) The first mention of a temporal component to the models was in the Results. I found the lack of introduction of the temporal nature of the models quite confusing.</p><p>3) What was done for serological surveys in South America, since there were none available? How were the serological data representative of the whole population? Can this be justified more?</p><p>4) It would be good to be clearer about which model parameters go where and which data is used to inform which parameters. E.g. a workflow diagram would help the reader to follow more easily what you have done.</p><p>5) Why is BIC used for model selection? That's not exactly a natural choice for Bayesian models since it does not consider the effect of the choice of priors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 :</italic></p><p>Abstract – It is not accurate to say that this manuscript &quot;develops a novel framework&quot; or &quot;newly developed methodology&quot; given that it is an update of an existing framework by Garske et al. This issue is handled appropriately elsewhere in the manuscript, but here it is not.</p><p>Materials and methods – The prior on force of infection seems fairly small and strong. How was this choice made, and how sensitive are the results to it?</p><p>Materials and methods – For the ensemble predictions, is there a specific rationale or precedent for sampling proportional to AUC? It sounds reasonable, but also somewhat arbitrary without better justification.</p><p>Results – The AUCs of the models are essentially all the same, in which case it doesn't look like there was much success in discriminating among them and the ensemble is essentially a simple average of the component models. Am I missing I anything with that assessment?</p><p>Discussion – The explanation for the discrepancy in force of infection spatially as compared to Garske et al. is appreciated. I wonder if we can really be convinced that this is the correct interpretation (i.e., lower FOI in West Africa) or if we should consider this to be a sensitivity of the model. I'm not sure whether we can say without some sort of out of sample test of the predictions of these two models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Gaythorpe et al. estimated the global burden of yellow fever and the impact of mass vaccination activities in Africa in 2018. A previously published Bayesian modelling framework was extended and applied to a range of new and updated data sources. First, the authors updated an existing dataset of yellow fever occurrences (from 1987 to 2018). These data were used, along with a range of geospatial covariate data, to estimate the probability of yellow fever being reported in each first administrative region (i.e. province) within yellow fever risk zones. Measures of climatic and environmental variables and the presence of non-human primate reservoir species and mosquito vector species, among other factors, were included as model covariates. Data from a number of serological surveys was used to account for under-reporting and to estimate transmission intensity across the study region. Next, the authors updated an existing dataset of vaccination activities and used these data to calculate the number of deaths attributable to yellow fever at a province level, globally, and to estimate the number of deaths averted by vaccination in Africa. The authors estimated that in 2018, there were 51,000 (95%CrI[31,000-82,000]) deaths globally due to yellow fever, with 90% of the burden in Africa. Further, they estimated that vaccination averted 10,000 (95%CrI[6,000-17,000]) deaths in Africa in 2018. The study did not estimate the impact of vaccination in South America. The data available for studying global YF epidemiology is limited in volume and quality, which means that analyses such as the one presented here are inherently uncertain. This study considered uncertainty from estimation and model structure, but did not account for other key sources of uncertainty, i.e., in estimates of vaccination coverage or model covariates. Nonetheless, the study demonstrates a useful approach to estimating disease burden and vaccination impact over broad geographic areas. The data and approach seem appropriate to support the study's conclusions. However, in the manuscript's current state, some aspects of the analysis and model inputs need to be further clarified and justified:</p><p>1) The authors claim that they have developed a novel framework for estimating disease burden and vaccine impact. However, the study appears to make a number of extensions (e.g. incorporating new geographic regions, new covariates, updated data) to previously published methods. The authors should make the novelty of the framework more clear.</p><p>2) Limited details are provided on some model inputs. The authors should provide further details on the YF occurrence data used in the analysis. In particular, details on how cases were diagnosed, and discuss the potential impact of diagnostic uncertainties on the study results. Further details and justification should also be provided on the non-human primate covariate. For example, which NHP species were included and why.</p><p>3) The authors should provide information on the data and approach used to estimate the number of severe infections and deaths from the estimates of transmission intensity.</p><p>4) The authors claim that they developed a novel framework. However, the work appears to make a number of extensions (e.g. incorporating new geographic regions, new covariates, updated data) to previously published methods. Please make the novelty of the framework more clear.</p><p>5) Limited information on the model inputs are provided in the Materials and methods section. Where the authors point to previously published methods or dataset, they should at least provide a brief summary of the method/dataset. For updated or new datasets, more detailed descriptions should be provided. For example:</p><p>– YF occurrence data. Please summarise the number of occurrence records used in the analysis by geographic region and time. Briefly summarise how occurrences of YF were diagnosed. PCR? Serology? Clinically? If serological and /or clinically diagnosed cases are included, please comment on the potential impact of misdiagnosed cases (e.g. due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as dengue) and how this may have impacted your results and conclusions.</p><p>– NHPs data. What is the difference between habitat suitability and occurrence of non-human primates? Also, I suggest that you do not refer to the species range maps provided by IUCN as &quot;species distributions&quot; as these are not modelled species distributions (as the authors point out in the Discussion). Perhaps refer to them as &quot;range maps&quot;. Please clarify what you mean by &quot;species richness&quot;. Did you count the number of species range maps covering at least 10% of each province? Which NHPs did you include and what was the justification?</p><p>– Vector data. Ae aegypti is the main vector for urban yellow fever transmission, please justify why you included Ae Albopictus as a potential covariate.</p><p>6) How were severe infections and deaths estimated from transmission intensity surface? Please provide details in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>7) Please define what you mean by &quot;potential&quot; deaths in the Materials and methods and/or Results section.

Results are presented based on ensemble model predictions.

For this reason, I feel like this work would be better suited in a specialist journal.</p><p>1) I'm not convinced that the contribution of this paper is novel enough for publication in eLife. The model framework was already largely in place, as was most of the data. I think the Abstract oversells the novelty of the methodology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Abstract to avoid overselling the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The first mention of a temporal component to the models was in the Results.

How were the serological data representative of the whole population? Can this be justified more?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there are no serological surveys available for South America partly due to concerns about cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses and partly as the vaccination coverage is generally high, rendering seroprevalence studies potentially less informative. We included serological data that includes information on the vaccination status of the included individuals and was not conducted as part of an outbreak investigation. As such, these provide a valuable view of the population of the province and time when the survey was conducted. We have added a further sentence on the serological survey inclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be good to be clearer about which model parameters go where and which data is used to inform which parameters.

It sounds reasonable, but also somewhat arbitrary without better justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined both sampling by likelihood and by AUC, there was no major difference, likely due to the point below. As such, and because we were using AUC to compare against the original model of Garske et al., 2013, and the updated model of Gaythorpe et al., 2019, we chose to sample by AUC. This was also substantially more computationally efficient for the large sample sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results – The AUCs of the models are essentially all the same, in which case it doesn't look like there was much success in discriminating among them and the ensemble is essentially a simple average of the component models.

As such, and because we also did not want to omit potentially useful covariates, we chose to sample proportionally from all of the models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion – The explanation for the discrepancy in force of infection spatially as compared to Garske et al. is appreciated. I wonder if we can really be convinced that this is the correct interpretation (i.e., lower FOI in West Africa) or if we should consider this to be a sensitivity of the model. I'm not sure whether we can say without some sort of out of sample test of the predictions of these two models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this is a fair point and we have added to the Discussion to highlight that this may be a sensitivity of the approach, especially given that only occurrence data is available in West Africa rather than both occurrence and serology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Gaythorpe et al. estimated the global burden of yellow fever and the impact of mass vaccination activities in Africa in 2018. A previously published Bayesian modelling framework was extended and applied to a range of new and updated data sources. First, the authors updated an existing dataset of yellow fever occurrences (from 1987 to 2018). These data were used, along with a range of geospatial covariate data, to estimate the probability of yellow fever being reported in each first administrative region (i.e. province) within yellow fever risk zones. Measures of climatic and environmental variables and the presence of non-human primate reservoir species and mosquito vector species, among other factors, were included as model covariates. Data from a number of serological surveys was used to account for under-reporting and to estimate transmission intensity across the study region. Next, the authors updated an existing dataset of vaccination activities and used these data to calculate the number of deaths attributable to yellow fever at a province level, globally, and to estimate the number of deaths averted by vaccination in Africa. The authors estimated that in 2018, there were 51,000 (95%CrI[31,000-82,000]) deaths globally due to yellow fever, with 90% of the burden in Africa. Further, they estimated that vaccination averted 10,000 (95%CrI[6,000-17,000]) deaths in Africa in 2018. The study did not estimate the impact of vaccination in South America. The data available for studying global YF epidemiology is limited in volume and quality, which means that analyses such as the one presented here are inherently uncertain. This study considered uncertainty from estimation and model structure, but did not account for other key sources of uncertainty, i.e., in estimates of vaccination coverage or model covariates. Nonetheless, the study demonstrates a useful approach to estimating disease burden and vaccination impact over broad geographic areas. The data and approach seem appropriate to support the study's conclusions. However, in the manuscript's current state, some aspects of the analysis and model inputs need to be further clarified and justified:</p><p>1) The authors claim that they have developed a novel framework for estimating disease burden and vaccine impact. However, the study appears to make a number of extensions (e.g. incorporating new geographic regions, new covariates, updated data) to previously published methods. The authors should make the novelty of the framework more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you we have clarified this in the Abstract and have added caveats throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Limited details are provided on some model inputs. The authors should provide further details on the YF occurrence data used in the analysis. In particular, details on how cases were diagnosed, and discuss the potential impact of diagnostic uncertainties on the study results. Further details and justification should also be provided on the non-human primate covariate. For example, which NHP species were included and why.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further details on the occurrence data and the non-human primate covariates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should provide information on the data and approach used to estimate the number of severe infections and deaths from the estimates of transmission intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included details on this and further referenced Johansson et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that they developed a novel framework. However, the work appears to make a number of extensions (e.g. incorporating new geographic regions, new covariates, updated data) to previously published methods. Please make the novelty of the framework more clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have addressed this in both the Abstract and the Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Limited information on the model inputs are provided in the Materials and methods section. Where the authors point to previously published methods or dataset, they should at least provide a brief summary of the method/dataset. For updated or new datasets, more detailed descriptions should be provided. For example:</p><p>– YF occurrence data. Please summarise the number of occurrence records used in the analysis by geographic region and time. Briefly summarise how occurrences of YF were diagnosed. PCR? Serology? Clinically? If serological and /or clinically diagnosed cases are included, please comment on the potential impact of misdiagnosed cases (e.g. due to cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses such as dengue) and how this may have impacted your results and conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included further description on the occurrence data for YF including:</p><p>– linking to the outbreak dataset available on github for Africa: https://github.com/kjean/YF_outbreak_PMVC/tree/main/formatted_data</p><p>– Adding further detail on the diagnosis methods and the inclusion of suspected YF cases as a measure of surveillance effort</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– NHPs data. What is the difference between habitat suitability and occurrence of non-human primates? Also, I suggest that you do not refer to the species range maps provided by IUCN as &quot;species distributions&quot; as these are not modelled species distributions (as the authors point out in the Discussion). Perhaps refer to them as &quot;range maps&quot;. Please clarify what you mean by &quot;species richness&quot;. Did you count the number of species range maps covering at least 10% of each province? Which NHPs did you include and what was the justification?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have added further information detailing how the NHP data is included and correcting the language from “species distribution” to “range maps”. The included NHP families are mentioned in Table 1 and all species within those families are included in the calculation of “species richness”, we have detailed this further in the data description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Vector data. Ae aegypti is the main vector for urban yellow fever transmission, please justify why you included Ae Albopictus as a potential covariate.</p></disp-quote><p>There are a number of vectors of YF, Aegypti is the main urban vector. However, albopictus is also known to be able to carry YF. As such, we included both in the covariate selection process. We have noted this in the list of covariates. However, Ae. Albopictus was not found to be significant in the final models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) How were severe infections and deaths estimated from transmission intensity surface? Please provide details in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>Severe infections and deaths were calculated from the model output: infections scaled by the full uncertainty range of Johansson et al. who estimated the proportion of infections considered severe and, of those, the proportion of those who go on to die of YF. We have added further clarification in the text and in the flow diagram, Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please define what you mean by &quot;potential&quot; deaths in the Materials and methods and/or Results section. You mention it in the Discussion, but it should be earlier. Conceptually this was a bit confusing because &quot;potential&quot; could be interpreted as assuming no vaccination.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph on this in the Materials and methods to further explain what we indicate by “potential”. We aimed to describe the fact that what we present captures an average burden over the years and does not, for example, include some of the stochastic effects that may lead to outbreaks or lack thereof.</p></body></sub-article></article>
