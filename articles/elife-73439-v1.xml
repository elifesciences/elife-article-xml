We demonstrate a remarkable, hitherto unknown mechanism by an α-PFT protein from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. As part of the MakA/B/E tripartite toxin, MakA is involved in membrane pore formation similar to other α-PFTs. In contrast, MakA in isolation induces tube-like structures in acidic endosomal compartments of epithelial cells in vitro. The present study unravels the dynamics of tubular growth, which occurs in a pH-, lipid-, and concentration-dependent manner. Within acidified organelle lumens or when incubated with cells in acidic media, MakA forms oligomers and remodels membranes into high-curvature tubes leading to loss of membrane integrity. A 3.7 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of MakA filaments reveals a unique protein-lipid superstructure. MakA forms a pinecone-like spiral with a central cavity and a thin annular lipid bilayer embedded between the MakA transmembrane helices in its active α-PFT conformation. Our study provides insights into a novel tubulation mechanism of an α-PFT protein and a new mode of action by a secreted bacterial toxin.</p></abstract><kwd-group

directly with target cell membranes by binding to specific receptors, lipids, or proteins on host cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geny and Popoff, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lemichez and Barbieri, 2013</xref>). Both extracellular and intracellular bacterial pathogens produce and secrete host membrane-attacking pore-forming toxins (PFTs) to counteract host defenses, to promote colonization and spread, and to kill other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Los et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verma et al., 2021</xref>). PFTs can be categorized into two main groups, α-PFTs and β-PFTs, based on whether the secondary structure of the membrane-penetrating domain contains α-helices or β-barrels, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Los et al., 2013</xref>). Generally, PFTs are secreted from bacteria in a monomeric, soluble form. Upon recognition and binding to the target cell membrane, the toxins undergo a conformational change, interact with the membrane, dimerize, and oligomerize, leading to the formation of membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischofberger et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Vibrio cholerae,</italic> a Gram-negative bacterium, is the causal organism of the diarrheal disease cholera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clemens et al., 2017</xref>). Cholera toxin (CT) and toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP) are the main virulence factors of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> that cause disease in mammalian hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaper et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Taylor et al., 1987</xref>). Most environmental <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates do not produce CT and TCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rajpara et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, these bacteria are considered pathogenic since they have been associated with secretory diarrhea and may cause wound infections and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains lacking the CT-encoding genes often contain a set of genes coding for other secreted virulence factors, including hemolysin, hemagglutinin protease, RTX toxin, and multiple lipases that together may play a role in pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwartz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) as host models for bacterial predatory interactions and infection in aqueous environments, respectively, we obtained evidence for a new <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cytotoxin denoted MakA (motility-associated killing factor A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>V. cholerae</italic> gene <italic>makA</italic> (<italic>vca0883</italic>) is localized in a gene cluster together with <italic>makC</italic> (<italic>vca0881</italic>), <italic>makD</italic> (<italic>vca0880</italic>)<italic>, makB</italic> (<italic>vca0882</italic>), and <italic>makE</italic> (<italic>vca0884</italic>). This gene cluster has been found in different <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains, including CT-negative isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsou and Zhu, 2010</xref>). The crystal structure of MakA revealed that it belongs to the ClyA α-PFT family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>), named after the potent, one-component, PFT ClyA which is expressed from a monocistronic operon in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oscarsson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oscarsson et al., 1996</xref>). Our recent studies of the proteins encoded by the <italic>mak</italic> genes in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> demonstrated that MakA can form a tripartite cytolytic complex with MakB and MakE, whereas neither of the three proteins displays cytolytic activity on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadeem et al., 2021a</xref>). Other family members of α-PFT are found among the bipartite toxins from <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> (YaxAB) and <italic>Xenorhabdus nematophila</italic> (XaxAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>), as well as among the tripartite toxins from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (NheABC and HblL<sub>1</sub>L<sub>2</sub>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sastalla et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> (AhlABC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (SmhABC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchill-Angus et al., 2021</xref>). The bipartite and tripartite PFTs require the combined action of all protein partners to induce pore formation in the target membranes, and there is evidence that protein interaction occurs in a specific order for maximum cytolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchill-Angus et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). We recently demonstrated that an equimolar mixture of the MakA, MakB, and MakE proteins efficiently could assemble into a pore-forming complex in mammalian membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>). However, there are still questions about (i) how many molecules of each subunit protein are required to form a pore, (ii) how they exactly interact with each other, (iii) how structural conformational changes occur, and (iv) how protein moieties are involved in the interaction with the host membrane. In addition, it remains possible that some of the subunit proteins can be separately released from the bacteria and thereby exhibit biological effects on their own. Secretion of the MakA/B/E proteins from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> was shown to be facilitated via the bacterial flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>). However, about 10% of MakA was secreted from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> lacking the flagellum suggesting an alternative route of secretion, in contrast to MakB and MakE, which displayed a more definitive flagellum-dependent secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>).</p><p>Our earlier studies with purified MakA protein and cultured mammalian cells showed that the protein binds to the target cell membrane and, upon internalization, may accumulate in the endolysosomal membrane, causing lysosomal dysfunction, modulation of autophagy, and apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corkery et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadeem et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadeem et al., 2021b</xref>). Cell membrane dynamics are crucial for various biological processes in all kingdoms of life. In eukaryotes, the lipid bilayer and the number of membrane-associated proteins play a crucial role in the regulation of endocytosis, exocytosis, cell motility, cytokinesis, and maintenance of the organelle function in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tanaka-Takiguchi et al., 2013</xref>). The major proteins that play a key role in the regulation of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking include F-BAR, ESCRT-III, and dynamin proteins. In vitro, these proteins may associate with lipid membranes and generate spiral filaments, causing the lipid membranes to distort and form tubular assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McCullough et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, a bacterial protein designated BdpA (BAR domain-like protein A) with BAR domain-like activity was identified in the <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1 strain. BdpA forms redox-active membrane vesicles and micrometer-scale outer membrane extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phillips et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to BAR domain proteins, dynamin was previously shown to be associated with the lipid membrane in vitro and form a helical tube-like assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sweitzer and Hinshaw, 1998</xref>). Bacterial dynamin-like proteins (BDLPs), like eukaryotic dynamin proteins, are well known for their capacity to induce tube assembly in the presence of lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Low and Löwe, 2006</xref>). Notably, there are only a few known bacterial toxins that produce invaginations in lipid membranes and eukaryotic cells, which can be exploited to transport these toxins intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg Klenow et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The present study aimed to further characterize the mechanism(s) behind MakA-induced lysosomal membrane tubulation as well as the pH-dependent molecular interaction(s) between MakA and host cell membranes. We found that under low pH conditions, MakA bound to purified lysosomes and to liposomes prepared from total epithelial cell lipid extracts (ECLE). The insertion of MakA into lysosomes and ECLE liposomes resulted in the formation of tubular assemblies. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of these assemblies revealed an unusual helical structure formed by MakA and lipid spirals. The observed structure revealed that MakA monomers adopted conformational arrangements typical of active membrane-bound α-PFTs while assembling into an atypical polymeric superstructure. Large structural rearrangements, presumably induced by the lowered pH, were necessary for the transition from the inactive soluble form to the extended active toxin form. Interaction of these MakA structures with cell membranes caused cell death in the in vitro setting. MakA is the first <italic>V. cholerae</italic> protein that engages target membranes to form nanotubes by polymerizing as a helical structure together with a lipid spiral.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>pH-dependent formation of tubular structures in lysosomes and on cell membranes by MakA</title><p>In recent in vitro studies with epithelial cells, we found that internalized MakA protein accumulated in the acidic endolysosomal compartment where it caused formation of tube-like structures and induced lysosomal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadeem et al., 2021b</xref>). Our findings prompted us to examine how the observed lysosomal tubulation and lysosomal dysfunction might be caused by MakA. Upon treatment of Caco-2 cells with MakA (250 nM, 18 hr), we observed co-localization of the Alexa568-labeled MakA (Alexa568-MakA) with GFP-LAMP1 or lysotracker in tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The tubulation in the lysosomes was further confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of lysosomes isolated from MakA-treated HCT8 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Western blot analysis of lysosomes isolated from MakA-treated (250nM, 18 hr) HCT8 and Caco-2 cells revealed, in addition to the MakA monomer, the formation of dimeric, tetrameric, and oligomeric MakA complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To investigate if MakA can also induce tubulation of lysosomes outside the intracellular environment, we purified lysosomes from untreated HCT8 cells and exposed them to native MakA or to Alexa568-MakA. Both confocal microscopy and TEM analysis revealed aggregation and tubulation of lysosomes at pH 5.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In addition, a majority of the lysosomes showed well-organized tubulation when exposed to MakA at pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe any MakA-induced tubular structures in lysosomes at pH 7.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed pH-dependent binding of MakA to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Alexa568-MakA was subsequently shown to bind epithelial cells in a pH-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). To determine the kinetics of MakA binding to the target cells, HCT8 cells were exposed to Alexa568-MakA at pH 5.0, and live-cell imaging was performed using spinning disc confocal microscopic analysis. Consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadeem et al., 2021a</xref>), we observed accumulation of Alexa568-MakA on the plasma membrane, including filipodia-rich tubular structures, in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

In a similar manner to the tubulation observed for the target cell membranes and lysosomes, MakA triggered tubulation of the ECLE liposomes in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Concomitant with the assembly of tubular structures emanating from the liposomes, size of the liposomes appeared to shrink as the tubules grew up to several micrometers in length. Ultimately, the entire liposome seemed to be transformed into long tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>). The tubulation of ECLE liposomes was also observed by confocal microscopy upon treatment with Alexa568-labeled MakA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). In the same population of small liposome particles, we also detected Alexa568-MakA-positive large lipid vesicles (5–10 μm in size, less than 1% of the entire liposome fraction). The z-stack projection suggested that the whole lipid vesicle was decorated with a bundle of fluctuating tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To further assess whether or not any protein or glycolipid receptor mediated the observed membrane tubulation by MakA, liposomes were prepared from a well-defined synthetic lipid mixture (SLM); whose composition was inspired by the distribution of lipids found in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorizate et al., 2013</xref>). Tubulation of the SLM liposomes by MakA was observed by TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition to the tubular structures, we observed a large number of well-organized, star-shaped oligomeric particles of MakA among the ECLE liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of MakA protein in the tubular structures was evidenced by immunogold staining using MakA-specific antiserum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Within 10 min, Alexa568-MakA binding to the SLBs resulted in formation of MakA-associated tubules of various sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that at pH 6.5 or lower, MakA may adopt a conformation that allows the protein to insert into the lipid membrane in the form of an oligomer assembly that can lead to the formation of a tube structure. Concomitantly, the size of the vesicle appears to shrink, and the tube may grow up to several micrometers in length.

A subsequent investigation of the layer line distances in a collapsed power spectrum of selected well-resolved class averages confirmed this distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Next, we performed a preliminary 3D refinement of filament segments from well-defined 2D class averages without imposing symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This volume was visually inspected to deduce the helical symmetry parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). One repeating element of the right-handed spiral consists of 37 tetramers that complete five turns around the helical axis, spanning a length of 216.5 Å and a diameter of 322 Å. This arrangement results in an axial rise of 5.85 Å per subunit and a helical twist of 48.65° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

This conformation of MakA is significantly different from the previously reported soluble state structures resembling the inactive form (PDB-6DFP and PDB-6EZV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>). In the soluble form, a C-terminal tail (res. 351–365, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, purple) inactivates the predicted transmembrane domains by forming a β-tongue, consisting of three β-sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>), that shields the hydrophobic residues from the surrounding solvent. This shielding characteristic is well described for the soluble form of the ClyA PFT family, including ClyA, Hbl-B, NheA, and AhlB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ganash et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kovac et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Madegowda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallace et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). MakA undergoes a structural change comparable to the opening of a Swiss army knife blade when it shifts from a soluble inactive to a membrane-bound active state, where the helix bundle of the tail region represents the handle, the transition from the tail to the neck region forms two hinges, and the β-tongue together with 4 and 5 resembles the blade that folds out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, α4 and α5; light and dark green). Additionally, the β-tongue changes its secondary structure and, together with α4 and α5/α6, forms two extended helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This significant conformational change leads to the formation of two TMHs and a short loop region (res. 219–221) between α4 and α5. Interestingly, despite certain similarities, all four copies of MakA adopt different conformations within the tetramer, as indicated by MakA-1 to MakA-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The most significant structural differences between the four MakA conformations can be observed in the neck and head domains, connected via a hinge with the tail domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The hinge allows for different degrees of bending (opening up of the Swiss army knife), while the neck helices α4 and α5 and the loop region (res. 219–221) display a high degree of plasticity. For the peripheral tail domain, two major conformations can be observed. In MakA-2 and MakA-4, this region superimposes well with the crystal structure, whereas helix α6 of MakA-1 and MakA-3 moves by almost 10 Å to extend the length of α5. While the stretched MakA states have shorter N-terminal helices than the kinked MakA forms, the C-terminal β-strand (res. 351–365), which covers the TMH in the soluble state, is disordered in all four subunits.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Conformational plasticity of MakA in the membrane-bound filamentous state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density of a MakA tetramer (EMD-13185-additional map 1) is shown next to a structural model.

Recent research on the pre- and pore forms of a mammalian PFT, the protein perforin 2 (mPFN2), provides interesting insights into the pore generation process. It was demonstrated that pre-pore-to-pore transformation occurs at an acidic pH, which is accomplished by a 180° rotation of the membrane-attacking domain and β-hairpin P2 domain with respect to one another, allowing membrane insertion to take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ni et al., 2020</xref>). Similar to these other toxins, a decrease in pH facilitated the MakA structural change comparable to the opening of a Swiss army knife blade when shifting from a soluble to a membrane-bound active state that interacts with the lipid membrane. The pH-induced structural change potentiated the MakA-induced cytotoxic effect on the target cell under the conditions tested. Consistent with these results, we recently found that MakA co-localizes with β-catenin, actin, and the phosphatidic acid biosensor, PASS, in filipodia-rich structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nadeem et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadeem et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro analysis of the low-pH-induced interaction between MakA and host membranes included purified lysosomes, cultured epithelial cells, red blood cells, and liposome models. In all model systems, we observed that low pH enhanced the activity of MakA, characterized by a striking tubulation of both purified lysosomes and liposomes prepared from ECLE. Furthermore, it was found that MakA formed tubular structures on liposomes independent of any specific protein receptor or energy-generating molecules, that is, ATP or GTP, suggesting that at low pH, the structural change and insertion of MakA itself was sufficient to trigger tubulation at the membrane surface. In contrast to some other PFTs that need cholesterol for oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gellings and McGee, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sathyanarayana et al., 2018</xref>), MakA could induce tubulation on liposomes obtained from lipid sources essentially lacking cholesterol, that is, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, showing that the pH-dependent tubulation of MakA can occur in the absence of cholesterol in the membrane. Bacterial cell membranes are typically devoid of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fiertel and Klein, 1959</xref>), while the membranes of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are mostly composed of glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids with trace quantities of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watts and Ristow, 2017</xref>). In addition, we observed that the presence of cholesterol was not required for the oligomerization of MakA in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our in vitro studies do not indicate that a particular membrane topology per se is required for the MakA-induced tube formation. The data indicate that MakA can interact with membrane lipids representing either side or topology of a membrane bilayer and thereby induce tubulation when the pH is acidic. This membrane interaction by MakA thereby appears different from, for example, Shiga toxin and CT, which insert into the membrane and cause inward-directed tubulations of artificial lipid membranes since toxin binding induces negative curvature of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chinnapen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Römer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Safouane et al., 2010</xref>). The CD spectrometry and TEM-negative staining data indicate that under acidic conditions MakA undergoes a conformational change, presumably adopting a structure that is promoting membrane interaction and formation of oligomeric assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>MakA evidently drives the rapid growth of tubules toward the extracellular space, as shown with red blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-G</xref>). We propose that the appearance of tubular structures in response to MakA was a direct consequence of MakA insertion into the membrane, which appeared to create the conditions for generating a positive curvature, as described previously for protein-lipid complexes and multi-anchoring polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campelo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nadeem et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>MakA and ESCRT-III proteins seem to have some similarities in terms of the major refolding of the subunit with ESCRT-III proteins. Both proteins tubulate membranes ultrastructurally and, as observed for MakA, human ESCRT-III protein CHMP1B/IST1 generates a positive membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). However, there are major differences between the proteins in terms of membrane interaction and oligomeric assembly: Through positively charged phospholipid-interacting regions in helix 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, shown in red), CHMP1B proteins associate with and coat a membrane externally, resulting in a stable, continuous, and intact membrane. MakA, on the other hand, has transmembrane domains that integrate into and span the lipid bilayer. When the membrane is disassembled and linearized, a lipid spiral forms around the filament axis, together with the MakA subunits. This implies membrane instability, which is consistent with the proposed cytotoxicity of MakA as opposed to ESCRT-III-regulated membrane remodeling and fission. Moreover, reduced ionic strength activates ESCRT-III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the trigger for MakA appears to be pH dependent. CHMP1B in its open, active conformation needs its binding partner, IST1, to co-polymerize and promote membrane tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>), while MakA oligomerizes into a helical filament on its own in vitro (by forming pairs of dimers). It should be noted that when MakA is interacting in vitro with its other binding partners from <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the structurally related MakB and MakE proteins, it acts as a component in a tripartite complex, forming oligomeric pore structures in membranes at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>). The observed structural heterogeneity within the dimer pair of MakA shown at acidic pH in the present study presumably reflects its ability to engage in heteromeric interactions with the other two Mak proteins. Furthermore, oligomerized CHMP1B and MakA have dramatically different protein-protein interactions: MakA creates pairs of dimers that are arrayed like a single propellor blade, while CHMP1B binds to four successive CHMP1B monomers that are almost parallel packed next to each other, resulting in a low-fence-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings allowed us to propose a model for MakA oligomer assembly and its implications for pore formation. Within the oligomerized MakA filament, the TMHs line the inner cavity, interacting with lipids that are intercalated both within the dimer interface and between the dimers in the helical spiral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>). In the context of PFT systems, the initial insertion of one toxin component was described for XaxAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>), YaxAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brauning et al., 2018</xref>), and suggested for AhlC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Considering that the TMHs of the MakA-tetramers harbor a lipid bilayer, it could be assumed that MakA initiates membrane insertion in a manner similar to its role in pore formation under neutral pH conditions when part of the tripartite MakA/B/E complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadeem et al., 2021c</xref>). We hypothesize that under low-pH conditions, MakA transitions from inactive to the active stretched conformation and penetrates the membrane as a monomer. In the membrane-bound state, the interaction of the head and tail domains of two monomers might lead to MakA dimer formation and subsequent oligomerization that ultimately lead to membrane tubulation.</p><p>The pronounced structural difference between two subunits forming a dimer in the absence of the tripartite complex interaction partner, that is, MakB or MakE, would reflect how MakA’s plasticity nevertheless can structurally mimic the expected structure when involved in the tripartite cytolysin. First, one completely stretched monomer dimerizes with a monomer with a pronounced elbow-like kink from α3 to α4 in the transition from the tail to the neck region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Subsequently, the two dimers form a tetramer with the stretched and kinked MakA states associating with each other, respectively. The subsequent tetramerization followed by oligomerization does not result in pore formation, but in helical growth and lipids being sheared off from vesicles and cell membranes at low pH. This process, which does not occur in the tripartite cytotoxin scenario under neutral pH conditions, depletes membranous structures of lipids and potentially causes cell lysis in a manner quite different from that of a bona fide α-PFT cytolysin complex. Our findings with the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> MakA protein reveal an unexpected capability and remarkable mode of action of an individual α-PFT toxin subunit.</p><p>The actual physiological role(s) in terms of function for the bacteria, and the pH-dependent MakA activity, remain(s) to be elucidated. A feasible hypothesis emerges when we consider the fact that the intestinal lumen of <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms is comparable to the endolysosomal compartment of human cells in terms of the low pH levels. The pH of the intestinal lumen of a living <italic>C. elegans</italic> varies from 5.96 in the pharynx to 3.59 in the lower intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauhan et al., 2013</xref>). In using <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a predatory model organism feeding on MakA-producing bacteria it will be of interest to determine if the pH-dependent activity of MakA actually plays a direct role in the toxic effect on the worms. Investigation of MakA’s pathophysiological effects and molecular interactions with intestinal tissue and cell membranes in the worms should reveal if analogous tube-like structures are formed.</p><p>From the perspective of protein engineering and nanotube formation, we suggest that the present findings on formation of MakA lipid/protein spiral structures have potential to be useful in fields of protein/membrane engineering and synthetic biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

SLM+ TxRed liposomes were created using the same protocol as above except for the addition of 1 mol% TxRed-DHPE and the corresponding reduction of POPC content to 38.5 mol%. The individual lipids dissolved in chloroform were mixed together, dried under nitrogen, and then stored in a vacuum for a minimum of 1 hr. The dried lipid film was then rehydrated using a pre-heated citrate-potassium buffer at pH 4.5 (20 mM citric acid, 50 mM KCl, pH 4.5, 40°C) to a lipid concentration of 1 mg/mL. The solution was then extruded at ~40°C 11 times through a polycarbonate membrane with a 100 nm pore size using an Avanti mini extruder.

Coverslips were cleaned by boiling in 7× detergent (MP Biochemicals) for 2 hr followed by extensive rinsing in 18 MΩ water and blow drying with nitrogen. Clean coverslips were fitted with poly(dimethylsiloxane) sheets containing 10 µm holes to create glass-bottomed wells. SLBs were made by adding 10 µL of 0.1 mg/mL of either SLM or SLM + TxRed liposomes to each well and incubating the wells at 37°C for 30 min before rinsing the wells with citrate-potassium buffer to remove excess liposomes. Wells were then extensively rinsed with citrate buffer at pH 6.5 (120 mM sodium citrate) prior to protein addition. Either Alexa568-MakA or unlabeled MakA diluted in citrate buffer at pH 6.5 was then added to a well to reach a final concentration of 3 µM.

The pH of IMDM cell culture media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin was adjusted to either 5.0, 6.5, 7.4, or 8.0, followed by treatment with an increasing concentration of MakA for 4 hr. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound MakA and lysed in ice-cold NP-40 cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 300 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1× phosSTOP, and protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche). For Western blot analysis of purified lysosomes, HCT8 or Caco-2 cells were grown in a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/flask), overnight. Cells were treated with vehicle or MakA (250 nM, 18 hr) and lysosomes were purified using the Lysosome Isolation Kit (ab234047, Abcam), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified lysosomes from HCT8 and Caco-2 cells were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (0.05%) for 10 min at 37°C followed by the addition of stop solution Tris-HCl (200 mM, pH 6.8). Subsequently, sample buffer was added to the vehicle- or MakA-treated lysosomes with or without crosslinking. After mixing with sample buffer, cell lysates or lysosomes were boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 5% skim milk in 0.1% PBST (RT, 1 hr). The membranes were incubated with the respective primary antibodies in 5% skim milk (4°C, overnight). After washing with PBST (0.1%), membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in 5% skim milk (RT, 1 hr). The membranes were developed with chemiluminescence reagent, Clarity Western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) or SuperSignal West femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Thermo Scientific).

After adding 3 μL sample to the grids, they were washed twice with MQ water and stained with 1.5% uranyl acetate solution (EMS, Hatfield, PA), followed by MQ water washing. Grids were examined with Talos L120C, operating at 120 kV.

The contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined using CTFFIND-4.1.14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>), and empty or micrographs with poor CTF fits or low ice quality were removed after manual inspection, which reduced the total to 1351 micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Helical reconstruction tools in RELION-3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He and Scheres, 2017</xref>) were used for subsequent image processing. Filaments were selected manually using the helix picker in RELION-3.1 with an outcome of 13,784 picked start and endpoints. First, segments were extracted between the picked start and endpoints as 2× binned data using a box size of 437 Å (210 pixels, 2.084 Å/px) with an inter-box distance (IBD) of 23 Å, resulting in 195’809 segments, which were subjected to 2D classification with 80 classes and a spherical mask of 360 Å. Classes displaying a straight filament with high-resolution features (152’961 segments) were refined without symmetry using a featureless cylinder (diameter 320 Å) generated with the helix toolbox in RELION-3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In parallel, a 2D classification was performed by extracting 65’241 segments from 2× binned data, applying a box size of 646 Å (310 px, 2.084 Å/px), an IBD of 62 Å, and a spherical mask of 580 Å.</p><p>The volume, refined without symmetry, was used to determine the helical symmetry parameters. First, diameter and repeat distance were visually analyzed in this volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Further, the repeat distance was confirmed from a corresponding summed power spectrum and by measuring the layer-line distance-1 in collapsed power spectra obtained using SPRING-0.86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desfosses et al., 2014</xref>) or BSOFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</xref>) and averaged using RELION-3.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Next, to determine the helical twist and rise, the number of turns and subunits per repeat were counted from the initial reconstructed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), and the handedness of the reconstruction was, after the subsequent high-resolution refinement described below, confirmed using the MakA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For the final reconstruction, 95’603 segments were extracted unbinned with 460-pixel boxes (479 Å) and an IBD of 46.56 Å. Subsequent 2D classification with a 432 Å spherical mask resulted in 65’485 segments that were 3D refined using a featureless cylinder as a template and a spherical mask of 360 Å. Local symmetry searches were performed to narrow down the helical symmetry by refining helical twist (48–50°) and rise (5.4–6 Å), yielding a map with an overall 4.1 Å resolution. Subsequent Bayesian polishing improved the resolution to 3.8 Å, and estimation of anisotropic magnification and CTF refinement resulted in a final map with an overall resolution of 3.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). As the peripheral region was less well resolved, a subsection of the structure was isolated via signal subtraction, centered in a 260-pixel box and subjected to 3D classification without symmetry and local searches with an increasing sampling rate from 3.7°, 1.8°, and 0.9° angles. From the resulting three classes, further refinement of class 2 (56.8%) yielded a map of the two tetramers in isolation at an overall resolution of 4.1 Å with improved peripheral density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>, blue branch, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). As the resulting three classes showed different conformations of the MakA head region, we examined whether these conformations exist across the volume. Two subsequent 3D classifications into five classes, without image alignment but with local symmetry searches, first with all classes, then with the top class from the first run, showed a normal distribution of angles, ranging from 48.48° to 48.68° suggesting continuous motion/rotation along the filament axis, which is most pronounced in the tail region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, blue branch, lower right).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Model building, refinement, and validation</title><p>To obtain an initial model of the tail domain, the MakA crystal structure (PDB-6EZV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dongre et al., 2018</xref>) was rigid-body docked into the density map using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). Regions where the density/model fit was poor (no density, difference in conformation) were trimmed. This included the C-terminal tail (res. 351–365) and the central region (res. ~ 160–260). Elements in the tail domain with poor density fit were rigid-body docked. The central region of the protein, which includes the neck and head, was built de novo in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The model was first refined against the asymmetric map of the two tetramers in isolation (4.1 Å) using phenix.real_space_refine (version 1.14–3260) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Next, this model was rigid-body docked into the 3.7 Å helical map, two neighboring placeholder molecules were symmetry expanded to provide interaction interfaces, and refined with secondary structure restraints. The final model contains four MakA subunits with trimmed sidechains in the tail domain (N-terminus to 159, 281 to C-terminus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Edward H Egelman as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Adam Frost (Reviewer #2); Ana J Garcia-Saez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The topology of the structure raises a concern as it appears to be the opposite of what would occur in a cellular context. This needs to be addressed.</p><p>2) The authors should clarify whether these experimental conditions for the addition of MakA to the extracellular medium at acidic pH would have any physiological relevance in the context of the actual host/pathogen interaction</p><p>3) The map:model FSC cannot be believed, or at least it cannot be understood why it is so much better than the map:map FSC.</p><p>4) There appears to be some similarity to the major refolding of ESCRT-III proteins. This should be either discussed or dismissed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are some general problems with the approach used for helical symmetry determination. While it certainly appears that the correct symmetry has been found for the inner core, it is entirely possible that the outer region may have a reduced symmetry (such as by dimerization) that leads to a lower resolution when the core symmetry is imposed. A simple way to check this would be by generating an averaged power spectrum from the segments. Does this power spectrum only show the helical symmetry of the core, or are their additional layer lines that cannot be explained by the core? This is quite different from what has been done, which relies on power spectra from 2D class averages. As has been shown, the averaged power spectrum is not the same as the power spectrum of an averaged image. While what I suggest may sound far-fetched, it has actually been shown for bacterial flagellar filaments that the core can have a higher symmetry than the outer domains, which can form dimers in some species.</p><p>There is something very strange about the map:model FSC, since the apparent resolution is ~ 3.0 Å. How is this possible?</p><p>There appear to be some similarities in terms of the major refolding of the subunit with ESCRT-III proteins. This should be discussed. Is there potential homology?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Can the authors distinguish possible mechanisms for how acidic pH triggers the MakA change, the &quot;opening of a Swiss army knife blade&quot;? Which residues near the C-terminal tail, hinges, or β-tongue may be pH sensitive?</p><p>2) Figure 3A. These binding isoforms have unusual response profiles that make them challenging to interpret. This protein's binding and unbinding from membranes is not a simple first-order process: MakA polymerizes upon the membrane. Do the authors think the upward slope reflects ongoing assembly? How are the liposomes anchored to the L1 chip? How does the reported binding constant account for polymerization (I don't think it does, so this is a Kapparent of 49nm?). On balance, these data add little to the story.</p><p>3) The high-resolution features recovered in the helical reconstruction indicate that the symmetry imposed is &quot;correct&quot; -- at least to the FSC-estimated resolution of the map. However, the procedure described for determining the symmetry from a 2D class average is not accurate and should not be perpetuated.

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that pH may regulate the activity of MakA. In additional experiments we exposed the target cells to MakA under different pH conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed dramatic increase in the activity of MakA when the pH of the extracellular media was acidic (Figure 1 and Figure 2).</p><p>In the Discussion section of our amended manuscript, we have pointed out that the actual physiological role(s) in terms of function for the bacteria of the pH-dependent MakA activity remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Nevertheless, we also point out a feasible case where the acidic pH effect on MakA might have physiological relevance in the context of a host/bacterium interaction.

There is no obvious sequence homology or structural similarity between the MakA and ESCORT-III proteins. Furthermore, the modes of membrane interaction appears different between the two. These aspects are now highlighted in the Discussion section by referring to the recent studies by Nguyen et al., (2020). To illustrate the clarified points, we included an additional supplementary figure that displays the apparent differences between the pore-forming toxin MakA's unique oligomeric form and the ESCRT-III proteins, (Figure 4—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are some general problems with the approach used for helical symmetry determination. While it certainly appears that the correct symmetry has been found for the inner core, it is entirely possible that the outer region may have a reduced symmetry (such as by dimerization) that leads to a lower resolution when the core symmetry is imposed. A simple way to check this would be by generating an averaged power spectrum from the segments. Does this power spectrum only show the helical symmetry of the core, or are their additional layer lines that cannot be explained by the core? This is quite different from what has been done, which relies on power spectra from 2D class averages. As has been shown, the averaged power spectrum is not the same as the power spectrum of an averaged image. While what I suggest may sound far-fetched, it has actually been shown for bacterial flagellar filaments that the core can have a higher symmetry than the outer domains, which can form dimers in some species.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #1 for the thorough reading of our manuscript and for providing very constructive input. We are addressing each point raised in the comments below and believe that the manuscript has improved substantially.</p><p>Reviewer #1 raised a valid point regarding the possible differing symmetry of the inner and outer filament cores. To investigate this possibility, we calculated the summed power-spectra (PS) from 1331 selected segments as well as from 271 projections of the final volume and compared them. All power spectra agree well with each other, including the PS of the 2D class average, and no additional layer lines are visible (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). Furthermore, we have confirmed the symmetry parameters by performing broad global searches of the helical twist and rise in CryoSPARC (Figure 4—figure supplement 2F).</p><p>Based on our analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and 2), we assume that continuous motion along the filament axis, together with the dynamic nature of the solvent-exposed dimer, contributes to the reduced resolution in the peripheral region rather than imposing a symmetry that only describes the core. Our assumption is based on a number of factors:</p><p>– Movement / flexing along the filament axis: A 3D classification without image alignment but with local symmetry searches (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, blue branch, lower right) shows a normal distribution of angles with a major particle population at a twist of 48.57 degree. Reclassification of this population again results in normal distributed particles. We expect such behaviour for continuous states along the filament axis.</p><p>– Local conformational differences and flexibility of the solvent exposed tail: The isolation of two MakA tetramers from the segments using signal subtraction followed by 3D classification and refinement (without imposing symmetry) allowed us to improve the peripheral density and connectivity. At the same time, this analysis visualized significant local conformational differences and structural heterogeneity in the tail region rather than specific states.</p><p>– Filament and interdimer wobbling due to membrane fluidity: The filament is built up like a spring with lipids in between the turns. The thin lipid bilayer might act like a lubricant for the protein spiral. The non-uniform nature of the lipid mixture introduces additional heterogeneity in thickness and membrane-behavior. We expect the MakA proteins embedded in a thin lipid bilayer with no protein/protein interactions between turns and only minimal interactions between asymmetric subunits to be dynamic.</p><p>– Suboptimal interactions within the dimer interface: Recent in vitro studies show that MakA is part of a tripartite pore-forming toxin complex consisting of three structurally homologous proteins (MakA, MakB, and MakE). The homodimer could represent a suboptimal structural state, with reduced stability or steric problems, and therefore potentially does not form a perfect and stable dimer as it might form with MakB, MakE, or in a trimer with both. However, such heterodimers remain to be characterized at the ultrastructural level.</p><p>Taken together, these points suggest that the less well resolved tail region of MakA is a result of motion. To clarify the procedure used to determine the helical symmetry parameters, we have adjusted the text in the method section and the legend of Figure 4—figure supplement 2<bold>.</bold> Furthermore, for full transparency, we have uploaded the raw dataset to the public repository EMPIAR under accession code EMPIAR-10869</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is something very strange about the map:model FSC, since the apparent resolution is ~ 3.0 Å.

This should be discussed. Is there potential homology?</p></disp-quote><p>Both proteins promote tubulation of membranes ultrastructurally, and, as observed for MakA, the human ESCORT-III protein CHMP1B/IST1 induces a positive membrane curvature. However, the proteins exhibit considerable differences in terms of membrane interaction and oligomeric assembly: Through positively charged phospholipid-interacting regions in helix 1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 4<bold>,</bold> indicated in red), CHMP1B proteins associate with, and coat, a membrane externally, resulting in a stable continuous and intact membrane. MakA in contrast, possesses transmembrane domains that integrate into and span the lipid bilayer. When the membrane is disassembled and linearized, a lipid spiral around the filament axis forms, together with the MakA subunits. This indicates destabilization of the membrane, which is consistent with the proposed cytotoxicity of MakA, as opposed to the membrane remodeling and fission regulated by ESCRT-III.</p><p>MakA and CHMP1B have no obvious structural or sequence homology at the molecular level. However, certain similarities can be observed regarding active and inactive monomer conformations. Both proteins exist in a closed, soluble, inactive state in which the C-terminus shields the membrane-interacting region from the surrounding solvent (McCullough et al., Science, 2015; Shim et al., Traffic, 2007; Tang et. al, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016). The inactive monomers transition into an open, active, insoluble conformation, in which the proteins’ secondary structure changes from loop (CHMP1B) or a β sheet (MakA) to a membrane-associated helix in CHMP1B (McCullough et al., Science, 2015) and to the MakA transmembrane helices which are exposed to the environment. Activation of ESCRT-III is achieved by reduction of ionic strength (McCullough et al., Science, 2015), whereas the trigger for MakA seems to be pH dependent.</p><p>The open, active conformation of CHMP1B, requires its binding partner, IST1, to co-polymerize and promote membrane tubulation (McCullough et al., Science, 2015), whereas MakA oligomerizes on its own into a helical filament in vitro by forming pairs of dimers. However, as stated in the Discussion section, it should be noted that when MakA is interacting in vitro with its other binding partners from <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, the structurally related MakB and MakE proteins, it acts as a component in a tripartite complex forming oligomeric pore structures in membranes at neutral pH (Nadeem et al., 2021). The observed structural heterogeneity within the dimer pair of MakA shown in the present study at acidic pH is presumably reflecting its ability to engage in heteromeric interactions with the other two Mak proteins.</p><p>Moreover, the protein-protein interactions of oligomerized CHMP1B and MakA are very different: While one CHMP1B molecule binds to four subsequent CHMP1B monomers that are almost parallel packed next to each other resulting in a low-fence-like structure (McCullough et al., Science, 2015), MakA forms pairs of dimers, which are organized in the shape of a single propellor blade.</p><p>To clarify the similarities and differences between MakA and ESCRT-III, we have included an additional figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) for comparative purposes and added a paragraph for clarification to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Can the authors distinguish possible mechanisms for how acidic pH triggers the MakA change, the &quot;opening of a Swiss army knife blade&quot;?

These binding isoforms have unusual response profiles that make them challenging to interpret. This protein's binding and unbinding from membranes is not a simple first-order process: MakA polymerizes upon the membrane. Do the authors think the upward slope reflects ongoing assembly?
