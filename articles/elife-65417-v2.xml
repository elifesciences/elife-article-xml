(VNTs) mediate the selective uptake and enrichment of small-molecule neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs) and are therefore a major determinant of the synaptic output of specific neurons. To identify novel VNTs expressed on SVs (thus identifying new neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators), we conducted localization profiling of 361 solute carrier (SLC) transporters tagging with a fluorescent protein in neurons, which revealed 40 possible candidates through comparison with a known SV marker. We parallelly performed proteomics analysis of immunoisolated SVs and identified seven transporters in overlap. Ultrastructural analysis further supported that one of the transporters, SLC35D3, localized to SVs. Finally, by combining metabolite profiling with a radiolabeled substrate transport assay, we identified UDP-glucose as the principal substrate for SLC35D3. These results provide new insights into the functional role of SLC transporters in neurotransmission and improve our understanding of the molecular diversity of chemical transmitters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurotransmitters</kwd><kwd>transporter</kwd><kwd>solute carrier</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicles</kwd><kwd>UDP-glucose</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z181100001318002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011620</institution-id><institution>Center for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011230</institution-id><institution>State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yulong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of novel vesicular transporters will shed light on to expanding the chemical diversity of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The release of extracellular signaling molecules by secretory vesicles is a strategy used by a wide range of cell types and tissues and plays an essential role under both physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burgoyne and Morgan, 2003</xref>). A key step in the process is the accumulation of the respective signaling molecules into the secretory vesicles by specific transporter proteins. In the nervous system, vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (VNTs) such as VGLUT and VGAT (which transport glutamate and GABA, respectively) are essential for the transport of small-molecule neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs). These selective transporters determine the category, amount, and transport kinetics of neurotransmitters, thereby establishing the molecular basis of the underlying chemical neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blakely and Edwards, 2012</xref>). All VNTs identified to date belong to the Solute Carrier (SLC) superfamily of membrane transport proteins, the second-largest group of membrane proteins in the human proteome, with more than 400 members spanning 65 subfamilies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://slc.bioparadigms.org/">http://slc.bioparadigms.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hediger et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, approximately 30% of these 400 transporters are either uncharacterized or orphan transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">César-Razquin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perland and Fredriksson, 2017</xref>), providing the opportunity to identify novel VNTs and their cognate substrates, thus identifying new neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators.</p><p>The physiological role of transporter proteins is closely coupled with their subcellular localization; however, to date, localization profiling of transporters – particularly SLC transporters, including which are expressed on secretory organelles in primary cells – has not been systematically studied. Tagging a protein of interest with a fluorescent protein is a widely used strategy for localization profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simpson et al., 2000</xref>), and this approach offers an effective strategy for screening large numbers of targeted proteins. In addition, the development of mass spectrometry (MS)‒based proteomics coupled with subcellular fractionation has made it possible to examine the subcellular spatial distribution of the proteome both rapidly and efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christoforou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orre et al., 2019</xref>), including the SV proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laßek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Immunoisolation of SVs, followed by proteomic analysis using high-sensitivity MS, provides a specific and efficient method for characterizing the molecular anatomy of SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grønborg et al., 2010</xref>) including endogenous SLC transporters.</p><p>Electron microscopy (EM) is the gold standard to obtain ultrastructural information since it offers the vastly superior resolution (on the order of 1 nm in biological samples) compared to the resolution of optical imaging (on the order of 200–300 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Suárez and Ting, 2008</xref>). Moreover, using a genetically encoded tag for EM overcomes certain limitations associated with classic immuno-EM labeling methods, which require specific antibodies and penetration of those antibodies. APEX2, an enhanced variant of ascorbate peroxidase, is a highly efficient proximity-based EM tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lam et al., 2015</xref>) suitable for determining the subcellular localization of proteins of interest.</p><p>Identifying the molecular function of an orphan transporter is an essential step toward understanding its biological function. However, using the classic radiolabeled substrate transport assay to deorphanize transporters is a relatively low-throughput approach, particularly given the virtually unlimited number of chemicals that can be tested. On the other hand, metabolite profiling using MS is a high-throughput method for knowing the content metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chantranupong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vu et al., 2017</xref>) that can offer insights into candidate substrates. Thus, combining metabolite profiling together with the radiolabeled substrate transport assay will likely yield new insights into the molecular function of orphan transporters.</p><p>The nucleotide sugar uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-glucose) plays an essential role in glycosylation in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the release of UDP-glucose into the extracellular space was detected previously using an enzyme-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lazarowski et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequent experiments with 1231N1 cells (an astrocytoma cell line) showed that the release of UDP-glucose requires both Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and the secretory pathway, as the release was inhibited by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA and the Golgi apparatus blocker brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreda et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Nucleotide sugars are transported into subcellular organelles by the SLC35 family, which contains 31 members, including 20 orphan transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caffaro and Hirschberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishida and Kawakita, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song, 2013</xref>). Importantly, the level of nucleotide sugars released by cells can be manipulated by changing the expression of SLC35 transporters; for example, knocking out an SLC35 homolog in yeast decreased the release of UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-galactosamine, whereas overexpressing human SLC35D2 in airway epithelial cells increased UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-galactosamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sesma et al., 2009</xref>). However, whether UDP-glucose is transported by a SLC35 transporter located on secretory organelles is currently unknown.</p><p>In this study, we screened 361 SLC members using localization profiling and identified 40 candidate vesicular transporters. In parallel, we performed proteomics analyses of immunoisolated SVs from mouse brain samples and found that seven transporters overlapped, including the orphan SLC35 subfamily transporters SLC35D3, SLC35F1, and SLC35G2. Further ultrastructural analysis using APEX2-based EM supported that the SLC35D3 is capable of trafficking to SVs. Finally, we combined metabolite analysis and the radiolabeled substrate transport assay in subcellular organelles and identified UDP-glucose as the principal substrate of SLC35D3.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a subset of SLC35 proteins as putative vesicular transporters using localization screening of SLC transporters</title><p>To identify new candidate vesicular transporters, we performed localization screening of SLC transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First, we created a cloning library containing 361 human SLC family members fused in-frame with the red fluorescent protein mCherry; we then systematically co-expressed individual SLC-mCherry construct with EGFP-tagged synaptophysin (SYP-EGFP) to label SVs in cultured rat cortical and hippocampal neurons, revealing the localization of SLC transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Of the 223 SLC transporters that trafficked to neurites, 134 showed overlap with SYP-EGFP and were analyzed further by quantifying the co-localization ratio between the red and green fluorescent signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,E</xref>). As expected, known synaptic vesicular transporters such as VGLUT and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) had relatively high co-localization ratio with SYP-EGFP (50–80% co-localization) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>), whereas markers of non-vesicular organelles such as the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria had relatively low co-localization ratio (10–20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Setting a threshold at the co-localization ratio for VGLUT3 – a well-known vesicular transporter – revealed a total of 40 candidate vesicular transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Among these candidates, a subset of SLC35 transporters, including SLC35D3, SLC35F1, and SLC35G2, had a co-localization ratio of approximately 70% with SYP-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). In contrast, other members of the same subfamily, such as SLC35A1, SLC35E1, and SLC35E2, localized primarily to organelles in the soma and had relatively low co-localization ratio (10–20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that putative vesicular transporters, including a subset of SLC35 family members, likely localize to neuronal SVs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Localization profiling of SLC family members reveals candidate vesicular transporters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Schematic diagram of the localization profiling strategy. Red and green fluorescent signals were collected using confocal microscopy imaging of cultured rat neurons co-expressing mCherry-tagged SLC proteins and EGFP-tagged synaptophysin (SYP-EGFP).

To study the substrate specificity of SLC35D3, we performed a competition assay in which we applied a 100-fold higher concentration of non-radiolabeled substrate together with radiolabeled UDP-glucose in the transport assay. We found that non-radiolabeled UDP-glucose – but not the structurally similar UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-galactosamine – virtually eliminated the transport of radiolabeled UDP-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In addition, several other UDP-sugars partially inhibited transport activity but were not enriched in the metabolite profiling, possibly by competing with UDP-glucose on the transporter’s substrate-binding pocket. Interestingly, CMP-sialic acid did not reduce the transport of UDP-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), even though this nucleotide sugar was increased – albeit to a lesser extent than UDP-glucose – in the organelles of cells expressing SLC35D3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), indicating that CMP-sialic acid may not be a direct substrate of SLC35D3 but may have been indirectly increased on its abundance as shown by metabolite profiling.</p><p>We also measured the time course and dose dependence of UDP-glucose transport by SLC35D3, revealing a time constant of 2.9 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and a Km value of 0.87 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Lastly, we examined the role of the electrochemical proton gradient on SLC35D3 activity, as this gradient has been reported to drive the activity of known VNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edwards, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van Liefferinge et al., 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, Bafilomycin A1 did not reduce the transport. Unlike the proton uncouplers that directly abolish the proton electrochemical gradient, Bafilomycin A1 inhibits V-ATPase that indirectly affects the maintenance of proton electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshimori et al., 1991</xref>). There can be preserved proton electrochemical gradient in SVs after the acute application of Bafilomycin A1, as indicated by a previous work using pH-dependent quantum dots to study SV Kiss and Run (K and R) and full-collapse fusion (FCF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), which may support UDP-glucose transport by SLC35D3.</p><p>To compare the transport mechanism of SLC35D3 with a canonical ER/Golgi localized SLC35 transporter, we investigated the pharmacological properties of SLC35A3, which is an ER/Golgi localized UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Moreover, the transport activity of GDP-mannose by a yeast homolog of the nucleotide–sugar transporters was neither sensitive to CCCP nor valinomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker and Newstead, 2017</xref>), which also suggested different transport mechanisms among nucleotide–sugar transporters. Further studies by proteoliposome reconstitution of purified SLC35D3 can help to illustrate the detailed transport mechanism, e.g., if SLC35D3 has the obligate exchanger activity.

For example, the vesicular nucleotide transporter SLC17A9 has been reported to play a role in vesicular ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sawada et al., 2008</xref>), but was not identified in our proteomics analyses of SVs, consistent with reports by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grønborg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, our analysis did not identify SLC10A4, another vesicular transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larhammar et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, studies regarding these low-abundance transporters may require more robust strategies such as enriching specific SVs from VNT-expressing brain regions, using specific antibodies against VNTs, or generating transgenic mice expressing biochemical labels on specific VNTs.</p><p>In addition to our study, a subset of SLC35 family members was also reported by SV proteomics. SLC35G2 was recently reported in SV proteomics using an improved workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taoufiq et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, SLC35D3 was not simultaneously identified, potentially due to a few reasons: (1) the proteome may vary across different species at different ages (SD rats at 4–6 weeks vs C57BL6 mice at 6–8 weeks); (2) SLC35D3 has an even lower protein abundance compared with SLC35G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which is more challenging for detection; and (3) different purification strategies may lead to differences in SV pools. For example, another SLC35 family member, SLC35F5, was found to be enriched in VGAT-positive SVs instead of VGLUT1-positive SVs, even though the majority of the two proteomes were highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyken et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grønborg et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, these studies provided hints for identifying vesicular SLC35 transporters.</p><p>Biochemical fractionation strategies (e.g., differential fractionation and density gradient fractionation) combined with antibodies recognizing endogenous proteins are classic in validating the subcellular localization of the protein of interest. Given limited performance of antibodies in detecting SLC35D3, we tried exogenous delivery of SLC35D3 using AAV-PhP.eB, which infected the whole mouse brain efficiently therefore providing satisfactory starting materials. It is worth noting that AAV-PhP.eB potentially results in overexpression of SLC35D3 in the brain that may affect the subcellular distribution of the transporter. In addition, the LP2 fraction (crude SVs) after differential fractionation may contain other organelles such as secretory granules and lysosomes. Subsequent studies using more efficient SLC35D3 antibodies and further purified SVs can be of help to validate the localization of endogenous SLC35D3 in vivo.</p><p>Combining metabolite profiling with a radiolabeled substrate transport assay is a powerful tool for identifying and characterizing transporter substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vu et al., 2017</xref>), which could facilitate the classic deorphanization of an orphan transporter by screening the costly and environmentally unfriendly radioactive ligands in transport assay. Therefore, targeted candidates in metabolic profiling were in a higher priority for further validation like radioactive transport assay. Here, we show that this strategy can indeed be effective for studying orphan vesicular transporters located on secretory organelles. The performance of metabolic profiling and the transport assay is largely dependent on the signal-to-noise/signal-to-background ratio. Here in addition to function as an extracellular signaling molecule, UDP-glucose is also known to be accumulated in ER/Golgi for glycosylation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez and Hirschberg, 1986</xref>). This transport activity mediated by endogenous transporters contributes to the basal signal and limits the performance of overexpressed SLC35D3 in metabolic profiling as well as the transport assay based on organelles derived from the secretory pathways. Further optimization of the deorphanization strategy, e.g., knockingout endogenous transporters can be tested to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>SLC35D3 is expressed primarily in striatal neurons that project to the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus externa in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lobo et al., 2006</xref>), and mice with a recessive mutation in the <italic>SLC35D3</italic> gene have decreased motor activity, impaired energy expenditure, and develop obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, an important question for future studies is how SLC35D3 and its substrate UDP-glucose play a role in these circuits. The substrate of SLC35D3, UDP-glucose, is generally synthesized and exists in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>). In our hypothesis, UDP-glucose will be transported into SVs in SLC35D3-positive neurons and undergo regulated exocytosis upon stimulations. After the extracellular signaling process, UDP-glucose can be degraded by ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (E-NPPs), which is widely known to metabolize nucleoside triphosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazarowski and Harden, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, previous studies regarding G protein‒coupled receptors (GPCRs) found that UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, could serve as the ligand of the purinergic receptor P2Y14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2001</xref>), indicating that nucleotide sugars may function as extracellular signaling molecules, a notion supported by the fact that the P2Y14 receptor is widely expressed in a variety of brain regions and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). The P2Y14 receptor is coupled primarily with the Gαi protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chambers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>), which does not elicit an excitatory downstream calcium signal. Thus, whether the P2Y14 receptor plays a role in SLC35D3-expressing neurons is an interesting question that warrants investigation.</p><p>In addition to function in the central nervous system, it is possible that SLC35D3 also plays a role in the peripheral tissues. SLC35D3 can be localized to secretory organelles in platelets, and mutations on SLC35D3 lead to malfunction of the secretory organelles in platelets of mice, which resembles HPS syndrome that causes bleeding in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chintala et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meng et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, UDP-sugars can mediate vasoconstriction of the porcine coronary artery through the P2Y14 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>). Whether or not there is a general principle of vesicular UDP-glucose release mediated by SLC35D3 in different tissues would be an important question to answer.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

All plasmid sequences were verified using Sanger sequencing (TsingKe Biological Technology). For the localization studies in cultured neurons, the open-reading frames (e.g., SLC-mCherry, SLC-APEX2, SYP-EGFP, organelle marker-EGFP, etc.) were cloned into the N3 vector under the control of the CAG promoter. To generate stable cell lines expressing various SLC35 transporters, we generated the pPacific vector containing a 3’ terminal repeat, the CAG promoter, a P2A sequence, the puroR gene, and a 5’ terminal repeat; the genes of interest were then cloned into a modified pPiggyBac (namely pPacific) vector using Gibson assembly. Two mutations (S103P and S509G) were introduced in pCS7-PiggyBAC (ViewSolid Biotech) to generate a hyperactive piggyBac transposase for generating the stable cell lines.

The cells were then homogenized using a ball-bearing homogenizer (10 μm clearance). The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min to remove the nuclei and cellular debris. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 g for 25 min. For metabolite profiling, the pellet was washed three times in ice-cold KPBS, and the metabolites were extracted in 80% methanol, freeze-dried, and stored at −80°C. For the transport assay, the pellet was resuspended in uptake assay buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose, 2 mM KCl, 2 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), aliquoted, and stored at −80°C.</p><p>For SV fractionation, the procedure was adapted from previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huttner et al., 1983</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Briefly, mouse brains were gently homogenized in sucrose buffer containing 0.32 M sucrose and 4 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min to remove the nuclei and cellular debris. The resulting supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged at 9200 g for 15 min. The pellet (P2) was resuspended in sucrose buffer and recentrifuged at 10,200 g for 15 min. The resulting pellet (P2’) was resuspended in 1 ml sucrose buffer and then added with 9 ml ice-cold water. After three strokes, the lysate was immediately added with 80 μl 1M HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) and kept on ice for 30 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 25,000 g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant (LS1) was further centrifuged at 165,000 g for 2 hr to get a pellet (LP2) of crude SVs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Targeted metabolite profiling</title><p>Samples were analyzed using a TSQ Quantiva Ultra triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with an Ultimate 3000 UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization probe. Chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution on a Hypercarb PGC column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mobile phase A consisted of 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate dissolved in pure water, and mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile. A 25 min gradient with a flow rate of 250 μl/min was applied as follows: 0–1.2 min, 4% B; 1.2–19 min, 4–35% B; 19–20 min, 35–98% B; 20–22 min, 98% B; 22–25 min 4% B. The column chamber and sample tray were kept at 45°C and 10°C, respectively. Data were acquired using selected reaction monitoring in negative switch ion mode, and optimal transitions are reported as the reference. Both the precursor and fragment ion fractions were collected at a resolution of 0.7 FWHM. The source parameters were as follows: spray voltage: 3000 V; ion transfer tube temperature: 350°C; vaporizer temperature: 300°C; sheath gas flow rate: 35 arbitrary units; auxiliary gas flow rate: 12 arbitrary units; collision-induced dissociation gas pressure: 1.5 mTorr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Uptake assay</title><p>For the radiolabeled substrate transport assay, 20 μg of the membrane fraction was incubated with the indicated concentration of radiolabeled substrate at 37°C for 5 min (unless otherwise).

Krantz (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Qian et al., reports SLC35D3 as a synaptic vesicle transporter for UDP-glucose. This transporter has been implicated basal ganglia function, energy expenditure and obesity. The manuscript is well-written and the study largely well-executed. The authors performed two screens to identify synaptic vesicle transporters, a localization assay in transfected rat neurons and a proteomic screen of immuno-isolated synaptic vesicle proteins in mice. From these screens they reported the identification of 40 and 20 transporters, respectively, and of these, 7 were present in both screens. Four are vesicular transporters with already known substrates and three are orphan transporters. The authors used metabolite profiling to identify UDP-glucose as the putative substrate of one of the identified orphan transporters, SLC35D3. Transport assays on isolated membranes from transfected HEK293 cells were then used to characterize further its substrates and inhibitors and dependence on the proton electrochemical gradient. While these experiments point to SLC35D3 as a novel synaptic vesicle transporter, which would be the important finding of this study, there are a number of concerns raised by the reviewers as to the veracity of this conclusion that will first need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. There is a concern that the localization screen and the EM resulted in over-expression of the transporter, which could cause its mis-localization to synapses. If there is an available antibody that the authors can show is specific to the transporter, the authors could immunostain brain slices or cultured neurons to show co-localization of the endogenous transporter with synaptophysin. If an antibody is not available, the authors could use lentivirus with an epitope tagged transporter to try to avoid over-expression. Since synaptophysin also localizes to secretory granules, it would be helpful to co-stain with a bona fide secretory granule-specific marker such as Chromogranin A but also see #2 below.</p><p>2. There is a concern that the synaptic vesicle isolation is not pure enough to conclude that SLC35D3 is on synaptic vesicles (as opposed to secretory granules or other intracellular organelles). To mitigate this, the authors could perform subcellular fractionation to isolate synaptic vesicles, secretory granules, ER, Golgi etc by size and relative density differences via a classical biochemical method such as density gradient centrifugation. This would allow the authors to determine the relative enrichment of the transporter in these compartments which is also important to know since SLC35 family members have been reported to reside in Golgi/ER compartments.</p><p>3. There are also concerns regarding the dependence on the proton electrochemical gradient. The authors show that BafA1, which inhibits the proton ATPase does not have an effect on transport. This contradicts their findings with FCCP and nigericin. The authors should discuss the finding with BafA1 relative to the other findings and whether the transporter acts as an obligate exchanger. Related to the possibility that the transporter instead resides on Golgi/ER, the authors should compare the activity of SLC35D3 with a more canonical ER/Golgi member of the family to demonstrate the difference in mechanism. This may also involve fractionation of the membranes as mentioned in #2.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Localization, proteomics, and metabolite profiling reveal a putative vesicular transporter for UDP-glucose&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor, Olga Boudker.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There is still some concern amongst the reviewers that the authors have not convincingly demonstrated that the transporter resides exclusively or primarily on synaptic vesicles in vivo. In the absence of an antibody that recognizes the transporter in brain slices, the reviewers suggested that the authors use lentivirus to minimize overexpression, which the authors did in cultured neurons and indeed expression was lower with the lentivirus and still colocalized to a significant extent with an antibody to synaptophysin. However, for the brain tissue subcellular fractionation study, the authors instead used AAV PhP.eB, which showed similar overexpression as plasmid transfection in cultured cells raising some doubt about its subcellular distribution in this context. Also, although the fractionation did show some enrichment on LP2, the levels of the transporter were otherwise fairly similar across fractions. Lastly, the LP2 fraction is too crude as localization of the transporter to other organelles within this fraction is instead possible.</p><p>Thus, the reviewers request that the authors use density gradient fractionation to identify more precisely the identity of the organelle(s) where the transporter resides in vivo. (And lentivirus is preferred if possible over PhP.eB.) If this experiment is not included in the revised manuscript, the authors need to discuss the above mentioned limitations (use of PhP.eB virus likely leads to transporter overexpression in brain and interpretation of LP2 as being crude) when describing the fractionation experiment and the authors will need to temper their claim throughout the manuscript that the transporter localizes exclusively or primarily to SVs in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would have been helpful to see what happens if the authors had injected the lentivirus construct into the mice and looked for colocalization with markers of synaptic vesicles (VGLUT1, VGAT, synaptophysin) as well as performed the fractionation study. It is likely they chose the PHP.eb because of the retro-orbital injection and supposedly good spread of the virus.</p><p>Otherwise the authors have satisfied my concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Li and colleagues have provided a number of additional experiments and have satisfactorily addressed most of the points. However, one prominent concern remains regarding the subcellular localization of SLC35D3. Essentially, the authors performed a crude synaptosomal preparation and examined a fraction that is enriched in synaptic vesicles and has relatively little ER and Golgi. Nevertheless, the authors overstate the purity of the fraction examined. Indeed, as much as ~30% of SLC35D3 co-localizes with chromogranin A, a canonical secretory granule marker suggesting that this fraction is enriched in secretory granules as well as synaptic vesicles. One strong possibility therefore is that SLC35D3 is not purely found in synaptic vesicles but that it is also localized to other vesicular compartments including secretory granules. The authors did not test enriched the crude synaptic vesicle fractions like LP2 for other compartments like endoscopes, lysosomes etc. raising further questions about the definitive intracellular localization. This would also be in line with the discrepancy concerning the absence of being reported in recent synaptic vesicle proteomics studies such as Taoufiq et al. (2020). Therefore, without obtaining a highly purified synaptic vesicle fraction either through classical biochemical means or even via recently reported immuno-isolation (for example, see Chantranupong et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020), concluding that SLC35D3 is truly a synaptic vesicle transporter cannot be made conclusively.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded very thoughtfully to the concerns raised. Questions still persist about the synaptic vesicle localization (still reliant on over-expression and the enrichment by fractionation is not strong), but there is not much more the authors can do given the low expression of endogenous 35D3. Similarly, the lack of bafilomycin effect is surprising since this usually results in run-down of the membrane potential--although the pH gradient may be more resistant (H<sup>+</sup> efflux requires movement of a counterion). Since other family members differ in mechanism, I suspect this transporter does not depend on a H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient, accounting for the bafilomycin result, but it is difficult to explain the effect of nigericin as indirect, so again, there is not much more the authors can do and their comparison to another family member here is helpful. Again, it is unclear why the published proteomics has not identified 35D3 but the authors have done all they can and the results presented are reasonable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a thorough job responding to the reviewers' comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65417.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

There is a concern that the synaptic vesicle isolation is not pure enough to conclude that SLC35D3 is on synaptic vesicles (as opposed to secretory granules or other intracellular organelles). To mitigate this, the authors could perform subcellular fractionation to isolate synaptic vesicles, secretory granules, ER, Golgi etc by size and relative density differences via a classical biochemical method such as density gradient centrifugation. This would allow the authors to determine the relative enrichment of the transporter in these compartments which is also important to know since SLC35 family members have been reported to reside in Golgi/ER compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns, we performed differential centrifugation [1] (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) to fractionate the mouse brain for different subcellular components, and then determined the level of SLC35D3.

There are also concerns regarding the dependence on the proton electrochemical gradient. The authors show that BafA1, which inhibits the proton ATPase does not have an effect on transport. This contradicts their findings with FCCP and nigericin. The authors should discuss the finding with BafA1 relative to the other findings and whether the transporter acts as an obligate exchanger. Related to the possibility that the transporter instead resides on Golgi/ER, the authors should compare the activity of SLC35D3 with a more canonical ER/Golgi member of the family to demonstrate the difference in mechanism. This may also involve fractionation of the membranes as mentioned in #2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out.</p><p>The inhibition mechanism of BafA1 is different from FCCP and nigericin.

SVs can still preserve proton electrochemical gradient after acute application of BafA1, as indicated by previous work using pH-dependent quantum dots to study SV Kiss and Run (KandR) and full-collapse fusion (FCF) [2]. In contrast, proton uncouplers including FCCP and nigericin can directly abolish the proton electrochemical gradient.

We found the pharmacological treatment including proton uncouplers didn’t significantly inhibit UDP-N-Acetyl-glucosamine transport, indicating SLC35A3 may have a different transport mechanism compared with SLC35D3 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Moreover, the transport activity of GDP-mannose by a yeast homolog of the nucleotide-sugar transporters was neither sensitive to CCCP nor valinomycin [4], which also suggested different transport mechanisms among nucleotide-sugar transporters.

In the absence of an antibody that recognizes the transporter in brain slices, the reviewers suggested that the authors use lentivirus to minimize overexpression, which the authors did in cultured neurons and indeed expression was lower with the lentivirus and still colocalized to a significant extent with an antibody to synaptophysin. However, for the brain tissue subcellular fractionation study, the authors instead used AAV PhP.eB, which showed similar overexpression as plasmid transfection in cultured cells raising some doubt about its subcellular distribution in this context. Also, although the fractionation did show some enrichment on LP2, the levels of the transporter were otherwise fairly similar across fractions. Lastly, the LP2 fraction is too crude as localization of the transporter to other organelles within this fraction is instead possible.</p><p>Thus, the reviewers request that the authors use density gradient fractionation to identify more precisely the identity of the organelle(s) where the transporter resides in vivo. (And lentivirus is preferred if possible over PhP.eB.) If this experiment is not included in the revised manuscript, the authors need to discuss the above mentioned limitations (use of PhP.eB virus likely leads to transporter overexpression in brain and interpretation of LP2 as being crude) when describing the fractionation experiment and the authors will need to temper their claim throughout the manuscript that the transporter localizes exclusively or primarily to SVs in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestions, and we would like to discuss the mentioned limitations.</p><p>Firstly, there is a trade-off in choosing the virus and delivery strategy. Even though lentivirus can ameliorate the expression level of protein of interest, it is difficult to achieve enough infection for biochemical fractionation study after injected into adult mouse brains since it can be only diffused and expressed in a limited brain region [1-3]. Injection into embryonic mouse brains was reported to result in a wide distribution after the developmental process [4], but it may take a few months which would be beyond the time scale of the revision. Therefore, we previously chose AAV-PhP.eB which could cross the blood-brain barrier and get delivered to the whole mouse brain easily [5] to achieve satisfactory starting input of biochemical experiments.</p><p>Secondly, using AAV-PhP.eB has its limitation in this case. The relatively high expression level of the transporter by AAV-PhP.eB may result in excess distribution of the protein in the secretory pathway, which subsequently affects the performance of either differential fractionation or density gradient fractionation for identifying the subcellular distribution of the protein of interest. This may also help to explain that the enrichment of SLC35D3 in LP2 is not as significant as SYP.</p><p>Thirdly, we agree that LP2 is crude which may contain other organelles so that we cannot rule out the possibility that SLC35D3 also localizes to other organelles such as secretory granules.</p><p>We have now added a paragraph, as shown below, in the Discussion section to clarify our experimental rationale and discuss the limitations.</p><p>Line 346-357:</p><p>“Biochemical fractionation strategies (e.g., differential fractionation and density gradient fractionation) combined with antibodies recognizing endogenous proteins are classic in validating the subcellular localization of the protein of interest. Given limited performance of antibodies in detecting SLC35D3, we tried exogenous delivery of SLC35D3 using AAV-PhP.eB, which infected the whole mouse brain efficiently therefore providing satisfactory starting materials. It is worth noting that AAV-PhP.eB potentially results in overexpression of SLC35D3 in the brain that may affect the subcellular distribution of the transporter. In addition, the LP2 fraction (crude SVs) after differential fractionation may contain other organelles such as secretory granules and lysosomes. Subsequent studies using more efficient SLC35D3 antibodies and further purified SVs can be of help to validate the localization of endogenous SLC35D3 in vivo.”</p><p>We also toned down the claim throughout the revised manuscript as suggested:</p><p>Line 25-26:</p><p>Ultrastructural analysis further supported that one of the transporters, SLC35D3, localized to SVs.</p><p>Line 105-107:</p><p>Further ultrastructural analysis using APEX2-based EM supported that the SLC35D3 is capable of trafficking to SVs.</p><p>Line 134-136:</p><p>Together, these results indicate that putative vesicular transporters, including a subset of SLC35 family members, likely localize to neuronal SVs.</p><p>Line 146-148:</p><p>SLC35D3 with relatively low expression level has a higher possibility to localize to synaptic vesicles than to secretory granules.</p><p>Line 200-202:</p><p>In summary, these data corroborate the view that SLC35D3 is less likely to be a classic ER/Golgi transporter and tends to localize to SVs.</p><p>Line 212-213:</p><p>…demonstrating that SLC35D3 could localize to SVs in cultured neurons.</p><p>Line 309-310:</p><p>Here, we report the identification and characterization of three novel SLC35 transporters putatively localized to SVs…</p><p>Line 313-315:</p><p>These data indicate the potential existence of a novel neuronal vesicular transporter of the nucleotide sugar…</p><p>Line 318-323:</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that these transporters may also play a physiological role in regulated secretory granules in non-neuronal secretory cells.

However, one prominent concern remains regarding the subcellular localization of SLC35D3. Essentially, the authors performed a crude synaptosomal preparation and examined a fraction that is enriched in synaptic vesicles and has relatively little ER and Golgi. Nevertheless, the authors overstate the purity of the fraction examined. Indeed, as much as ~30% of SLC35D3 co-localizes with chromogranin A, a canonical secretory granule marker suggesting that this fraction is enriched in secretory granules as well as synaptic vesicles. One strong possibility therefore is that SLC35D3 is not purely found in synaptic vesicles but that it is also localized to other vesicular compartments including secretory granules. The authors did not test enriched the crude synaptic vesicle fractions like LP2 for other compartments like endoscopes, lysosomes etc. raising further questions about the definitive intracellular localization. This would also be in line with the discrepancy concerning the absence of being reported in recent synaptic vesicle proteomics studies such as Taoufiq et al. (2020). Therefore, without obtaining a highly purified synaptic vesicle fraction either through classical biochemical means or even via recently reported immuno-isolation (for example, see Chantranupong et al., eLife 2020), concluding that SLC35D3 is truly a synaptic vesicle transporter cannot be made conclusively.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the remaining concerns. Please refer to our overall responses (Page 1-3) for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have responded very thoughtfully to the concerns raised. Questions still persist about the synaptic vesicle localization (still reliant on over-expression and the enrichment by fractionation is not strong), but there is not much more the authors can do given the low expression of endogenous 35D3. Similarly, the lack of bafilomycin effect is surprising since this usually results in run-down of the membrane potential--although the pH gradient may be more resistant (H<sup>+</sup> efflux requires movement of a counterion). Since other family members differ in mechanism, I suspect this transporter does not depend on a H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient, accounting for the bafilomycin result, but it is difficult to explain the effect of nigericin as indirect, so again, there is not much more the authors can do and their comparison to another family member here is helpful. Again, it is unclear why the published proteomics has not identified 35D3 but the authors have done all they can and the results presented are reasonable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have done a thorough job responding to the reviewers' comments.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for recommendation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
