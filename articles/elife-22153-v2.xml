Chronic activation of P2X7 underlies many health problems such as pathologic pain, yet we lack effective antagonists due to poorly understood mechanisms of inhibition. Here we present crystal structures of a mammalian P2X7 receptor complexed with five structurally-unrelated antagonists. Unexpectedly, these drugs all bind to an allosteric site distinct from the ATP-binding pocket in a groove formed between two neighboring subunits. This novel drug-binding pocket accommodates a diversity of small molecules mainly through hydrophobic interactions. Functional assays propose that these compounds allosterically prevent narrowing of the drug-binding pocket and the turret-like architecture during channel opening, which is consistent with a site of action distal to the ATP-binding pocket. These novel mechanistic insights will facilitate the development of P2X7-specific drugs for treating human diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22153.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22153.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>P2X7 receptor</kwd><kwd>allosteric inhibition</kwd><kwd>X-ray structure</kwd><kwd>ATP-gated ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS072869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crystal structures of a mammalian P2X7 receptor and structure-based functional studies reveal a novel drug-binding site and subtype-specific conformational rearrangements required for channel opening.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic pain is a major public health epidemic, debilitating more than 10% of adults globally with afflictions like persisting headaches, lower back pain, and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gold and Gebhart, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldberg and McGee, 2011</xref>).

Over the last decade, enormous effort has been made to develop a number of structurally distinct P2X7 specific antagonists, some of which have been demonstrated to alleviate chronic pain in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honore et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McGaraughty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartlett et al., 2014</xref>). However, mechanisms of action for these drugs remain poorly understood, hampering the development of effective therapeutic compounds for human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keystone et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya and Biber, 2016</xref>).</p><p>P2X receptors are trimeric ligand-gated ion channels that facilitate extracellular-ATP mediated signaling along with the G protein-coupled P2Y receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">North, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnstock, 2014</xref>). The P2X7 receptor belongs to the P2X receptor family, however, it was originally identified as a unique ATP-receptor named &quot;the P2Z receptor&quot;, as it harbors many characteristics distinct from P2X and P2Y receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Virgilio, 1995</xref>). For instance, the P2X7 receptor requires an unusually high concentration of ATP (EC50 ≥ 1 mM under physiological ion concentrations) for initial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2010</xref>), its channel activity is facilitated by prolonged or repeated ATP applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Surprenant et al., 1996</xref>), and it opens a membrane pore large enough for molecules up to ~900 Da to permeate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinberg et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nuttle and Dubyak, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan et al., 2008</xref>). While crystal structures of the P2X3 and P2X4 receptors have uncovered common mechanisms such as ATP-binding and gating for the P2X receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>), many questions continue to exist regarding subtype specific mechanisms, especially for the enigmatic P2X7 receptor subtype. How do structurally-unrelated drugs antagonize only the P2X7 receptor but not the other P2X subtypes? Do they target an activation mechanism unique to the P2X7 subtype? Here we identified and mapped the binding site for the P2X7 specific inhibitors for the first time using X-ray crystallography, and demonstrated by electrophysiological experiments that those inhibitors allosterically abrogate conformational changes associated with P2X7 receptor activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Architecture of a mammalian P2X7 receptor</title><p>To define the structural basis for drug binding, we first sought to determine the crystal structures of a mammalian P2X7 receptor in the presence of five structurally distinct antagonists (A740003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Honore et al., 2006a</xref>), A804598 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donnelly-Roberts et al., 2009</xref>), AZ10606120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Michel et al., 2007</xref>), GW791343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michel et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2008b</xref>), and JNJ47965567 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2013</xref>)).

This drug-binding pocket is surrounded by thirteen residues projecting mainly from β-strands (β4, β13 and β14) in the upper body domains of the neighboring subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While the precise distances and angles between the side-chains and the drugs cannot be determined at the current resolutions (~3.2–3.6 Å), electron density was clear enough to localize and orient the side chains of the drug-coordinating residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Despite structural diversity, all five P2X7 antagonists fit within the drug-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), highlighting that the size and the shape of the drug-binding pocket play major roles in determining the affinity and specificity of the drugs.

To clarify the working mechanism for each drug, we measured the dose responses of the P2X7 mediated YO-PRO-1 uptake in the presence of each drug at multiple concentrations. We used BzATP—an artificial but potent agonist of P2X7 receptors—for these experiments to achieve saturating responses in the presence of concentrated antagonist. For each drug, dose response curves fit well with a non-competitive inhibition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenakin, 2006</xref>), but poorly with a competitive model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

We exploited fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>) using a fluorescently-labeled ATP analogue (Alexa-ATP), which is as potent as ATP and is capable of triggering P2X7 channel opening at 10 μM in the absence of divalent cations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). At this concentration, Alexa-ATP gave rise to fluorescence anisotropy when incubated with P2X7 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6D</xref>). Notably, drug-treated P2X7 receptor exhibited similar levels of fluorescence anisotropy, which drastically decreased in the presence of unlabeled-ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6E</xref>). Together, these experiments strongly support that all five P2X7 antagonists are allosteric non-competitive inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>P2X7 specific conformational change during channel activation</title><p>We propose that the five studied drugs antagonize the P2X7 receptor through a common mechanism and that the unique inter-subunit cavity may be a critical locus for functional regulation. Interestingly, the inter-subunit cavity formed by β13 and β14 in the upper body domain is much wider in P2X7 than in zfP2X4 or in hP2X3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, this 'turret-like' structure and the cleft corresponding to the P2X7 drug-binding pocket remain relatively occluded in zfP2X4 and in hP2X3 after activation by ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mansoor et al., 2016</xref>). Do the drug-binding pocket and the turret in P2X7 become narrower during channel activation? To explore the involvement of the inter-subunit cavity in P2X7 receptor activation, we monitored the movement of the cavity residues with and without ATP. We first created a series of single cysteine mutants in the drug-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and measured ATP-gated channel activity after applying a large cysteine-reactive agent (MTS-TPAE; Mw: 447 Da). We reasoned that modification of a cysteine residue with a bulky moiety should interfere with the conformational changes necessary for channel opening, thereby resulting in diminished channel activity. When MTS-TPAE was applied in the absence of ATP, four cysteine mutants (F103C, K110C, T308C, and I310C) showed irreversible current reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), consistent with the idea that the covalently bound MTS-TPAE at these positions hinders the conformational changes required for channel opening. When MTS-TPAE was applied in the presence of ATP, on the other hand, none of the cysteine mutants presented significant current reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). These results indicate that at least four residues in the drug-binding pocket are more accessible to MTS-TPAE in the closed state than in the open state. Our data therefore suggest that the drug-binding pocket narrows upon ATP binding and that such a conformational rearrangement is crucial for P2X7 channel opening.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22153.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Drug-binding pocket narrows during P2X7 activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of the turret formed by β13 and β14.

Because two of the three introduced cysteines may form a disulfide bond, we pretreated the cells with a reducing agent prior to cysteine accessibility experiments. Under these conditions, MTS-TPAE diminished the Y295C channel activity by ~80% in the absence of ATP but to a lesser extent (~40%) in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). These data support that the turret also narrows during P2X7 activation. Widening of the turret upon ATP-binding is unlikely, as 1) MTS-TPAE had no effect on the Y295C mutant prior to treatment with a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating the formation of a disulfide bond that would bring the two neighboring subunits closer (Cβ-Cβ distance would change from ~14 Å to ~4 Å) and 2) Y295C mutant exhibited comparable current density with the wildtype in the absence of a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Our data suggest that this cavity shrinks during activation, which allows the lower body domain to widen further. Indeed, the ATP-binding left flipper domain is connected with the pore-lining transmembrane helix through the turret composed of two β-strands (β13 and β14), which supports that movements of the upper body domain are tightly coupled with the channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although the lower body domain in our ATP/A804598-bound structure does seem to widen to some extent upon ATP-binding, the turret diameter remains locked due to A804598 binding, rendering the accompanying movement of the pore-lining transmembrane helices insufficient for channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Closure of the turret, therefore, seems to be a prerequisite for full-widening of the lower body domain, which is necessary for channel opening. Interestingly, the turrets of both P2X3 and P2X4 are narrower even in the closed state, which may facilitate subsequent conformational changes in the lower body domain. Obviously, the crystal structure of an ATP-bound, open-state P2X7 would strengthen our hypothesis. However, it is technically challenging to obtain such a crystal structure, as ATP-bound P2X7 receptors are prone to aggregation in a detergent containing solution. Future efforts to uncover molecular details about the open state of P2X7 may yield further insight into subtype-specific activation mechanism.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that all five tested drugs are allosteric and non-competitive inhibitors, which is in contrast to the previous studies showing that A740003, A804598, and JNJ47965567 are competitive inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honore et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donnelly-Roberts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2013</xref>). This discrepancy may be attributed to the high agonist concentrations (i.e. up to 3 mM ATP or 1 mM BzATP) required for obtaining reliable EC50 values in the presence of antagonists. With such a high concentration of agonists, we noticed that the YO-PRO-1 uptake activity starts to decline ~10 min after agonist application. To minimize potential experimental artifacts, we took advantage of the initial rates instead of total counts at a certain time point used by the previous studies. Nevertheless, the Schild plots of these three compounds appear to be linear at lower concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), making it difficult to rely solely on the Schild regression analysis for determining the mode of drug action. We therefore provided extra evidence of non-competitive allosteric drug action using 1) curve fitting with known models of competitive and non-competitive inhibition, 2) ligand-binding assays in the presence of antagonists, and 3) the crystal structure of P2X7 obtained in the presence of both an agonist and an antagonist.</p><p>Combined with the crystal structures, information about the drug-receptor specific interactions provide an excellent platform for rationally improving physicochemical properties of currently available P2X7 antagonists. For example, replacing the phenyl group in JNJ47965567 with a slightly bulkier group may increase the binding affinity of this compound, as that would fill the void around residue F95. Likewise, low potency of AZ10606120 and GW791343 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) may be overcome by replacing chemical moieties with those fit better into the drug-binding pocket. Our data also suggest that it may be possible to attach an extra chemical group to the site away from the residue interacting with F103 without affecting binding of the P2X7 antagonists. This leads to an interesting possibility that these drugs could be conjugated with cell penetrating peptides or specific ligands expressed on endothelial cells, which may improve the delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Liu, 2012</xref>). In addition, identification of an unexpected binding pocket within P2X7, that is absent in the closely related P2X4, should allow for engineering of isoform-specific drugs. Development of a new generation of P2X7 antagonists with increased clinical efficacy has the potential to have a significant impact on the treatment of chronic pain and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construct design</title><p>Ten mammalian P2X7 genes (human: Q99572.4; giant panda: XP_002913164.1; horse: XP_001495622.1; cattle: NP_001193445.1; dog: NP_001106927.1; rabbit: XP_002719791.1; rat: Q64663.1; mouse: Q9Z1M0.2; opossum: XP_001373213.1; guinea pig: NP_001166578.1) were synthesized based on the protein sequences (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and subcloned into a modified pFastBac baculovirus expression vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) that harbors a Strep-tag and EGFP at the N-terminus (pNGFP-FB3). These P2X7 constructs were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and screened using the FSEC strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</xref>). Briefly, Sf9 cells at a cell density of 1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in six well plates were infected with 20 μl/well of P1 virus (10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> PFU/mL), harvested after 48 hr, and solubilized in 150 μl of S1 buffer (1% n-Dodecyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM; Anatrace, Maumee, OH) and Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in phosphate-buffered saline; (pH 7.4)) for 30 min at 4°C. The soluble fractions were collected by ultra-centrifugation at 87,000 × g for 30 min and analyzed by FSEC. Because the full-length P2X7 receptors were poorly expressed in Sf9 cells and did not crystallize in our initial trials, C-terminally truncated versions of the nine P2X7 receptor orthologues (~240 residues removed from the C-terminus) were rescreened by FSEC. Based on the sharp and symmetrical peak profile, the C-terminally truncated panda P2X7 (pdP2X7) was selected for crystallization trials. A series of terminal deletions and glycosylation mutants of pdP2X7 were screened for improving the expression level, stability, and monodispersity. The best behaved construct (Δ1-21/Δ360-600/N241S/N284S) formed crystals in the P4<sub>2</sub> space group that diffracted to ~7 Å, which was sufficient for obtaining an initial electron density map by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of the zebrafish P2X4. To improve crystal packing, we screened combinations of point mutants at the predicted crystal contact sites for crystallization/diffraction behavior. Finally, we obtained a construct termed pdP2X7<sub>cryst</sub> (Δ1-21/Δ360-600/N241S/N284S/V35A/R125A/E174K), which formed crystals in a different space group (I2<sub>1</sub>3) that diffracted to ~3.5 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Expression and purification</title><p>pdP2X7<sub>cryst</sub> was expressed as an EGFP-fusion protein using a baculovirus-insect cell system.

The cells were broken by nitrogen cavitation at 600 psi using a 4635 cell disruption vessel (Parr Instrument, Moline, IL). After removing unbroken cells and debris by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 185,000 × g for one hour and solubilized in S2 buffer (2% Triton X-100 (Anatrace) in PBS (pH 7.4)) for one hour. The soluble fraction was collected after centrifugation at 185,000 × g for one hour and incubated with StrepTactin Sepharose High Performance resin (GE Healthcare, Marlborough, MA) for 30 min using a batch procedure. The resin was transferred into a gravity column (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA) and washed with 10 column volumes of W buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM DDM), and pdP2X7cryst-EGFP was eluted with E buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl; pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM desthiobiotin, 15% glycerol, and 0.5 mM DDM).

HEK293 cells were split into six well plates at a cell density of 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well and incubated overnight. Three hours after transfection with 2 μg of the full length pdP2X7 in pIM2 vector (IRES-mCherry; modified from pIE2 vector) using jetPRIME reagent (Polyplus-transfection, France), cells were trypsinized, transferred into poly-D-Lysine coated black-walled 96 well plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at 7.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well, and incubated for 24 hr. Cells were washed with assay buffer (2 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 13 mM Glucose, 147 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3)) and were incubated with 5 μM YO-PRO-1 Iodide (Thermo Fisher Scientific), in the presence or absence of antagonists at multiple concentrations at 37°C for 10 min. Upon application of 1 mM ATP (final), uptake of YO-PRO-1 was recorded with 1 min intervals by following the fluorescence change using a Synergy HT multi-detection microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT; Ex: 485 nm/20, Em:528 nm/20, sensitivity 60). To obtain the dose dependent uptake inhibition by antagonists, the initial rates of YO-PRO-1 uptake were plotted against multiple concentrations of the P2X7 specific drugs.

Cells were transfected with 1 μg of the full length pdP2X7 (wildtype or mutants) or the full length mP2X4 (wildtype or mutants) in pIE2 vector using FuGENE6 (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were used 18–32 hr after transfection for measuring the P2X receptor activities using the whole cell patch clamp configuration. Membrane voltage was clamped at −60 mV with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), currents were filtered at 2 kHz (eight-pole Bessel; model 900BT; Frequency Devices, Ottawa, IL) and sampled at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1440A and pCLAMP 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). The extracellular solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 13 mM Glucose, 2 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, (pH 7.3). The pipette solution contained 147 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, which was adjusted to pH 7.0 using NaOH. Whole cell configuration was made in an extracellular solution supplemented with 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and the extracellular solutions were rapidly exchanged to the solutions containing desired concentrations of ATP using a computer-controlled perfusion system (RSC-200; Bio-Logic, France). Because pdP2X7 substantially runs up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and E</xref>), we measured the channel activity after treating the cells with 1 mM ATP for at least 20 s. For testing the effects of P2X7 specific antagonists on pdP2X7, these drugs were incubated with ATP (1 mM) for 1 min. Concentrations of the drugs were: A740003: 600 nM; A804598: 180 nM; AZ10606120: 2.3 μM; GW791343: 50 μM; JNJ47965567: 136 nM. For the cysteine accessibility studies on pdP2X7, 0.1 mM MTS-TPAE (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada) was perfused for 10 s either in the absence or presence of 1 mM ATP. For probing mP2X4 accessibility in the closed state, 0.1 mM MTS-TPAE was applied for 10 s and application of 10 μM ATP for 1 s was used to measure channel activity. For mP2X4 accessibility in the open state, 5 μM ATP was applied for 9 s and 0.1 mM MTS-TPAE was applied for 3 s. For measuring cysteine accessibility of pdP2X7/Y295C or mP2X4/F296C mutants, cells were treated with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 5 min prior to recording. To normalize the channel activities from multiple experiments, the ratio between channel activity before and after MTS-TPAE application was calculated for each cell. Since mP2X4 rapidly runs down, these ratios were further normalized to the control channel activities measured on the same cell in the absence of MTS-TPAE. Stock solutions of 100 mM MTS-TPAE were prepared freshly every 5 hr in water and stored on ice and were diluted to the desired concentrations in the extracellular solution immediately before each recording. All recordings were performed using more than five cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the personnel at beamlines 24-ID of the Advanced Photon Source, X-25 of National Synchrotron Light Source, and F1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hiro Furukawa (Reviewer #2) and Mark L Mayer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an exciting manuscript describing the first X-ray structure of the P2X7 receptor, a subtype of ATP-activated P2X receptors implicated in a range of interesting biological processes, including pain and apoptosis. Structures were solved in the presence of 5 distinct inhibitors, and for one of them in the combined presence of ATP. These structures show that the drugs bind in a completely unanticipated region of the receptor, in a cleft originating from the external surface of the receptor that resides behind the ATP binding pocket. In the one case when ATP was bound to the receptor along with antagonist, closure of the lateral ATP binding domain occurs similar to what is seen in the original structure of the ATP-bound zfP2X4 receptor, as well as the very recently published ATP-bound P2X3 receptor, but opening the pore is prevented by the presence of the drugs in the cleft, suggesting that it narrows as the channel opens. Interestingly, the drug-binding cleft is essentially absent from P2X3 and 4 receptors, explaining why the drugs studied here are selective for P2X7. The new structures presented are accompanied by extensive functional experiments, including 1) mutagenesis of the drug-binding cleft to confirm the unexpected binding site, 2) Schild analysis demonstrating that the drugs do not work through a competitive mechanism as suggested for 3 of the compounds by earlier work, and 3) accessibility studies with bulky MTS reagents that are consistent with the cleft being wide in the closed state and narrowing upon ATP binding. Overall this is a beautiful study that arrives at interesting and important new conclusions concerning the gating mechanism and mechanism of drug action for the P2X7 receptor. The work could be published anywhere and <italic>eLife</italic> is fortunate to have this one. Revision should be straightforward.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following two concerns could be addressed by careful revision of the manuscript without performing additional experiments, but it is important that they take these issues seriously.</p><p>1) Although the location of the bound drug molecules is convincingly demonstrated by Fo-Fc maps, it is far from clear that the current resolution of any structure reported in the paper (3.2 – 3.9 Å) is high enough to support the detailed models in presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> in which side chain interactions with bound ligands are reported. Indeed, the 2Fo-Fc map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> appears to show tubes of electron density for α-helices, without any side chains. How robust are the chosen side chain rotamers during refinement; is the helical register correct; how do these issues impact the models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>? Also, how dependent on side chain conformations are the HOLE plots and graph presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</p><p>2) The conclusion that the antagonists &quot;allosterically prevent narrowing of the drug-binding pocket and the turret-like architecture during channel opening&quot; is a reasonable hypothesis derived from a combination of functional experiments with MTS reagents, and a comparison with previously reported P2X3 and P2X4 crystal structures, but there is no direct proof of this. In our opinion the authors overstate what their data actually shows. What is lacking is an agonist (ATP) bound P2X7 structure in which the turret has adopted an active compact conformation. They should carefully revise the manuscript to address this, and perhaps explain why this was not done, and an indirect approach of functional assays with Cys mutants and MTS-TPAE adopted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22153.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The following two concerns could be addressed by careful revision of the manuscript without performing additional experiments, but it is important that they take these issues seriously.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although the location of the bound drug molecules is convincingly demonstrated by Fo-Fc maps, it is far from clear that the current resolution of any structure reported in the paper (3.2 – 3.9 Å) is high enough to support the detailed models in presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> in which side chain interactions with bound ligands are reported.

We therefore avoided describing potential specific-interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. We also performed site-directed mutagenesis for the drug-surrounding residues, where we validated the involvement of these residues in drug-binding. Nevertheless, locations and orientations of the side chains around the drug-binding pocket are well-supported by the reasonable electron density in these regions. To clarify these points, we added 1) a sentence in the main text describing the limitation of our current structures, 2) a new video (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) showing the electron density of the drug-binding residues around one of the antagonists (JNJ47965567), and 3) a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) that shows the side chain electron density for the residues comprising the turret (β13 and β14) and the α-helix whose helical-register was questioned. We believe that these extra video and figure support the models presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> as well as the HOLE plots and graph presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>The 2Fo-Fc map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> includes only one short helix (D89-T90-A91-D92-Y93) whose side chain densities are relatively well-defined. Unfortunately, the angle of this figure prevents readers from appreciating how good the side chain densities are, as the point of this figure was to show no obvious density in the drug-binding pocket. The newly added figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) should solve this issue. In addition, combining the fact that the helical register in this region is consistent with those of P2X3 and P2X4, miss-assignment of residues in this region is highly unlikely.</p><p>We selected the side chain rotamers that fit best in the electron density, which is a standard way of modeling a low resolution structure. While there is a chance that the side chain rotamer is incorrect, a wrongly assigned rotamer should not have major impact on the models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, as the approximate orientation of each side chain should remain the same. Likewise, the HOLE plots would be only minutely different, if different side chain conformations are used. Indeed, positions of the peptide backbone account for the major differences in the HOLE plots.</p><p><italic>2) The conclusion that the antagonists &quot;allosterically prevent narrowing of the drug-binding pocket and the turret-like architecture during channel opening&quot; is a reasonable hypothesis derived from a combination of functional experiments with MTS reagents, and a comparison with previously reported P2X3 and P2X4 crystal structures, but there is no direct proof of this. In our opinion the authors overstate what their data actually shows. What is lacking is an agonist (ATP) bound P2X7 structure in which the turret has adopted an active compact conformation. They should carefully revise the manuscript to address this, and perhaps explain why this was not done, and an indirect approach of functional assays with Cys mutants and MTS-TPAE adopted.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers and rephrased the stronger statement about the conformational changes. We also added a description about why we are short in obtaining an ATP-bound P2X7 structure in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
