experience significant mechanical forces while recirculating, but the consequences of these forces are not fully understood. Recent work has shown that gain-of-function mutations in mechanically activated Piezo1 cation channels are associated with the dehydrating RBC disease xerocytosis, implicating a role of mechanotransduction in RBC volume regulation. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations result in RBC dehydration are unknown. In this study, we show that RBCs exhibit robust calcium entry in response to mechanical stretch and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression. Furthermore, RBCs from blood-cell-specific Piezo1 conditional knockout mice are overhydrated and exhibit increased fragility both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that Yoda1, a chemical activator of Piezo1, causes calcium influx and subsequent dehydration of RBCs via downstream activation of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, directly implicating Piezo1 signaling in RBC volume control. Therefore, mechanically activated Piezo1 plays an essential role in RBC volume homeostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07370.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07370.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07370.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Within our bodies, cells and tissues are constantly being pushed and pulled by their surrounding environment. These mechanical forces are then transformed into electrical or chemical signals by cells. This process is crucial for many biological structures, such as blood vessels, to develop correctly, and is also a key part of our senses of touch and hearing.</p><p>In 2010, researchers discovered a group of ion channels—proteins embedded in the membrane that surrounds a cell—that open up when a force is applied and allow calcium and other ions to enter the cell. This movement of ions generates the electrical response of the cell to the applied force. However, not much is known about the roles of these ‘Piezo’ ion channels.</p><p>Red blood cells experience significant forces when they pass through narrow blood vessels. In a disease called xerocytosis, the red blood cells become severely dehydrated and shrink. In 2013, researchers discovered that patients with this disease have mutations in the gene that codes for the Piezo1 protein: a Piezo protein that has also been linked to a role in blood vessel development in embryos. This suggested that Piezo1 may regulate the volume of red blood cells.</p><p>Cahalan, Lukacs et al.—including some of the researchers who worked on the 2010 and 2013 studies—have now investigated the role of Piezo1 in red blood cells in more detail. Applying strong forces to red blood cells from mice caused calcium to rapidly enter cells through Piezo1 channels.</p><p>Cahalan, Lukacs et al. then deleted the Piezo1 gene from red blood cells. This made the cells larger and more fragile than normal cells because they contained too much water. To investigate how Piezo1 regulates water content, the cells were treated with a chemical compound called Yoda1. This compound was shown in a separate study by Syeda et al. to activate Piezo1 channels. Activating Piezo1 caused a second type of ion channel to open up as well, which allowed potassium ions and water molecules to leave the cell. This resulted in the cell becoming dehydrated.</p><p>This work raises the possibility that Piezo proteins are involved in other diseases where red blood cell volume is altered. In particular, many believe that Piezo1 may be involved in sickle cell disease, a possibility that can now be tested using the tools described in this study.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07370.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07370.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>red blood cells</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>physiology</kwd><kwd>cell volume regulation</kwd><kwd>knockout animals</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patapoutian</surname><given-names>Ardem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patapoutian</surname><given-names>Ardem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ranade</surname><given-names>Sanjeev S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship 14POST20000016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cahalan</surname><given-names>Stuart M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In red blood cells, the Piezo1 protein is responsible for sensing mechanical forces and volume regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian red blood cells (RBCs) are rather unique in that they lack a nucleus and many organelles and that they traverse the circulatory system several hundred thousand times in their life cycle. RBCs experience significant mechanical forces while recirculating that influence their physiology in many ways, including changes in deformability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chien, 1987</xref>), ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sprague et al., 2001</xref>), NO release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yalcin et al., 2008</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Larsen et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyrda and et al., 2010</xref>), the latter of which can influence RBC volume. Changes in RBC volume can affect their membrane integrity and ability to travel through capillaries with diameters smaller than the RBCs themselves. The critical importance of RBC volume regulation is demonstrated by several pathologies resulting from either overhydration or dehydration of RBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallagher, 2013</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which RBCs sense mechanical forces and the effects of these forces on volume homeostasis have remained unclear.</p><p>Recent studies have identified a conserved family of mechanosensitive non-selective cation channels, Piezo1 and Piezo2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coste et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2012</xref>). Piezo1 responds to a wide array of mechanical forces, including poking, stretching, and shear stress, and is essential for proper vascular development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nilius and Honore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>). The potential role of Piezo1 in RBC physiology is most clearly demonstrated by many gain-of-function mutations in Piezo1 that have been identified in patients with the RBC disease xerocytosis, also called dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andolfo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, whole body treatment of zebrafish with Piezo1 morpholino affects RBC volume homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faucherre et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the Piezo1 locus has also been implicated in a genome-wide association screen for affecting the RBC mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">van der Harst et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether any of these effects are due to Piezo1 expression on the RBCs themselves is not understood nor is the normal role of Piezo1 in mammalian RBC physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first investigated whether Piezo1 is expressed on mouse RBCs using <italic>Piezo1</italic><sup><italic>P1-tdTomato</italic></sup> mice that express a Piezo1-tdTomato fusion protein from the <italic>Piezo1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>). Both peripheral blood RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and developing bone marrow pro-RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) from <italic>Piezo1</italic><sup><italic>P1-tdTomato</italic></sup> mice exhibited increased tdTomato fluorescence by flow cytometry compared to those from <italic>Piezo1</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> mice.

To further investigate the role of Piezo1 in RBC physiology, we set out to genetically ablate it. Mice deficient in Piezo1 die in utero, so we deleted Piezo1 specifically in the hematopoietic system. We bred Vav1-iCre mice, which express Cre recombinase early in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shimshek et al., 2002</xref>), to mice where exons 20–23 of <italic>Piezo1</italic> are flanked by loxP sites (P1<sup>f</sup>), thus generating viable, fertile Vav1-iCre P1<sup>f/f</sup> (Vav1-P1cKO) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Vav1-P1cKO lymphocytes exhibited &gt;95% deletion of <italic>piezo1</italic> transcript, demonstrating efficient Cre-mediated excision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Hematological analysis of blood from Vav1-P1cKO mice revealed significant changes in RBC physiology without significant anemia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Notably, compared to WT mice, Vav1-P1cKO mice had elevated (% of WT ± SEM) mean corpuscular volume (MCV, 109.51 ± 1.51) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH, 103.14 ± 0.48) and reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, 94.37 ± 1.08), suggesting that Piezo1-deficient RBCs were overhydrated. Since increased MCV can also be observed in the dehydrated RBCs in xerocytosis, we further tested whether Piezo1-deficient RBCs were actually overhydrated. Overhydrated RBCs exhibit increased osmotic fragility and increased size as measured by forward scatter using flow cytometry. Blood from Vav1-P1cKO mice exhibited both of these characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), demonstrating that Piezo1-deficient RBCs are overhydrated. While Vav1-P1cKO RBCs were overhydrated, scanning electron microscopy of WT and Vav1-P1cKO RBCs revealed that Vav1-P1cKO RBCs had relatively normal discoid morphology, unlike more severe overhydration pathologies such as spherocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Regardless, these results suggest that Piezo1 expression on RBCs is a negative regulator of RBC volume.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07370.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Piezo1 in blood cells causes RBC fragility and splenic sequestration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: flow cytometry histograms of tdTomato fluorescence on Ter-119<sup>+</sup> peripheral blood red blood cells (RBCs).

Although they appeared visibly darker and redder following H&amp;E staining, spleens from Vav1-P1cKO mice exhibited normal formation of both red and white pulp without an evident expansion of red pulp or increased iron deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). However, flow cytometric analysis of splenic RBC subpopulations revealed an increased number of fully mature Ter119<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>−</sup> RBCs, but not immature Ter119<sup>+</sup> CD71<sup>+</sup> RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the darker splenic color is due in part to retention of overhydrated circulating mature RBCs. Consistent with this, immature splenic RBCs had similar forward scatter in WT and Vav1-P1cKO mice, indicating that they were of similar size, while fully mature RBCs in Vav1-P1cKO exhibited increased forward scatter indicative of increased size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also found that Vav1-P1cKO mice exhibited significantly lower plasma haptoglobin concentrations, indicative of intravascular hemolysis in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, Piezo1-deficient RBCs have increased fragility and are aberrantly retained within the spleen, suggesting that Piezo1 helps maintain RBC integrity and normal recirculation.</p><p>Piezo1 is a mechanically activated, calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel. RBCs experience significant mechanical forces during circulation; we, therefore, sought to determine whether acute application of mechanical force could cause Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and whether any Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx observed was dependent on Piezo1. However, many of the existing methods of mechanical stimulation available to us proved unsuitable for this purpose. Patch-clamp experiments proved impractical as conditions that allowed the formation of gigaohm seals in a cell-attached setting resulted in cell rupture upon application of negative pressure. Additionally, RBCs were also too small and fragile for indentation using a glass probe with or without simultaneous electrophysiological recording. Calcium imaging studies using shear stress in laminar flow chambers did not yield detectable increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>We, therefore, developed a mechanical stimulation assay combining the advantage of calcium imaging (no gigaohm seal necessary) and patch clamp (a pipette to capture the cell). We used micropipettes with a long, tapered tip and optimized their size and shape (tip diameter ∼1–1.5 μm) so that RBCs could only partially enter into the pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the presence of 0.05% BSA, mechanical stimulation of these cells was possible without causing cell rupture by applying negative pipette pressure using a high-speed pressure clamp device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This method allowed for quantitative and reproducible application of force while detecting changes in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Application of negative pressure induced a rapid rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in Fluo-4-loaded WT RBCs with a threshold of ∼ −5 mmHg and a P<sub>50</sub> of −9.72 ± 0.51 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, repeated applications of negative pressure induced a mild rundown in the calcium response. To account for this, we normalized all responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> to the average of two maximal (−25 mmHg) stimuli flanking each test pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Following removal of a half-maximal −10 mmHg stimulus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels declined to baseline with an average t<sub>1/2</sub> of 21 ± 1.8 s. This increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration must be a result of influx rather than receptor-mediated store release as RBCs do not possess intracellular stores. To conclusively determine whether this Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was Piezo1-mediated, we subjected Vav1-P1cKO RBCs to similar negative pressure stimulation. We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was not detectable in any Vav1-P1cKO RBCs, even at pressures up to −35 mmHg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Experiments using Vav1-P1cKO RBCs were conducted using the same pipettes that previously elicited Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in WT RBCs, allowing for equivalent mechanical stimulation between genotypes. These results demonstrate that RBCs can respond to mechanical force by allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter the cell and that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is dependent on Piezo1.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07370.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>RBCs exhibit Piezo1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in response to mechanical stretch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: cartoon representation of mechanical stretching of RBCs.

In fact, RBCs from one strain of mice lacking KCa3.1 exhibit increased size and osmotic fragility similar to what is seen in Vav1-P1cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grgic et al., 2009</xref>). We tested whether Yoda1 could cause RBC dehydration, and whether any possible dehydration was mediated through KCa3.1 activation by Piezo1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Treatment of WT RBCs, but not Vav1-P1cKO RBCs, with 15 μM Yoda1 led to a rapid change in their shape, progressing from discocytes to echinocytes to spherocytes, similar to what has been demonstrated for treatment with A23187 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Steffen et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>We further tested the osmotic fragility of blood following treatment with Yoda1 and/or the KCa3.1 antagonist TRAM-34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wulff et al., 2000</xref>). Incubation of WT, but not Vav1-P1cKO blood, for 30 min with 5 μM Yoda1 caused a marked reduction in RBC osmotic fragility that was prevented by a 10-min pretreatment with 2 μM TRAM-34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Both WT and Vav1-P1cKO RBCs exhibited reduced osmotic fragility when treated for 30 min with 1 μM A23187, demonstrating normal functionality of KCa3.1 in Vav1-P1cKO RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The lack of any Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, shape changes, or changes in osmotic fragility of Vav1-P1cKO RBCs in response to Yoda1 further demonstrates the specificity of Yoda1 on Piezo1. Importantly, TRAM-34 did not block Piezo1 HEK293T cells transfected with Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data as a whole suggest a model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> whereby activation of Piezo1 on RBCs leads to calcium influx, potassium efflux through KCa3.1 that is accompanied by water loss, resulting in RBC dehydration.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Many of the effects exerted by physical forces on cellular physiology remain unclear. Here, we have shown that these forces have a significant effect on RBC physiology by activating the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. Our findings suggest a link between mechanical forces and RBC volume via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Piezo1. The ability of RBCs to reduce their volume in response to mechanical forces could improve their ability to traverse through small-diameter capillaries and splenic sinusoids. Additionally, it is possible that this reduction in volume could aid in oxygen/CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the periphery by concentrating hemoglobin within RBCs, which may promote release of oxygen from hemoglobin; in fact, mechanical stimulation of RBCs via optical tweezers has been shown to cause such a release of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rao et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>It was not previously clear whether the cause of RBC dehydration in DHS patients is due to direct or indirect mechanisms. We have demonstrated that genetic deletion of Piezo1 in blood cells leads to overhydrated, fragile RBCs. We have also shown that mechanical force can cause calcium influx into RBCs that is dependent on Piezo1 expression. We cannot exclude the possibility that deletion of Piezo1 alters RBC membrane properties, resulting in decreased activity of a separate mechanosensitive ion channel rather than calcium entering the cell through Piezo1 itself. We find this unlikely given the relatively mild overhydration of Vav1-P1cKO RBCs and the complete absence of any mechanically induced calcium influx in these cells. Finally, using the first identified selective small molecule activator of Piezo1, we have shown that calcium influx through Piezo1 dehydrates RBCs via the actions of KCa3.1. These findings are consistent with the observation of dehydrated RBCs from DHS patients with gain-of-function Piezo1 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zarychanski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andolfo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2013</xref>), further supporting that the dehydration seen in DHS patients is due to increased Piezo1-mediated calcium influx in response to mechanical forces in RBCs themselves.</p><p>This work also demonstrates the power of combining both genetic and chemical approaches. Experiments performed on Piezo1-deficient background demonstrate the specificity of Yoda1; meanwhile, the acute effect of Yoda1 on RBC dehydration allows us to conclude that Piezo1 activity can regulate cell volume regulation via KCa3.1 activation and suggests that changes in RBC volume in Vav1-P1cKO mice are not a consequence of developmental compensation or non-cell autonomous mechanisms.</p><p>Piezo1 has been proposed by many to mediate a non-selective current observed in sickle cell disease (SCD) called P<sub>Sickle</sub>, which acts upstream of KCa3.1 to mediate RBC sickling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lew et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ranney, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demolombe et al., 2013</xref>). While KCa3.1 inhibitors can improve many hematological indices of SCD patients, they have thus far been ineffective in preventing painful vasculo-occlusive crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ataga et al., 2008</xref>). Generation of mice containing conditional deletion of Piezo1 in blood cells combined with full replacement of normal murine hemoglobin genes with sickling human hemoglobin genes could help determine whether Piezo1 mediates both P<sub>Sickle</sub> and the pathology of SCD. Inhibiting Piezo1 may modulate other pathways in addition to potentially blocking KCa3.1-dependent dehydration that may have therapeutic benefits in patients with SCD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Piezo1<sup>P1-tdTomato</sup> fusion knockin mice were generated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ranade et al.

By using conditional Piezo1 deletion from red blood cells, a novel mechanical assay combining fluorescent calcium-imaging with cell membrane stretch and the novel chemical Piezo1-specific agonist described in the accompanying manuscript they demonstrate that calcium-influx is completely dependent on Piezo1 and leading to cell dehydration via the ion channel KCAa3.1.</p><p>The finding is novel because it clearly links activity of Piezo1 to Xerocytosis for which previous evidence coming from Piezo1 gain-of-function mutations, zebrafish Piezo1 morpholino treatment and genome-wide association studies was only indirect. It is significant because it identifies Piezo1 as a molecular target for Xerocytosis, demonstrates that chemical modulation of Piezo1 activity can directly red blood cell volume and opens the possibility to study mechanisms of sickle cell disease.</p><p>With one exception (see below) I find that the conclusions are well supported by the data and I anticipate my suggestions for experiments or careful discussion will address my concern. The manuscript writing is lacking some carefulness and below I am listing a number of minor points that should all be addressed.</p><p>Major concern:</p><p>1) Since Vav1-P1cKO cells are drastically different in shape I am not convinced that the mechanical stimulus applied in the calcium-imaging/membrane stretch experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is equivalent to the control (wild-type) cells. Other mechanosensitive ion channels might be present in these cells and their activation not obvious due to changed cell elasticity. While the data on chemical Piezo1 activation by Obi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) convincingly demonstrate that Piezo1 is able to induce dehydration, the conclusion that calcium-influx upon membrane-stretch is entirely dependent on Piezo1 is still overreaching. To address this issue experimentally, the authors could combine fluorescent calcium-imaging with cell-poking (no patch pipette). If cells that are briefly treated with Obi1 (e.g. 1minute exposure to Obi1 and then wash) are similar in elasticity I would expect an extension/activity profile similar to that obtained from untreated cells. In an alternative experiment the authors could transiently induce calcium influx into wild-type cells to induce dehydration and subsequently assay mechanical sensitivity of Piezo1. At the least this issue has to be discussed and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> has to be modified to show that chemical (and only perhaps mechanical) activation of Piezo1 leads to calcium influx and cell dehydration.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) In the Results, the authors report that RBC have ‘similar forward scatter in WT and Vav1-P1cKO mice’, but they do not give an explanation or interpretation of this result.</p><p>2) When explaining the novel mechanical stimulation assay the authors fail to mention that cells are loaded with fluorescent calcium indication (Fluo-4) to monitor calcium levels.</p><p>3) The sentence ‘WT or Vav1-P1cKO RBCs loaded with the calcium-sensitive dye Fluo-4 and then treated 15uMObi1’ does not make sense.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: The panel is lacking axis labels. Please, add.</p><p>5) All experiments: please indicate the actual number of experiments (n) instead of general statements (e.g. at least 3 WT mice).</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>: Please indicate the meanings of all abbreviations. Also, it would be interesting and helpful to cite (or measure) these values from human Xerocytosis patients in order to put the values in perspective.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>: The time course of calcium-increase with respect to mechanical stimulation is not clear to me. Does it happen upon release of pressure? Please clarify this.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: The sequence of amplitudes of mechanical stimuli is unusual and I would normally expect successively larger stimuli. What was the reason for this protocol and how will it influence channel response due to inactivation?</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>: The panel is lacking axis labels.

In the present manuscript, they report that Piezo1 plays a major role in regulating the volume of red blood cells (RBCs). Opening of Piezo1 in response to mechanical stress is responsible for a calcium influx in RBCs. Increasing intracellular calcium leads to the opening of the KCa3.1 Gardos channel, loss of K<sup>+</sup> ions and dehydration. Deletion of Piezo1 specifically in hematopoietic cells caused RBC fragility and sequestration in the spleen. By contrast, Piezo1 opening with the newly discovered opener Obi1 (see companion paper), results in RBC dehydration. Importantly, this effect is absent when Piezo1 is deleted in RBCs. It is concluded that Piezo1 may contribute to Psickle.</p><p>This is a very important paper for understanding how RBCs regulate their volume and help to decipher the mechanisms involved in RBCs pathology, including Xerocytosis and Sickle Cell disease. Moreover, this paper further demonstrates “physiologically” the effect of the Piezo1 opener Obi1 (see companion paper). The manuscript is very well written and presented. The technical quality of the work appears to be sound. I don't see much to change in this report, which could be published in its present form. This manuscript is a very nice complement of the other report concerning the discovery of Obi1. I only have a few minor points and suggestions which may help to further improve the quality of this great paper.</p><p>Minor points and suggestions:</p><p>1) Is Obi1 active on the Piezo1 gain-of-function mutations causing Xerocytosis? Please, cite the work of Sachs and collaborators also describing gain-of-function mutations on Piezo1: Xerocytosis is caused by mutations that alter the kinetics of the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1.

This is in contrast to many other RBC diseases such as spherocytosis or sickle cell disease. To further demonstrate this, we have included images of scanning electron micrographs of both WT and Vav1-P1cKO blood obtained under similar magnification. These images are provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Other mechanosensitive ion channels might be present in these cells and their activation not obvious due to changed cell elasticity. While the data on chemical Piezo1 activation by Obi1 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) convincingly demonstrate that Piezo1 is able to induce dehydration, the conclusion that calcium-influx upon membrane-stretch is entirely dependent on Piezo1 is still overreaching</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer is indeed correct that we cannot exclude the potential for other mechanosensitive ion channels being responsible for the calcium influx at this point in time. We have now mentioned this possibility in the Discussion as follows.</p><p>We have further modified the sentence in our Abstract to now say “…and that this entry is dependent on Piezo1 expression”, which more accurately reflects the data.</p><p><italic>To address this issue experimentally, the authors could combine fluorescent calcium-imaging with cell-poking (no patch pipette). If cells that are briefly treated with Obi1 (e.g. 1minute exposure to Obi1 and then wash) are similar in elasticity I would expect an extension/activity profile similar to that obtained from untreated cells. In an alternative experiment the authors could transiently induce calcium influx into wild-type cells to induce dehydration and subsequently assay mechanical sensitivity of Piezo1</italic>.</p><p>We tried, but find it technically very difficult to perform cell poking experiments on RBCs.

There isn’t much literature regarding the role of mechanical forces in oxygen exchange. One paper has described that mechanical stretching of RBCs by optical tweezers can release oxygen from hemoglobin (now cited, Rao et al., Biophysical Journal, 2009), though the precise mechanism by which this happens is unknown. The involvement of Piezo1 in such a process is possible, and we will look into it in the future. For now, we have added the following sentence in Discussion section: “Additionally, it is possible that this reduction in volume could aid in oxygen/CO<sub>2</sub> exchange in the periphery by concentrating hemoglobin within RBCs, which may promote release of oxygen from hemoglobin; in fact, mechanical stimulation of RBCs via optical tweezers has been shown to cause such a release of oxygen.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
