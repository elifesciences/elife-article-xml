In B lymphocytes, the immune synapse controls the production of high-affinity antibodies, thereby defining the efficiency of humoral immune responses. While the key roles played by both the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons in the formation and function of the immune synapse have become increasingly clear, how the different events involved in synapse formation are coordinated in space and time by actin–microtubule interactions is not understood. Using a microfluidic pairing device, we studied with unprecedented resolution the dynamics of the various events leading to immune synapse formation and maintenance in murine B cells. Our results identify two groups of events, local and global, dominated by actin and microtubules dynamics, respectively. They further highlight an unexpected role for microtubules and the GEF-H1-RhoA axis in restricting F-actin polymerization at the lymphocyte–antigen contact site, thereby allowing the formation and maintenance of a unique competent immune synapse.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>immune synapse</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>GEF-H1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15- CE18-0014-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fattaccioli</surname><given-names>Jacques</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE30-0062-01 IMPerIS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pineau</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pineau</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microfluidics and dynamic imaging allow systematic characterization of polarization kinetics in B lymphocytes and highlight the role of microtubules as master regulators of actin polymerization at the immune synapse.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell polarization refers to the acquisition of a cell state characterized by the asymmetric distribution of cellular individual components, including molecules and organelles. It is critical for a multitude of cellular functions in distinct cell types and further controls cell–cell interactions. This particularly applies to lymphocytes, which rely on cell polarity to form a stereotyped structure called the immune synapse to communicate with antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dustin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrasco and Batista, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Junt et al., 2007</xref>). Immune synapses are not only instrumental for lymphocyte activation but also serve their effector functions, for example, by facilitating the killing of infected or malignant cells by cytotoxic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batista and Dustin, 2013</xref>). Understanding how immune synapses form has thus become a major challenge for cell biologists and immunologists for the last decade, yet many mechanistic questions remain unanswered. In particular, how immune synapses are maintained in time to serve sustained lymphocyte function and allow robust immune activation is poorly understood.</p><p>Immune synapse formation is accompanied by the reorganization of lymphocyte antigenic receptors and associated signaling molecules into a concentric structure that forms at the contact zone with antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monks et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fleire et al., 2006</xref>). The synapse allows the exchange of information (molecules and vesicles) between the two cells through tightly regulated exocytic and endocytic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griffiths et al., 2010</xref>). Signaling and trafficking at the immune synapse require deep rearrangements of both the lymphocyte actin and microtubule cytoskeletons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douanne and Griffiths, 2021</xref>). On one side, the actin cytoskeleton controls the organization of antigen receptor-containing microclusters for coordination between trafficking and signaling and further helps generating the mechanical forces that depend on the myosin II motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Treanor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Treanor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolger-Munro et al., 2019</xref>). On the other side, the microtubule cytoskeleton controls the recruitment of organelles at the immune synapse. This relies on centrosome reorientation, leading to lymphocyte symmetry breaking and acquisition of a polarized cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torralba et al., 2019</xref>). Although it is now clear that these events of actin and microtubule reorganization are instrumental for synapse formation, how they depend on each other and are coordinated to ensure proper and durable synapse function remains elusive.</p><p>There is growing evidence in the literature suggesting that the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons do not act independently of each other but indeed functionally and/or physically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dogterom and Koenderink, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hohmann and Dehghani, 2019</xref>). This is well-illustrated, for example, by the study of oocyte polarization in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> where polarization of intracellular organelles occurs in response to actomyosin contraction at one cell pole, which is in turn downregulated upon centrosome recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gubieda et al., 2020</xref>). A crosstalk between actin and microtubules in lymphocytes was also recently highlighted by our work, showing that clearance of branched actin at the centrosome is needed for its detachment from the nucleus and polarization to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obino et al., 2016</xref>). However, whether the microtubule network in turn impacts on actin dynamics and immune synapse formation, function, and maintenance has not been studied, in part because the tools to quantitatively monitor in time both local actin reorganization and microtubule reorientation were not available so far. In this work, we developed a microfluidic chamber to quantitatively analyze both the local and global events associated to immune synapse formation in time and space and establish their dependency on actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. Our results revealed that the microtubule network controls the polarized polymerization of F-actin at the interface between lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, thereby allowing sustained formation of a unique and functional immune synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A microfluidic system for the systematic study of immune synapse formation</title><p>We aimed at understanding how local and global events of synapse formation were coordinated in space and time. As a model, we used B lymphocytes, which form immune synapses upon engagement of their surface B cell receptor (BCR) by cognate antigens presented at the surface of neighboring cells. In vivo, this cell–cell interaction takes place in lymphoid organs and is required for antigen extraction and activation of signaling pathways that later on promote B lymphocyte differentiation into cells able to produce high-affinity antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrasco and Batista, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pape et al., 2007</xref>). Antigen extraction involves two modes: (1) an early mechanical mode that relies on actin-mediated forces at the synapse and (2) a late proteolytic mode that requires centrosome polarization to the synapse and subsequent lysosomes transport on microtubules and secretion of hydrolases into the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spillane and Tolar, 2016</xref>). It has been shown that mechanical antigen extraction occurs on deformable substrates while proteolytic extraction is used to extract antigen from stiff materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spillane and Tolar, 2016</xref>). The first pathway, when activated, inhibits the second one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spillane and Tolar, 2016</xref>), suggesting a functional interaction between these actin- and microtubule-dependent events. However, the experimental systems used so far did not allow to reach a sufficient temporal resolution to quantitatively monitor the evolution of both cytoskeleton networks in 3D from the first instant of immune synapse formation. To circumvent this problem, we built a microfluidics device based on an array of traps where antigen-coated oil droplets and B cells can be sequentially captured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Antigen-coated lipid droplets are a good 3D substrate to mimic antigen-loaded cells as they allow antigen mobility at their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, they are effectively stiff (see ‘Materials and methods’) and might thus also allow lysosome recruitment at the synapse and proteolytic antigen extraction. Chambers were imaged in 3D from the time of cell injection to capture the entire process of synapse formation. Droplets were functionalized either with a non-activating molecule (BSA, negative control) or an activating BCR ligand (F(ab′)<sub>2</sub> anti-mouse IgG, referred to as ‘antigen’ from now on). Both ligands were grafted to the lipid droplet with fluorescent streptavidin to follow their accumulation dynamics at the droplet surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Such an accumulation was exclusively observed upon engagement of the BCR with its ligand, BSA-coated droplets remaining homogeneously fluorescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Staining of the exocyst component EXOC7 implicated in lysosomal proteases secretion at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sáez et al., 2019</xref>) showed an enrichment of this protein 45 min upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting synapse functionality in terms of antigen extraction. Of note, we confirmed that both antigen and actin were enriched at the immune synapse of primary murine IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells in the first minutes after BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), showing that these observations are not restricted to our model B cell line. Altogether, these results indicate that our microfluidics system can be used to study the dynamics of immune synapse formation as well as the mechanisms involved in its maintenance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microfluidic system to study dynamics of B lymphocyte polarization and immune synapse formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transmission image of a chamber of the microfluidic chip containing the traps.

Characteristic timescales were extracted from volumetric images taken every 30 s (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). We found that the peak of DAG production occurred ∼3.25 min upon contact between the lymphocyte and the antigen-coated droplet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This time is comparable to the one found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gawden-Bone et al., 2018</xref> for cytotoxic T cells. This event was concomitant with actin polymerization, which peaked at the synapse at ∼3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Formation of the stereotypical actin pattern, with actin protrusions at the periphery and an actin-cleared area at the center, was then observed. Centrosome and Golgi tracking over time showed that they displayed similar behaviors, reaching the immune synapse area after 5 min for the centrosome (distance &lt;2 µm) and 6.5 min for the Golgi apparatus (distance &lt;4 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was only observed in cells where the BCR was specifically engaged and is in good agreement with these two organelles being physically associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chabin-Brion et al., 2001</xref>). Lysosomes, which are also known to associate with microtubules for intracellular transport, displayed a slightly different behavior: their distance to the immune synapse decreased down to ∼3 µm in ∼6 min, indicating their polarization, but then increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), maybe due to the secretion of lysosomal vesicles, which would lead to signal fainting at the immune synapse and a consequential apparent redistribution all over the cell. Finally, we observed that the nucleus was transported to the rear of the cell at later timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Closer observation revealed that this organelle displayed a biphasic movement: a rotation reoriented the nucleus until its stereotypical lymphocyte nuclear invagination faces the immune synapse (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> &lt; 45° after ∼8 min); once the nucleus had reoriented, it started moving toward the cell rear ∼15 min after contact with the droplet, slowly reaching the opposite cell pole over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). In summary, quantification from single kinetics of the various events leading to immune synapse formation in B lymphocytes suggests the existence of two groups of processes: (1) ‘early processes’ localized at the immune synapse, such as the strong polymerization of F-actin, antigen clustering, and signaling downstream of BCR engagement, which take place in the first 3 min; and (2) global rearrangements resulting in the reorientation of the centrosome, Golgi apparatus, and nuclear invagination to the immune synapse, the recruitment of lysosomes, and later on, the rearward transport of the nucleus. These local and global events associated to synapse formation will be referred to as early and late events from now on.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video3" xlink:href="elife-78330-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Examples of polarization dynamics at the B cell immune synapse of a IIA1.6 cell, for diacylglycerol (DAG) signaling, F-actin, the centrosome, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes and the nucleus; droplet outline drawn on each movie.</title></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Timescales of B lymphocyte polarization.</title><p>All images in this figure are from 3D SDCM time-lapse imaging of IIA1.6 cells in contact with an antigen-coated droplet (outlined in blue).

However, neither inhibition nor activation of myosin II contractility (using the inhibitor para-nitroBlebbistatin or the TRPML1 Calcium channel agonist MLSA1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bretou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumari et al., 2019</xref>) strongly affected antigen clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or DAG production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>) at initial or late timepoint. Taken together, these results stress the importance of F-actin organization – but not actomyosin contractility – in early local events of immune synapse formation, namely, antigen clustering and BCR signaling. Interestingly, imaging centrosome and nucleus repositioning to the synapse revealed that in the absence of F-actin these global polarization processes were preserved and did even take place faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). This acceleration in centrosome polarization might result from loss of F-actin-dependent tethering of this organelle to the nucleus in latrunculin A-treated cells. Indeed, we previously showed that this pool of F-actin must be cleared for the centrosome to move toward the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obino et al., 2016</xref>). We observed that the centrosome faces the nuclear invagination throughout immune synapse formation, and that they reorient together to ultimately face the immune synapse independently of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This was confirmed by the strong correlation between centrosome and nucleus orientation with respect to the cell–droplet axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These findings suggest that the centrosome and the nucleus reorient together, which is not affected by F-actin depolymerization. We conclude that the actin cytoskeleton is essential for the local, early events (antigen clustering and DAG production downstream of BCR signaling) of synapse formation, but not for the global, late ones (centrosome and nucleus polarization).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>F-actin is essential for antigen recruitment and signaling amplification, but not for the establishment of the polarity axis.</title><p>Experiments for this figure were performed using IIA1.6 cells, stained with SiRTubulin and Hoechst to visualize the centrosome and the nucleus, in contact with a F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>αIgG-coated droplet, imaged with SDCM 3D and quantified in 3D.

For this, we treated cells with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules. As expected, microtubule depolymerization prevented centrosome polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Nucleus polarization was also impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings are consistent with these two organelles repositioning together, as described above, and further suggest that their movement is driven by microtubules. Remarkably, we observed that microtubule depolymerization induced major events of nucleus and cell deformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Videos 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>) as well as blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These deformation events were associated to aberrant F-actin distribution: multiple F-actin polymerization spots were visible all around the cell, even far from the immune synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, G and H</xref>). Accordingly, depolymerizing F-actin in nocodazole-treated cells with latrunculin A restored their round shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Microtubule depolymerization had a mild impact on antigen clustering and DAG signaling (clustering was slightly reduced while DAG was slightly more sustained) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>). In addition, morphological analysis of the synapse showed that the stereotypical concentric actin patterning at the immune synapse was preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>). Altogether, these results show that microtubules are instrumental for the global late events of synapse formation (centrosome and nucleus repositioning), but also suggest that microtubules maintain the polarization axis of the cell by limiting the polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton to the immune synapse, consistent with a role for these filaments in synapse maintenance.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Microtubule disruption leads to intense cell and nucleus deformation, and impairs the establishment and maintenance of a polarized organization.</title><p>Experiments for this figure were performed using IIA1.6 cells in contact with a F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>αIgG-coated droplet, and 3D SDCM time-lapse imaging.

A good candidate to be involved in this process is the guanine exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1), an activator of the RhoA small GTPase that is released from microtubules upon depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). GEF-H1 was recently shown to be also released upon microtubule acetylation, allowing its recruitment to the B cell immune synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sáez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seetharaman et al., 2021</xref>). We tested that microtubules are acetylated upon BCR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Accordingly, we observed that GEF-H1 accumulated at the immune synapse upon BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Noticeably, treatment of B cells with nocodazole or with the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>) led to a marked decrease in the synaptic fraction of GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). Actin was also found to be less polarized in SAHA-treated cells (see back/front ratio, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that by globally enhancing GEF-H1 release both microtubule depolymerization and acetylation lead to a decrease in the relative enrichment – or polarization – of this protein at the synapse. As a consequence of this, actin polymerization now takes place all around the cell cortex, consistent with a need for microtubules to restrict the activity of GEF-H1 to the B cell immune synapse. To test this hypothesis, we silenced GEF-H1 expression using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We found that GEF-H1 silencing normalizes most of the effects of microtubules depletion: it reduced cell deformation and blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>). Rescue experiments confirmed that the silencing was specific of this GEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Silencing GEF-H1 also slightly altered antigen recruitment, but this effect was compensated by microtubules disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In microtubules-depleted cells, actin polarity was strongly perturbed while synaptic actin patterns were mildly altered. GEF-H1 silencing in nocodazole-treated cells restored both polarization (see illustrations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref> and axial profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and synaptic actin patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) as observed in untreated cells. These results indicate that the aberrant non-polarized actin polymerization observed upon treatment of B lymphocytes with nocodazole most likely results from GEF-H1 release from microtubules. To further probe the role of GEF-H1, we perturbed its downstream Rho GTPase, RhoA. We found that B cells expressing a constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoA L63, referred to as RhoA CA) displayed a phenotype similar to the one of nocodazole-treated cells: aberrant non-polarized actin polymerization, dynamic cell deformation, and blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of a dominant negative form of RhoA (RhoA DN) prevented cell deformation and blebbing upon nocodazole treatment, similar to the effect of GEF-H1 silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>).

We found that, while control cells tend to have a stronger F-actin enrichment at one synapse, indicating that they are able to establish and maintain a dominant polarity axis, this was less often observed in nocodazole-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Remarkably, GEF-H1 silencing in nocodazole-treated cells led to the re-establishment of a single polarity axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). The role of GEF-H1 in controlling the uniqueness of the polarity axis was further reinforced by the observation of multiple synapses in SAHA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), in which GEF-H1 polarized accumulation was compromised. The capacity of establishing and maintaining a single polarity axis is essential for cells to migrate in a directional manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maiuri et al., 2015</xref>), which might be required for activated B lymphocytes to reach the border of the T cell zone in lymph nodes for T-B cooperation. We therefore hypothesized that by compromising the polarity axis of B cells microtubule depletion might also impair their migratory capacity. To test this hypothesis, we plated B lymphocytes on BSA-coated surfaces after incubation with antigen-coated droplets. We found that B cells whose microtubules had been depolymerized with nocodazole exhibited more confined trajectories as compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>). Consistently, nocodazole-treated cells exhibit larger orientation change at each step (mean directional change rate or angular velocity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>), indicating that their migration is less directional than the one of control B lymphocytes. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that, by restricting RhoA-dependent actin polymerization via GEF-H1, microtubules allow the maintenance of a single polarity axis and stabilize in space and time a unique immune synapse in B lymphocytes. We propose that this process helps B cells properly extracting, processing, and presenting antigens to T lymphocytes.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video11" xlink:href="elife-78330-video11.mp4"><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>Bright-field movies of migrating IIA1.6 cells treated with DMSO (Control) or nocodazole, on a BSA-coated dish, in contact with an antigen-coated droplet.</title><p>Scale bar 10 µm.</p></caption></media></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we used a custom microfluidic system to study the coordination by actin and microtubule cytoskeletons of the various events associated to immune synapse formation in B lymphocytes. We observed that this process is characterized by two classes of events: a first phase (in the first 3.5 min), where F-actin is strongly polymerized at the site of contact, leading to antigen accumulation and production of DAG as a result of BCR signaling, and a second phase during which the centrosome is reoriented toward the immune synapse together with the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes while the nucleus undergoes a rotation followed by backward transport. The timescales we found for late polarization events are shorter than the ones measured for B cells in other systems (e.g., centrosome polarized in 30 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>], nucleus fully polarized in 30 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ulloa et al., 2022</xref>], lysosomes maximally clustered in 40 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spillane and Tolar, 2018</xref>]) and much closer to results found in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gawden-Bone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hooikaas et al., 2020</xref>), possibly due to the properties of the substrate that we used for antigen presentation. We found that F-actin polymerization is only needed for the first phase, in contrast to microtubules that not only control centrosome and organelle repositioning, but further maintain a unique polarity axis by restricting actin nucleation to the immune synapse. We propose that this mechanism reinforces a single synapse and guarantees B cell persistent migration to the T cell zone for cooperation with T lymphocytes.</p><p>How do microtubules restrict F-actin polymerization to the immune synapse? We identified GEF-H1 as a key player in this process, which limits RhoA activity and downstream actin nucleation to the synapse. Indeed, we observed that global activation of the GEF-H1-RhoA axis induced actin polymerization outside of the synapse, independently of myosin II activity. Interestingly, it was recently shown that microtubules were acetylated in the vicinity of the centrosome upon immune synapse formation, resulting in the local release and activation of GEF-H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sáez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seetharaman et al., 2021</xref>). Our results suggest that GEF-H1 might activate RhoA to trigger downstream formin-dependent actin nucleation at the immune synapse exclusively. In this model, RhoA would remain inactive in the rest of the cell, most likely due to GEF-H1 trapping on microtubules deacetylated by HDAC6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hubbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seetharaman et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, inhibition of microtubule deacetylation decreases the polarization of GEF-H1 to the synapse, leading to uncontrolled actin polymerization all over the cell cortex. We suggest that this ‘local activation’ of GEF-H1 and ‘global inhibition’ by trapping on deacetylated microtubules is reminiscent of the Local Excitation Global Inhibition model described in amoebas, where symmetry breaking arises from and is stabilized by a local positive feedback (PIP3 that promotes F-actin polymerization) combined to a globally active diffusible inhibitory signal (PTEN, a PIP3 phosphatase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parent and Devreotes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janetopoulos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devreotes and Janetopoulos, 2003</xref>). Of note, this model suggests that histone deacetylase inhibitors (some of them already used as drugs against autoinflammatory diseases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Licciardi and Karagiannis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nijhuis et al., 2019</xref>) could, by impairing polarization of B cells toward the synapse, prevent hyper activity of immune cells in pathological conditions, such as lymphoma or autoimmune diseases.</p><p>The Local Excitation Global Inhibition model predicts the establishment of a single stable polarity axis. Accordingly, our experiments show that unperturbed B lymphocytes favor the formation of a unique synapse over multiple ones, even when particulate antigens are presented from several locations. We propose that this mechanism, at least in enzymatic extraction, could help improving antigen extraction. Indeed, GEF-H1 has been shown to be necessary for the assembly of the exocyst complex at the immune synapse, and therefore for protease secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sáez et al., 2019</xref>). In this context, the localized release and activation of GEF-H1 by microtubules at the immune synapse might allow for the concentration of resources, promoting F-actin polymerization and optimizing proteolytic extraction at one unique site. Polarization of the centrosome and reorientation of the microtubule network would thus reduce the dispersion of resources in secondary synapses. Indeed, the release of proteases in several locations or in an open environment (as opposed to the tight synaptic cleft) could result in a lower local concentration of proteases, and therefore lower the efficiency of antigen uptake. A unique polarity axis could also help T/B cooperation as antigen-loaded B cells must migrate to the T cell zone for antigen presentation to T lymphocytes, and, as here shown, their capacity to migrate directionally depends on the robustness of cell polarity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrasco and Batista, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maiuri et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that B cells can undergo asymmetric cell division upon synapse formation and antigen extraction, which prevents antigen dilution upon cell division, an event that also requires a stable polarity axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thaunat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sawa, 2012</xref>). Future experiments aimed at studying how these downstream events of synapse formation are regulated when B cells nucleate actin all over their cell cortex and form multiple contacts should help address these questions.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that microtubules can act as a master regulator of actin polymerization, maintaining the formation of a single immune synapse in B lymphocytes. This control relies on the GEF-H1-RhoA axis, which may be at the core of a ‘Local Excitation Global Inhibition’ model. Our work points at the interaction between actin and microtubules as a way to control the axis of cell polarity that might be common to a larger class of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Stacks of 21 images (δz = 0.7 µm) were taken every 30 s during 40 min, with a binning of 2. Auto Focus was implemented in Metamorph using the bright-field image, then applied to fluorescent channels with a z-offset at each time point. On the day of the experiment, droplets were functionalized and cells were resuspended at 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in CLICK + 25 mM HEPES. Microfluidic chips, cells, and media were kept in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until imaging. Droplets (diluted 1/6 from functionalized solution) were injected in the microfluidic chip using a Fluigent MFCS-EZ pressure controller, Tygon tubing, and metal injectors from the dispensing needles 23GA. When enough traps contained a droplet, the inlet was changed to CLICK + 25 mM HEPES (or CLICK + 25 mM HEPES + drug) to rinse PB + Tween 20 buffer and remove any antigen in solution or droplet that could remain.

Tracking of the cell for analysis of centrosome orientation was performed by first obtaining a mask of the cell from SiRTubulin background cytoplasmic signal. This channel is used to create a mask of the cell on Fiji and find its center of mass. Briefly, the 3D stack is interpolated (to obtain an isotropic voxel) and a background subtraction (based on a Gaussian filtered [radius = 4] image of the field without cell, time = 0) is applied. A Gaussian filter is applied on the resulting image (radius = 2) to remove local noise and the cell is finally segmented using an automatic threshold (Huang).

These experiments provide an understanding of the specific roles of the reorganization of the actin as well as the microtubule cytoskeleton in the selection and restriction of a unique immune synapse, an important process in high-affinity antibody generation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78330.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Mayor</surname><given-names>Satyajit</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/046dg4z72</institution-id><institution>Marine Biological Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78330.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. General Statements</p></disp-quote><p>In this work, we investigated the cytoskeleton rearrangement events leading to synapse formation in the context of antigen recognition by B cells. We developed a microfluidics-based device to quantify the dynamics of these events in space and time and to study their coordination. We observed two types of events: early local events, which take place at the synapse and are controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, and late global events that involve the polarization of additional organelles and require microtubules. Noticeably, we found that these two phases are not independent as microtubules are needed to restrict actin polymerization to the immune synapse via the GEF-H1-RhoA signaling pathway. This allows B cells to form and maintain over time a single polarity axis, promoting the formation of a singular polarity axis.</p><p>All three reviewers have understood the work and raised competent and interesting critiques. We appreciate that they saw the paper’s significance for both the immunology and cell biology communities. Referees #2 and #3 are very positive on the results and mainly raise technical control concerns that we will address. Referee #1 believes that the results presented in figures 6 &amp; 8 deserve to be strengthened. Therefore, our experimental plan aims at strengthening these results by providing additional evidence for the role of microtubules at the B cell immune synapse in promoting a single polarity axis by restricting actin polymerization to the synapse via the GEFH1-RhoA pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Referee #1:</p><p>1) The data presented in support of the concluding model (that microtubules enforce synapse uniqueness by constraining the scope of GEF-H1) fall short of being convincing. Although GEFH1 depletion appears to rescue the cell shape defects induced by nocodazole (Figure 6B), there is no quantitative analysis of the effects of GEF-H1 depletion on the depolarization of F-actin. All we are shown is a single high resolution micrograph (Figure 6E). Furthermore, the capacity of GEF-H1 depletion to rescue the multiple synapse phenotypes explored in Figure 8 is not assessed. I appreciate that depletion of GEF-H1 could diminish F-actin accumulation at the synapse, but it should be possible to employ an alternative signaling readout for synapse formation. Alternatively, the authors could hyperactivate the GEF-H1 pathway using perturbations of microtubule acetylation or a GEF-H1 mutant that does not bind to microtubules. In general, more data is required that specifically implicates GEF-H1 in this process.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 6B, we show GEF-H1 accumulation at the immune synapse with time, which is impaired upon microtubule depolymerization. We also established the impact of microtubule acetylation (increased using SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor) on F-actin and GEF-H1 relative enrichment at the immune synapse in Figure 6C-D.</p><p>We quantified the distribution of F-actin along the cell-droplet axis and found that siGEFH1 prevents the effect of Nocodazole treatment on its distribution (Figure 6-Supplement Figure 1D-E).</p><p>We included new data on GEF-H1 localization and actin localization in GEF-H1 silenced cells in Figures 6B-C-D and 6I. Actin distribution along the polarity axis is also shown in Figure 6-Supplement Figure 1D-E, and additional examples are added in Figure 6-Supplement Figure 2.</p><p>We performed new experiments mixing cells and droplets outside the chip and considered only cells in contact with two droplets (having exclusively single or double synapses as a possible outcome). The new data include GEF-H1-silenced cells, and are reported in Figures 8 A, B, E. In addition, we showed that the presence of multiple synapses can also be promoted by increased microtubule acetylation using SAHA (histone deacetylase inhibitor), see Figure 8F.</p><p>We included measurements of antigen recruitment at the immune synapse in control of GEF-H1-silenced cells, as shown in Figure 6-Supplement Figure 1C.</p><p>We used SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, to increase microtubule acetylation. Indeed, Tubacin treatment induced a strong destabilization of our oil droplets, likely due to its chemical structure. SAHA treatment led to a decreased relative enrichment in GEF-H1 at the immune synapse (Figure 6C), a decrease in the polarization of F-actin (Figure 6D), and the promotion of multiple synapses (Figure 8F). These effects go in the same direction as microtubule disruption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phenotypes in Figure 8 are surprisingly subtle, particularly given how strong the effect of nocodazole is on F-actin polarization in single B cell-droplet conjugates (Figure 5D, H). One would expect an even stronger F-actin depolarization phenotype when an actual second target is present (e.g. Figure 8B). Instead, panel C indicates a very weak phenotype (perhaps not even statistically significant?). Differences are also quite small in Figure 8D. The subtlety of these phenotypes, despite the fact that a rather dramatic perturbation was applied (microtubule depolymerization) leads me to wonder whether microtubules are only peripherally involved in maintaining synapse uniqueness, and/or whether there might be a compensatory pathway. Perhaps the microtubule-GEF-H1 axis may be more important for restricting migration away from the synapse rather than the formation of multiple synapses? This alternative interpretation may be more consistent with the Figure 5 and Figure 8 data.</p></disp-quote><p>The new quantification and synapse counting method improved consistently the significance of the difference between untreated and Nocodazole-treated cells.</p><p>We performed a series of cell motility experiments with activated B cells (on BSA-treated surfaces as the confined assay turned out to be less controllable). We showed that the trajectories of nocodazole-treated cells are less persistent than the ones of untreated cells, see Figures 8G-I, consistent with the idea that microtubules disruption destabilizes the single polarity axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figures 5L and 6E should be quantified over multiple synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>This new quantification is now presented in Figures 5L and 6I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Key results should be reproduced in primary B cells, preferably using actual antigen-bearing target cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As anticipated, we could not present a comprehensive study on primary cells. Nonetheless, we show that our microfluidics system can be adapted to primary murine B cells to observe antigen and actin accumulation at the immune synapse (Figure 1-Supplement Figure 1B-E). Other observations would require setting up transgenic mice models (transfection and Sir Tubulin do not work properly in these cells). We cannot, therefore, reproduce all the data of the paper in a reasonable amount of time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What are the effects of taxol? Do Taxol treated cells form synapses? Can they form second synapses? Is F-actin polymerization at the synapse inhibited?</p></disp-quote><p>Taxol-treated cells show extremely variable effects: Antigen recruitment is lower, while actin seems recruited more strongly at the synapse, but with high cell-to-cell variability. Taxol affects several aspects of the cytoskeleton (transport, microtubule state, etc) making these data hard to interpret. Therefore, we present the data here below, but we will not include them in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of Taxol (1 µM) on B lymphocyte immune synapse formation.</title><p>(A) Plateau (Average 25-30min) of antigen recruitment (Median+/- IQR,DMSO N=8;8, Taxol N=9;6, 2 independent experiments, Mann-Whitney test).

The use of the microfluidics system in combination with the oil droplets as a model antigen-presenting surface is a recent technological advance from this lab (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.22.473360v2.full.pdf), which I think will bring new understanding to B cell activation. The experiments are hypothesis driven and done well, and the data are presented clearly both with representative images and presentation of analysed data compiled from independent experiments. I do not think that additional experiments are essential to support the claims of the paper. However, I was surprised that the authors did not measure of antigen internalisation from the droplet. The authors discuss the importance of synapse formation for antigen extraction and have a system to monitor both actin polymerisation and lysosome recruitment to the synapse; is it possible to monitor antigen internalisation in these experiments? It would be a very nice addition to the manuscript, though it is not essential to support the main claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Illustration and quantification of EXOC7 recruitment at the synapse are shown in Figure 1—Supplement Figure 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The figure legends indicate that most experiments were repeated twice, and the bar plots compile all data points (individual cells) from both experiments and the statistical analysis performed on these. There is often a large spread in the data, and it is difficult to know whether this is from cell-to-cell variability in general or variability between the independent experiments. It would be helpful if the authors could color-code the data points by experiment and include the mean value for each independent experiment on the same bar plot. I don't think this will change the conclusions of the paper, but I do think it would clarify how much variability there is in the cell behavior and how reproducible the experiments are.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Figure 2G quantifies the characteristic times of polarization events from the imaging measurements of B cell synapse formation. While the mean values suggest a series of events that begin with actin enrichment and DAG signalling, and finish with nucleus rearward transport, there is a very large spread in the data and I wonder whether this representation of the data reflects what happens at the single-cell level. Is it possible to show the timescales of these events at the single cell level?</p></disp-quote><p>See Figure 2-Supplement Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5K shows a striking oscillation in DAG enrichment in nocodazole-treated cells. It is very interesting that the cells all seem to oscillate with the same frequency even across different experiments. Could the authors comment on this observation?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that, unfortunately, this results from the effect of a single cell on the average value and is therefore not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, violet curve).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78330-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee #3</p><p>Major concerns</p><p>1) The role of GEF-H1 should be verified with rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-expressed GEF-H1 in GEF-H1-silenced cells and recovered indeed the unperturbed phenotype, see Figure 6-figure supplement 1 A-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The effect of RhoA on synapse formation and polarization should be investigated more thoroughly.

Please leave empty if not applicable.</p><p>Referee #3: Also, siRNA studies should include at least two silencing oligos leading to the same phenotype and a scrambled control. siRNAs can lead to lots of off-target effects and careful validation is thus important.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience siRNA pools work better and are not less specific than single siRNA, even though this might depend on the nature of the target mRNA. In the case of GEF-H1, siRNA Smart Pool systems have been successfully used in other publications (Ho et al., Cell Reports, 2021; Dhakal et al., 2008, Journal of Biological Chemistry; Ridgway 2010, Journal of Cellular Biochemistry). May also the referee keep in mind that the results obtained with GEF-H1 silencing were confirmed by transfection of constitutively active RhoA. In addition, if rescue experiments are successful, this will show that the siRNA pool used is specific.</p><p>Rescue experiments were successful: we consider that the phenotype is specifically due to GEF-H1 silencing and we added a comment in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee #3: Also a very interesting approach here, although probably beyond the scope of this study, could be to use, for example, photoinducible constructs to focally activate/inactive the cytoskeletal regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>An optogenetic approach, though very elegant, is technically very challenging in our experimental system and would therefore require a lot of time to be set up.

Is it possible that the less acidic lysosomes that appear fainter with Lysotracker are approaching the synapse earlier than the more acidic ones (more intense lysotracker)? Can the authors comment about possible vesicle acidity changes during cell activation?</p></disp-quote><p>The question of whether lysosomes modify their pH while being recruited to the synapse is indeed very interesting. However, addressing it properly would require a lot of experimental development and time as currently, our results do not have enough spatial and temporal resolution to do so. We believe that taking this time is not reasonable as this point falls out of the scope of our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
