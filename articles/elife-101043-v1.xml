and digestion. Neuronal subtypes in the ENS have been distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, morphology, and expression of characteristic markers, notably neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here, we investigated synaptic cell adhesion molecules as novel cell-type markers in the ENS. Our work identifies two type II classic cadherins, <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8,</italic> specific to sensory neurons in the mouse colon. We show that <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons demonstrate all other distinguishing classifications of enteric sensory neurons including marker expression of <italic>Calcb</italic> and <italic>Nmu</italic>, Dogiel type II morphology and AH-type electrophysiology and <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> current. Optogenetic activation of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> sensory neurons in distal colon evokes retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs), while pharmacologic blockade of rhythmicity-associated current <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> disrupts the spontaneous generation of CMCs. These findings provide the first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons and demonstrate a functional and critical role for sensory neurons in the generation of CMCs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enteric nervous system</kwd><kwd>sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>synaptic cell adhesion

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory signaling within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract plays a critical role in the autonomous regulation of digestion. The GI tract is the only internal organ system containing its own sensory neurons. Intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) detect relevant stimuli through chemo- and mechano-sensation and direct appropriate GI functions via downstream components of the enteric nervous system (ENS), including ascending and descending interneurons, and excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fung and Vanden Berghe, 2020</xref>). These neuronal subtypes have begun to be distinguished morphologically, electrophysiologically, and by marker expression, classically especially of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nurgali et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2008</xref>), and together this information has provided an opening to characterize individual neuron subtype function within the GI tract.</p><p>Synaptic cell adhesion molecules define neuronal subtype connectivity within many regions of the CNS. Type II cadherins are a family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules with combinatorial expression in multiple neural circuits of the CNS, including retina, limbic, olivonuclear, and auditory projection systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honjo et al., 2000</xref>). Type II cadherins bind homophilically by expression of the same cadherin at both the pre- and post-synapse, which stabilizes developing synapses between correct partners while incorrect synapses are pruned away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamagata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2015</xref>). Recent RNA-Seq studies of human and mouse ENS have identified synaptic cell adhesion molecules, including type II cadherins, expressed in enteric neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">May-Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drokhlyansky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morarach et al., 2021</xref>). However, the specificity of their expression has yet to be harnessed to assess neuronal subtype-specific function in the ENS.</p><p>Here, we identify type II cadherin, <italic>Cdh6</italic>, as a novel marker for IPANs of the colonic ENS. We demonstrate the sensory identity of <italic>Cdh6</italic> neurons by immunohistochemical, morphological, and neurophysiological classification. <italic>Cdh6</italic> neurons express IPAN markers <italic>Calcb</italic> and <italic>Nmu</italic>. Sparse labeling of individual IPANs reveals they project mainly circumferentially and branch extensively in myenteric ganglia. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of sensory neurons in situ reveal action potential (AP) slow afterhyperpolarizations characteristic of IPANs, and hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (<italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>), a rhythmicity indicator in thalamocortical and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009</xref>). Using a <italic>Cdh6</italic> genetic mouse model, we show that optogenetic activation of distal colon IPANs is sufficient to evoke retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs), while pharmacologic block of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> in IPANs disrupts colonic rhythmicity and reversibly abolishes spontaneous CMCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of the type II classic cadherin <italic>Cdh6</italic> in colonic IPANs</title><p>To identify cadherins expressed in enteric neuronal subtypes in mouse, we screened recently published RNA-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drokhlyansky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morarach et al., 2021</xref>) for classic type II cadherin expression. <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic> appeared to be restricted to IPAN subsets in both small intestine and colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drokhlyansky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morarach et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Cdh9</italic> was previously identified in a separate population of IPANs in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">May-Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drokhlyansky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morarach et al., 2021</xref>).

Failure of proximal colonic stimulation to evoke CMCs may reflect inhibition by IPAN recruitment of descending pathways; or conversely, high efficacy of stimulation from distal colon may reflect bias toward activation of ascending excitatory cholinergic pathways. Our classification of <italic>Cdh6+</italic> neurons as IPANs in the distal colon may not extend to the proximal colon; thus, we cannot extrapolate that <italic>Cdh6</italic>+ optogenetic activation in the colon is restricted to IPANs as in the distal colon. In addition, our stimulus paradigm in the proximal colon may not have activated enough neurons based on light density and illumination. In previous studies, optogenetic stimulation of calretinin-expressing neurons or choline acetyl transferase-expressing neurons (both of which include IPANs, interneurons, and motor neurons) elicited anterograde CMCs regardless of stimulus location, including proximal colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hibberd et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Efimov et al., 2024</xref>). Proximal colon stimulation of nitric oxide synthase-expressing neurons also elicited CMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koh et al., 2022</xref>). These studies, as noted, each activated multiple neuronal classes employing the same neurotransmitter. How broad and nonspecific activation of such disparate neuron classes readily evokes CMCs remains unclear.</p><p>Spontaneous and evoked CMCs were abolished in hexamethonium, confirming that CMC synchronous firing is dependent on nicotinic cholinergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hibberd et al., 2018b</xref>). This reinforces that nicotinic cholinergic transmission is required for greater activation and synchrony of the entire ENS motility network to generate CMCs.</p><p>Through our electrophysiological investigation of IPANs in the distal colon using voltage clamp, our work reveals the presence of two voltage-gated ion conductances and their underlying currents, <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>. Slow AHP, <italic>I<sub>H</sub>,</italic> and <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> have been previously identified as distinguishing characteristics of IPANs in rat and guinea pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nurgali et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). Although prior studies noted <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> and proposed <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> in guinea pig Dogiel type II neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nurgali et al., 2007</xref>), they have not previously been reported in studies of intact mouse distal colon myenteric plexus due to the conventional reliance on sharp electrode recordings in which voltage clamp is not possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2022</xref>). The presence of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> and <italic>I<sub>T</sub></italic> in thalamocortical relay neurons and other cell types supports intrinsic rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCormick and Pape, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pape and McCormick, 1989</xref>). It is possible that these two currents may similarly promote autonomous rhythmic activity in colonic IPANs.</p><p><italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> is conducted through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benarroch, 2013</xref>). HCN channel family members HCN1 and HCN2 have been shown to be present in mouse distal colonic Dogiel type II neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>), and RNA-Seq ENS screens similarly indicate their expression in IPANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drokhlyansky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morarach et al., 2021</xref>). Knockout of HCN2 in mouse leads to a severe growth restriction phenotype due to malnutrition and GI dysmotility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fisher et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologic blockade of <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic>, which we show to be present in IPANs, with two distinct HCN channel blockers ZD7288 and CsCl abolishes CMCs, an otherwise persistent and ongoing pattern of motor activity in the mouse colon. We speculate that <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> in colonic IPANs, as in thalamocortical neurons, plays a role in promoting either rhythmic oscillatory single neuron activity or network burst firing, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCormick and Pape, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pape and McCormick, 1989</xref>). Blocking <italic>I<sub>H</sub></italic> may impair individual IPANsâ ability to fire rhythmically, or the ability of IPANs to synchronize into a network burst firing mode. Failure of IPANs to fully activate and synchronize could prevent generation of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fung and Vanden Berghe, 2020</xref>) synchronized rhythmic myenteric network activation of motility circuits, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nurgali et al., 2004</xref>) the resulting synchronized contractions that sum to much larger contractile forces during CMCs.</p><p>Type II cadherins are most commonly homophilic synaptic cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamagata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Cdh6</italic> can also form heterodimers with <italic>Cdh7, Cdh10,</italic> and <italic>Cdh14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shimoyama et al., 2000</xref>). However, <italic>Cdh10</italic> and <italic>Cdh14</italic> are very lowly expressed in the colon by single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drokhlyansky et al., 2020</xref>), and we performed RNAscope for <italic>Cdh7</italic> and did not observe any expression (data not shown). Restricted expression of two type II cadherins, <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic>, to mouse colonic IPANs raises the possibility of these cadherins supporting IPAN-IPAN synaptic connections. While broadly speaking, IPANs are not known to receive synaptic input and in fact have been characterized electrophysiologically by their lack thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirst et al., 1974</xref>), some work has in fact suggested that AH-AH neuron interconnected pairs may exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kunze et al., 1993</xref>). Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy investigation of synapses on enteric neurons further showed that calbindin-positive neurons, presumed IPANs, do receive synapses, though fewer than non-calbindin neurons, and some of those synapses were also calbindin-reactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pompolo and Furness, 1988</xref>). These observations informed a proposed âIPAN driver circuitâ theory, in which IPANs form an interconnected network of positive feedback to synchronize and amplify sensory signaling and thus activate large swaths of enteric circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wood, 2012</xref>). In contrast, more recently, activation of large regions of the ENS has been suggested to be driven by interneuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barth et al., 2022</xref>). It is important to note that our study was unsuccessful in localizing Cdh6 protein via immunohistochemistry, to confirm protein expression in neurons or in Cdh6-cre-tdT+ muscle cells or visualize synaptic connections between neurons or connections to other cell types. Further investigations are necessary to determine whether synaptic adhesion molecules, such as <italic>Cdh6</italic> and <italic>Cdh8</italic>, may in fact support IPAN-IPAN synapses underlying an âIPAN driver circuitâ.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The area of light emission from each LED was 240 Î¼m Ã 320 Î¼m (0.0768 mm<sup>2</sup>). To characterize LED function, light power density across a range of currents was measured 5 mm from the LED using a standard photodiode power sensor (S120C; Thorlabs, NJ, USA) and a power meter (Thorlabs, PM100USB). The stimulator panel within LabChart software was used to set parameters and manually trigger LED pulse trains via the 10 V analogue output of the PowerLab and an ILD1 opto-isolator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Intraluminal pellet CMC recordings</title><p>To record proximal and distal colon CMCs separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ishizawa, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hibberd et al., 2022</xref>), full-length colon was bisected halfway between the caeco-colonic junction and terminal rectum, creating equal length proximal and distal colon preparations. Each preparation was suspended vertically on a stainless-steel holder inside a glass, water jacketed organ bath containing Krebs solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>). A 2.7 mm diameter synthetic pellet (polymethyl methacrylate, âPerspexâ) was placed inside the gut lumen and linked by stainless-steel rod to a force transducer (MLT0420, ADInstruments), allowing measurement of both anterograde and retrograde propulsive forces on the pellet. Signals were amplified by bridge amplifier (FE224, ADInstruments), digitized at 1 kHz (PLCF1, ADInstruments) and recorded using LabChart 8 software.</p><p>ZD7288 (73777, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water as stock solution at 10 mM. Cesium chloride (C4036, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water as stock solution at 200 mM. Tetrodotoxin citrate (T-550, Alomone Labs) was dissolved in water as stock solution at 3 mM. Control, ZD7288, CsCl, and washout periods were at least 30 min; TTX was applied for at least 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests and graphical representation of data were performed using Prism 9 software (GraphPad).

For colonic motility experiments, sample sizes were based on 25% of measurement variance explained by the treatment effect (the minimum effect of interest) and a within group variance of 20% (effect size f=1.12). Repeated measures ANOVA with two groups with an alpha error probability of 5% and power of 95% gives a minimum sample size of five replicates in each group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization was not relevant to our study, as all mice were allocated into experimental groups based on genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Blinding</title><p>For optogenetic studies, experimenters were initially blinded to group allocation; however, it should be noted that overt functional responses to optogenetic stimulation unavoidably reveal group allocation once experiments are underway.

The morphology, neurochemical coding, and electrophysiological properties of these cells have been relatively well described in a long literature dating back to the late 1800's but questions remain regarding their roles in enteric neurocircuitry, potential subsets with unique functions, and contributions to disease. Here, the authors provide RNAscope, immunolabeling, electrophysiological, and organ function data characterizing IPANs in mice and suggest that Cdh6 is an additional marker of these cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper would likely be of interest to the enteric neuroscience community and increases information regarding the properties of IPANs in mice. These data are useful and suggest that prior data from studies of IPANs in other species are likely translatable to mice.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Major weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The novelty of this study is relatively limited. The main point of novelty suggests an additional marker of IPANs (Cdh6) that would add to the known list of markers for these cells. How useful this would be is unclear. Other main findings basically confirm that IPANs in mice display the same classical characteristics that have been known for many years from studies in guinea pigs, rats, mice and humans.</p><p>(2) Critical controls are needed to support the optogenetic experiments. Control experiments are needed to show that ChR2 expression (1) does not change the baseline properties of the neurons, (2) that stimulation with the chosen intensity of light elicits physiologically relevant responses in those neurons, and (3) that stimulation via ChR2 elicits comparable responses in IPANs in the different gut regions focused on here. These essential controls remain absent in the study and limit confidence in the data derived from this model.</p><p>(3) The motor effects observed in optogenetic experiments are difficult to understand in the absence of good controls for optogenetic control of the proposed neuron population (discussed above). It remains unclear how stimulating IPANs in the distal colon would generate retrograde CMCs while stimulating IPANs in the proximal colon did nothing. Key controls confirming that the optogentic stimulus was adequate, specific, and relevant are needed. In addition, better characterization of the Cdh6+ population of cells in both regions would be needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these effects.</p><p>(4) From the data shown, it is clear that expression driven by the Cdh6CreERT2 driver is not confined to IPANs. There is obviously expression of GFP and ChR2 in smooth muscle cells. This is a major limitation for the physiological experiments that attempt to use this model to specifically stimulate IPANs and assess changes in gut motor function. Better characterization of this model is needed and control experiments are necessary to assess whether functional ChR2 is expressed in cells beyond the proposed subtype of enteric IPANs.</p><p>(5) Some of the main conclusions of this study are overstated and claims of priority are made that are not true. For example, the authors state on lines 27-28 of the abstract that their findings provide the &quot;first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons&quot;. This is certainly not true since Gould et al (AJP-GIL 2019) expressed ChR2 in nitrergic enteric neurons and showed that activating those cells disrupted CMC activity. In fact, prior work by the authors themselves (Hibberd et al Gastro 2018) showed that activating calretinin neurons with ChR2 evoked motor responses. Work by other groups has used chemogenetics and optogenetics to show effects of activating multiple other classes of neurons in the gut.</p><p>(6) The electrophysiological characterization of mouse IPANs is useful but is limited to a small subset of Cdh6+ neurons in the distal colon myenteric plexus. Therefore, it remains unclear how well the properties reported here might reflect those of other Cdh6+ IPANs in the same or different regions. Similarly, blocking IH with ZD7288 affects all IPANs and does not add specific information regarding the role of the proposed Cdh6+ subtype.</p><p>(7) The submucosal plexus (SMP) also contains enteric IPANs and these were not included in the analysis of Cdh6 expression. Whether or not the proposed IPAN marker Cdh6 would be useful for identifying or targeting those cells remains unclear.</p><p>[Editor's note: The Reviewing Editor considers that further controls requested from the reviewers have largely been provided already in prior publications by other groups, as they concern specifically tools published years ago but in a different tissue context. Hence the methodology used to deliver the results reported here fall within the standard practices in the field. The comprehensive, multi-technique approach to the results is compelling in and of itself, and ought to suffice, rendering this work reproducible and therefore a basis for further research.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101043.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gomez-Frittelli</surname><given-names>Julieta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Devienne</surname><given-names>Gabrielle Frederique</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Travis</surname><given-names>Lee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Adelaide</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kyloh</surname><given-names>Melinda A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Adelaide</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Duan</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hibberd</surname><given-names>Tim J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Adelaide</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Spencer</surname><given-names>Nick J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Flinders University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bedford Park</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huguenard</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaltschmidt</surname><given-names>Julia A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Stanford Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Stanford</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Gomez-Frittelli and colleagues characterize the expression of cadherin6 (and -8) in colonic IPANs of mice.

Cdh6 primarily forms homodimers but, as the reviewer points out, has been known to also form heterodimers with some other cadherins. We performed RNAscope in the colonic myenteric plexus with Cdh7 and found no expression (data not shown). Cdh10 is suggested to have very low expression (Drokhlyansky et al., 2020), possibly in putative secretomotor vasodilator neurons, and Cdh14 has not been assayed in any RNAseq screens. We attempted to visualize Cdh6 protein via antibody staining (Duan et al., 2018) but our efforts did not result in sufficient signal or resolution to identify synapses in the ENS, which remain broadly challenging to assay. Similarly, immunostaining with Cdh6 antibody was unable to confirm Cdh6 protein in tdT-expressing muscle cells, or by RNAscope. We have addressed these caveats in the discussion section.</p><p>(1) E.

Whilst single neurochemical classes of enteric neurons have been manipulated to alter gut functions, all such instances to date do not represent manipulation of a single functional class of enteric neurons. In the given examples, multiple functional classes are activated utilizing the same neurotransmitter, as NOS and calretinin are each expressed to varying degrees across putative motor neurons, interneurons and IPANs. In contrast, Chd6 is restricted to IPANs and therefore this study is the first optogenetic investigation of enteric neurons from a single putative functional class. Our abstract and discussion emphasizes this point and differentiates this study from those previous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Critical controls are needed to support the optogenetic experiments.

However, our paper is not the first to express ChR2 in enteric neurons. Authors of our paper have shown in Hibberd <italic>et al.</italic> 2018 that expression of ChR2 in a heterogeneous population of myenteric neurons did not change network properties of the myenteric plexus. This was demonstrated in the lack of change in control CMC characteristics in mice expressing ChR2 under basal conditions (without blue light exposure). Regarding question (b), that it should be shown that stimulation with the chosen intensity of light elicits physiologically relevant responses in those neurons. We show the restricted expression of ChR2 in IPANs and that motor responses (to blue light) are blocked by selective nerve conduction blockade.</p><p>Regarding question (c), that our study should demonstrate that stimulation via ChR2 elicits comparable responses in IPANs in the different gut regions. We would not expect each region of the gut to behave comparably. This is because the different gut regions (i.e. proximal, mid, distal) are very different anatomically, as is anatomy of the myenteric plexus and myenteric ganglia between each region, including the density of IPANs within each ganglia, in addition to the presence of different patterns of electrical and mechanical activity [Spencer <italic>et al.,</italic> 2020]. Hence, it is difficult to expect that between regions stimulation of ChR2 should induce similar physiological responses. The motor output we record in our study (CMCs) is a unified motor program that involves the temporal coordination of hundreds of thousands of enteric neurons and a complex neural circuit that we have previously characterized [Spencer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018]. But, never has any study until now been able to selectively stimulate a single functional class of enteric neurons (with light) to avoid indiscriminate activation of other classes of neurons.</p><p>(1) T.

The electrophysiological characterization was also only done in a small fraction of colonic IPANs, and it is not clear if these represent cell properties in the distal colon or proximal colon, and whether these properties might be extrapolated to IPANs in the different regions. Similarly, blocking IH with ZD7288 affects all IPANs and does not add specific information regarding the role of the proposed Cdh6+ subtype.</p></disp-quote><p>Our electrophysiological characterization was guided to be within a subset of Cdh6+ neurons by Hb9:GFP expression.

We have clarified in the results and methods that these experiments were performed in the distal colon and agree that we cannot extrapolate that these properties are also representative of IPANs in the proximal colon.

IPANs are present in the SMP of the small intestine and colon, and it would be useful to know if this proposed marker is also present in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. In addition to characterizing Cdh6 in the myenteric plexus, it would be interesting to query if sensory neurons located within the SMP also express Cdh6. Our preliminary data (n=2) show ~6-12% tdT/Hu neurons in Cdh6-tdT ileum and colon (data not shown). We have added a sentence to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The emphasis on IH being a rhythmicity indicator seems a bit premature. There is no evidence to suggest that IH and IT are rhythm-generating currents in the ENS.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the statement there is no evidence to suggest that IH and IT are rhythm-generating currents in the ENS. We agree with the reviewer that evidence of rhythm generation by IH and IT in the ENS has not been explicitly confirmed. We are confident the reviewer agrees that an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, although the presence of IH has been well described in enteric neurons. We have modified the text in the results to indicate more clearly that IH and IT are known to participate in rhythm generation in thalamocortical circuits, though their roles in the ENS remain unknown. Our discussion of the potential role of IH or IT in rhythm generation or oscillatory firing of the ENS is constrained to speculation in the discussion section of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) As the authors point out in the introduction and discuss later on, Type II Cadherins such as Cdh6 bind homophillically to the same cadherin at both pre- and post-synapse. The apparent enrichment of Cdh6 in IPANs would suggest extensive expression in synaptic terminals that would also suggest extensive IPAN-IPAN connections unless other subtypes of neurons express this protein. Such synaptic connections are not typical of IPANs and raise the question of whether or not IPANs actually express the functional protein and if so, what might be its role. Not having this information limits the usefulness of this as a proposed marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the proposed IPAN-IPAN connection is novel although it has been proposed before (Kunze et al., 1993). As detailed in our response to Reviewer #1, we attempted to confirm Cdh6 protein expression, but were unsuccessful, due to insufficient signal and resolution. We therefore discuss potential IPAN interconnectivity in the discussion, in the context of contrasting literature.</p><p>(1) W. A. A. Kunze, J. B. Furness, J. C.

By definition, these are not CMCs as stated by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a valid criticism as to the terminology, since tethered pellet experiments do not record propagation. We believe the periodic bouts of propulsive force on the pellet is triggered by the same activity underlying the CMC. In our experience, these activities have similar periodicity, force and identical pharmacological properties. Consistent with this, we also tested full colons (n = 2) set up for typical CMC recordings by multiple force transducers, finding that CMCs were abolished by ZD7288, similar to fixed pellet recordings (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The data from the optogenetic experiments are difficult to understand. How would stimulating IPANs in the distal colon generate retrograde CMCs and stimulating IPANs in the proximal colon do nothing? Additional characterization of the Cdh6+ population of cells is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the different optogenetic responses in the proximal and distal colon are challenging to interpret, but perhaps not surprising in the wider context. It is not only possible that the different optogenetic responses in this study reflect regional differences in the Chd6+ neuronal populations, but also differences in neural circuits within these gut regions. A study some time ago by the authors showed that electrical stimulation of the proximal mouse colon was unable to evoke a retrograde (aborally) propagating CMC (Spencer, Bywater, 2002), but stimulation of the distal colon was readily able to. We concluded that at the oral lesion site there is a preferential bias of descending inhibitory nerve projections, since the ascending excitatory pathways have been cut off. In contrast, stimulation of the distal colon was readily able to activate an ascending excitatory neural pathway, and hence induce the complex CMC circuits required to generate an orally propagating CMC. Indeed, other recent studies have added to a growing body of evidence for significant differences in the behaviors and neural circuits of the two regions (Li et al., 2019, Costa et al., 2021a, Costa et al., 2021b, Nestor-Kalinoski et al., 2022).
