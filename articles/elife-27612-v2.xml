(<italic>NGLY1</italic>) cause a rare, multisystem congenital disorder with global developmental delay. However, the mechanisms by which <italic>NGLY1</italic> and its homologs regulate embryonic development are not known. Here we show that <italic>Drosophila Pngl</italic> encodes an <italic>N</italic>-glycanase and exhibits a high degree of functional conservation with human NGLY1. Loss of <italic>Pngl</italic> results in developmental midgut defects reminiscent of midgut-specific loss of BMP signaling. <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant larvae also exhibit a severe midgut clearance defect, which cannot be fully explained by impaired BMP signaling. Genetic experiments indicate that Pngl is primarily required in the mesoderm during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Loss of Pngl results in a severe decrease in the level of Dpp homodimers and abolishes BMP autoregulation in the visceral mesoderm mediated by Dpp and Tkv homodimers. Thus, our studies uncover a novel mechanism for the tissue-specific regulation of an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway by an <italic>N</italic>-glycanase enzyme.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27612.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA carries the information needed to build and maintain an organism, and units of DNA known as genes contain coded instructions to build other molecules, including enzymes. Sometimes, genes can become faulty and develop mutations that can affect how an embryo develops and lead to diseases. For example, people with mutations in the gene that encodes an enzyme called <italic>N</italic>-glycanase 1 experience many problems with their nervous system, gut and other organs.</p><p>Normally, <italic>N</italic>-glycanase 1 helps the body remove specific sugar molecules from some proteins in the cells, and is also thought to be important during embryonic development. As an embryo develops, its cells undergo a series of transformations, which is regulated by different molecules and signaling pathways. For example, a pathway known as BMP signaling plays an important role in many tissues. Problems with this pathway can lead to many diseases throughout the body, including the gut, where it helps cells to develop.</p><p>Previous research has shown that fruit flies lacking the gene that codes for an equivalent <italic>N</italic>-glycanase enzyme (which is called Pngl in flies) cannot develop properly into adults. However, until now it was not known what type of cells need the <italic>N</italic>-glycanase enzyme in any organism, or if NGLY1 is essential for important signaling pathways like BMP signaling. Now, Galeone et al. have used genetically modified flies to test how losing Pngl affected their development.</p><p>The results first showed that engineering Pngl-deficient fruit flies to produce the human enzyme eliminated their problems; these flies developed and survived like normal flies. This confirmed that that the human and fly enzymes can perform equivalent roles. Galeone et al. then discovered that Pngl plays two distinct roles in a group of cells that surround the fruit fly’s gut tissue and give rise to the cells that eventually form the muscle layer in the gut. In the larvae, Pngl was required to empty the gut, which is a necessary step before the larvae can develop into an adult. Moreover, Pngl is needed for BMP signaling in the gut, and when flies had the enzyme removed, some parts of their gut could not from properly.</p><p>This study will provide a framework to improve our understanding of how BMP signaling is regulated in humans. A next step will be to test if some of the symptoms experienced by patients without a working copy of the gene for <italic>N</italic>-glycanase 1 are caused by a faulty BMP-signaling system in specific tissues. If this is the case, it could provide new opportunities to treat some of these symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NGLY1</kwd><kwd>BMP signaling</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>midgut</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grace Wilsey Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suzuki</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name><name><surname>Jafar-Nejad</surname><given-names>Hamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM084135 R01DK109982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jafar-Nejad</surname><given-names>Hamed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>N-glycanase 1 is required for a BMP autoregulatory loop in the visceral mesoderm and for intestinal development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>NGLY1</italic> (<italic>N</italic>-glycanase 1) encodes an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of <italic>N</italic>-glycans from glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2000</xref>). Whole-genome and -exome sequencing has recently resulted in the identification of <italic>NGLY1</italic> mutations in patients with an autosomal recessive developmental disorder called NGLY1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caglayan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Enns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heeley and Shinawi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Need et al., 2012</xref>). NGLY1-deficient patients show a host of phenotypes including global developmental delay, movement disorder, hypotonia, absent tears, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, and small feet and hands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Enns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanism by which NGLY1 deficiency causes the above-mentioned clinical phenotypes is not known, and neither has NGLY1 been linked to any major developmental signaling pathway.</p><p>In yeast, <italic>N</italic>-glycanase 1 (Peptide: <italic>N-</italic>glycanase or PNGase, encoded by <italic>PNG1</italic>) has been associated with endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suzuki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>), a process that plays a crucial role in the proteasome-mediated degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brodsky, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). However, null mutants for yeast <italic>PNG1</italic> do not show apparent phenotypic abnormalities and exhibit normal growth rate and viability under a variety of experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzuki et al., 2000</xref>). A recent study has provided strong evidence that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a transcription factor called SKN-1 (homolog to mammalian NFE2L1/2) needs to be retrotranslocated from ER to cytoplasm by ERAD machinery and deglycosylated by NGLY1 (PNG-1 in worms) to function properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>). However, deglycosylation does not result in SKN-1 degradation, but instead promotes the activation of SKN-1 so that it can mediate the necessary transcriptional response to proteasome disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lehrbach and Ruvkun, 2016</xref>). Moreover, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking NGLY1 did not show impairment and/or delay in the degradation of misfolded proteins, but displayed an unconventional deglycosylation reaction that may generate aggregation-prone proteins harboring <italic>N</italic>-GlcNAc and result in cell toxicity in the absence of NGLY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, although NGLY1 seems to be functionally associated with the ERAD machinery, it does not seem to directly promote the degradation of misfolded proteins in animals.</p><p>Human <italic>NGLY1</italic> has a single <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog called PNGase-like (<italic>Pngl</italic>), whose loss-of-function mutants result in semi-lethality and sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funakoshi et al., 2010</xref>). We have used <italic>Drosophila</italic> to determine the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Pngl</italic> regulates animal development. Our data indicate that <italic>Pngl</italic> is required in the visceral mesoderm (VM) during midgut development to regulate bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling from VM to endoderm in embryonic midgut and also to ensure midgut clearance before puparium formation. BMP ligands can signal either as homodimers or as heterodimers through homodimeric or heterodimeric BMP type I receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bangi and Wharton, 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ray and Wharton, 2001</xref>). Our data indicate that loss of <italic>Pngl</italic> abolishes a BMP autoregulatory loop in the VM mediated by homodimers of one ligand (Decapentaplegic; Dpp) acting through homodimers of one receptor (Thickveins; Tkv), and hence link a deglycosylation enzyme to tissue-specific regulation of BMP signaling in flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high level of functional conservation exists between fly Pngl and human NGLY1</title><p>Based on the analysis of three <italic>Pngl</italic> alleles (<italic>Pngl<sup>ex14</sup></italic>, <italic>Pngl<sup>ex18</sup></italic> and <italic>Pngl<sup>ex20</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it has previously been reported that loss of <italic>Drosophila Pngl</italic> results in developmental delay and a semi-lethality phenotype, with about 1% adult escapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funakoshi et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, these phenotypes were rescued by ubiquitous expression of mouse NGLY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Funakoshi et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting functional conservation between Pngl and its mouse homolog. To further examine the degree of conservation between fly Pngl and its mammalian homologs, we used ΦC31-mediated transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bischof et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Venken et al., 2006</xref>) to generate transgenic flies capable of overexpressing wild-type (WT) human NGLY1 or the NGLY1-ΔR402 mutant, a single amino acid in-frame deletion identified in an NGLY1 deficiency patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Enns et al., 2014</xref>), and asked whether they can rescue the homozygous lethality of <italic>Pngl<sup>ex14</sup></italic> and <italic>Pngl<sup>ex18</sup></italic>. Ubiquitous expression of WT human NGLY1, but not NGLY1-ΔR402, was able to rescue the lethality in both <italic>Pngl</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To better assess whether Pngl can function as an <italic>N</italic>-glycanase, we used RTL (RTAΔ-transmembrane-Leu2) spotting assays, which provide a reproducible <italic>in vivo</italic> model to assess the level of PNGase activity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hosomi et al., 2010</xref>). RTL undergoes ERAD in a PNGase-mediated, deglycosylation-dependent manner and therefore leucine-auxotrophic yeast cells which express functional <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> PNGase (Sc-Png1) are unable to grow in media lacking leucine. However, yeast cells that lack Sc-Png1 or express a catalytically-inactive version of Sc-Png1 fail to degrade RTL and can therefore grow on leucine-deficient medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hosomi et al., 2010</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>png1</italic> mutant yeast cells (<italic>png1</italic>Δ) grow well in media with or without leucine when transfected with the RTL plasmid. Expression of Sc-Png1-HA severely decreases the ability of these cells to grow in the absence of leucine, confirming that this phenotype is PNGase-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hosomi et al., 2010</xref>). An HA-tagged version of the fly Pngl suppressed the growth of the yeast cell in media without leucine to the same extent as the Sc-Png1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Meanwhile, Pngl harboring a C303A mutation in its putative catalytic domain (Pngl-HA-C303A) failed to rescue PNGase function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), even though WT and C303A versions are expressed at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pngl is able to deglycosylate RTL and facilitate the efficient degradation of the RTL protein. Next, we expressed a FLAG-tagged version of RTAΔ in yeast cells and asked whether Pngl can increase the level of the deglycosylated version of this protein upon inhibition of the protein biosynthesis. In <italic>png1</italic>Δ mutant yeast cells, almost all RTAΔ was found to be in the glycosylated form (g1) at three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Expression of Sc-Png1 or fly Pngl increased the relative level of the deglycosylated form (g0) in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). However, Pngl-C303A failed to remove glycans from RTAΔ. Similar experiments indicate that human NGLY1, but not the C309A catalytic mutant NGLY1, can also compensate for the lack of Sc-Png1 in the RTL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Of note, NGLY1-ΔR402 showed a weak rescue of the PNGase activity in this assay, suggesting that it is a hypomorphic allele. Altogether, these observations indicate that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pngl is indeed an <italic>N</italic>-glycanase enzyme and that there is high level of functional conservation between Pngl and its yeast and human homologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of <italic>Pngl</italic> causes gastric caeca and acidification defects in the larval midgut</title><p><italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> larvae did not show any gross morphological defects. However, inspection of the larval internal organs suggested defects in the mutant larval midguts. In the anterior part of the midgut, control larvae harbor four finger-like structures called gastric caeca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which play key roles in the insect digestive system, including water and ion transport and secretion of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pullikuth et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Volkmann and Peters, 1989</xref>). <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> larvae showed a severe shortening of the gastric caeca (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, red asterisks) compared to <italic>y w</italic> and heterozygote controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Control larvae harbor a specific region in the middle midgut called the ‘acid zone’, which has a luminal pH of less than 2.3 and is considered the fly stomach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubreuil, 2004</xref>). The acid zone can be visualized by feeding larvae with bromophenol blue (BPB), which is blue in neutral and basic pH but turns yellow as the pH is decreased from 7.0 to 1.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, red dotted box). <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> larvae are almost completely devoid of the yellow color in the midgut, indicating a loss of acid zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Following dimerization in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Dpp proprotein dimers traffic through the secretory pathway, where they undergo cleavages to release the active dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Künnapuu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sopory et al., 2010</xref>). Since our results indicate a role for <italic>Pngl</italic> in Dpp autoactivation mediated by Dpp homodimers (as opposed to Dpp-Gbb heterodimers) in PS7 VM, we examined the effects of loss of Pngl on Dpp dimerization and processing by Western blotting on larval extracts using the above-mentioned anti-Dpp antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). When ran on a reducing gel, control larvae (<italic>y w</italic> and <italic>UAS-Pngl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> without a GAL4 driver) exhibited two prominent bands: one corresponding in size to the full-length proprotein monomer and the other to the proprotein dimer, suggesting that Dpp dimers are partially resistant to the amount of reducing agents used in our assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). A third band slightly bigger and much fainter than the proprotein monomer was also observed in control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, red asterisk). Larvae homozygous for <italic>Pngl</italic> alleles and those ubiquitously expressing <italic>Pngl</italic> dsRNA showed an accumulation of a band corresponding in size to the prodomain (cleavage product) and a significant decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to Dpp dimers, without an apparent decrease in the intensity of the proprotein monomer band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Of note, although larvae heterozygous for the <italic>Pngl<sup>ex14</sup></italic> allele did not show any midgut defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), they displayed an intermediate pattern in the Western blot, suggesting that Pngl plays a dosage-sensitive role in Dpp dimerization and/or processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). To better assess the level of Dpp dimers in a <italic>Pngl</italic>-deficient background, we performed Western blot analysis on larval extracts ran on a non-reducing SDS gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Control larvae showed two rather strong bands corresponding in size to Dpp dimers and a weaker band corresponding to a proprotein monomer. This indicates that in a non-denaturing state, Dpp molecules are primarily found in association with other molecules and form Dpp-Dpp homodimers. We found a significant decrease in Dpp dimers in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant and knock-down larvae and a corresponding increase in the level of full-length monomer and the same cleavage product observed in regular Western blots. Again, <italic>Pngl<sup>ex14/+</sup></italic> larvae showed an intermediate band pattern, with a significant decrease in the intensity of one of the two ‘dimer’ bands and an apparent increase in the intensity of the full-length monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Dpp dimers are not exclusively reduced in midguts of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants but are also decreased in other parts of the larval body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).

However, the <italic>N</italic>-glycanase function has not been linked to any developmental signaling pathway. Here we report that fly <italic>Pngl</italic> regulates BMP signaling during embryonic midgut development without affecting BMP signaling in ectodermal and head regions of the embryo. Our data indicate that <italic>Pngl</italic> is not required in the midgut endoderm to receive the BMP signal, but rather is required in the VM to send the BMP signal. It has previously been shown that BMP signaling uses a paracrine/autocrine loop in the VM to sustain and increase the expression of Dpp in PS3 and PS7 of embryonic VM. This loop is proposed to ensure that the level of BMP ligands in the VM is high enough to induce signaling in the endoderm and to specify gastric caeca, the second midgut constriction and the acid zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bienz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hursh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Staehling-Hampton and Hoffmann, 1994</xref>). Several lines of evidence indicate that the BMP autoregulation mediated by the para-autocrine loop in the VM is the step which is impaired in <italic>Pngl</italic>-deficient embryos. First, Pngl is not required for the initial, Ubx-dependent expression of <italic>dpp</italic>. In fact, even a 50% decrease in the expression of <italic>dpp</italic> in the visceral mesoderm of <italic>dpp<sup>s2/+</sup></italic> animals does not impair BMP autoactivation and midgut development. Second, despite expressing Dpp at early stages, BMP signaling is not activated in <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> VM, as evidenced by the lack of pMad staining. Third, overexpression of Dpp-GFP in the mesoderm is able to induce BMP signaling in the endoderm in <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos. Lastly, bypassing the para-autocrine loop by transgenic expression of a constitutively active BMP receptor in the mesoderm results in restoration of BMP signaling in PS3 and PS7 regions of the endoderm and in partial rescue of lethality in <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos.</p><p>In the BMP para-autocrine loop, VM cells both secrete the BMP ligand and respond to it. Therefore, theoretically, Pngl might play a critical role in sending the BMP signal, receiving the BMP signal, or both. Although our data do not allow us to exclude any of these possibilities, based on the following observations, we favor a scenario in which Pngl is required in VM cells to send the Dpp signal not to receive it: (1) Pngl is not required to receive the BMP signal in the endoderm; (2) Loss of Pngl and <italic>Pngl</italic> KD result in a dramatic decrease in the level of Dpp homodimers and the Dpp-positive puncta; (3) Expression of a constitutively active form of Tkv in the mesoderm is able to restore midgut pMad staining in embryos and the copper cell region in the adult midgut, and partially rescue the lethality of <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> animals; (4) Loss of <italic>Pngl</italic> almost fully suppresses the aberrant BMP signaling caused by mesodermal overexpression of Dpp-GFP.</p><p>Whole larval protein extracts from <italic>Pngl</italic>-deficient animals show an increase in the level of the monomeric forms of Dpp (full-length and a cleavage product) and a simultaneous decrease in the bands corresponding in size to Dpp dimers. Moreover, <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos show a decrease in Dpp-positive puncta both in the mesoderm, where signaling is impaired, and in the ectoderm, where signaling is not impaired. Together, these observations indicate that the effect of loss of Pngl on the Dpp protein itself is not limited to the mesoderm. Indeed, protein extracts from <italic>Pngl</italic>-deficient midgut and carcass (without midgut) both show a decrease in Dpp dimer levels. This suggests that either Pngl regulates BMP signaling by affecting Dpp dimer levels in other larval tissues not identified yet, or that Dpp dimers are only important in the midgut and although they are decreased elsewhere, Dpp-Gbb heterodimers compensate for the lack of Dpp dimers in most other tissues. Regardless, we propose that loss of BMP signaling in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant midguts results from a requirement for Dpp homodimers in the para-autocrine autoregulatory loop present in the visceral mesoderm.</p><p>BMP ligands can signal both as homodimers and as heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bragdon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have shown that in general, BMP heterodimers have stronger bioactivity than their homodimers counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aono et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butler and Dodd, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Israel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Valera et al., 2010</xref>). In some cases, the homodimers induce weak to moderate signaling, and in other cases they either do not elicit signaling or even play an antagonistic role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bangi and Wharton, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). Stronger activity of BMP heterodimers can at least in part be explained by differential affinities of individual BMP ligands for different BMP receptors, combined with stronger signal transduction by heterodimeric type I receptors compared to homodimers of each type I receptor. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Dpp has a higher affinity for Tkv, whereas the other two ligands–Gbb and Scw–have a higher affinity for Sax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bangi and Wharton, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shimmi et al., 2005</xref>). A similar receptor-ligand binding preference has been observed among the vertebrate orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>). In the embryonic dorsal midline and the wing imaginal disc, Dpp/Scw and Dpp/Gbb heterodimers induce high levels of signaling, respectively, through Tkv/Sax heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bangi and Wharton, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>). Comparison of the <italic>gbb</italic> mutant phenotypes in the midgut with those caused by <italic>Pngl</italic> loss and by <italic>dpp</italic> KD indicates that Dpp homodimers are the only productive form of ligand in PS7. Moreover, mesodermal KD of <italic>tkv</italic> severely decreases BMP signaling in PS7, but mesodermal KD of <italic>sax</italic> not only does not decrease pMad staining in PS7, but also results in an expansion of pMad expression domain in the PS7 region, similar to <italic>gbb</italic> mutant embryos. Together, these observations strongly support the notion that the BMP autoregulatory loop in the VM, which is essential for the activation of BMP signaling in the endoderm, relies solely on Dpp and Tkv homodimers, and therefore is impaired in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants due to the severe decrease in the level of Dpp homodimers in these animals.</p><p>Vertebrate and invertebrate BMP proteins and other members of the TGFβ superfamily each harbor several <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites, which have been shown to be glycosylated in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Groppe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyazono and Heldin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tauscher et al., 2016</xref>). Various functional roles have been ascribed to <italic>N</italic>-glycans on these ligands, including enhancing receptor binding of BMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saremba et al., 2008</xref>), keeping the TGFβ1 ligand in a latent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyazono and Heldin, 1989</xref>), and promoting inhibin (α/β) heterodimer formation at the expense of activin (β/β) homodimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antenos et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, given the significant increase in Dpp monomeric forms and the simultaneous decrease in Dpp dimers upon loss of <italic>Pngl</italic>, it is possible that Pngl removes one or more <italic>N</italic>-glycans from Dpp and thereby promotes the formation or the stability of Dpp homodimers. Whether the regulation of Dpp by Pngl is direct or mediated via other proteins will remain to be explored.</p><p>In agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masucci and Hoffmann, 1993</xref>), our data suggest that the lethality of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants cannot be fully explained by shortening of the gastric caeca and impairment of BMP signaling in midgut development. <italic>Pngl</italic> KD with mesodermal drivers leads to a higher degree of lethality compared to <italic>dpp</italic> KD with the same drivers. Moreover, <italic>how<sup>24B</sup> &gt; Pngl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals show ~70% lethality, even though they do not have gastric caeca defects. Finally, restoring BMP signaling in the midgut by expressing <italic>tkvCA</italic> only recues the lethality in ~30% of <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> animals. Phenotypic analysis of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants combined with rescue and KD experiments suggest that a failure to properly empty the gut before puparium formation contributes to lethality in these animals. The molecular mechanisms for the food accumulation phenotype and other potential <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> phenotypes contributing to lethality are still under investigation.</p><p>In summary, our work indicates that the fly Pngl is an evolutionarily conserved <italic>N</italic>-glycanase enzyme necessary to sustain BMP autoactivation in the VM mediated by para-autocrine activity of Dpp homodimers through Tkv homodimers. Although we cannot exclude that Pngl plays important roles in other cell types as well, our data indicate that Pngl is primarily required in the mesoderm during midgut development and its loss results in Dpp-dependent and Dpp-independent midgut defects. Given the reports on potential para-autocrine functions of mammalian Dpp homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grimsrud et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rege et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shukunami et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tokola et al., 2015</xref>) and prominent human pathologies associated with dysregulated BMP signaling in ophthalmic, gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), tissue-specific alterations in BMP signaling might contribute to some of the NGLY1 deficiency phenotypes including retinal abnormalities, delayed bone age and osteopenia, small feet and hands, and chronic constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Enns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lam et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of the <italic>pngl</italic> gene (which encodes an enzyme that removes N-linked glycans) during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. This study is highly relevant as mutations in the human ortholog of this gene (NGLY1) are responsible for a congenital disorder of glycosylation where patients present with major developmental delays. Using genetic deficiencies, deletions and RNAi interference, the authors identify a role for this gene in Dpp signaling during early development that results in phenotypic abnormalities in larvae. Specifically, they demonstrate that loss of <italic>pngl</italic> influences the extent of Dpp propagation in PS3 and PS7 of embryonic development, thereby affecting mesoderm to endoderm signaling. This study is thorough, well-controlled and will provide important insights into signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms that may be responsible for the phenotypes observed in human NGLY1 patients.</p><p>This study does represent an important step in understanding how the loss of this gene influences a particular signaling pathway during a stage of development and could be very useful in beginning to interpret some of the developmental defects occurring in the patients. It would be very informative to know if (and how) the glycosylation status of <italic>dpp</italic> is altered upon loss of <italic>pngl,</italic> but we do see that is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>Please use the specific comments from the reviewers, some overlapping, to submit a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Comments of Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The overall concerns with the manuscript at this point are some of the interpretations and lack of biochemical mechanistic insight into the link between N-glycanase activity and Dpp homodimerization.</p><p>1) Why are <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants lethal? Mutants that lead to loss of the Copper cell region do not result in lethality (Cell Tissue Res. 2001 Oct: 306(1): 167-78). <italic>how-Gal4</italic> driven knockdown also results in lethality but does affect gastric caeca formation. This suggests that lethality is not due to loss of the caeca.</p><p>2) <italic>Mef2-Gal4</italic> and <italic>how-Gal4</italic> expression of human NGLY1 partially rescues <italic>Pngl</italic> lethality. <italic>Mef2-Gal4</italic> and <italic>how-Gal4</italic> expression of <italic>Pngl</italic> RNAi results in 0 and 28% survivability and <italic>Mef2-Gal4</italic> and <italic>how-Gal4</italic> expression of <italic>dpp</italic> RNAi results in loss of the acid region and caeca and 8 and 80% survivability, leading the authors to conclude that <italic>Pngl</italic> plays a <italic>dpp</italic> independent role. This may indeed be the case and should be mentioned in the Abstract. However, an alternative explanation is that <italic>dpp</italic> is required in other tissues and the knockdown by these drivers is not effective in the other tissues.</p><p>3) Subsection “Loss of BMP signaling in <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryonic endoderm is caused by impaired BMP autoactivation in VM”: <italic>Mef&gt;tkv<sup>CA</sup></italic> rescues <italic>Pngl</italic> lethality. Given the concerns that lethality is not due to caeca or acid region loss, this would argue that <italic>Pngl</italic> is required for BMP/ (maybe TGF-B) signaling elsewhere.</p><p>4) Do <italic>Mef&gt;tkv<sup>CA</sup> Pngl</italic> minus flies that make it to adulthood have a Copper cell region. It would be interesting to know if <italic>Pngl</italic> is required for proper midgut formation during metamorphosis.</p><p>5) Mutants that make it to adulthood are sterile. Do these animals have ovaries/testis that are consistent with loss of <italic>dpp</italic>, i.e. germline stem cell loss? Knowing this might help to establish <italic>Pngl</italic> as a gene required for a subset of BMP signaling pathway events. It would especially be interesting as <italic>gbb</italic> is also required for germline stem cell maintenance.</p><p>6) From the Abstract, the authors write,&quot;[…]without affecting BMP signaling in other contexts[…]&quot; It's impossible to be sure it is not affecting BMP signaling in other contexts. It's just that the authors were not able to identify any others. The same concern relates to the last sentence of the subsection “BMP signaling from VM to endoderm is impaired upon loss of <italic>Pngl</italic>”. The word &quot;specifically&quot; should be removed.</p><p>7) Do <italic>Pngl</italic> genes harboring a C303A mutation fail to rescue the <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant fly phenotypes. This would at least genetically link the catalytic domain/activity to described phenotypes. There is no data in this paper to how <italic>Pngl</italic> affects <italic>dpp</italic>.</p><p>8) Why did the authors, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, do Western Blots on whole larvae and not midguts versus carcass (midgut minus)? Changes in dimmer accumulation in carcass could help identify other tissues where <italic>Pngl</italic> may act.</p><p>9) &quot;BMP ligands can signal both as homodimers and as heterodimers (Bragdon et al., 2011; 383 O'Connor et al., 2006).&quot;</p><p>If so, have the authors examined the tissues where the ligands act as homodimers? Do they have phenotypes? Changes in accumulation on Western Blots?</p><p><italic>Comments of Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) As the mesodermal knockdown of <italic>pngl</italic> was more severe that the knockdown of <italic>dpp</italic>, can the authors comment on reasons for this (are there other suspected targets of <italic>Pngl</italic> in the mesoderm)?</p><p>2) Clarification with regard to rescue experiments-is Dpp-GFP processed and dimerized in the same manner as endogenous Dpp?

Mutants that lead to loss of the Copper cell region do not result in lethality (Cell Tissue Res. 2001 Oct: 306(1): 167-78). how-Gal4 driven knockdown also results in lethality but does affect gastric caeca formation. This suggests that lethality is not due to loss of the caeca.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Mutants with loss of acid zone usually do not show lethality. Moreover, our data indicate that <italic>dpp</italic> knockdown by <italic>how-GAL4</italic>, which is expressed after gastric caeca anlagen is formed, does not lead to significant lethality. This is not true in <italic>how-GAL4</italic>-mediated <italic>Pngl</italic> knockdown experiments, where the lethality is remarkably high although gastric caeca formation is not affected. Therefore, although we think gastric caeca shortening contributes to <italic>Pngl</italic> lethality (please see below), these data clearly suggest that other events are involved in the lethality of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants. At the time of the original submission, we had data showing a Dpp-independent midgut phenotype (food accumulation) in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant and mesoderm-specific knockdown larvae. However, we decided not to include the data in the first version because we do not know the molecular mechanism for this phenotype, and the manuscript was focused on BMP signaling. Since both reviewers have inquired about the reason behind the discrepancy between <italic>dpp</italic> knockdown and <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant/knockdown phenotypes, we now include the data in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. <italic>Pngl</italic>-mutant wandering larvae accumulate food in the midgut and are not able to properly empty their midgut before puparium formation. Comparing knockdown data for <italic>dpp</italic> and <italic>Pngl</italic> by pan-mesodermal drivers reveals that the food accumulation phenotype in <italic>Pngl</italic> larvae is at least in part and perhaps fully independent of impairment in BMP signaling. Specifically, <italic>how&gt;dpp<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> larvae do not show any food accumulation phenotype, but <italic>how&gt;Pngl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> larvae show a rather severe food accumulation phenotype. It is noteworthy that <italic>Mef2&gt;dpp<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> larvae show some degree of food accumulation. This phenotype is milder than that observed in <italic>Mef2&gt;Pngl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> larvae and <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants, and might be due to defects caused by complete loss of Dpp in the mesoderm, independently of the function of <italic>Pngl</italic>. Nevertheless, in the manuscript we call the food accumulation phenotype partially independent from Dpp signaling to be on the safe side.</p><p>By studying several alleles of <italic>dpp</italic> which specifically affect its expression in PS3 and PS7 in the embryonic visceral mesoderm, the Hoffmann group showed that loss of gastric caeca is accompanied by developmental delay and some degree of larval and pupal lethality (Masucci and Hoffmann, 1993). In agreement with this report, we believe our data indicate that shortening of gastric caeca contributes to the lethality of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants. As shown in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), overexpression of TkvCA restores BMP signaling in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant embryonic midgut and rescues the lethality of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants around 30%. Moreover, the rescue of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant lethality by <italic>how&gt;NGLY1</italic> is weaker than the rescue with <italic>Mef2&gt;NGLY1</italic> (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Lastly, ~30% of <italic>how&gt;Pngl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>animals reach adulthood, even though they lose the acid zone and show food accumulation. We conclude that the lethality of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants arises from at least two sources: to some extent from BMP-dependent defects in the midgut (mostly due to the gastric caeca shortening), to a larger extent from BMP-independent defects in the mesoderm, and potentially due to minor contributions from non-mesodermal tissues. The importance of the structural and functional integrity of visceral mesoderm in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is an understudied area. Among the small number of studies that we found discussing the importance of visceral mesoderm, one of them seems to show a correlation between a failure to empty the gut due to functional defects in visceral mesoderm and lethality (Bland et al., 2010). Unfortunately, our current data do not allow us to draw strong conclusions on the extent to which the food accumulation phenotype contributes to the lethality of <italic>Pngl</italic> larvae. We have used the following sentences in the revised Discussion to convey this message: “Phenotypic analysis of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants combined with rescue and KD experiments suggest that a failure to properly empty the gut before puparium formation contributes to lethality in these animals. The molecular mechanisms for the food accumulation phenotype and other potential <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic>phenotypes contributing to lethality are still under investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Mef2-Gal4 and how-Gal4 expression of human NGLY1 partially rescues Pngl lethality. Mef2-Gal4 and how-Gal4 expression of Pngl RNAi results in 0 and 28% survivability and Mef2-Gal4 and how-Gal4 expression of dpp RNAi results in loss of the acid region and caeca and 8 and 80% survivability, leading the authors to conclude that Pngl plays a dpp independent role. This may indeed be the case and should be mentioned in the Abstract. However, an alternative explanation is that dpp is required in other tissues and the knockdown by these drivers is not effective in the other tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we mention the issue raised by the reviewer in the Abstract as well as in Results and Discussion. As discussed above, we now present evidence for a food accumulation phenotype in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant and mesodermal KD animals that is at least partially Dpp-independent. Given that overexpression of NGLY1 in the mesoderm of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants results in the formation of adults at greater than 80% of the Mendelian ratio, <italic>Pngl</italic> seems to be primarily required in the mesoderm during fly development. Having said that, the reviewer’s point is well taken: our data are not sufficient to rule out a role for <italic>Pngl</italic> in non-mesodermal tissues. Accordingly, we have added the following phrase to the last paragraph of the Discussion: “Although we cannot exclude that <italic>Pngl</italic> might play important roles in other cell types as well, our data indicate that <italic>Pngl</italic> is primarily required in the mesoderm during midgut development[…]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Loss of BMP signaling in Pngl<sup>–/–</sup> embryonic endoderm is caused by impaired BMP autoactivation in VM”: Mef&gt;tkv<sup>CA</sup> rescues Pngl lethality. Given the concerns that lethality is not due to caeca or acid region loss, this would argue that Pngl is required for BMP/ (maybe TGF-B) signaling elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, our data indicate that gastric caeca shortening most likely contributes to lethality, in agreement with a previous report (Masucci and Hoffmann, 1993). Therefore, we believe that the partial rescue of <italic>Pngl</italic> lethality by <italic>Mef2</italic>&gt;tkvCA can be explained by the rescue of gastric caeca. However, we agree with the reviewer that it is possible that <italic>Pngl</italic> is required in other contexts for TGF-β or BMP signaling during embryonic or larval development. Accordingly, we have modified the Results section as follows: “These observations further indicate that impaired BMP signaling is partially responsible for the lethality of <italic>Pngl<sup>–/–</sup></italic> animals. This is likely due to gastric caeca shortening (Masucci and Hoffmann, 1993), although we cannot exclude that <italic>tkvCA</italic> overexpression affects unknown BMP-related defects in other parts of mesoderm in these mutants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Do Mef&gt;tkv<sup>CA</sup> Pngl minus flies that make it to adulthood have a Copper cell region. It would be interesting to know if Pngl is required for proper midgut formation during metamorphosis.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have investigated the adult midgut of <italic>Pngl</italic> escapers and compared them with flies rescued by overexpressing <italic>tkvCA</italic> with <italic>Mef2-GAL4.</italic> As shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>tkvCA</italic> rescues the adult Copper cell region and the midgut length in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Mutants that make it to adulthood are sterile. Do these animals have ovaries/testis that are consistent with loss of dpp, i.e. germline stem cell loss? Knowing this might help to establish Pngl as a gene required for a subset of BMP signaling pathway events. It would especially be interesting as gbb is also required for germline stem cell maintenance.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have tested whether loss of <italic>Pngl</italic> causes impairment of BMP signaling in germline stem cells (GSCs) of ovaries and testes in <italic>Pngl</italic> adult escapers 3-4 days after eclosion (n&gt;10 for each). We have stained both tissues by pMad antibody to test BMP signaling and Vasa antibody to mark germline cells and their progeny. Our data suggest that BMP signaling in germaria of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant ovaries is not lost, as we see pMad co-localized with Vasa in the anterior part of the germarium. Unfortunately, we cannot test GSC maintenance and BMP signaling in an age-dependent manner in mutant germaria of <italic>Pngl</italic> adult escapers due to their short lifespan. Notably, we have found a severe decrease in pMad expression in the anterior part of the mutant testis in male <italic>Pngl</italic> adult escapers, strongly suggesting BMP signaling impairment in this tissue. These data indicate that the reviewer is correct: although among the BMP-dependent processes during embryonic and larval stages that we have studies so far midgut development is the only context affected by the loss of <italic>Pngl, Pngl</italic> is likely to have important roles in some additional cell types as well. We have modified the revised version to reflect this notion, as mentioned in our response to questions 3 and 4. However, we feel that it’s premature to add the testis and ovary data to the manuscript, as both tissues also show morphological abnormalities that are not likely to be caused by the loss of BMP signaling. We will need to perform additional in-depth studies on these tissues to bring them to the same level of scrutiny applied in our midgut studies, and the manuscript is already somewhat long, especially after the addition of food accumulation data. We hope that the editor and reviewer will agree with our strategy of not showing the ovary/testis data but clearly mentioning that specific cell types other than visceral mesoderm are likely to require the function of <italic>Pngl</italic> as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) From the Abstract, the authors write,&quot;[…]without affecting BMP signaling in other contexts[…]&quot; It's impossible to be sure it is not affecting BMP signaling in other contexts. It's just that the authors were not able to identify any others. The same concern relates to the last sentence of the subsection “BMP signaling from VM to endoderm is impaired upon loss of Pngl”. The word &quot;specifically&quot; should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have modified the text to address this issue in the Abstract and the Results section and removed “specifically”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do Pngl genes harboring a C303A mutation fail to rescue the Pngl mutant fly phenotypes. This would at least genetically link the catalytic domain/activity to described phenotypes. There is no data in this paper to how Pngl affects dpp.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a great suggestion (like a number of other points raised by the reviewer). As shown in new panels in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 (3K-3O</xref>), transgenic overexpression of <italic>Pngl</italic> harboring a single mutation in its catalytic domain (C303A) in the mesoderm of <italic>Pngl</italic> mutants failed to rescue the gastric caeca length and the acid zone, even though Western blots show that this mutation does not affect the expression level of Pngl. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type Pngl by the same driver (<italic>Mef2</italic>-GAL4) fully rescued these phenotypes. These data indicate that <italic>Pngl</italic>’s deglycosylation activity is essential for the regulation of BMP pathway in larval midgut.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Why did the authors, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, do Western Blots on whole larvae and not midguts versus carcass (midgut minus)? Changes in dimmer accumulation in carcass could help identify other tissues where Pngl may act.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we have performed carcass vs. midgut Western Blot in a non-reducing condition and probed with Dpp antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, the level of Dpp dimer is decreased not only in the midgut but also in other parts of the larval body. This could mean that either <italic>Pngl</italic> regulates BMP signaling by affecting Dpp dimer levels in other larval tissues, or that Dpp dimers are only important in the midgut and although they are decreased elsewhere, Dpp-Gbb heterodimers compensate for the lack of Dpp dimers in most other tissues. We have discussed both of these possibilities in the revised version (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;BMP ligands can signal both as homodimers and as heterodimers (Bragdon et al., 2011; 383 O'Connor et al., 2006).&quot;</p><p>If so, have the authors examined the tissues where the ligands act as homodimers? Do they have phenotypes? Changes in accumulation on Western Blots?</p></disp-quote><p>Cell-based assays have indicated that BMP ligands can signal both as homodimers and heterodimers. However, the relative in vivo contribution of BMP heterodimer versus homodimer in most tissues is not well known. Therefore, unfortunately we do not have the knowledge required to address the reviewer’s comment.</p><p><italic>Comments of Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) As the mesodermal knockdown of pngl was more severe that the knockdown of dpp, can the authors comment on reasons for this (are there other suspected targets of Pngl in the mesoderm)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. As described in our response to questions 1-3 of reviewer 1, we have added a new figure (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) to address this issue. Unfortunately, we do not know the target(s) of <italic>Pngl</italic> involved in this phenotype, as it seems to be mostly BMP-independent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarification with regard to rescue experiments-is Dpp-GFP processed and dimerized in the same manner as endogenous Dpp? Does it have the same N-glycans? If not, could this affect your interpretation (or perhaps give clues as to what region of Dpp is affected by Pngl)?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this point, we overexpressed <italic>dpp-GFP</italic> by <italic>Mef2-GAL4</italic> and tested the Dpp pattern by anti-GFP Western blotting in reducing and non-reducing conditions. As previously reported in S2 cells (Teleman and Cohen, 2000), we found that the precursor and mature forms of Dpp-GFP match the expected size and pattern in reducing conditions (Author response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, left lane). In addition, in non-reducing conditions the size of the observed bands corresponds to Dpp-GFP dimers, and they show the same pattern as the endogenous Dpp (Author response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, right lane). These data suggest that the GFP polypeptide which has been inserted in Dpp protein does not affect its processing and dimerization. Moreover, we have checked the GFP sequence inserted in Dpp by consulting the Experimental Procedures of the paper which reported the generation of this transgene (Teleman and Cohen, 2000) and looked for potential <italic>N</italic>- glycosylation consensus sequences (N-X-S/T). None of the 13 asparagine residues present in this fragment conforms to the <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation consensus sequence. Since the GFP has been inserted in the context of the full length Dpp (without any deletions in the Dpp protein), the Dpp-GFP protein most likely possesses the same <italic>N</italic>-glycans as the endogenous Dpp.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Dpp-GFP shows dimerization and processing patterns similar to Dpp.</title><p>Larval extracts from <italic>Mef2&gt;dpp-GFP</italic>were run under reducing (left lane) and non-reducing (right lane) conditions and probed with an anti-GFP antibody.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27612-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In pngl mutants, can you distinguish between Dpp protein simply being produced at a lower level (due to instability, higher turnover, etc.) vs. Dpp protein not being able to mediate autoregulation? Or are these different ways of saying the same thing?</p></disp-quote><p>Four observations in the original manuscript were used to conclude that Dpp autoregulation in the visceral mesoderm is impaired: presence of initial, Ubx-dependent expression of <italic>dpp</italic> in stage 13 <italic>Pngl</italic> embryos, lack of pMad in the visceral mesoderm of these embryos, rescue of pMad expression in endoderm by mesodermal overexpression of Dpp-GFP, and rescue of pMad expression in the endoderm by overexpression of TkvCA in the mesoderm. We believe that it is difficult to reconcile the hypothesis of a simple reduction in Dpp as the cause of these phenotypes with the last line of evidence mentioned here. However, the reviewer’s comment prompted us to test whether reducing the <italic>dpp</italic> expression in mesoderm by another strategy could impair BMP autoregulation. The <italic>dpp<sup>S2</sup></italic> allele harbors a chromosomal breakpoint in regulatory elements that control <italic>dpp</italic> expression in the visceral mesoderm and results in a complete loss of <italic>dpp</italic> expression in the visceral mesoderm in homozygosity, without affecting its expression in other embryonic tissues (Masucci and Hoffmann, 1993). We reasoned that if decreasing Dpp production levels is sufficient to explain the <italic>Pngl</italic> midgut phenotypes, animals heterozygous for this allele, which will presumably lose 50% of <italic>dpp</italic> expression in the visceral mesoderm, should show defects in the propagation of the Dpp expression domain and expression of pMad in embryonic midgut and potentially some BMP-dependent defects in the larval midgut. As the new panels in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 (M and N</xref>) show, in stage 13 <italic>dpp<sup>S2</sup></italic> heterozygous embryos, the level of Dpp protein in PS7 is even less than that Dpp level in <italic>Pngl</italic> homozygous embryos. However, it can lead to Dpp spreading at stage 14. Moreover, as shown in a new supplemental figure of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <italic>dpp<sup>S2</sup></italic> heterozygous animals do not exhibit defects in the formation of second midgut compartment and Labial expression in the embryo and in the acid zone in third instar larvae. These observations further support the conclusion that impairment of the Dpp autoregulatory loop underlies the loss of BMP signaling in <italic>Pngl</italic> mutant midguts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors comment on whether any of the major phenotypes seen in the NGLY1 patients are thought to be due to changes in BMP signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some sentences to the last paragraph of the Discussion section to address this issue.</p></body></sub-article></article>
