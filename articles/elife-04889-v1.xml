By combining cryo-focused ion beam milling of vitreous <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells with cryo-electron tomography, we acquired three-dimensional structures of the chloroplast in its native state within the cell. Chloroplast envelope inner membrane invaginations were frequently found in close association with thylakoid tips, and the tips of multiple thylakoid stacks converged at dynamic sites on the chloroplast envelope, implicating lipid transport in thylakoid biogenesis. Subtomogram averaging and nearest neighbor analysis revealed that RuBisCO complexes were hexagonally packed within the pyrenoid, with ∼15 nm between their centers. Thylakoid stacks and the pyrenoid were connected by cylindrical pyrenoid tubules, physically bridging the sites of light-dependent photosynthesis and light-independent carbon fixation. Multiple parallel minitubules were bundled within each pyrenoid tubule, possibly serving as conduits for the targeted one-dimensional diffusion of small molecules such as ATP and sugars between the chloroplast stroma and the pyrenoid matrix.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04889.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04889.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04889.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many organisms can harvest light to produce their own energy through a process called photosynthesis. In plant and algal cells, photosynthesis takes place within the chloroplasts, which are compartments that contain stacks of structures called thylakoids.</p><p>Inside the thylakoids, proteins absorb energy from light and convert it into biochemical energy that can be used by the cell. This energy then powers a series of reactions that result in carbon dioxide being incorporated into energy-rich sugars. The enzyme RuBisCO is essential for this process, and is believed to be the most abundant protein on Earth. In land plants, RuBisCO is found throughout the chloroplast, but in algae it is limited to a specialized area called the pyrenoid.</p><p>Much of our current knowledge of chloroplast structure comes from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. However, the traditional methods used to prepare cells for TEM can damage their internal structures. Also, previous studies have focused primarily on the chloroplasts of land plants, even though aquatic organisms—including the alga <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>—account for over 50% of photosynthesis on the planet.</p><p>Here, Engel et al. provide the first three-dimensional structures of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> chloroplasts in their natural state. They used several recently-developed techniques to study cells that were preserved in a close-to-living condition. The cells were rapidly frozen, thinned with a technique called cryo-focused ion beam milling, and then imaged by a type of TEM called cryo-electron tomography.</p><p>The three-dimensional images provide many insights into the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> chloroplast, including evidence that lipids and proteins move between the membrane that surrounds the chloroplast—called the chloroplast envelope—and the tips of the thylakoids. These images show how thylakoids may be built by the transport of molecules from the chloroplast envelope. In addition, the images reveal the detailed structures of the tubes that connect the thylakoids to the pyrenoid, which could explain how the two stages of photosynthesis (light harvesting and the conversion of carbon dioxide) can be coordinated even though they occur at different places within the chloroplast.</p><p>Engel et al. also observed that RuBisCO enzymes are arranged in a hexagonal pattern inside the pyrenoid, but are spaced too far apart to make direct contact with each other. To understand how the pyrenoid is assembled, a future goal will be to determine what causes RuBisCO to be arranged in this way.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04889.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04889.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic></kwd><kwd>focused ion beam</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron tomography</kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>thylakoid</kwd><kwd>RuBisCO</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7th Framework Programme Grant HEALTH-F4-2008-201648/PROSPECTS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumeister</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung (Humboldt Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>German Academic Exchange Service</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CONACyT-DAAD Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuhn Cuellar</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Clusters CIPSM and SFB 1035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumeister</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumeister</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Inter-Institutional Research Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumeister</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first 3D views of the native algal chloroplast provide new insights into thylakoid biogenesis, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The chloroplast is the site of eukaryotic photosynthesis and carbon fixation, coupled processes that convert the energy of light into stored biochemical energy, while exchanging environmental CO<sub>2</sub> for O<sub>2</sub>. As such, the chloroplast both directly and indirectly sustains much of the life on our planet.</p><p>The biochemical pathways of photosynthesis rely on the chloroplast's elaborate architecture. In both higher plants and algae, the light-dependent photosynthetic reactions take place in the thylakoids, sheet-like membrane-bound compartments that group together into regularly-spaced stacks (called grana in higher plants). Photons are absorbed by photosystem complexes within the thylakoid membrane, and the downstream electron transfer chain generates NADPH in the chloroplast stroma. This process, combined with the splitting of H<sub>2</sub>0 into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup>, concentrates H<sup>+</sup> inside the thylakoid lumen. The resulting proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is used by the ATP synthase complex to generate ATP in the chloroplast stroma, where the light-independent carbon fixation reactions occur. ATP and NADPH power the Calvin–Benson cycle, a series of reactions that incorporate CO<sub>2</sub> into the three-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Downstream pathways produce starch, which is stored within the chloroplast. The CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing step of the Calvin–Benson cycle is catalyzed by the octomeric ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) complex. In higher plants, which have ready access to gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>, RuBisCO complexes are distributed throughout the chloroplast stroma. However, algae primarily live in aquatic environments where CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved as HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. In order to maintain efficient carbon fixation, the majority of algal RuBisCO complexes are concentrated in a specialized region of the chloroplast known as the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Holdsworth, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lacoste-Royal and Gibbs, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borkhsenious et al., 1998</xref>), where carbonic anhydrase frees CO<sub>2</sub> from solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Karlsson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Moroney et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, in algae the light-dependent and light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are physically segregated to distinct regions of the chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While the chloroplast's biochemical pathways are well characterized, a better understanding of the organelle's native three-dimensional (3D) architecture would help answer questions about the biogenesis of thylakoids and pyrenoids, as well as the cellular mechanisms that link the activities of these two physically separated systems.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04889.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-FIB of plunge-frozen <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cross-section diagram of a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cell.

Each of these preparation steps can distort structures and obscure high-resolution information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Weston et al., 2009</xref>). Sample preparation by freeze-fracture has enabled observations of integral proteins embedded in membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Park and Pfeifhofer, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodenough and Staehelin, 1971</xref>), but it cannot provide a 3D view of chloroplast architecture. Vitrification by rapid freezing offers the best possible preservation of biological material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref>). Imaging vitreous samples by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) generates 3D views of native structures, where image contrast corresponds to the intrinsic variation in mass density instead of the sample's local affinity for heavy metal stains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumeister et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decade, there has been progress in the 3D visualization of photosynthetic structures. Much of this work has focused on cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nevo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Ting et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Konorty et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Iancu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liberton et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2011b</xref>), as the small size of these prokaryotes allows imaging by whole-cell tomography. With the exception of a few very small cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Henderson et al., 2007</xref>), more complex eukaryotic specimens must be thinned to make them transparent to the electron beam. Two approaches have been used to examine thin samples of higher plant thylakoids. High pressure freezing followed by freeze-substitution reduces the fixation artifacts caused by conventional TEM sample preparation, enabling tomograms of plastic sections that better preserve thylakoid ultrastructure but are still limited in resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shimoni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austin and Staehelin, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, thylakoids can be isolated from crushed chloroplasts to make thin vitreous samples suitable for cryo-ET. While this approach has yielded informative high-resolution structures of protein complexes embedded in thylakoid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kouril et al., 2011</xref>), these membranes have been removed, both spatially and temporally, from their cellular context. Labile and transient chloroplast structures may no longer be biologically relevant in such preparations.</p><p>The ideal approach would be to thin intact vitreous specimens for cryo-ET, preserving both 3D architecture and high-resolution information. Until recently, the only method capable of thinning vitreous material was cryo-sectioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hsieh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Amoudi et al., 2004</xref>), a procedure that is technically demanding, causes compression and crevasse deformations, and has a narrow range of optimal section thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Amoudi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouchet-Marquis and Hoenger, 2011</xref>). Cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling provides a compression-free method for thinning vitreous material to any desired thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rigort et al., 2012b</xref>). Cryo-FIB is also more high-throughput than cryo-sectioning, as specimens can be thinned directly on the grid that will be used for cryo-ET. Cryo-FIB is thus becoming the method of choice and has already been successfully applied to a variety of eukaryotic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rigort et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Strunk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Villa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Winter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We combined cryo-FIB with cryo-ET to acquire the first in situ 3D structures of the algal chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While most structural studies have focused on terrestrial plants, aquatic organisms account for around 50% of global carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Field et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behrenfeld et al., 2001</xref>), and it is estimated that nearly half of this aquatic production is performed by eukaryotic algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jardillier et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we chose to examine the genetically tractable unicellular green alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, the most extensively studied model organism for algal photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grossman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blaby et al., 2014</xref>). Because all biological material was immobilized at the moment of whole cell vitrification, fine structures remained well preserved within their cellular context, enabling accurate measurements of thylakoid architecture, membrane invaginations, pyrenoid tubules, the eyespot, and the 3D organization of RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Native 3D architecture of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> thylakoid membranes</title><p><italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells are ∼10 μm in diameter, and about half of their volume is occupied by a single cup-shaped chloroplast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sager and Palade, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gaffal et al., 1995</xref>). Different regions of the algal chloroplast are associated with specific functions. Carbon fixation is carried out in the pyrenoid at the base of the chloroplast cup. There is evidence for chloroplast protein translation and import near the base of the cup, while the sides of the cup (known as lobes) are thought to contain mature thylakoids that perform the light reactions of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Uniacke and Zerges, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schottkowski et al., 2012</xref>).

Thylakoid stacks had a lateral repeat distance of 22.4 ± 1.3 nm, with 4.9 ± 0.5 nm thylakoid membranes, 9.0 ± 1.4 nm thylakoid lumina, and 3.6 ± 0.5 nm interthylakoid stromal spaces (± denotes standard deviation, n = 38 thylakoids from eight stacks). Although <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> thylakoid lumina were significantly wider than the thylakoid lumina reported in studies of higher plant grana (15.7–16.3 nm lateral repeat, 4.5–4.7 nm thylakoid lumina, and 3.2–3.6 nm interthylakoid stromal spaces) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirchhoff et al., 2011</xref>), grana thylakoid lumina have been shown to expand to 9.2 nm when plants are adapted to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirchhoff et al., 2011</xref>). In our tomograms, the number of thylakoids per stack ranged from 2 to 15, with a median of 3 thylakoids.

Each pyrenoid tubule encompassed between two and eight minitubules, with a median of 5. In cross-section, the minitubules had an oval or bean-like shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,G</xref>) with a long-axis diameter of 21.6 ± 1.7 nm and a short-axis diameter of 13.4 ± 1.1 nm, including the membrane (n = 22 minitubules within four pyrenoid tubules).

Minitubule membranes were derived from the coalescence of two opposed membranes of adjacent thylakoids in a stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>). Consequently, minitubule membrane topology is ‘inside-out’ relative to the membranes of pyrenoid tubules. At the periphery of the pyrenoid, minitubules were completely enveloped within the surrounding pyrenoid tubule membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–H</xref>). As pyrenoid tubules proceeded towards the center of the pyrenoid, minitubules emerged from the pyrenoid tubules, exposing their stromal lumina to the pyrenoid matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–E</xref>). Thus, pyrenoid minitubules form continuous conduits between the interthylakoid stromal space and the RuBisCO complexes in the pyrenoid matrix.

Comparing the structures of algal and higher plant thylakoid stacks may shed light on the evolution of photosynthetic systems. The <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> interthylakoid stromal space (3.6 nm) is comparable to the grana interthylakoid stromal space (3.2–3.6 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirchhoff et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that the molecular mechanisms that hold two algal or higher plant thylakoid membranes together may be similar. This attraction is proposed to involve van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber and Chow, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chow et al., 2005</xref>), perhaps mediated by light-harvesting complexes bound to photosystem II (PSII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daum et al., 2010</xref>). The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of PSII projects 4.5 nm into the thylakoid lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2004</xref>), a comparable distance to the 4.5–4.7 nm width of grana thylakoid lumina measured for isolated chloroplasts and leaves of dark-adapted plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirchhoff et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, OECs on opposite sides of these narrow lumina must interdigitate due to spatial constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daum et al., 2010</xref>), and indeed, it seems likely that the size of the OEC determines the minimum grana lumen width. Our <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells, which were grown in constant light until the moment of vitrification, had 9 nm thylakoid lumina. Interestingly, this may be a result of light conditions rather than an algal characteristic, as leaves that were harvested from light-exposed plants and immediately cryo-immobilized had 9.2 nm grana lumina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirchhoff et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, PSII complexes in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> thylakoids and light-exposed higher plant grana should experience fewer limitations to their mobility, and their OECs may directly face each other instead of being interdigitated. Examination of dark-adapted <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> cells would reveal whether the light-induced change in thylakoid lumen width is conserved between algae and higher plants.</p><p>While much research in higher plants has focused on the mechanisms that organize thylakoid stacks, little is known about how proteins orchestrate the dramatic membrane curvature seen in our tomograms, including the 180<sup>°</sup> loops between thylakoid tips, the transition from flat thylakoid stacks to cylindrical pyrenoid tubules, and the very thin pyrenoid minitubules. One good candidate for the 180<sup>°</sup> loops is CURT1, an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that oligomerize, tubulate membranes, and are enriched at the grana margins of higher plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pribil et al., 2014</xref>).

Thus, transport between these systems must be possible. Over one third of the inner membrane invaginations in our tomograms were located within 40 nm of a thylakoid tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), less than the width of two stacked thylakoids. Taken together with the rare direct connections we observed between the inner membrane and thylakoid tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>), it is likely that there is a transport mechanism for the exchange of lipids and proteins between these two compartments. Consistent with this idea, there is growing evidence that vesicular transport from the chloroplast envelope inner membrane is required for thylakoid biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Nordhues et al., 2012</xref>).

In the model proposed by these studies, thylakoid proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome are locally translated at the base of the chloroplast cup in a region surrounding the pyrenoid called the T-zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Uniacke and Zerges, 2007</xref>). At the base-lobe junction, where the base and sides of the cup meet, nuclear-encoded proteins are imported and assembled with the chloroplast-encoded proteins into macromolecular complexes in the thylakoid membranes. Finally, mature thylakoids in the sides of the cup carry out the photosynthetic light reactions. If this model is correct, the thylakoid tip convergence zones at the base and rim of the chloroplast cup likely perform different functions. The base of the cup is located close to the ER and Golgi, as well as many cytoplasmic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and thus convergence zones at the base-lobe junction are ideally situated for the import of new proteins. Indeed, in this junction region we observed small complexes associated with both the chloroplast envelope outer membrane and inner membrane invaginations, indicating that these complexes may be undergoing import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Unlike thylakoid tip convergence zones near the base of the chloroplast cup, convergence zones at the rim of the cup are located far from the site of thylakoid biogenesis and only contain mature thylakoids. One possibility is that the rim could be the site where old and photodamaged thylakoid proteins are transported out of the chloroplast for degradation. In this source-sink model, there would be a constant flux of proteins from the source at the chloroplast base to the sink at the rim of the cup. It is also worth considering that the apical rim of the chloroplast is positioned close to the flagella, the only part of the cell's external membrane that comes into direct contact with the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The rim is thus well situated for the uptake and release of molecules that cannot permeate the cell wall. It is possible that thylakoid tip convergence zones are a conserved feature of algal chloroplasts, as similar structures can be found in a wide range of algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gibbs, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Moisan et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, thylakoid tip convergence zones may be homologous to the biogenesis centers of cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kunkel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">van de Meene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Stengel et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pyrenoid tubules bridge the spatially separated light-dependent and light-independent steps of photosynthesis</title><p>Although the aggregation of RuBisCO within the pyrenoid is advantageous for utilizing the high local concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>, this causes RuBisCO to be physically isolated from the photosynthetic pathways that occur in the thylakoid stacks and chloroplast stroma. The pyrenoid tubules appear to solve this problem, as they connect these regions of the chloroplast by serving as conduits through the dense starch sheath.</p><p>The RuBisCO catalytic reaction does not use ATP or NADPH. However, RuBisCO activase is also localized to the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McKay and Gibbs, 1991</xref>) and requires ATP to promote RuBisCO activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Streusand and Portis, 1987</xref>). While immunolabeling data indicates that many Calvin–Benson cycle enzymes may be restricted to the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Suss et al., 1995</xref>), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), which uses ATP to carry out the final step of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration, has been detected in close association with the pyrenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Holdsworth, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McKay and Gibbs, 1991</xref>). Thus, the pyrenoid likely requires ATP from the chloroplast stroma. Conversely, the product of carbon fixation, G3P, must be exported from the pyrenoid. If other Calvin–Benson cycle enzymes do indeed exclusively reside in the stroma, then regeneration intermediates of the Calvin–Benson cycle would also need to exchange efficiently between the stroma and the pyrenoid.</p><p>The pyrenoid minitubules identified in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–H</xref>) form narrow continuous channels between the interthylakoid stromal space and the pyrenoid matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10 fig11">Figures 10 and 11</xref>). Therefore, we propose that minitubules facilitate the rapid targeted diffusion of small molecules such as ATP and Calvin–Benson cycle sugars between these two compartments. The minitubule lumen diameter is only 3–4 nm by 8–15 nm, while the longest axes of ATP and the sugars RuBP and G3P measure ∼1.4 nm, ∼1.2 nm, and ∼0.7 nm, respectively. Thus, diffusion of these metabolites through the minitubules would be practically one-dimensional. While we are unsure how the local minitubule environment may affect the diffusion coefficient, assuming a diffusion coefficient of a small molecule in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Milo et al., 2010</xref>), it would only take a few milliseconds to travel 1 μm through a minitubule.</p><p>In addition to bundling minitubules and directing them towards the pyrenoid center, the larger pyrenoid tubules may play an important role in supplying RuBisCO with saturating levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. It is believed that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> in the thylakoid lumen is converted to CO<sub>2</sub> by carbonic anhydrase 3 (CAH3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Karlsson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hanson et al., 2003</xref>), a reaction that is aided by the high H<sup>+</sup> concentration in the lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Raven, 1997</xref>). Since membranes are much more permeable to CO<sub>2</sub> than HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Moroney et al., 2011</xref>), CO<sub>2</sub> would then freely diffuse out of the thylakoids and into the pyrenoid. Under low-CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, CAH3 is phosphorylated and moves from the thylakoids to the pyrenoid tubules, where it can efficiently supply RuBisCO with CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blanco-Rivero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sinetova et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while minitubules may deliver the energy and sugars for carbon fixation, the larger pyrenoid tubules likely provide the CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The structure of the pyrenoid is dynamic and responds to environmental changes including light, temperature, and atmospheric composition. When cells are grown in low light, the pyrenoid matrix becomes fenestrated with more pyrenoid tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rawat et al., 1996</xref>). Such an inducible condition may allow the examination of pyrenoid tubule assembly and growth through the pyrenoid matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Hexagonal close packing of RuBisCO: specific inter-complex interactions or random packing caused by pyrenoid forces?</title><p>The hexagonal arrangement of RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid could be caused by one of two distinct influences. Either there are specific interactions between RuBisCO complexes that enforce this hexagonal configuration, or non-specific packing forces resulting from crowding within the pyrenoid compress the complexes together, yielding hexagonal close packing of roughly spherical objects. If RuBisCO complexes do make specific interactions with each other, this would indicate that there may be allosteric molecular mechanisms for increasing the efficiency of carbon fixation. Two studies found evidence that the RuBisCO small subunit may mediate inter-complex interactions in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Genkov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). The hydrophobic residues in the surface-exposed α-helixes of the RuBisCO small subunit were shown to be necessary for pyrenoid formation, and RuBisCO aggregation was prevented in vivo when these domains were replaced by less hydrophobic sequences from higher plants. This implies that hydrophobic interactions between RuBisCO complexes may drive pyrenoid formation.</p><p>Alternatively, the hexagonal arrangement of RuBisCO particles may be caused by non-specific pyrenoid packing forces. We found that the centers of RuBisCO complexes in the pyrenoid were ∼15 nm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>), even though RuBisCO is shaped like a rounded cube with a shortest diameter of ∼10.5 nm and a longest diameter of ∼13 nm. Thus, there is a 2–4.5 nm space between RuBisCO complexes, depending on their relative orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). This data suggests that RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid may not directly interact with each other and that other factors, such as a dense matrix of proteins and carbohydrates or small linker proteins between the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Meyer and Griffiths, 2013</xref>), determine the RuBisCO spacing. In the case of non-specific packing, the key question becomes how these packing forces are generated. One possibility is that since the pyrenoid is encased in a dense starch sheath, packing forces could increase as additional RuBisCO complexes are inserted into this relatively fixed volume. Such a model raises the question of how RuBisCO complexes are targeted through the starch sheath during pyrenoid growth.</p><p>In different classes of bacterial carboxysomes, both random and specific packing of RuBisCO have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rae et al., 2013</xref>). In α-carboxysomes, which are found primarily in ocean-dwelling cyanobacteria, non-specific packing forces alone are believed to be sufficient to induce the layered organization of RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Iancu et al., 2010</xref>). However, in the β-carboxysomes of freshwater cyanobacteria, RuBisCO complexes are held in an organized array by CcmM linker proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Long et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peña et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While our data cannot discriminate between random and specific causes of hexagonal RuBisCO packing in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> pyrenoid, several lines of investigation may be able to help tease apart this question. Technical advances such as direct detection cameras continue to improve the resolution of cryo-tomograms. Once higher resolutions are attained, it will be possible to use template matching to determine whether RuBisCO complexes have a preferred orientation relative to each other, a strategy that has already been successfully applied to ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brandt et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pfeffer et al., 2012</xref>). If RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid do indeed have preferred orientations, template matching will also reveal which surfaces likely mediate RuBisCO aggregation. A complementary approach would be to examine how RuBisCO packing changes under conditions where the pyrenoid becomes less organized, including mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Thyssen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), elevated levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rawat et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borkhsenious et al., 1998</xref>), and during RuBisCO aggregation in newly divided cells at dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>). If the hexagonal packing disappears in disorganized pyrenoids, this would indicate that the packing is driven by non-specific pyrenoid forces. However, if islands of hexagonal packing persist even when RuBisCO complexes are not being forced together, this would provide evidence for inter-complex interactions. Additionally, the pyrenoid forms in mutants that lack a starch sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Villarejo et al., 1996</xref>), enabling a direct test of whether the starch induces hexagonal packing of RuBisCO.</p><p>By combining cryo-FIB with cryo-ET, we acquired the first in situ 3D views of the algal chloroplast, native structures that provide new insights into the mechanisms of thylakoid biogenesis, photosynthesis, and carbon fixation.

A spherical template, which functioned well due to the homogeneity of pyrenoid composition and the roughly spherical shape of RuBisCO at the tomogram resolution, made it possible to discard the rotational search, dramatically increasing the localization speed and enabling iterative fine-tuning of parameter values.

Our tomograms represent the artifact-free native state of hydrated cells, reveal 3D views of the cellular environment, and provide much higher resolution information. This enabled us to make observations about cellular architecture that were not previously possible. We make this point generally in the Introduction: “Much of our understanding of chloroplast architecture comes from conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heslop-Harrison, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hodge et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ohad et al., 1967a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ohad et al., 1967b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sager and Palade, 1957</xref>) using the traditional protocol of sample fixation, heavy metal staining, dehydration, plastic embedding, and sectioning with an ultramicrotome. Each of these preparation steps can distort structures and obscure high-resolution information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Weston et al., 2009</xref>). Sample preparation by freeze-fracture has enabled observations of integral proteins embedded in membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goodenough and Staehelin, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Park and Pfeifhofer, 1969</xref>), but it cannot provide a 3D view of chloroplast architecture. Vitrification by rapid freezing offers the best possible preservation of biological material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref>). Imaging vitreous samples by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) generates 3D views of native structures, where image contrast corresponds to the intrinsic variation in mass density instead of the sample’s local affinity for heavy metal stains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumeister et al., 1999</xref>).”</p><p>Specifically, our technique enabled the first detailed analysis of fine and transient features including: 1) chloroplast envelope inner membrane invaginations, 2) pyrenoid minitubules, and 3) the packing of RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid. While not singling out individual studies, in the Introduction we emphasize the novelty of these observations compared to all previous work: “Because all biological material was immobilized at the moment of whole cell vitrification, fine structures remained well preserved within their cellular context, enabling accurate measurements of thylakoid architecture, membrane invaginations, pyrenoid tubules, the eyespot, and the 3D organization of RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid matrix.”</p><p>Differences from previous classical EM studies are also noted in the manuscript:</p><p>“Pyrenoid tubules have previously been reported to contain “ridges” or “infoldings” along the inner surface of the tubule membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ohad et al., 1967a</xref>). Interestingly, in high magnification cryo-tomograms these structures were revealed to be smaller tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9E-H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>), which we have termed pyrenoid minitubules.”</p><p>“The pyrenoids of most species, including those found in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, appear amorphous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Griffiths, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). Since these conclusions about pyrenoid architecture are based on 2D EM of plastic sections, we decided to investigate whether RuBisCO complexes were ordered within our native-state tomographic volumes of the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> pyrenoid. (…) symmetry-free subtomogram averaging of 45.6 nm<sup>3</sup> subvolumes revealed that the RuBisCO complexes were actually hexagonally packed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>).”</p><p><italic>The RuBisCO results may be over-emphasized, which may mislead some readers. It is most likely that the appearance of hexagonal packing is the result of randomly arranging RuBisCO within a confined space. This should be made clear in the text</italic>.</p><p>Given the available studies on RuBisCO packing, it is premature to make the judgment that “it is most likely that the appearance of hexagonal packing is the result of randomly arranging RuBisCO within a confined space”. Both random packing and specific packing interactions are plausible mechanisms. In our discussion, we discuss the evidence in favor of each mechanism without showing favoritism towards either model. The evidence in favor of specific packing in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is outlined in the Discussion section: “Two studies found evidence that the RuBisCO small subunit may mediate inter-complex interactions in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Genkov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). The hydrophobic residues in the surface-exposed α-helixes of the RuBisCO small subunit were shown to be necessary for pyrenoid formation, and RuBisCO aggregation was prevented in vivo when these domains were replaced by less hydrophobic sequences from higher plants. This implies that hydrophobic interactions between RuBisCO complexes may drive pyrenoid formation.”</p><p>For comparison, we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion explaining how different types of carboxysomes can employ either specific or random packing mechanisms: “In different classes of bacterial carboxysomes, both random and specific packing of RuBisCO have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rae et al., 2013</xref>). In α-carboxysomes, which are found primarily in ocean-dwelling cyanobacteria, non-specific packing forces alone are believed to be sufficient to induce the layered organization of RuBisCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Iancu et al., 2010</xref>). However, in the β-carboxysomes of freshwater cyanobacteria, RuBisCO complexes are held in an organized array by CcmM linker proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Long et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Peña et al., 2010</xref>).”</p><p>As stated in the Discussion, our data favors either random packing or linker proteins, not direct inter-RuBisCO interactions: “Alternatively, the hexagonal arrangement of RuBisCO particles may be caused by non-specific pyrenoid packing forces. We found that the centers of RuBisCO complexes in the pyrenoid were ∼15 nm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D</xref>), even though RuBisCO is shaped like a rounded cube with a shortest diameter of ∼10.5 nm and a longest diameter of ∼13 nm. Thus, there is a 2-4.5 nm space between RuBisCO complexes, depending on their relative orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>). This data suggests that RuBisCO complexes within the pyrenoid may not directly interact with each other and that other factors, such as a dense matrix of proteins and carbohydrates or small linker proteins between the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Meyer and Griffiths, 2013</xref>), determine the RuBisCO spacing.”</p><p>To further emphasize that non-specific packing forces result in “random” packing of RuBisCO, we have modified the title of the section “Hexagonal close packing of RuBisCO: specific inter-complex interactions or <italic>random</italic> packing caused by pyrenoid forces?”, as well as the following sentence: “While our data cannot definitively judge between random and specific causes of hexagonal RuBisCO packing in the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> pyrenoid, several lines of investigation may be able to help tease this question apart.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
