The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a major mechanism that detects and alleviates protein-folding stresses in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the role of individual arms of the UPR in skeletal muscle regeneration remain less understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that IRE1α (also known as ERN1) and its downstream target, XBP1, are activated in skeletal muscle of mice upon injury. Myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α or XBP1 in mice diminishes skeletal muscle regeneration that is accompanied with reduced number of satellite cells. Ex vivo cultures of myofiber explants demonstrate that ablation of IRE1α reduces the proliferative capacity of myofiber-associated satellite cells. Myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α dampens Notch signaling and canonical NF-κB pathway in skeletal muscle of adult mice. Finally, targeted ablation of IRE1α also reduces Notch signaling, abundance of satellite cells, and skeletal muscle regeneration in the mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Collectively, our experiments suggest that the IRE1α-mediated signaling promotes muscle regeneration through augmenting the proliferation of satellite cells in a cell non-autonomous manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>ire1 signaling</kwd><kwd>XBP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Skeletal muscle regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR059810</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Ashok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR068313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Ashok</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The IRE1/XBP1 signaling in myofibers is essential for robust skeletal muscle regeneration in response to injury.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle, the most abundant tissue of the body, has remarkable regenerative capacity mainly due to its resident muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells. These cells are located beneath the basal lamina of myofiber in a dormant state. Upon muscle injury, satellite cells become activated leading to their asymmetric cell division and differentiation into myoblasts which eventually fuse together or with existing myofibers to accomplish muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuang and Rudnicki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). In many muscle diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and aged skeletal muscle (sarcopenia), the abundance and regenerative capacity of satellite cells are diminished leading to impairment in muscle regeneration and a net loss of muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brack and Muñoz-Cánoves, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>). It is now increasingly evidenced that muscle regeneration is regulated through orchestrated activation of multiple signaling pathways and factors produced by regenerating myofiber as well as other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanisms of muscle regeneration are not yet fully understood.</p><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the major subcellular compartment that is involved in protein folding and secretion. Many secreted proteins are translated from mRNAs localized on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane and enter the ER as nascent chains that are modified and properly folded before exiting the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harding et al., 1999</xref>). An imbalance between the influx of unfolded proteins and the capacity of the organelle to handle them causes stress in the ER that triggers activation of an adaptive signaling network, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Preissler and Ron, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>). The major goal of the UPR is to restore homeostasis or induce apoptosis of permanently damaged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>). The UPR is initiated by three ER transmembrane sensors: protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). PERK directly phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α), which leads to the attenuation of translation initiation and limits the protein-folding load on the ER. IRE1α (also known as ERN1, Endoplasmic Reticulum to Nucleus signaling 1) is a serine/threonine kinase and endoribonuclease controlling cell fate under ER stress. Once activated, IRE1α oligomerizes leading to three major downstream outputs: the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the splicing of <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA, and the degradation of targeted mRNA and microRNAs, a process referred to as regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>). Upon stress in ER, ATF6 protein is transported to the Golgi complex where it is cleaved by S1P and S2P to release the N-terminal-domain. The cleaved ATF6 domain translocates to the nucleus, where in association with other factors, it induces gene transcription of target molecules such as GRP78, GRP94 and calnexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Kaufman, 2014</xref>). Although ER stress is the major trigger, a few components of the UPR, including IRE1α and XBP1 can also be activated in mammalian cells in the absence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah and Ravanan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dufey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinon et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Because regeneration of injured skeletal muscle involves a huge increase in demand for synthesis, processing, and secretion of multiple growth factors and signaling proteins and synthesis of an entirely new set of contractile, cytoskeletal, and membrane proteins, the activation of UPR may be a physiological response to ensure that cells participating in regeneration continue to function efficiently during these increased demands. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that the UPR is activated and plays an important role in skeletal muscle formation and regenerative myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afroze and Kumar, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohnert et al., 2018</xref>). ATF6 arm of the UPR is activated during skeletal muscle development where it mediates apoptosis of a subpopulation of myoblasts that may be incompetent of handling cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>). The role of the UPR in myogenesis is also supported by the findings that pan-inhibition of ER stress attenuates apoptosis and myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakanishi et al., 2005</xref>) whereas inducers of ER stress remove vulnerable myoblasts allowing more efficient differentiation into myotubes in cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakanishi et al., 2007</xref>). Recent studies have suggested that PERK arm of the UPR is required for maintaining satellite cells in a quiescent state in skeletal muscle of adult mice. Genetic inducible ablation of PERK in satellite cells inhibits skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zismanov et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, PERK-ATF4 axis regulates the early differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts potentially through upregulating the expression of differentiation-associated microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2021</xref>). Intriguingly, it was recently reported that IRE1α stimulates skeletal muscle regeneration through RIDD-mediated reduction in myostatin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role and the mechanisms by which the IRE1α/XBP1 signaling axis in myofibers regulates skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice remain poorly understood.</p><p>In the present study, using genetic mouse models, we have investigated the role of IRE1 and XBP1 in skeletal muscle regeneration. Our results demonstrate that myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α attenuates skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice. IRE1α controls muscle regeneration potentially through the activation of XBP1 transcription factor. Genetic ablation of XBP1 also reduces regeneration of injured skeletal muscle. Our results also demonstrate that the IRE1α/XBP1 signaling pathway in myofibers promotes the proliferation of satellite cells. Depletion of IRE1α in myofibers suppresses Notch and canonical NF-κB signaling in regenerating skeletal muscle. Finally, our experiments demonstrate that genetic ablation of IRE1α exacerbates myopathy and reduces the number of satellite cells in skeletal muscle of dystrophin-deficient mdx (a model of DMD) mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α attenuates skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice</title><p>We first investigated how the phosphorylation of IRE1α and levels of spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) protein are regulated in skeletal muscle after injury.

In the present study, we demonstrate that the activation of IRE1α/XBP1 signaling axis is increased in skeletal muscle upon injury and that genetic ablation of IRE1α or XBP1 in myofibers attenuates skeletal muscle regeneration potentially through inhibiting the proliferation of satellite cells in a cell non-autonomous manner. Our study also demonstrates that IRE1α-mediated signaling is essential for the regeneration of injured myofibers in dystrophic muscles of mdx mice.</p><p>Skeletal muscle regeneration is accomplished through the activation of satellite cells which proliferate and differentiate to become myoblasts that eventually fuse with injured myofibers to complete regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuang and Rudnicki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). While the frequency of satellite cells in skeletal muscle of healthy individuals remain constant, their number and regenerative potential can get altered in various disease states and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brack and Muñoz-Cánoves, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dumont et al., 2015</xref>). We found that ablation of IRE1α in myofibers has no noticeable effect on skeletal muscle development in mice. Furthermore, genetic ablation of IRE1α in differentiated myofibers does not influence the frequency of satellite cells in naïve conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α inhibits the regeneration of skeletal muscle in response to injury in adult mice. Our results also demonstrate that the size of the regenerating myofibers and levels of various MRFs, such as <italic>Myf5</italic>, <italic>Myod1,</italic> and <italic>Myog</italic> as well as <italic>Myh3</italic> are considerably reduced in injured muscle of <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggesting that IRE1α-mediated signaling supports the early steps of muscle regenerative program. We have previously reported that PERK is essential for the survival and differentiation of activated satellite cells into the myogenic lineage. While the role of IRE1 in muscle progenitor cells has not been yet investigated, targeted ablation of XBP1 does not affect satellite cell function during regenerative myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). These results suggest that distinct arms of the UPR may have different roles in the regulation of muscle progenitor cell function and skeletal muscle regeneration in adults. It is also possible that IRE1 regulates satellite cell function through its kinase activity which will be investigated in future studies.</p><p>IRE1α, the most evolutionary conserved UPR signaling branch, is a serine/threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease that cleaves and initiates splicing of the <italic>Xbp1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>).

Activated IRE1α also controls various biological processes, including cell death and inflammation through degradation of a subset of mRNAs and microRNAs through a process known as RIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maurel et al., 2014</xref>). The target mRNAs of RIDD in mammalian cells require a consensus motif of 5′-CUGCAG-3′, along with a secondary stem loop structure. The disruption in stem loop formation or mutation in the consensus sequence hampers RIDD-mediated degradation of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oikawa et al., 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, in response to some stimuli, such as genotoxic stress or microbial products, IRE1α signaling is activated without any noticeable ER stress signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdullah and Ravanan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dufey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinon et al., 2010</xref>).

A recent study demonstrated that IRE1α promotes skeletal muscle regeneration through reducing the levels of myostatin via RIDD pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2021</xref>).

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the levels of other mRNAs which are known to be degraded through RIDD-dependent mechanisms suggesting that IRE1α signaling in myofibers may not be regulating skeletal muscle regeneration through RIDD pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our results are consistent with the findings that the RIDD-dependent mRNA decay occurs only when there is an ectopic activation of IRE1α with concomitant inhibition of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Hollien, 2015</xref>).

Notch signaling is quite unique that it can regulate the fate of one cell with that of a cellular neighbor through interaction between the Notch receptor and the membrane-bound Notch ligands that are expressed in a juxtaposed cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kann et al., 2021</xref>). It is now evidenced that the outcome of Notch signaling is dependent on the cellular context and is capable of influencing quiescence, self-renewal, survival, and differentiation cell fates. Notch signaling has also been shown to regulate the self-renewal and proliferation of satellite stem cells both in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, our results demonstrate that levels of Notch receptor 1, 2 and 3 and Notch ligands Jagged1 and Jagged2 are significantly reduced in injured muscle of <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice compared with <italic>Ern1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. In addition, transcript levels of Notch target genes are also reduced in regenerating muscle of <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice further suggesting an inhibition in Notch signaling upon myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). While we observed an inhibition in the markers of Notch signaling in <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice, it remains unknown how depletion of IRE1 in myofibers influences Notch signaling. It is possible that IRE1/XBP1 signaling directly regulates the gene expression of Notch ligands in myofibers which through interaction with Notch receptor promotes the proliferation of other cell types in regenerating myofibers. However, it is also possible that IRE1-mediated signaling regulates Notch signaling through paracrine mechanisms. Certainly, more investigations are needed to understand the mechanisms by which IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR affects Notch signaling during regenerative myogenesis.</p><p>Previous studies have also shown that the levels of various components of canonical Wnt signaling are increased in injured skeletal muscle and Wnt signaling promotes myoblast fusion during regenerative myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hindi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hindi et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, spatial activation of Notch and Wnt signaling is important for the progression of muscle regeneration upon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brack et al., 2008</xref>). However, there was no significant difference in the gene expression of various components of Wnt signaling in regenerating muscle of <italic>Ern1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggesting that IRE1α specifically regulates Notch signaling and inhibition of Notch signaling may be one of the important mechanisms for the reduced proliferation of satellite cells in <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice.</p><p>Signaling crosstalk between Notch and NF-κB pathways has been reported especially in cancer cells. In general, Notch1 and Notch target genes augment the activity of NF-κB through multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espinosa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrandino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osipo et al., 2008</xref>). NF-κB is known to promote proliferation and survival of a number of cell types. NF-κB can be activated through a canonical pathway that involves the activation of IKKβ and p65 subunits. In non-canonical pathway, protein levels of NIK are increased due to inhibition of its degradation. NIK phosphorylates IKKα which in turn phosphorylates p100 protein leading to its proteolytic processing into p52 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayden and Ghosh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Razani et al., 2011</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that the canonical NF-κB signaling is activated at initial stages of myogenesis to augment the proliferation of muscle progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Straughn et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, the non-canonical NF-κB signaling augments myoblast fusion during myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enwere et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hindi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hindi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the levels of phosphorylated p65 protein as well as gene expression of <italic>Tnf</italic>α, a potent inducer of canonical NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayden and Ghosh, 2004</xref>), are significantly reduced in regenerating myofibers of <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice compared to <italic>Ern1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. In contrast, there was a significant increase in the levels of p100 and p52 proteins in the injured muscle of <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice suggesting activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling upon deletion of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although the physiological significance of differential activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathway remains unknown, it is possible that inhibition of canonical signaling is another mechanism for the reduced proliferation of satellite cells in injured skeletal muscle of <italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice. Alternatively, spurious activation of non-canonical NF-κB signaling may cause precautious fusion of muscle progenitor cells leading to deficits in muscle regeneration.</p><p>DMD is a genetic muscle disorder which involves chronic degeneration and regeneration of myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emery, 1998</xref>). It has been postulated that inadequate muscle regeneration in DMD is due to exhaustion of satellite cells after several rounds of myofiber degeneration and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to DMD patients, skeletal muscles of mdx mice maintain their ability to regenerate throughout life. Indeed, mdx mice serve as an excellent model to study muscle regeneration in disease conditions and in response to repeated cycles of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). Our results demonstrate that genetic ablation of IRE1α exacerbates dystrophic phenotype and reduces the proportion of regenerating myofibers in skeletal muscle of mdx mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These results are consistent with a recently published report demonstrating that myoblast-specific deletion of IRE1α also exacerbates dystrophic phenotype in mdx mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to the published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2021</xref>), we did not find any significant difference in the transcript levels of myostatin or Bloc1S1 in dystrophic muscle of mdx;<italic>Ern1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and mdx;<italic>Ern1</italic>cKO mice. Interestingly, our analysis also showed that myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1α significantly reduces the number of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and gene expression of Notch targets in skeletal muscle of mdx mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>) further suggesting that IRE1α-mediated signaling in myofibers promotes proliferation of satellite cells to support muscle regeneration.</p><p>In summary, our study provides initial evidence that IRE1/XBP1 signaling is activated during acute or chronic muscle injury and its main function is to promote muscle regeneration through supporting proliferation of satellite cells in a cell non-autonomous manner.</p><p>One caveat of our study is that we have used Cre-loxP system to delete <italic>Ern1</italic> or <italic>Xbp1</italic> gene in skeletal muscle of mice. While tissue-specific knockout is an important approach to understand the function of a gene, it does not cause the complete excision of the target gene. Moreover, deletion of a gene from the beginning of the development can also lead to the activation of another gene to compensate for its functions. Therefore, more investigations using inducible <italic>Ern1</italic>- or <italic>Xbp1</italic>-knockout mice and pharmacological inhibitors are needed to establish the role of IRE1α/XBP1 axis in skeletal muscle regeneration. Moreover, it will be important to determine whether supraphysiological activation of the IRE1α/XBP1 signaling axis using transgenic or pharmacological approaches can improve myofiber regeneration in response to acute injury and in animal models of muscle degenerative diseases. Future studies will also investigate the cell-autonomous role of IRE1α in satellite cell function during regenerative myogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

The mouse tail was then gently pulled backward in the horizontal plane until it could no longer grasp the bar. The force at the time of release was recorded as the peak tension. Each mouse was tested five times with a 1 min break between tests. The average peak tension from five attempts normalized against total body weight was defined as grip strength.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Skeletal muscle injury and in vivo fusion assay</title><p>Muscle necrotic injury in adult mice was performed by injection of 50 µl of 1.2 % BaCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma Chemical Co.) dissolved in saline into the TA muscle as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindi et al., 2012</xref>). At various time points after intramuscular injection of BaCl<sub>2</sub>, the mice were euthanized and TA muscle was collected for biochemical and histological studies. To study myoblast fusion in vivo, the mice were given an intraperitoneal injection of EdU (4 μg per gram body weight) at day 3 after intramuscular injection of 1.2 % BaCl<sub>2</sub> into the TA muscle. After 11 days of EdU injection, the TA muscle was isolated and sectioned in a microtome cryostat. The sections were subsequently immunostained with anti-Laminin for marking boundaries of myofibers and processed for the detection of EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei similar to as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hindi et al., 2017</xref>). The EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei on muscle sections were detected as instructed in the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Imaging Kit (Invitrogen). Finally, images were captured and the number of intramyofiber EdU<sup>+</sup> myonuclei/myofiber, percentage of 2 or more EdU<sup>+</sup> centrally nucleated fibers and percentage of EdU<sup>+</sup> myonuclei/total nuclei were quantified using NIH ImageJ software. For calculating the EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei, the images were split into single channels and green channel was scanned to count the EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei. Similarly, the red and blue channels were scanned to count the numbers of myofibers and myonuclei, respectively. While counting, it was ensured that EdU fluorescence is indeed from nucleus. This was achieved by keeping the merged image open in a parallel window and scrutinizing whether the fluorescence overlapped with DAPI and coincided with nuclear location. To reduce variations, three to four different sections from mid-belly of each muscle were included for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology and morphometric analysis</title><p>Uninjured and injured TA muscles were isolated from mice, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned with a microtome cryostat.

To confirm that red staining is specific to Pax7+ cells, a parallel window with the corresponding merged image was kept open. Care was taken to scrutinize that red fluorescence overlapped with DAPI fluorescence and was also located underneath the basal lamina (laminin staining) to be considered as real Pax7 staining. Similarly, the green and blue channels were scanned to count the numbers of myofibers and nuclei, respectively. For minimizing variation based on muscle size, the satellite cells were quantified from three to four separate regions from the mid-belly of each muscle. A minimum of 500 myofibers were scanned per mouse to count the associated Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)</title><p>Satellite cells were analyzed by performing FACS analysis as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hindi and Kumar, 2016</xref>).

We calculated the sample size for each group as eight animals. Considering a likely drop-off effect of 10%, we set sample size of each group of six mice. For some experiments, three to four animals were found sufficient to obtain statistical differences. Animals with same sex and same age were employed to minimize physiological variability and to reduce SEM from mean. The exclusion criteria for animals were established in consultation with IACUC members and experimental outcomes. In case of death, skin injury, sickness or weight loss of &gt;10%, the animal was excluded from analysis. Muscle tissue samples were not used for analysis in cases such as freeze artefacts on histological section or failure in extraction of RNA or protein of suitable quality and quantity. Animals from different breeding cages were included by random allocation to the different experimental groups. Animal experiments including morphometric analysis of myofiber CSA, percentage of Pax7<sup>+</sup>, or EdU<sup>+</sup> cells on TA muscle sections were blinded using number codes till the final data analyses were performed. Statistical tests were used as described in the Figure legends. Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses used two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant unless otherwise specified.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

One assumes that unfolded protein responses are increased during tissue regeneration due to the huge increase in demand for synthesis, processing, secretion and signaling via the diverse array of proteins deposited in extracellular matrix during tissue repair, and synthesis of an entirely new set of contractile proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane proteins and machinery for homeostasis (ion channels, adhesion molecules, dystrophin, and others) and that activation of UPR is a physiological response that assures that cells participating in regeneration continue to function efficiently in the face of these many demands.

However, in its current form, the manuscript falls short of presenting a compelling and cohesive mechanism by which these effects occur.</p><p>Strengths of this manuscript include comprehensive histological analyses of skeletal muscle regeneration together with assessment of satellite cell fate. The use of muscle-specific KO mice is also a strength as is the a priori power analysis, which enhances the rigor of the work. The statistical analyses used are appropriate. The writing is clear and easy to follow.</p><p>One of the major weaknesses of this work is the use exclusively of loss-of-function paradigms. Given the critical role of the ER in protein synthesis and folding, it is not surprising that disruption of this system would drastically affect regeneration after an acute injury. The manuscript would be considerably strengthened by the addition of gain-of-function or rescue studies, and specifically as they pertain to the studies implicating Notch and/or NF-κB as downstream mediators of the effect of IRE1 on satellite cell proliferation.</p><p>It is interesting that the investigators identified activation of XBP1, but not the RIDD mechanism, as downstream of the effect of IRE1 on skeletal muscle regeneration. However, the data provided to rule out the RIDD mechanism are limited to gene expression analyses. Given that previous work has implicated RIDD in the regulation of muscle regeneration by IRE1, additional studies are needed to support the current authors' conclusions.</p><p>It is not clear why the investigators chose to perform a double injury experiment in Figure 1. The double injury data in Figure 1H, I are not quantified, so these images are not of high significance. Also, grip strength testing is performed in the mdx mice studies of Figure 8, but not in Figure 1. The addition of functional measures to Figure 1 would be valuable.</p><p>It is not clear to me how the findings of Notch signaling fit relate to the NFk-B findings and, as currently presented, the two findings seem disconnected. Similarly, satellite cell proliferation in the XBP1 muscle KO mice is not quantified, which would be helpful for supporting the investigators' overall proposed mechanism.</p><p>The rationale for the studies presented in Figure 8 in which mdx mice are crossed with IREmKO mice is not clear, nor is the interpretation of findings that the increased IRE1 in mdx mice, when reversed, aggravates the pathogenic phenotype.</p><p>It would be helpful if the investigators would provide a more thorough discussion of the physiological relevance of the current findings, which utilize a myofiber-specific KO of IRE, versus the previous work by He et al. in which IRE is knocked out specifically in myoblasts.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>This reviewer appreciates the extensive analyses that have been performed and that are presented in this manuscript. The authors are also to be commended for inclusion of the negative findings (e.g., the lack of effect on Wnt signaling). However, in its current form, many of the data presented describe the phenotype of the KO mice. The science would be strengthened by mechanistic interrogation of the hypothesis proposed.</p><p>I also recommend submission of full western blots as Supplementary files. The western blots shown in Figure 6 are of poor quality. Along these lines, for greater transparency, the graphs would be strengthened if changed to include individual data points.</p><p>Authors have not included a statement about whether investigators performing analyses were blinded to the treatment group, which is important as many of the analyses performed may be subject to bias.</p><p>Please provide information regarding age and sex of the animals used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Roy et al. demonstrates that IRE1/XBP1 signaling plays a significant role in muscle regeneration. Given that mature skeletal muscle fibers contain high concentrations of contractile and structural proteins, quality control mechanisms to maintain protein homeostasis are crucial. In this study, the authors used a loss of function approaches to test the role of IRE1 and its downstream transcriptional factor, XBP-1 following acute muscle injury and chronic muscular dystrophy model in mdx mice. However, due to the limitations in the experimental approach and study design, reported data do not support the authors' conclusions and alternative explanations can be identified. Overall, the authors do not provide mechanistic insights on how IRE-1 affecting muscle stem cell dynamics.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>The manuscript by Roy et al. reports interesting observations on how IRE1/XBP1 signaling affects acute and chronic myogenic response by satellite cells. Overall, given the importance of proteostasis in muscle, this is an important area of research in muscle biology. However, there several shortcomings that reduced enthusiasm for this study.</p><p>1.

Overall, the link between how muscle-specific knockout of IRE1 influences muscle stem cell myogenesis is weak. A snapshot of gene expression changes does not provide convincing evidence of non-cell-autonomous interactions.</p><p>5. Figure 3E, these are not a pure population of satellite cells that are &gt;95% Pax7+. An additional positive satellite cell surface marker or different gating strategy should be used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript examines the role of Ire1, a protein involved in the unfolded protein response, in the proliferation and regenerative abilities of skeletal muscle satellite cells. A model of skeletal muscle regeneration following injection of barium chloride into the left tibialis anterior muscle (TA) with injection of normal saline into the right TA serving as the control. Phospho-Ire1 was increased by muscle injury. The role of Ire1 in muscle regeneration was tested in mice with a germline conditional deletion of Ire1 under a muscle creatine kinase promotor. The conditional Ire1 knockout diminished myofiber size out to at least day 14 after injury, reduced numbers of Pax7(+) nuclei in regenerating muscle, and reduced numbers of EdU(+) nuclei. Biochemical evidence of lower expression of Notch 1 and a downstream target, Hes6, in regenerating tissues is presented. The conditional knockout of Ire1 worsened grip strength in mdx mice. Taken together, the data support a role for unfolded protein response signaling through Ire1 in the ability of skeletal muscle satellite cells to proliferate and fuse during tissue repair.</p><p>Caveats to interpreting the data are universal to the field and include unanticipated effects of the germline deletion of Ire1 on muscle biology and the small N of some of the experiments.</p><p>The results of these genetic experiments need to be reconciled with those of a prior report showing that inhibition of the PERK arm of the unfolded protein response or genetic ablation of Perk1 inhibits muscle regeneration while inhibition of Irk1 does not.

In our previously published report about the role of PERK in skeletal muscle regeneration, we had deleted Perk or Xbp1 in the satellite cells and the effects were cell-autonomous. In the present manuscript, we studied the role of IRE1 and XBP1 in differentiated myofibers where we deleted Ire1 and Xbp1 gene using muscle creatine kinase (MCK)-Cre line. MCK promoter is expressed in differentiated muscle cells only, not in muscle progenitor/satellite cells. We have now discussed this issue in the “Discussion” section of our manuscript (Page # 15, in first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please clarify the rationale for the studies presented in Figure 8 in which mdx mice are crossed with IREmKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>All the muscle regeneration studies (in Figures 1-7) in our manuscript were performed using a model of acute skeletal muscle injury. The mdx mice is a model of chronic muscle degeneration and regeneration. Therefore, to study the role of IRE1 in myofibers during chronic muscle injury and regeneration, we crossed IRE1<sup>mKO</sup> mice with mdx mice. We have now clearly explained this point in the Result section of the manuscript (Page # 12, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please acknowledge and discuss limitations of knockout approaches and comment on the need for gain of function studies in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now discussed this point in the “Discussion” section of the manuscript (Page # 18 and 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please discuss your findings in relationship to those recently reported by He et al. (PMC8409588) using a Pax7 promotor to ablate IRE1.</p></disp-quote><p>He et al. used MyoD1-Cre line (active in myoblasts) not the Pax7 promoter line. We acknowledge that it is important to dissect the role of IRE1 in muscle progenitor cells. This has been further discussed in the “Discussion” section of the manuscript (Page # 16, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please discuss purity of satellite cells (Figure 3E) and caveats for interpreting this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The FACS analysis in Figure 3E is done as another approach to confirm that myofiber-specific ablation of IRE1/ERN1 inhibits satellite cell abundance in injured myofibers. There is always a possibility that the satellite cell population identified by FACS may contain some other cell types as well. However, our results with FACS approach support the immunohistochemical (Figure 3A and 3B) and biochemical studies (Figure 3C and 3D) about the effect of myofiber-specific deletion of IRE1α on satellite cell number in regenerating muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please expand on the rational for performing the double injury experiment in Results. Please quantify data from Figure 1H.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided additional justification for double injury experiment. We have provided quantification of the data of Figure 1H in the new Figures 1I and 1J (Page # 6, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please expand on the discussion of the logic for concluding that gene expression for altered Notch signaling indicates non-cell autonomous mechanisms; please discuss alternative interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we do not have concrete data about this aspect, we have removed the presumption that alteration in Notch signaling is indicative of non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Indeed, it is possible that Notch ligands and receptors are expressed in two different cells of the same cell type within an organ. In addition, factors produced by injured myofibers may also influence Notch signaling in a paracrine fashion. We have now specifically mentioned this aspect in the Discussion section of the manuscript (Page # 17, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. One assumes that unfolded protein responses are increased during tissue regeneration due to the huge increase in demand for synthesis, processing, secretion and signaling via the diverse array of proteins deposited in extracellular matrix during tissue repair, and synthesis of an entirely new set of contractile proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane proteins and machinery for homeostasis (ion channels, adhesion molecules, dystrophin, and others) and that activation of UPR is a physiological response that assures that cells participating in regeneration continue to function efficiently in the face of these many demands. A brief paragraph on this biology from the teleological perspective would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very important point and has been now added to the “Introduction” section of the manuscript (Page # 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Discuss caveats in interpreting the data on XBP1 with regard to effects of the knockout on satellite cell proliferation; add data on this outcome if feasible (Ki67 immunostaining).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have Ki67 immunostaining results for this figure. However, we have now specifically mentioned in the Results section that further experimentation is needed to determine whether XBP1 signaling in myofibers affect proliferation or survival of satellite cells in injured muscle microenvironment (Page # 10, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Please discuss relationships between the Notch and NF-κB pathway studies. Expand on the rational for adding analysis of NF-κB to the outcomes evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point about Notch and NF-κB signaling. We have now added a few sentences and references about signaling cross-talk between Notch and NF-κB pathway in the Results (Page # 11, 12) and the Discussion (Page # 17) sections of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Please respond to the following comments and revise the manuscript as appropriate:</p><p>– Authors did look at different time points (day 5 and day 14) in figure 1, the rest of the data were collected from the one-time point. This is not enough to capture and dynamic changes of muscle stem cell myogenic response.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we have performed histological analysis at day 5 and day 14. Moreover, we have also analyzed muscle regeneration after double injury (second injury after 21 days of first injury). We have chosen day 5 for satellite cell analysis because at this time the number of satellite cell peaks and muscle is undergoing active regeneration. Therefore, it is easy to capture the changes in satellite cell response at day 5. Please note that in vivo EdU incorporation in regenerating myofiber was also performed at day 14 after injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Skeletal muscles are multinucleated, cross-sectional analyses of 10-15 micron muscle sections will not provide a full understanding of changes in myogenesis. In addition, these are myofiber-specific knockouts of IRE1/XBP1 using MCK Cre. Each nucleus in muscle could have a different unfolded protein response and transcriptional regulation during muscle regeneration. Especially, muscle stem cell-derived myonuclei vs. other uninjured myonuclei.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that cross-sectional analyses may not provide full understanding of the myogenesis. However, we have performed many other experiments including Western blot, QRT-PCR, and FACS analysis where whole muscle tissue was used. Results of our histological and biochemical analysis are highly consistent. In addition, we would like to clarify that for our experiments we ensure that &gt; 90% of TA muscle is injured after injection of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and therefore our analysis included mostly regenerating tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Edu+ nuclei should be normalized to total nuclei. More importantly, in Figure 4A, I am not sure why fused myonuclei (central nuclei from muscle stem cells in myofiber) are Edu+. These are post-mitotic nuclei. Authors should test whether these are non-specific binding. Muscle fibers have autofluorescence in the green fluorescence (488nm) emission wavelength.</p></disp-quote><p>We have also now provided percentage of EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei in total nuclei in the TA muscle sections (Figure 4D). These is no non-specific binding because not all the nuclei were EdU<sup>+</sup> in the sections. We had given intraperitoneal injection of EdU at day 3 post-injury. EdU is a thymidine analogue which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. Satellite cells that became activated and entered the cell cycle incorporate EdU. Because myonuclei are postmitotic, EdU<sup>+</sup> nuclei represent satellite cells that became “activated” and have entered the cell cycle. Since only muscle progenitor cells fuse with injured myofibers, the EdU+ nuclei in myofibers is a representation of satellite cell activation/proliferation and fusion. This is a standard approach to measure the proliferation and fusion of satellite cells with regenerating skeletal muscle of mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>I noticed that during revisions, Ire1 was replaced with Ern1. My understanding is that these are two designations for the same gene. Given that Ire1 is used in relevant published literature it makes sense to include this designation in the title and introduction. To aid the reader, please clarify in the text that IRE1 and Ern1 refer to the same gene..</p></disp-quote><p>We used Ern1 in place of IRE1 as suggested by an editorial support staff of <italic>eLife</italic> journal. Ern1 is the gene name of IRE1α and therefore we used Ern1 to refer floxed mice (i.e. Ern1fl/fl) and conditional knockout (Ern1cKO). As you also noted that IRE1 is the most commonly used name of this gene in ER stress field. However, we agree that it is important to specifically mention that IRE1 and Ern1 refer to the same gene. We have now specially mentioned this in the Abstract (page # 2), Introduction (page # 3), and Results (Page # 5) sections of our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
