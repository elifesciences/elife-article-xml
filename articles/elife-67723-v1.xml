During locomotion, the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> spontaneously cycles between forward runs, reversals, and turns with complex but predictable dynamics. Here, we provide insight into these dynamics by demonstrating how RIM interneurons, which are active during reversals, act in two modes to stabilize both forward runs and reversals. By systematically quantifying the roles of RIM outputs during spontaneous behavior, we show that RIM lengthens reversals when depolarized through glutamate and tyramine neurotransmitters and lengthens forward runs when hyperpolarized through its gap junctions. RIM is not merely silent upon hyperpolarization: RIM gap junctions actively reinforce a hyperpolarized state of the reversal circuit. Additionally, the combined outputs of chemical synapses and gap junctions from RIM regulate forward-to-reversal transitions. Our results indicate that multiple classes of RIM synapses create behavioral inertia during spontaneous locomotion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>gap junctions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CIB was an HHMI Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bargmann</surname><given-names>Cornelia I</given-names></name><name><surname>Sordillo</surname><given-names>Aylesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lab support to CIB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sordillo</surname><given-names>Aylesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Precise genetic manipulations demonstrate that a single-neuron class dynamically controls multiple behaviors by engaging different synapses during high- and low-activity states.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons coordinate their activity across networks using a variety of signals: fast chemical transmitters, biogenic amines, neuropeptides, and electrical coupling via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagy et al., 2019</xref>).

Many of its integrating interneurons and motor neurons are active during one or more of three basic motor behaviors – forward runs, reversals, and turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A set of interneurons including AIB, AVA, and RIM are active when animals reverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venkatachalam et al., 2016</xref>); a different set, AIY, RIB, and AVB, are active during forward runs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>); and a set including AIB, RIB, and RIV are active during sharp omega turns, which typically follow a reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Venkatachalam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The functional role of each integrating neuron can be evaluated by considering the neuron’s regulation of specific locomotor features, like reversal speed or turn angle, and its influence on locomotor transitions. The AVA neurons, for example, are backward command neurons that drive reversals; when AVA neurons are optogenetically depolarized, animals reverse, and when AVA neurons are ablated or acutely silenced reversals are short and infrequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pokala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>). Acute silencing of AVA often causes aberrant pauses – thwarted reversals – followed by a turn, indicating that AVA neurons are required for the execution of a reversal, but not for the global dynamics of the forward-reversal-turn sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pokala et al., 2014</xref>). Other neurons in the locomotor circuit are implicated in transition dynamics. For example, altering AIB and RIB activity can change the probability and timing of the reversal-to-turn transition without generating abnormal pause states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pokala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two RIM neurotransmitters affect spontaneous locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RIM synapses with interneurons, motor neurons, and muscle implicated in spontaneous foraging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>).

In addition to tyramine, RIM expresses the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4, identifying it as one of the 38 classes of glutamatergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>). RIM also forms gap junctions with multiple neurons whose activity is associated with reversals (AIB, AVA, AVE), as well as neurons active during pauses (RIS) and forward runs (AIY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>eat-4</italic> and gap junction subunits are broadly expressed throughout the foraging circuit, precluding a simple interpretation of null mutants in these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we used a cell-specific knockout of <italic>eat-4</italic> and a cell-specific gap junction knockdown to isolate the synaptic functions of RIM. By examining behavioral effects of multiple transmitters and gap junctions, we reveal distinct functions of RIM during reversals, when its activity is high, and during forward locomotion, when its activity is low. Notably, our results indicate that while RIM depolarization extends reversals, the propagation of hyperpolarization through RIM gap junctions extends the opposing forward motor state. This work indicates that a single interneuron class employs different classes of synapses to shape mutually exclusive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RIM glutamate and tyramine suppress spontaneous reversals and increase reversal length</title><p>The goal of this work was to understand how RIM influences spontaneous behavioral dynamics, including individual features of locomotion and transitions between motor states.

The RIM glu KO; <italic>tdc-1</italic> double mutant was similar to each single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

These results suggest that RIM glutamate and tyramine are released when RIM is depolarized, as expected, to extend reversals and increase reversal speed. However, the stronger effects of RIM::HisCl indicate that hyperpolarization affects other targets as well.</p><p>A possible explanation for the distinct effects of RIM::HisCl silencing with histamine, versus RIM inactivation with mutations or ablation, is that acute and chronic neuronal silencing have different effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeon et al., 2021</xref>). To examine this possibility, we incubated RIM::HisCl animals on histamine for 48 hr, beginning in the L2 larval stage, and tested their behavior as adults. Chronic histamine treatment caused decreases in reversal frequency, reversal length, and reversal speed that were similar to those in acutely treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that RIM hyperpolarization might suppress reversals by decreasing the activity of the AVA backward command neurons. In order to test this possibility, we examined spontaneous calcium dynamics in AVA after hyperpolarizing RIM::HisCl with histamine. Immobilized animals were exposed to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>-conditioned media, then switched to buffer to induce a local search-like state characterized by sustained epochs of high AVA activity (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Acute RIM silencing decreased the fraction of time that AVA activity was high and reduced spontaneous AVA transitions from the low- to the high-activity state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). AVA activity fell after 30 min in buffer, consistent with a change to a global search-like state; at the same time, the effects of RIM silencing were diminished. These results are consistent with a model in which RIM hyperpolarization acutely suppresses AVA activity. However, as neuronal dynamics in immobilized and freely moving animals are substantially different, they may not fully reflect the effects of RIM hyperpolarization on AVA during off-food foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallinen et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RIM gap junctions stabilize forward runs</title><p>To explain the effect of hyperpolarized RIM neurons, we considered the gap junctions that RIM forms with a variety of other neurons in the local search circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). RIM shares the most gap junctions with AVA and AVE that, like RIM, have high activity during reversals and low activity during forward runs. We hypothesized that RIM gap junctions stabilize the forward motor state by propagating hyperpolarizing currents between RIM and AVA (and possibly other) neurons, thereby preventing their depolarization.</p><p>Invertebrate gap junctions are made up of innexin subunits, which assemble as homo- or heteromers of eight subunits on each of the two connected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burendei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oshima et al., 2016</xref>).

Together with other results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>), our results suggest that hyperpolarization through gap junctions is a recurrent circuit motif in <italic>C. elegans</italic> locomotion.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>RIM synapses generate behavioral inertia and jointly regulate forward-to-reversal transitions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of synaptic regulation of spontaneous behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).

(–) indicates that the synapse decreases the parameter (e.g., RIM tyramine, glutamate, and <italic>unc-1/unc-9</italic> gap junctions all inhibit reversal initiation because the mutants have more spontaneous reversals than wild-type). Additional RIM transmitters inhibit reversals during global search (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and RIC octopamine and gap junctions increase forward and reversal speed, but not reversal initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

These functions all rely on the RIM transmitter tyramine, which also increases the length of reversals evoked by aversive sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkema et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pirri et al., 2009</xref>). We found that RIM glutamate increases spontaneous reversal length and duration, but only during the coupled reversal-omega maneuver, and does not increase reversal speed. Both RIM glutamate and tyramine also extend reversals evoked by acute depolarization.</p><p>Neurons that release both classical transmitters, like glutamate, and biogenic amines, like tyramine, can employ them additively, cooperatively, or distinctly. In mice, dopaminergic neurons that project from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens release both dopamine and glutamate, and either transmitter can support positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zell et al., 2020</xref>). In both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice, the glutamate transporter enhances dopamine loading into synaptic vesicles for a cooperative effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Münster-Wandowski et al., 2016</xref>). At a more subtle level, GABA and dopamine co-released from terminals in the mammalian striatum affect target neurons differently – GABA rapidly inhibits action potentials, while dopamine modulates activity through slower GPCR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). The nonadditive effects of RIM glutamate and tyramine on spontaneous and optogenetically evoked behavioral dynamics in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggest that they act as co-transmitters to cooperatively stabilize reversal states when RIM is depolarized.</p><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> glutamate receptors and tyramine receptors are broadly expressed in the locomotor circuit. Among RIM’s synaptic targets, the AIB and AVA reversal-promoting neurons express excitatory AMPA-type glutamate receptors, as does RIM itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brockie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hart et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>), and glutamate is released onto AVA during reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marvin et al., 2013</xref>). RIM glutamate might reinforce the reversal state by depolarizing AVA, while RIM tyramine inhibits the competing forward state via the tyramine-gated chloride channel LGC-55 on AVB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pirri et al., 2009</xref>). AVA also expresses a glutamate-gated chloride channel, <italic>avr-14,</italic> that inhibits spontaneous reversals; a genetic interaction between <italic>avr-14</italic> and an RIM-specific knockdown of <italic>eat-4</italic> suggests that this receptor could be a target of RIM glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Since all of these receptors coexist in a circuit rich in positive and negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2016</xref>), cell-specific knockouts of receptors as well as neurotransmitters may be needed to define their functions precisely.</p><p>The promoter used to alter RIM activity and signaling, <italic>tdc-1,</italic> is also expressed in RIC neurons. RIC-specific manipulation did not appreciably affect reversal frequency or duration, although it might contribute alongside RIM. RIC neurotransmitters and gap junctions did affect both forward and reversal speed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RIM gap junctions extend forward runs</title><p>For both chemogenetic hyperpolarization and optogenetic depolarization of RIM, the effects on reversal frequency were opposite to those predicted from RIM ablation. Hyperpolarization led to an unanticipated increase in forward run durations, pointing to an active function for RIM when silenced. RIM and its gap junction partners AVA, AVE, and AIB have low activity during forward locomotion; our results suggest that in the hyperpolarized forward state RIM gap junctions inhibit the AVA backward command neurons and possibly others as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kagawa-Nagamura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our conclusion that RIM gap junctions stabilize a hyperpolarized state resonates with previous studies in a different part of the reversal circuit. In addition to their gap junctions with RIM, the AVA neurons form gap junctions with <italic>unc-9</italic>-expressing VA and DA motor neurons that drive backward locomotion. Genetic inactivation of those gap junctions results in defects in forward locomotion and increases calcium levels in AVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>). From this result, the UNC-9-UNC-7 gap junctions were inferred to decrease the activity of AVA based on hyperpolarizing current flow from VA and DA motor neurons. This role is similar to the role we propose for gap junctions between AVA and RIM. In fact, it could be molecularly similar: the <italic>unc-9</italic> innexin expressed in VA/DA neurons and RIM can form heterotypic gap junctions with the <italic>unc-</italic>7 innexin expressed in AVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>). However, unlike the RIM gap junction knockdown, which acts primarily to affect the duration of coordinated forward runs, the AVA-motor neuron knockdown results in highly uncoordinated movement.</p><p>The experiments here, and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kawano et al., 2011</xref>, are limited by the fact that behavior and calcium imaging do not directly measure gap junction conductances. Moreover, direct measurements of gap junctions between AVA and VA5 motor neurons indicate that UNC-9-UNC-7 gap junctions transmit depolarizing current from VA5 to AVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shui et al., 2020</xref>). That said, reconstitution in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes revealed a startling array of rectifying and membrane potential-dependent properties of UNC-9-UNC-7 gap junctions, depending on which of the seven UNC-7 splice forms is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shui et al., 2020</xref>). How innexins and their splice forms contribute to RIM-to-AVA communication, other than requiring <italic>unc-9</italic> function in RIM, remains to be determined.</p><p>Interactions between chemical and electrical synapses play prominent roles in motor circuits including the stomatogastric ganglion of crustaceans, the heartbeat circuit in leeches, and rapid escape circuits in nematodes, arthropods, and fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szczupak, 2016</xref>). Antagonism between electrical and chemical synapses has also been observed in the reversal-to-omega-turn transition in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Although chemical synapses in these circuits can be either excitatory or inhibitory, their electrical synapses have all been thought to be excitatory. We speculate that inhibitory electrical synapses resembling those of RIM gap junctions may emerge as stabilizing elements of other motor circuits with long-lasting, mutually exclusive states.</p><p>Optogenetic depolarization of RIM elicits reversals, an effect that is reciprocal to that of RIM hyperpolarization. While gap junctions from RIM to AVA could be attractive candidates for this activity, the overall increase in reversal frequency upon RIM depolarization was only slightly diminished by the <italic>unc-9</italic> gap junction knockdown and unaffected by RIM chemical transmitters. RIM expresses 11 innexin genes, the most of any neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>). RIM gap junctions may depolarize AVA via innexins that are not affected by the <italic>unc-1(dn</italic>) transgene, such as <italic>inx-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hori et al., 2018</xref>)<italic>,</italic> which synergizes with <italic>unc-9</italic> to promote reversals evoked by optogenetic RIM depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>unc-1(dn</italic>) transgene only partly suppresses the effects of RIM hyperpolarization on reversal frequency, suggesting that <italic>unc-9</italic> may act with additional innexin subunits to propagate RIM hyperpolarization to AVA. Cell-specific knockout of <italic>inx-1</italic> and other innexins should provide a deeper understanding of RIM gap junctions in AVA, AIB, AVE, and other neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>RIM regulates motor state transitions</title><p>The dynamic functions of RIM in spontaneous motor state transitions during local search are regulated by the combined action of tyramine, glutamate, and gap junction signaling. All of these synaptic outputs inhibit reversal initiation, even though RIM glutamate and tyramine stabilize the reversal once it has begun.</p><p>Among the characterized neurons within the foraging circuit, RIM is the only neuron where ablation has opposite effects on the initiation and execution of a behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2005</xref>).

A role for RIM gap junctions in preventing reversals is consistent with its proposed action in the hyperpolarized (forward) state, but tyramine and glutamate release are likely to rely upon depolarization. In one model, a low level of neurotransmitter release during forward-to-reversal transitions might oppose reversal initiation, while higher levels promote it. Low-level release would be consistent with the graded electrical properties of many <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, including motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2009</xref>) and RIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), which can also result in graded transmitter release.</p><p>We note, however, that chronic or developmental effects of tyramine might also contribute to the increased reversal frequency upon RIM ablation, <italic>tdc-1</italic> mutations, or tetanus toxin expression. Tyramine release during learning can lead to long-term circuit remodeling, and tyramine mediates systemic responses to starvation and other stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Rosa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Özbey et al., 2020</xref>).

Now they show that RIM depolarization extends reversals via synaptic (glutamatergic) and secretory (tyraminergic) signaling, while RIM hyperpolarization promotes forward locomotion via electrical signaling through gap junctions. As a result, RIM was shown to act for stabilizing both forward and backward movement, which is important for understanding of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior in general. Upon revision, authors added new experimental results and edited the text to add explanation to clarify the ambiguity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Behavioral control by depolarized and hyperpolarized states of an integrating neuron&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Yuichi Iino as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pointed out by reviewer #2 point 1, evaluation of the effect of manipulation of RIM activity, especially by HisCl, on connected neurons needs to be performed, probably by calcium imaging. A similar test was previously done by Gordus et al., 2015, Figure 4, in odor-stimulated animals. Authors need to do similar experiments but in the absensce of stimuli and in the local and global off-food state, to see how it effects spontaneous rather than evoked ON/OFF state transitions in AIB and AVA, for example.</p><p>2) As pointed out by reviewer #3 point 2, it is essential to clarify the difference between RIM ablation and RIM transient silencing. The HisCl silencing differs from ablation in two ways. One is acute v. chronic perturbation, and the other is hyperpolarization vs. absence of a cell. The authors focus on the latter, but interpretation of the data would change if they found that chronic hyperpolarization did not cause the same effect as acute hyperpolarization, such as compensatory changes in the neuronal functions.</p><p>3) As pointed by reviewer #1, authors' claim that activation by RIM depolarization is through synaptic transmission and inhibition by RIM hyperpolarization is through gap junctions needs to be strengthened. RIM::HisCl prolongs forward movement and reduces reversal rate both in the tdc-1 (Figure 5C) and gap junction knockdown background (Figure 7B), but the his- data in Figure 5C look different from Figure 2B. Authors also claim that reversal length is shortened in the tdc-1/eat-4 mutants (Figure 3), but not in the gap junction knockdown mutant (Figure 6E). However, the wild type data differ considerably between the two figures. More repeated measurements are needed to build confidence in the authors' interpretation of data given that the baselines wander.</p><p>Authors are encouraged to address other comments/questions by the reviewers, such as, why the local/global difference? Why would hyperpolarization propagate more readily than depolarization through the gap junctions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My only concern is that it is still not clear whether the HisCl effect is mediated by gap junctions, because HisCl and unc-1(n494) have just additive effect causing mutual suppression. This is expected to happen also in cases where HisCl and unc-1 act in different pathways. The same ambiguity remains for the ReaChR experiments. Although RIM expresses many gap junction genes and the specificity of unc-1(n494) is not known, inx-1 is a good candidate, because previous study (Hori et al., 2018) suggested that inx-1 is not down regulated by unc-1(n494). inx-1 mutants exist and the defect in locomotion is mild. It is recommended that authors test inx-1 mutant, or inx-1; unc-1(n494), and test the effect of HisCl and ReaChR under these backgrounds. It is noted, however, that considering 11 innexins are expressed in RIM, there is no guarantee that this experiment will turn out informative.</p><p>In figure 2, data show that tdc-1 mutants have higher frequency of reversal, while this effect was not observed in Figure 5C (without His). Is there any speculation by the authors about the cause of this discrepancy?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Physiological effects are not measured in this study, which is a little surprising given the availability of tools. This might be particularly interesting in the experiments related to electrical coupling (HisCl and innexin dominant negative), as it would strengthen the claim that RIM electrical synapses act to suppress activity in reversal command neurons to prolong the forward state. That said, the conclusions stand on the interpretation of the behavioural results.</p><p>2. It is surprising that the electrical coupling between RIM and the reversal circuit appears to play only an inhibitory role. I would have expected the dnUNC-1 experiment to destabilize both forward and reverse states, but this does not appear to be the case, as reversal measurements (speed, length, duration) are unchanged. And then there is the puzzling and weak/differential effect (lines 265-267) of dnUNC-1 in local vs global search. Finally it seems odd that optogenetically induced but not spontaneous reversals are destabilized by disrupting RIM gap junction signaling. I wonder if the authors have thoughts on why this relationship seems to have this directional bias, and what might difference between spontaneous and evoked reversals might explain this.</p><p>3. Figure 2 and 3. Much of the analysis uses a distinction between &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; reversals. This distinction is based on a clearly bimodal distribution (Figure 2C) that supports the idea that these are 2 categorically different behaviors with overlapping length distributions. The use of a cutoff will miscategorize some &quot;long&quot; distributions at the short end of that distribution as &quot;short&quot; and vice versa, but that's fine. What's less clear is that using this cutoff makes sense in the case of some of the mutants/transgenics analyzed. In Figure 2E it appears that in tdc-1 and tdc-1; RIM-Glu-KO animals, long reversals are essentially abolished-the bimodal shape of the WT and RIM-Glu-KO distributions is gone, and the reversals that fall into the &quot;long&quot; category by virtue of being above the WT-based cutoff are the tail of the short reversal distribution (which is masked by the overlap in WT). This seems to make sense with the rev-omega reduction seen when tdc-1 is mutated. I can't tell, but is it plausible that the differences in reversal-omega is sufficiently explained by the fact that all tdc-1 reversals (no matter which side of the cutoff they are on) are behaviorally &quot;short reversals&quot;? I don't think this raises concerns about the major conclusions of the paper, but I am wondering if there is an analysis approach that considers the fit of the data to one or two distributions, and whether it might simplify the interpretation of some of the</p><p>analysis.</p><p>4. Figure 4. With the above in mind, seeing the full distribution of reversal lengths in Figure 4 would be instructive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript sets the stage for two potentially exciting discoveries. The first is that RIMs use tyraminergic and glutamatergic co-transmission to control foraging. Because VGLUT is intertwined with monoamine signaling, this point demands another experiment to conclusively demonstrate that glutamate from RIMs is important for RIM control of foraging. The second is that RIMs have separable functions when depolarized and hyperpolarized. The model presented predicts that chronic hyperpolarization will have effects similar to acute hyperpolarization. In addition to testing the model, it will build confidence to see that two different methods to hyperpolarize RIMs cause similar effects on foraging behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67723.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As pointed out by reviewer #2 point 1, evaluation of the effect of manipulation of RIM activity, especially by HisCl, on connected neurons needs to be performed, probably by calcium imaging.

As requested, we imaged spontaneous calcium transients in AVA neurons in RIM::HisCl animals, which were immobilized in a configuration similar to the one in the Gordus paper referenced by the reviewer. We used immobilized animals because the results are quantitatively reproducible, and we and others have experience in conducting and interpreting them.</p><p>High AVA activity is a proxy for the reversal state. To generate a state analogous to local search, we switched the immobilized animals from bacteria-conditioned medium to buffer. Over a 30-minute period in buffer, the fraction of time animals spent in a high AVA activity state decreased, as predicted if features of local and global search are represented in these animals.</p><p>Hyperpolarizing RIM with RIM::HisCl led to the following changes (1) during the “local search” interval, the fraction of time animals spent in a high AVA activity state was reduced to the level appropriate for “global search” (2) during “local search”, the number of transitions from a low to a high AVA activity state was reduced. These results are consistent with the behavioral results indicating that RIM::HisCl reduces the duration and frequency of reversals during local search (Figure 5A-C). Notably, AVA activity in the “global search” period was less affected, in agreement with the behavioral effects of RIM::HisCl.</p><p>We did not examine AIB calcium responses, because AIB activity is often uncoupled from that of RIM and AVA, and is correlated with turning states as well as reversals (Gordus et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2020), so it would be difficult to interpret these results.</p><p>In summary, these imaging results support our behavioral results and suggest that silencing RIM suppresses reversals by reducing AVA activity. However, it is worth noting that immobilization alters neuronal dynamics in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Hallinen et al., 2021). Imaging freely-moving animals would be a more definitive experiment, but those methods are still in development (in a number of labs), and establishing and validating them is beyond the scope of this paper. We include a statement of this limitation in the revised paper (p. 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As pointed out by reviewer #3 point 2, it is essential to clarify the difference between RIM ablation and RIM transient silencing. The HisCl silencing differs from ablation in two ways. One is acute v. chronic perturbation, and the other is hyperpolarization vs. absence of a cell. The authors focus on the latter, but interpretation of the data would change if they found that chronic hyperpolarization did not cause the same effect as acute hyperpolarization, such as compensatory changes in the neuronal functions.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, there can be differences between acute and chronic neuronal inactivation. Indeed, a recent paper identifies a <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory circuit in which chronic silencing results in functional compensation, masking the effects of acute silencing (Yeon et al., 2021). To address this point, we conducted experiments in which we chronically silenced RIM for 48 hours using the RIM::HisCl system, and then tested the animals for behavior. We observed very similar effects of chronic and acute RIM silencing on local search behavior, including the unexpected decrease in reversal frequency as well as the expected decrease in reversal duration (now added as Figure 5F-5H). These results support the interpretation that RIM silencing is different from RIM ablation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As pointed by reviewer #1, authors' claim that activation by RIM depolarization is through synaptic transmission and inhibition by RIM hyperpolarization is through gap junctions needs to be strengthened. RIM::HisCl prolongs forward movement and reduces reversal rate both in the tdc-1 (Figure 5C) and gap junction knockdown background (Figure 7B), but the his- data in Figure 5C look different from Figure 2B. Authors also claim that reversal length is shortened in the tdc-1/eat-4 mutants (Figure 3), but not in the gap junction knockdown mutant (Figure 6E). However, the wild type data differ considerably between the two figures. More repeated measurements are needed to build confidence in the authors' interpretation of data given that the baselines wander.</p></disp-quote><p>Technical issue: As noted by Reviewer #3, we conducted all experiments together with controls that were matched for genetic background and co-injected plasmids. Different wild-type control strains were used in Figures 2 and 3 (<italic>tdc-1p</italic>::<italic>nFLP, elt-2p</italic>::nGFP<italic>)</italic> versus Figure 5 and 7 (<italic>tdc-1p</italic>::HisCl::SL2::mCherry<italic>)</italic> and Figure 6 <italic>(unc-122p</italic>::GFP<italic>)</italic>, as described in Supplementary File 1, Table S1, strain details. These differences, plus small day-to-day variation between experiments (also noted in López-Cruz et al., 2019 and Zhao et al., 2003), are the likely source of the differences in baseline that Reviewer #1 noted. We clarify that point on page 5 of the text.</p><p>We performed additional repetitions of the acute histamine silencing experiments, and obtained the same results (i.e. Figures 5C-E and 7B-C now include more replicates). Additionally, the new Figure 5 includes a chronic silencing experiment, which repeats the results of acute silencing and also includes recovery after removal from histamine (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Interpretation/discussion, Reversal length in Figure 3 vs Figure 6E: Comparing reversal measures, there is, in fact, a small decrease in reversal length in the gap junction knockdown (0.11), which narrowly missed our threshold for discussion (0.15) but was smaller than the decrease in synaptic mutants (0.20-0.46). The effect of the gap junction knockdown was repeated in separate experiments in Figure 6 —figure supplement 2, with a slightly larger effect (0.16), and was additive with the synaptic mutants. In addition, reversals induced by optogenetic activation of RIM are shorter in the gap junction knockdown (Figure 7G). We changed the language on page 11 to indicate that the gap junction knockdown affected reversal length, but to a lesser extent than synaptic mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors are encouraged to address other comments/questions by the reviewers, such as, why the local/global difference?

We agree that <italic>inx-1</italic> is a strong candidate to mediate the remaining effect. In a recent paper, Li et al., (2020) showed that <italic>inx-1; unc-9</italic> double mutants are defective in reversal initiation upon acute RIM depolarization, but single mutants are not. These results match our single mutant knockdown in Figure 7F, and support the model that <italic>inx-1</italic> (<italic>unc-1(dn)</italic>-resistant) and <italic>unc-9 (unc-1(dn)-</italic>sensitive) gap junctions both propagate depolarizing RIM signals to drive reversals. At the same time, the complementary value of our experiment is the ability to manipulate one neuron, RIM, as most gap junction subunits are expressed in many cells and could be affecting multiple parts of the circuit. We currently lack reagents for cell-specific knockout of <italic>inx-1.</italic> We now clarify these points on page 16 and cite the Li paper for the possible contribution of <italic>inx-1.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure 2, data show that tdc-1 mutants have higher frequency of reversal, while this effect was not observed in Figure 5C (without His).

Why aren’t reversal states shorter in the gap junction knockdown? In fact, there was a small decrease in reversal length in the gap junction knockdown (0.11), which narrowly missed our threshold for discussion (0.15) but was smaller than the decrease in synaptic mutants (0.20-0.46). The result was reproducible in a different strain background, where the effect size was slightly greater (0.16; Figure 6 —figure supplement 2). That matches the observation that the reversals induced by optogenetic activation of RIM are shorter in the gap junction knockdown (Figure 7G). We changed the language on page 11 to say that the effect of the gap junction knockdown on reversal length was less than that of the synaptic mutants. We also note that RIM expresses genes for 11 innexins, and it is possible that other innexins propagate depolarizing currents to a greater extent than UNC-9. For example, <italic>inx-1</italic> is resistant to the <italic>unc-1(n494)</italic> dominant negative transgene (Hori et al., 2018) and acts in parallel with <italic>unc-9</italic> to propagate RIM depolarization (Li et al., 2020). We now make these points on page 16.</p><p>As the reviewer notes, we see evidence that RIM gap junctions propagate depolarizing currents in the optogenetic experiments in Figure 7F-G. First, reversals are invoked less efficiently during global search in <italic>unc-1(dn)</italic> gap junction knockdowns, and second, all evoked reversals are shorter. At this point we can only speculate on the difference between spontaneous and evoked reversals, and local versus global search reversals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
