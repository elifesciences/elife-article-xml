functional heart repair following myocardial infarction. However, it is unclear whether the effects of these mitogens are species-specific and how they directly compare in the same cardiac setting. Here, we examined how CM-specific lentiviral expression of various candidate mitogens affects human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs) and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) in vitro. In 2D-cultured CMs from both species, and in highly mature 3D-engineered cardiac tissues generated from NRVMs, a constitutively active mutant form of the human gene Erbb2 (cahErbb2) was the most potent tested mitogen. Persistent expression of cahErbb2 induced CM proliferation, sarcomere loss, and remodeling of tissue structure and function, which were attenuated by small molecule inhibitors of Erk signaling. These results suggest transient activation of Erbb2/Erk axis in CMs as a potential strategy for regenerative heart repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adult mammalian heart is composed primarily of post-mitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mollova et al., 2013</xref>). Due to an apparent lack of resident stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Berlo et al., 2014</xref>), the heart is unable to replace lost CMs following myocardial infarction (MI), and instead undergoes fibroblast-mediated scarring, resulting in a decline in cardiac function. One potential approach to regenerate the heart following MI is to stimulate the proliferation of endogenous CMs by gene therapy targeting cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leach and Martin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohamed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tzahor and Poss, 2017</xref>). While inducing adult CM proliferation is only the first step toward achieving efficient cardiac repair post-MI, it is arguably the most challenging and important one. A major question in the field, however, is that gene or pathway activation in particular is optimal for inducing human CM proliferation and restoration of function.</p><p>Several approaches involving increased expression of cell cycle-related proteins and modulation of the Hippo, neuregulin (Nrg1), or Wnt signaling pathways have been shown to generate robust proliferative responses in zebrafish and rodent CMs. Specifically, overexpression of Cyclin D2 alone or a combination of Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), CDK4, Cyclin B1, and Cyclin D1 promoted cell cycle activation in post-mitotic mouse, rat, and human CMs in vitro and in mouse hearts in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohamed et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Hippo pathway modulation via overexpression of constitutively active (ca) Yap variants (incapable of being phosphorylated and degraded) led to robust proliferative responses in vitro and in vivo through chromatin alteration surrounding proliferation-inducing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monroe et al., 2019</xref>). The mitogen Nrg1 induced CM proliferation in zebrafish through activation of its co-receptor, Erbb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gemberling et al., 2015</xref>), and overexpression of caErbb2 promoted CM proliferation in adult mice by inducing CM dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DâUva et al., 2015</xref>), possibly via Yap activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharonov et al., 2020</xref>). Wnt stimulation by small-molecule inhibition of GSK3Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buikema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mills et al., 2019</xref>) or induction of Î²-catenin release from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2018</xref>) induced proliferation in human CMs in vitro. Yet, there have been no studies that directly compare the pro-proliferative capacity of these different mitogenic pathways in parallel.</p><p>In this report, we directly compared the effects of manipulating different mitogenic pathways on in vitro cell cycle activation in CMs from various species and maturation levels, including 2D monolayer cultures of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CMs (hiPSC-CMs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shadrin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as functional 3D engineered NRVM tissues (cardiobundles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Helfer and Bursac, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>). We then probed the mechanisms underlying the observed mitogenic responses. We found that the human, but not rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DâUva et al., 2015</xref>), caErbb2 ortholog (cahErbb2) induced the most robust proliferative effects in hiPSC-CMs and NRVMs, which were associated with significant changes in CM morphology and function and mediated via upregulation of the Erk signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lentiviral expression of mitogens promotes hiPSC-CM proliferation without inducing apoptosis</title><p>Lentiviral vectors (LVs) were designed with the MHCK7 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salva et al., 2007</xref>) driving muscle-specific expression of mitogens together with a mCherry reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and used to transduce hiPSC-CMs and NRVMs. We applied a flow cytometry strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) validated using an established hiPSC-CM mitogen (GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buikema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mills et al., 2019</xref>) to determine whether an LV-induced mitogen expression resulted in cell cycle activation or apoptosis specifically in mCherry-labeled CMs. Compared to LV-driven expression of mCherry only, hiPSC-CMs transduced with LVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) encoding caCtnnb1 (ca Î²-catenin), Ccnd2 (Cyclin D2), carErbb2, or cahErbb2, but not caYap8SA, exhibited significantly higher incorporation of 5-ethynyl-2â²-deoxyuridine (EdU), indicating greater DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Increased numbers of CMs expressing phosphorylated histone H3 (H3P), an indicator of the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle, were also found with cahErbb2, caCtnnb1, and Ccnd2 transduction, with cahErbb2 appearing to have the most robust effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since cultured hiPSC-CMs are relatively immature, we also assessed whether cahErbb2 treatment would increase cell cycle activity in hiPSC-CMs cultured in a maturation medium (MM) shown to reduce proliferation and promote contractile function in human CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mills et al., 2017</xref>). While the MM reduced EdU incorporation in CMs compared to our standard culture medium, cahErbb2 LV treatment in MM consistently increased EdU incorporation and H3P expression in CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, we observed comparable percentages of diploid and polyploid hiPSC-CMs between control and LV-treated total or EdU<sup>+</sup> CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Collectively, these results showed that hiPSC-CMs with LV-mediated expression of cahErbb2, caCtnnb1, and Ccnd2 were induced to enter DNA synthesis and mitotic phases of the cell cycle at a higher rate than control hiPSC-CMs, and continued to undergo successful cytokinesis. Additionally, from cleaved caspase-3 (Cc3) analysis, transduced mitogens did not increase CM apoptosis, with caYap8SA having an anti-apoptotic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, both increased DNA synthesis and mitosis as well as pro-apoptotic effects were found with the application of CHIR99021 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mills et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, increased EdU incorporation with no change in CM polyploidy or apoptosis upon transduction with caCtnnb1, Ccnd2, carErbb2, or cahErbb2 LVs indicated induced CM proliferation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LV-delivered mitogens drive hiPSC-CM proliferation in monolayers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental design in hiPSC-CM monolayers.

Because caYap8SA cannot be phosphorylated and degraded, these findings may be explained by the activation of a negative feedback loop that degraded endogenous Yap protein to compensate for caYap8SA overexpression, which in turn attenuated the mitogenic effects in caYap8SA-transduced hiPSC-CMs. We further assessed caCtnnb1-transduced hiPSC-CMs and found that the gene expression of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> was increased, but also noted an increased expression of <italic>Lef1</italic> and <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), potentially signifying the presence of a Wnt pathway-mediated negative feedback inhibitory to <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernkopf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lustig et al., 2002</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, we also observed no difference in Ctnnb1 protein expression between control and transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Similar to caYap8SA and caCtnnb1, we further found increased Ccnd2 gene but not protein expression in Ccnd2-transduced hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M and N</xref>). Still, immunostaining analysis revealed that Ccnd2-transduced hiPSC-CMs exhibited higher nuclear abundance of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O and P</xref>), which likely contributed to the observed increase in CM cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, while these results suggest that LV-mediated expressions of various mitogens in hiPSC-CMs can induce post-transcriptional negative feedback responses to limit protein overexpression, mechanistic underpinnings of these processes remain to be additionally studied.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>cahErbb2 induces increased cell cycle activity in NRVM monolayers associated with sarcomere disassembly</title><p>To further compare the effects of studied mitogens in CMs from different species and maturity levels, we utilized cultured NRVMs. Specifically, NRVMs were transduced with the LVs the day of seeding and analyzed by flow cytometry at 14 days of monolayer culture, 2 days after EdU application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that expression of cahErbb2 but not other mitogens resulted in increased EdU incorporation in NRVMs, while both Ccnd2 and cahErbb2 yielded increased H3P expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). However, NRVMs transduced with some of the mitogens showed a significantly decreased fraction of diploid and increased fraction of polyploid CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that post-12 days of NRVM culture LV-induced cycling events led to CM polyploidization rather than cytokinesis, in contrast to the results in hiPSC-CMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This inference was supported by the finding that compared to control LV, the diploid fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup> NRVMs was significantly decreased and polyploid fraction significantly increased in all LV-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken together, these results revealed that by 14 days of 2D NRVM culture, cahErbb2 was still able to promote cell cycle entry and mitosis, while all tested mitogens led to increased NRVM polyploidy. Interestingly, in both NRVMs and hiPSC-CMs, LV expression of cahErbb2, but not other mitogens, also induced sarcomere disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) without altering expression of sarcomeric genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) or non-myocyte abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

This loss of maximum active force in cahErbb2 cardiobundles was accompanied by slower twitch kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A-C</xref>), as well as a significant increase in passive tension that indicated increased tissue stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We then confirmed that reduced contractile force generation due to cahErbb2 expression was also characteristic of mechanically unloaded tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D, E</xref>). To examine the potential causes of cahErbb2-induced increase in stiffness, we first generated tissues with 1.4Ã NRVM/hydrogel volume which exhibited an increased size and necrotic core similar to those of cahErbb2 cardiobundles, however, this did not lead to larger passive tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We compared the 1.4Ã tissues to cahErbb2 tissues and found that both the tissue size and acellular area within the tissues were similar, which suggests that a larger tissue alone does not cause greatly increased passive tension as seen with cahErbb2 cardiobundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). We further examined collagen I in cross-sections of cahErbb2 cardiobundles and found similar abundance to that of control tissues, indicating that increased tissue stiffness was not contributed by significant ECM accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>).

Previously, the expression of rat caErbb2 in mouse CMs led to sarcomere disassembly in vitro and in vivo, while downstream Erk and Akt signaling were found to be the primary drivers of carErbb2-induced CM cell cycle activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DâUva et al., 2015</xref>). In hiPSC-CMs in our study, cahErbb2 but not carErbb2 expression resulted in increased pErk and Erk abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, previously reported pAkt increase was not observed for either rat or human caErbb2 expression, with carErbb2 expression reducing total Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then measured the relative gene expression of Erk downstream targets indicative of increased Erk activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagle et al., 2018</xref>). Whereas cahErbb2 expression robustly increased transcription of multiple Erk targets, carErbb2 expression caused no such increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Consistent with the cahErbb2-induced Erk activation, we also observed an increase in nuclear localization of Erk protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and further confirmed Erk activation by analyzing the expression of additional gene targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In contrast to Erk, Akt localization was unaffected by cahErbb2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, cahErbb2 but not carErbb2 also increased the abundance of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) in Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which was further confirmed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). pS6 is usually considered as a downstream target of mTOR, which can be activated by stimulation of Akt or Erk pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Warfel et al., 2011</xref>).

The increased Erk activity in cahErbb2-transduced CMs appeared to both protect against the Erki/Meki-induced apoptosis and necessitate higher inhibitor doses to maximally block EdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then tested whether the inhibition of Erk signaling pathway can prevent cahErbb2-induced effects in NRVM cardiobundles by applying 100 nM Erki or 100 nM Meki between days 8 and 14 of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In this in vitro study, we directly compared a panel of lentivirally delivered mitogens to identify those capable of inducing the most potent and conserved pro-proliferative effects in CMs from different species, maturation stages, and culture environments. We found that constitutively active human Erbb2 induced the most robust and consistent proliferative response in hiPSC-CMs and NRVMs among rat caErbb2, human caCtnnb1, human Ccnd2, and human caYap8SA. Interestingly, we found evidence for the existence of negative post-transcriptional feedbacks on expression of mitogen proteins following transduction with caYap8SA, caCtnnb1, or Ccnd2 LVs, which appeared strongest in caYap8SA-transduced rat and human CMs where we did not find increased EdU incorporation. A negative feedback mechanism in the Hippo pathway mediated by Lats1/2 upregulation was previously reported when constitutively active Yap was expressed or Sav1 was deleted in mice and cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moroishi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless, our findings appear to contradict the potent proliferative effects of constitutively active Yap mutants observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mills et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monroe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">von Gise et al., 2012</xref>), which may be attributable to differences in species and mechanical environment of studied CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benham-Pyle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Panciera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), and will require further investigations.</p><p>Although cahErbb2 caused strong mitogenic effects in CMs, we suspect that this did not translate to improved contractile function in our cardiobundle system for two reasons. First, cell survival in the avascular cardiobundles relies on the ability of oxygen and nutrients to diffuse from the surface to the center of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bursac et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laschke and Menger, 2016</xref>). This limits the growth of metabolically active, functional myocardium and causes the development of central necrotic core, as observed in both cahErbb2-transduced and control, larger-volume tissues. Second, the LV-induced, continuous cahErbb2 expression in cardiobundles not only produces persistent proliferative effects, but also chronically over-activates Erk pathway leading to sarcomere disorganization and increased tissue stiffness. The partial functional rescue with Erki/Meki treatment suggests that in the vascularized myocardium in vivo, temporally controlled rather than the continuous expression of cahErbb2 could be a strategy to induce both transient CM hyperplasia and, ultimately, following cahErbb2 inactivation, enhanced myocardial function.</p><p>We were surprised to find that only the human but not rat ortholog of caErbb2 was able to activate Erk signaling in hCMs and NRVMs, especially considering the rat Erbb2-V663E and human Erbb2-V659E activating mutations are both located in the transmembrane domain and known to promote homo- and hetero-dimerizations of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ou et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, rat caErbb2 has been shown to drive CM dedifferentiation, proliferation, and hypertrophy when inducibly expressed in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharonov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DâUva et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, persistent cahErbb2 expression and downstream Erk activation induced not only CM cycling but also structural (sarcomere disassembly and fibroblast accumulation) and functional (reduced contractile force and increased stiffness) deficits, which in several aspects resembled in vivo pathologic cardiac remodeling mediated by hyperactive Erk signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallo et al., 2019</xref>). While we noticed increased <italic>Runx1</italic> expression in cahErbb2-transduced hiPSC-CMs, we did not observe a gene expression pattern characteristic of sustained CM de-differentiation as <italic>Myh6, Myh7,</italic> and <italic>Tnnt2</italic> levels remained unchanged. Although our in vitro systems lack the complexity of an in vivo cardiac milieu (e.g., cellular diversity and related signaling cross-talk), it is possible that the effects of caErbb2 expression in CMs may be species or maturation level-dependent. Further work will be needed to explore if human caErbb2 or its downstream effectors can generate comparable or more potent therapeutic effects than those of rat caErbb2 in both small and large animal

animal procedures were performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. NRVMs were isolated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, ventricles were harvested from P2 male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups, minced finely, and pooled before overnight trypsin incubation at 4Â°C. The following day, the minced ventricular tissue was subjected to several collagenase digestions and filtering steps to yield single-cell suspension. Cells were pre-plated for 1 hr to remove non-myocytes and enrich the NRVM population. The non-adherent cells were resuspended in 2D cardiac medium (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], penicillin (5 U/ml), and vitamin B12 (2 Âµg/ml)) and plated onto fibronectin-coated Aclar coverslips at a density of 5Ã 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well of a 12-well plate. Twenty-four hours following plating, the medium was changed to only include 5% FBS and full media changes were performed every other day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cardiobundle fabrication and 3D culture</title><p>NRVM cardiobundles were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Helfer and Bursac, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackman et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, 6.5Ã10<sup>5</sup> freshly isolated NRVMs were mixed with a fibrin-based hydrogel (2.5 mg/ml fibrinogen, 1 U/ml thrombin, and 10% v/v/Matrigel) and cast in PDMS tissue molds with two 2 mmÃ7 mm troughs and a porous nylon frame. In experiments testing, the effects of increased cell/hydrogel volume, our standard cell number and gel volume were scaled up by 1.4-fold. The molds containing the hydrogel-cell mixture were incubated at 4Â°C for 45 min to allow the hydrogel to fully polymerize and attach to the nylon frame. Tissues were then immersed in 3D cardiac medium (Low Glucose DMEM, 10% horse serum, 1% chick embryo extract, aminocaproic acid [1 mg/ml], L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate [50 Âµg/ml], penicillin [5 U/ml], and vitamin B12 [2 Âµg/ml]). The following day, the cardiobundles on frames were carefully removed from the molds and cultured in free-floating dynamic conditions on a rocker. Full media changes of 2 ml per well were performed every other day for 14 days.</p><p>For experiments utilizing small molecule inhibitors of Erk or Mek, we used SCH772984 (Erki) or PD0325901 (Meki). Both inhibitors were applied from days 8 to 14 after tissue generation at 100 nM, and were compared to a DMSO vehicle control.

All hiPSC-CM experiments were performed using DU11 hiPSCs between passages 24 and 45. Mycoplasma testing was done routinely with commercially available testing kits (MycoAlert, Lonza).</p><p>hiPSCs were differentiated into CMs via small-molecule-based modulation of Wnt signaling, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lian et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, DU11 hiPSCs were dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated into ESC-Matrigel coated dishes at 4Ã10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> with 5 ÂµM Y27632 (ROCK inhibitor). Maintenance media was changed daily prior to differentiation. To induce cardiac differentiation (day 0), cells were incubated in 6 Î¼M CHIR99021 in RPMI-1640 with B27(â) insulin. Exactly 48 h later, CHIR was removed and replaced with basal RPMI/B27(â) medium. On day 3, the cells were incubated in RB- containing 5 uM IWR-1, which was switched to basal RPMI/B27(â) medium on day 5. From days 7 to 10, the cells were cultured in RPMI/B27(+)-insulin with media changed every 2â3 days. Spontaneous contractions of hiPSC-CMs started on days 7â10 of differentiation. Differentiating CM cultures were purified via metabolic selection between days 10 and 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tohyama et al., 2013</xref>), by incubation in âno glucoseâ medium (glucose-free RPMI supplemented with 4 mM lactate, 0.5 mg/ml recombinant human albumin, and 213 Î¼g/ml L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate) for 48 h. At the end of the selection period, cultures were dissociated into single cells using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA followed by quenching with stop buffer (DMEM, 20% FBS, 20 Î¼g/ml DNAse I [Millipore 260913]) and replated onto fresh Matrigel-coated dishes to remove dead cells and debris. Cells were then maintained in our âstandardâ media consisting of RPMI/B27(+)-insulin with 2 mg/ml aminocaproic acid, 50 Î¼g/ml L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, 0.45 Î¼M 1-thioglycerol, 1% pen/strep, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1% sodium pyruvate. hiPSC-CM cultures with greater than 90% cTnT positive cells as measured by flow cytometry were used for all experiments.

PCR primers were designed to add complementary restriction site overhangs to the gene inserts which were also present in the MHCK7-MCS-P2A-mCherry backbone used for cloning the constructs. Standard restriction cloning was used to insert the gene fragments. Sanger sequencing was performed to ensure maintenance of reading frame and correct sequence.

Briefly, Hek293T cells were cultured in high glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Plasmids (Construct plasmid, Pax2, and VSVG) were purified using midiprep before transfection into Hek293T cells at 65â75% confluence using Jetprime transfection reagent. Medium was changed 16 hr following transfection, and medium containing virus was harvested 3â4 days following initial transfection. Virus was purified by precipitation using 3 volumes medium to 1 volume LentiX-Concentrator at 4Â°C overnight, then pelleted by centrifugation at 1500Ã<italic>g</italic> for 45 min at 4Â°C. Precipitated virus was aliquoted and stored at â80Â°C before use.</p><p>For experiments investigating the effects of the LVs on hiPSC-CM monolayers, cells were transduced with the LVs 17â20 days following the initiation of differentiation and were maintained for 1 week to allow the LVs to reach maximal expression before terminal analysis. For NRVM monolayer experiments, viral suspension was added at the time of cell plating. For NRVM cardiobundle experiments, LVs were added to the hydrogel-cell mixture at the time of cardiobundle fabrication to yield transduction efficiency between 45% and 80%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>NRVM or hiPSC-CM monolayers were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then dissociated using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37Â°C for 3 min, upon which monolayers were triturated several times to yield a single-cell suspension. Trypsin was quenched with DMEM/F12 containing 20% FBS and 20 Âµg/ml DNase I. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 300Ã<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, then resuspended in % paraformaldehyde (PFA) diluted in PBS. Cells were incubated in PFA for 10 min at room temperature (RT), centrifuged again, then resuspended in PBS containing 5% FBS for storage at 4Â°C.</p><p>Cells were stained for flow cytometry after centrifugation at 300Ã<italic>g</italic> for 5 min to remove storage medium. If EdU staining was performed, cells were incubated with the EdU flow cytometry staining cocktail as per the manufacturerâs protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated in the dark for 30 min, then washed 2Ã by addition of PBS followed by centrifugation. Antibody staining was performed after EdU staining. For antibody staining, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Triton-X 100, and 0.02% Azide). Primary antibodies including an isotype control were diluted in FACS buffer and incubated for 1 hr on ice. Cells were washed 2Ã with FACS buffer before addition of secondary antibodies and Hoechst diluted in FACS buffer. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 min at RT.

Primary antibody sources and dilutions are indicated in the Key Resources Table. The monolayers were washed with PBS before incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:1000 and Hoechst at 1:200 in antibody buffer for 1 hr. Monolayer samples were mounted using Fluoromount-G Mounting Medium and imaged using an Andor Dragonfly spinning disk confocal microscope.</p><p>Engineered cardiobundles were fixed with 2% v/v PFA on a rocking platform at 4Â°C overnight. For cross-sectional analysis, the fixed tissues were suspended in OCT and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen until solidified. The frozen tissue blocks were sectioned using a cryostat (Leica) into 10 Âµm sections. Cardiobundle cross-sections were blocked in antibody buffer for two hours at RT. Whole bundles for longitudinal images were blocked overnight at 4Â°C. All samples were incubated with primary antibodies at 4Â°C overnight in antibody buffer. Primary antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions in the Key Resources Table. Samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:1000 and Hoechst 1:200 in antibody buffer for 2.5 hr at RT for cross-sections and overnight at 4Â°C for whole bundles.

In 37Â°C Tyrodeâs solution, the cardiobundle was pinned to chamber at one end and a PDMS float connected to a linear actuator controlled by Labview software at the other end. Using platinum electrodes, a 90 V biphasic electrical pulse was applied for 5 ms at a 2 Hz rate to induce contractions. The force measurements were performed at the ends of 4% stretch steps lasting 45 s (0% stretch being the culture length of 7 mm), until 16% stretch was reached. Maximum twitch amplitude (occurring anywhere between 4% and 12% stretch), passive force-length curves, and parameters of twitch kinetics were derived as previously described using custom Matlab software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madden et al., 2015</xref>). For contractile force measurements under mechanically unloaded conditions, tissues were relaxed between 0% and â8% stretch to length where passive force became 0, upon which electrically induced contractions were recorded at 2 Hz rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot</title><p>To isolate total protein from hiPSC-CM samples, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS before lysis with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich P8340) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich P0044).

Supernatants were measured using BCA assay to determine total protein concentration. About 30 Âµg of samples were run on 4â12% gradient gels with Tris-Glycine-SDS running buffer at 100 V for 1â1.5 hr depending on the size of proteins being separated. Proteins were transferred to 0.45 Âµm PVDF membranes for Western blot at 4Â°C at 60 V for 2 hr. Membranes were blocked overnight in 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Membranes were cut such that multiple size proteins could be blotted from the same membranes. Primary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA and incubated with membranes overnight at 4Â°C. Membranes were washed 3Ã with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) before incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were washed 3Ã with TBS-T before incubation in SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate for 5 min. Membranes were imaged with a Biorad ChemiDoc using signal accumulation mode for up to 2 min. If the protein of interest was similar in size to the housekeeping gene (GAPDH), membranes were stripped following exposure for 10 min using Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer. Membranes were then reblocked and re-probed as indicated above. Antibodies and their dilutions can be found in the Materials and methods section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software. Statistical details can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Outliers were identified and removed using GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 ROUT method (Q=1%). Normality testing was done using the Shapiro-Wilk test and testing for equal variances was done using the Brown-Forsythe test. If data was not normally distributed, we performed logarithmic transformations and re-tested for normality and equal variances prior to performing the appropriate statistical test. All experiments were carried out in multiple cell batches. To analyze experiments in which not all mitogen groups were studied simultaneously, we first expressed results relative to Ctrl LV group within each experiment and then compared normalized results among different groups by applying logarithmic transformation followed by the appropriate statistical test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was performed using custom CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>) and FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) macros. Briefly, CellProfiler was used to determine nuclear number as well as vimentin<sup>+</sup> and EdU<sup>+</sup> cells. To quantify nuclear number and EdU+ nuclei, the identify primary objects function was used with global minimum cross entropy thresholding. To quantify vimentin<sup>+</sup> cells, vimentin signal was smoothed using Gaussian filter, thresholded using the minimum cross-entropy function, holes were removed using the remove holes function, and the watershed function was applied for segmentation. Colocalization analysis using the related objects function between vimentin signal and nuclei as well as EdU signal and nuclei was performed to exclude proliferative fibroblasts from cardiomyocyte EdU quantification. A custom FIJI macro using auto-thresholding methods was used to determine cardiobundle F-actin<sup>+</sup> area and total CSA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Specifically, the authors identified a constitutively active mutant form of human Erbb2 as the most potent mitogen, and that its expression determines cardiomyocyte sarcomere loss, cell proliferation, as well as cardiac tissue structure and function in an ERK-dependent manner. The findings presented may facilitate development of regenerative heart repair strategies following myocardial infarction and will be of interest to scientists and clinician-scientists working in the field of myocardial regeneration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Human Erbb2-induced Erk Activity Robustly Stimulates Cycling and Functional Remodeling of Rat and Human Cardiomyocytes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gilles De Keulenaer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1) Use of post-mitotic human CMs, such as metabolically &quot;matured&quot; CMs or EHTs from hiPSC-CMs would add value to the work. These can be obtained using metabolic stimuli as shown by Mills et al. 2017 (PNAS, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707316114).</p><p>2) Although cell cycle activity was clearly induced, no proof of increased cytokinesis has been presented. Is the increase in size of cardiac bundles due to increased number of CMs or increased size of CMs? Both can lead to the development of a necrotic centre as seen in the cahErbb2 overexpressing cardio bundle. The ERK pathway is key mediator of most hypertrophic stimuli and its activation induces CM hypertrophy (see for example the review by Bueno and Molkentin 2002, Circ Res, https://doi.org/10.1161/01.RES.0000038488.38975.1A). Also the Erbb2 ligand Neuregulin-1 has been shown to induce CM hypertrophy (Zurek et al. 2020, Circulation, https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044313).</p><p>Analysis of hypertrophy on either phenotypic or gene expression level in cardiac bundles is needed to exclude hypertrophy as a mechanism behind the increased CSA. For example cross-sectional area of individual cardiomyocytes by using a cell membrane stain combined with a CM marker â or gene expression of hypertrophic markers.</p><p>3) All figures: STDEV should be used instead of SEM. Moreover, violin plots or dot plots should be considered to better visualize the distribution of the data.</p><p>4) Some concerns about statistics, which require clarification:</p><p>i) The N numbers are huge and according to the Table 1 it is unclear if they all indeed represent independent samples. Were several samples from the same differentiations or cell isolations used? One field in a monolayer (Table 1, definition of n in Figures 1J, 1P, 4C, 4E, 4G) should not be considered to represent n=1, if several images were analysed from the same sample and/or if several technical replicates (samples prepared from the same cell isolation or differentiation and treated similarly) were analysed. Similarly, RNA or 10^4 cells from one monolayer do not correspond to n=1, if several technical replicates were used. Only samples from separate differentiations or cell isolations should be considered as representatives of n and the results from technical replicates should be averaged to form the n=1 data.</p><p>ii) Were the data analysed for equal variances before selecting the test (parametric vs. non-parametric)? If not, this should be done and an appropriate test chosen.</p><p>iii) Why did the authors carry out multiple t tests instead of using ANOVA, which is more suitable for multiple comparisons? For example, randomized block ANOVA is a very useful test for example for analysing data for which baseline values may vary between cell preparations (e.g. the percentage of Edu+ cells). In particular, the statistics for data in Figure 5 â Supplemental figure 1, panel B should be corrected. Why have the authors not included the control sample in the statistical analysis? Analysis of the percentage of Edu+ cells (not normalised data) using randomized block ANOVA solves the issue of experiment/cell-preparation-dependent variability in basal levels and the zero variance in normalised data. The data can be presented as is (normalised to control), but statistics should be corrected.</p><p>5) The authors have to be complimented for the high technical quality of their studies. This reviewer does not ask for new experiments, but suggests to underscore the limitations of this study, especially with regards to the observed effects of Erbb2 overexpression.</p><p>i) First, authors indicate that a necrotic core develops in the 3D model (because of extensive proliferation and development of hypoxia in the core); the extent to which the necrotic core contributes to an increased stiffness is undetermined, and should be addressed. Also, authors should discuss whether development of a necrotic core is related to the avascular structure of the 3D model?</p><p>ii) Second, the lentiviral overexpression of ERBB2 is not transient, because it cannot be turned off. Ideally, an on-off system is used so that after the proliferation phase, cardiomyocytes are allowed to redifferentiate and restructure their sarcomeres. No one is going to advocate continuous overexpression of ERBB2 in any tissue. An on-off system would allow the cardiomyocytes to redifferentiate resulting in a level playing field for all vectors. This issue should be better discussed.</p><p>iii) Third, it is not surprising that cardio bundles with the most actively proliferating cardiomyocytes and the most disorganized sarcomeres are less contractile.

As shown in Figure 1 âfigure supplement 3, we found that maturation media reduced the baseline EdU incorporation rate in CMs by half compared to our standard media as well as control media used by Mills et al. Transduction of cahErbb2 in CMs cultured in maturation media significantly increased EdU incorporation and H3P expression compared to transduction of mCherry (control). These results confirmed that mitogenic effects of cahErbb2 are also robust in metabolically matured hiPSC-CMs. In the main text, revisions made in response to reviewersâ comments are highlighted in red. Additional stylistic edits throughout the text were made to improve readability of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Although cell cycle activity was clearly induced, no proof of increased cytokinesis has been presented. Is the increase in size of cardiac bundles due to increased number of CMs or increased size of CMs? Both can lead to the development of a necrotic centre as seen in the cahErbb2 overexpressing cardio bundle. The ERK pathway is key mediator of most hypertrophic stimuli and its activation induces CM hypertrophy (see for example the review by Bueno and Molkentin 2002, Circ Res, https://doi.org/10.1161/01.RES.0000038488.38975.1A). Also the Erbb2 ligand Neuregulin-1 has been shown to induce CM hypertrophy (Zurek et al. 2020, Circulation, https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.044313).</p><p>Analysis of hypertrophy on either phenotypic or gene expression level in cardiac bundles is needed to exclude hypertrophy as a mechanism behind the increased CSA. For example cross-sectional area of individual cardiomyocytes by using a cell membrane stain combined with a CM marker â or gene expression of hypertrophic markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for this insightful comment. While we did not definitively show CM cytokinesis, the polyploid fraction within the hiPSC-CM population was not increased with application of most mitogens (Figure 1D,E), suggesting the cells which incorporated EdU ended up dividing (and re-attaining 2N DNA content) instead of becoming polyploid (having 4N or greater DNA content). In NRVMs the situation is less clear, but we measured the F-actin<sup>+</sup>/vimentin<sup>-</sup> area divided by number of nuclei within this area in cardio bundle cross-sections as a proxy for CM size that we have used in previous publications (e.g., Jackman et al., 2016, <italic>Biomaterials;</italic> Jackman et al. 2018, <italic>Acta Biomaterialia</italic>). This analysis revealed no change in CM size with mitogen expression (new Figure 3F), suggesting that the increase in cardio bundle size for cahErbb2 group was likely caused by an increase in CM numbers rather than the CM size. We also included measurements of relative cell size based on forward scatter data collected in our flow cytometry experiments in hiPSC-CMs and NRVMs (new Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1D-E) which suggested that cahErbb2 does not affect cell size in the monolayer setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All figures: STDEV should be used instead of SEM. Moreover, violin plots or dot plots should be considered to better visualize the distribution of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We converted any remaining bar/line plots to display STDEV rather than SEM, and most bar graphs were converted to box-and-whisker plots to visualize distribution of the data points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some concerns about statistics, which require clarification:</p><p>i) The N numbers are huge and according to the Table 1 it is unclear if they all indeed represent independent samples. Were several samples from the same differentiations or cell isolations used? One field in a monolayer (Table 1, definition of n in Figures 1J, 1P, 4C, 4E, 4G) should not be considered to represent n=1, if several images were analysed from the same sample and/or if several technical replicates (samples prepared from the same cell isolation or differentiation and treated similarly) were analysed. Similarly, RNA or 10^4 cells from one monolayer do not correspond to n=1, if several technical replicates were used. Only samples from separate differentiations or cell isolations should be considered as representatives of n and the results from technical replicates should be averaged to form the n=1 data.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate this comment. We have corrected our mistakes regarding using n=1 to represent images from the same sample and instead have averaged images to generate n=1 per biological replicate; the corrected n values are updated in the supplemental statistics table.</p><p>We also wanted to clarify that for the rest of our studies in both monolayer and cardio bundle experiments, we did not use technical replicates as individual nâs. Experiments were performed in multiple cell batches/differentiations to ensure reproducibility. Within a cell batch/differentiation, we used n=3 monolayer culture wells or tissues that were independently treated with LVs or small molecules and independently assessed thereafter, not n=1 well or tissue that was treated, collected, and assessed multiple times to generate n=3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Were the data analysed for equal variances before selecting the test (parametric vs. non-parametric)? If not, this should be done and an appropriate test chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected our analyses to test for equal variances before selecting the style of ANOVA and, where appropriate, we have used Welchâs ANOVA or Welchâs t test for statistical analysis to account for unequal variances. This information is updated in our new statistics table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Why did the authors carry out multiple t tests instead of using ANOVA, which is more suitable for multiple comparisons? For example, randomized block ANOVA is a very useful test for example for analysing data for which baseline values may vary between cell preparations (e.g. the percentage of Edu+ cells). In particular, the statistics for data in Figure 5 â Supplemental figure 1, panel B should be corrected. Why have the authors not included the control sample in the statistical analysis? Analysis of the percentage of Edu+ cells (not normalised data) using randomized block ANOVA solves the issue of experiment/cell-preparation-dependent variability in basal levels and the zero variance in normalised data. The data can be presented as is (normalised to control), but statistics should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have now applied ANOVA instead of multiple t-tests for our qPCR and western blot data analyses. We omitted to include that our multiple t-tests had included p value correction for multiple comparison, so revising the statistical tests did not affect our conclusions. The corrected statistical test information can be now found in our updated statistics table; we ran ANOVAs to ensure proper correction for multiple comparisons as suggested. We also corrected our figure to include the control sample in the graph for Figure 5 â supplemental figure 1 as suggested.</p><p>Through our analysis of the normalized data, we found they achieved a normal distribution following logarithmic transformation and therefore we determined that analysis of the normalized data was appropriate for our statistical analysis. We then applied Brown-Forsythe tests and if variance was found to be significantly different between groups, we used Welchâs ANOVA with Dunnett T3 correction for multiple comparisons rather than the standard ANOVA method. This information is included in our updated statistics table and statistical analysis section in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors have to be complimented for the high technical quality of their studies. This reviewer does not ask for new experiments, but suggests to underscore the limitations of this study, especially with regards to the observed effects of Erbb2 overexpression.</p><p>i) First, authors indicate that a necrotic core develops in the 3D model (because of extensive proliferation and development of hypoxia in the core); the extent to which the necrotic core contributes to an increased stiffness is undetermined, and should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we generated cardio bundles using increased hydrogel volume and cell number, which resulted in a larger tissue size and formation of acellular core (new Figure 3 âfigure supplement 3A-F) like those observed in cahErbb2-expressing cardio bundles. However, this increase in tissue size and core formation did not significantly alter passive force of the cardio bundles, in contrast to cahErbb2 expression that yielded 8-fold higher passive forces (Figure 3H). This suggested to us that cahErbb2-expressing cardio bundles have increased stiffness not due to the presence of acellular core, but due to an increase in ECM stiffness (e.g., accumulated collagen I), cell stiffness (e.g., more abundant intermediate filaments), or both. We thus performed additional quantitative immunostaining analyses in cahErbb2-expressing cardio bundles and found that collagen I abundance was not changed (new Figure 3 âfigure supplement 3G), while abundances of intermediate filament proteins nestin and vimentin were significantly increased (new Figure 3 âfigure supplement 3I-K). Collectively, these results suggested that increased cell stiffness may be the main contributor to increased tissue stiffness induced by cahErbb2 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, authors should discuss whether development of a necrotic core is related to the avascular structure of the 3D model?</p></disp-quote><p>Owing to the lack of functional vasculature, cell survival in cardio bundles depends on the adequate diffusion of oxygen and nutrients from surrounding culture media into the center of the tissue. Thus, the mitogen-induced increase in cardio bundle size, along with a potentially higher metabolism of proliferating CMs, likely caused reduced levels of oxygen/nutrients in the cardio bundle center leading to the formation of the necrotic core. In the revised manuscript, we now discuss roles of the avascular nature of cardio bundles in development of necrotic core.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Second, the lentiviral overexpression of ERBB2 is not transient, because it cannot be turned off. Ideally, an on-off system is used so that after the proliferation phase, cardiomyocytes are allowed to redifferentiate and restructure their sarcomeres. No one is going to advocate continuous overexpression of ERBB2 in any tissue. An on-off system would allow the cardiomyocytes to redifferentiate resulting in a level playing field for all vectors. This issue should be better discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers that constitutive expression of caErbb2 or any other mitogens would not be a safe approach to cardiac therapy. In our studies, we constitutively expressed mitogens to facilitate direct comparison of how they affect CM structure and function. Some potential effects of the cahErbb2 turn-off after 7-day expression could be inferred from our Meki and Erki experiments. Per reviewersâ suggestion, in the revised manuscript, we additionally discuss effects of continuous vs. transient mitogen expression in CMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Third, it is not surprising that cardio bundles with the most actively proliferating cardiomyocytes and the most disorganized sarcomeres are less contractile. Are these unloaded cardiomyocytes operating at slack length which would, beside the proliferating phenotype, be an explanation for their hypo-contractility due to increased restoring forces? This question is important, since then hypocontractility may be, at least to some extent, an in vitro artefact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We measure active (contractile) and passive forces in cardio bundles at multiple tissue lengths, i.e., starting from the culture length of 7mm, then increasing the length in 4% steps and measuring active and passive force at each step after the tissue equilibrates. This allows us to both find the maximum active force that tissue generates and construct passive force-length curves. Generally, with this protocol, our control cardio bundles produced maximum active forces at 8-12% stretch, while cahErbb2expressing cardio bundles produced maximum active force at ~4% stretch. These maximum active forces were presented and compared among groups. To address the reviewersâ comment, we performed additional experiments shown in new Figure 3 â supplemental figure 2 (panels D, E), where we decreased tissue length (negative %stretch) to a point when passive tension became 0 (~slack length). At these equally unloaded conditions, we compared generated active forces and confirmed that cahErbb2-expressing tissues still produced significantly lower forces compared to control tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors have provided some functional measurements of the cardiomyocyte bundles, however, additional parameters of cardiomyocyte function warrants investigation to properly establish that the induced proliferation translates into improved function.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that sustained cahErbb2 expression in cardio bundles induced deterioration rather than improvement of contractile function. To address reviewersâ request for measurement of additional functional parameters, we included analyses of the twitch kinetics in our tissues (new Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2A-C and Figure 5 âfigure supplement 2). These measurements serve as additional readouts of CM function and together indicate that the increased Erk activity because of cahErbb2 activation slows kinetics of force generation in cardio bundles. As noted in our answer to Reviewersâ comment 5 (ii), transient rather than continuous upregulation of mitogen expression would offer a possibility to induce short-lasting proliferation of CMs, followed by their redifferentiation and improvement of cardiac function, as shown previously by DâUva et al., (Nat Cell Biol., 2015).</p></body></sub-article></article>
