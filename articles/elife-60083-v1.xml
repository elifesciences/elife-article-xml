possesses a large number of genes of unknown or predicted function, undermining fundamental understanding of pathogenicity and drug susceptibility. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput functional genomics approach combining inducible CRISPR-interference and image-based analyses of morphological features and sub-cellular chromosomal localizations in the related non-pathogen, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Applying automated imaging and analysis to 263 essential gene knockdown mutants in an arrayed library, we derive robust, quantitative descriptions of bacillary morphologies consequent on gene silencing. Leveraging statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to inform investigations of gene function. Exploiting this observation, we infer the existence of a mycobacterial restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation. Our results support the application of large-scale image-based analyses for mycobacterial functional genomics, simultaneously establishing the utility of this approach for drug mechanism-of-action studies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Caused by the microorganism <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,</italic> tuberculosis kills more people around the world than any other infectious disease. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is also becoming increasingly resistant to treatments, which are particularly difficult for patients to complete.

This aphorism applies to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB) and the leading cause of death globally from an infectious disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">WHO, 2019</xref>). Despite considerable activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Satta et al., 2018</xref>) in the two decades subsequent to the pioneering release of the first complete mycobacterial whole-genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cole et al., 1998</xref>), the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genome still contains a large number of genes of unknown or hypothetical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mazandu and Mulder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Satta et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, functional validation is lacking even for many annotated genes, undermining fundamental understanding of mycobacterial metabolic and cellular functions which impact pathogenicity and drug susceptibility. There is consequently a pressing need for tractable, high-throughput approaches that can inform mycobacterial gene function rapidly and at scale.</p><p>The most commonly applied functional genomics methods in bacteria – transposon-sequencing (Tn-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">van Opijnen and Camilli, 2013</xref>) and, increasingly, CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi)-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) – combine pooled mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing, returning quantitative estimates of fitness (via relative abundance) of mutants in a particular growth condition. Common to these approaches is that they report on the capacity of the cells to produce biomass, thereby excluding other – potentially subtler – measures of the physiological consequences of target gene disruption. To overcome this limitation, some studies have utilized novel combinations of pooled approaches with cellular stains and sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rego et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baranowski et al., 2018</xref>), or with imaging and in situ sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camsund et al., 2020</xref>) to provide alternative readouts of genetic function. However, these methods are restricted in their resolution and throughput.</p><p>As for many bacterial pathogens, mycobacterial functional genomics has focused primarily on the identification of essential genes, employing Tn-based investigations under a variety of conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sassetti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DeJesus et al., 2017</xref>), in different strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carey et al., 2018</xref>) and mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kieser et al., 2015</xref>) backgrounds, and in models of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sassetti and Rubin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rengarajan et al., 2005</xref>). The development of genetic tools for conditional knockdown mutagenesis via targeted gene silencing (utilizing engineered hypomorphic strains carrying promoter replacement and/or targeted protein-degradation mutations) has subsequently enabled gene-by-gene explorations of essential gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schnappinger and Ehrt, 2014</xref>). However, while these approaches have ensured increasingly refined (conditional) essentiality predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">DeJesus et al., 2017</xref>), there is still an absence of whole-cell functional data for the majority of essential genes.</p><p>Here, we couple key recent advances in mycobacterial CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rock et al., 2017</xref>) with quantitative microscopic imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ducret et al., 2016</xref>) in developing a platform enabling whole-cell characterization of essential gene knockdown in the non-pathogenic model mycobacterium, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Leveraging available gene essentiality and CRISPRi guide efficacy data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>), we describe the construction of an arrayed collection of 276 validated CRISPRi mutants targeting essential <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> homologs of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> genes. Applying high-throughput quantitative imaging to the arrayed library, we implement a bespoke analytic pipeline to probe essential gene function at scale. From the ‘phenoprints’ generated via this approach, we demonstrate the potential for preliminary assignment of gene function and illustrate the capacity to analyze metabolic and macromolecular synthesis pathways using clustering analyses. Notably, these observations provide evidence supporting a mycobacterial restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation but not to other amino acid auxotrophies. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of this approach in elucidating antimicrobial mechanism-of-action (MOA), supporting its potential incorporation as a complementary tool in current TB drug discovery pipelines. Consistent with our intention to generate a community-accessible resource, all data from the screen are made available via an interactive database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://timdewet.shinyapps.io/MorphotypicLanscape/">https://timdewet.shinyapps.io/MorphotypicLanscape/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of an arrayed CRISPRi library targeting essential mycobacterial genes</title><p>We aimed to construct an arrayed library of inducible CRISPRi mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) targeting essential <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>).

Of our targeted set of 294 genes, 229 genes (~78%) were not located in identified operons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For these genes, it was expected that any knockdown phenotype should solely reflect the impact of silencing the targeted essential gene. Of the remaining 65 genes within operons, 20 possessed downstream transcriptional start sites which would be expected to abrogate polar effects. This left 34 genes whose genomic context was likely to complicate the interpretation of any knockdown phenotype. We nevertheless considered this group of 34 genes worth pursuing given our ability to evaluate the results in the context of the corresponding essentiality calls from Tn-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dragset et al., 2019</xref>) and in comparison to phenotypes observed for related (or ‘shared pathway’) genes.</p><p>Following large-scale cloning, all 294 CRISPRi constructs were electroporated into an <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> ParB-mCherry reporter mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Santi and McKinney, 2015</xref>). This strain was chosen as background to enable visualization of the <italic>oriC</italic> proximate region of the chromosome during imaging assays, thereby providing information about chromosome location dynamics and copy number as a function of essential gene knockdown. To validate the identity and essentiality of each <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mutant strain, we performed Sanger sequencing of the inserted sgRNA and whole-cell spotting assays of ATc sensitivity. Cloning was repeated for mutants which failed the validation screen. This process yielded 276 validated CRISPRi mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), 93% of the initial target set.

Until very recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 2020</xref>), an equivalent approach had not been described for mycobacteria. Therefore, on initiating this study, we chose to investigate the use of imaging to phenotype the CRISPRi mutant library following ATc-dependent transcriptional silencing. This required the development of tools for the extraction of large-scale quantitative data describing mycobacterial cell morphology.</p><p>To determine the optimal duration of ATc exposure, we performed time-lapse microscopy of knockdown mutants of three well-characterized essential genes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>) – the cell-division mediator, <italic>ftsZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dziadek et al., 2003</xref>), the elongasome anchor, <italic>wag31</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), and the inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, <italic>guaB2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Singh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy established that fully penetrant phenotypes were manifest at 18 hr post ATc exposure for all three genes. This represents approximately 6–7 doubling times of the wild-type <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155 parental strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Logsdon et al., 2017</xref>), or a dilution factor of pre-existing protein of approximately 64 to 128 (2<sup>6</sup> - 2<sup>7</sup>)-fold. For both <italic>wag31</italic> and <italic>ftsZ</italic> mutants, lytic cell death was observable after the 18 hr time-point. While <italic>guaB2</italic> knockdown did not produce as distinctive a visual phenotype as the other two genes, the formation of minicells and a decline in growth rate was evident from 18 hr. Although this test set comprised only three mutants, we were encouraged that, for these essential genes with distinct cellular functions, the 18 hr timepoint appeared suitable to ensure sufficient knockdown and dilution of pre-existing protein to yield a detectable phenotype while maintaining suitable cell numbers for imaging. We therefore proceeded to apply the same experimental conditions in phenotyping the full library, recognizing that the pragmatic utilization of a single, ‘terminal’ endpoint might not be optimal for every mutant in the collection.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-60083-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse microscopy of <italic>ftsZ</italic> and <italic>wag31</italic> silencing by CRISPRi.</title></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-60083-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse microscopy of <italic>guaB2</italic> silencing by CRISPRi.</title></caption></media><p>Adopting the 18 hr CRISPRi duration, we derived a protocol for medium-throughput imaging of batches of 24 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Like RNA polymerase, the protein translation machinery operates as a large, multi-protein complex, perhaps exposing a deficiency in this approach when applied to the macromolecular machines responsible for transcription and translation.

Then, in demonstrating the potential utility of the resulting phenoprint atlas, we presented four examples illustrating its use in enabling preliminary characterization of single-gene function (DNA methylase), the identification of distinct morphotypes associated with biosynthetic (histidine) and macromolecular (mycolic acid) pathway disruptions, and the potential to exploit CRISPRi morphotypes as a chemical-genetic tool to illuminate antimycobacterial MOA determination.</p><p>Advances in imaging technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Camsund et al., 2020</xref>) and sample preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), together with the availability of software tools such as MicrobeJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ducret et al., 2016</xref>), have enabled the application of imaging in bacterial systems biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang, 2015</xref>). Our pipeline was optimized for medium-throughput imaging of mycobacteria; however, increasing the throughput of imaging, for example with the Strain Library Imaging Protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), would be advantageous for larger collections of mutants. To ensure completeness in our online ‘Morphotypic Landscape’ database, we plan in future to expand the library to include all 423 predicted essential <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> genes from our pooled screening data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>). There appears to be significant value, too, in establishing an equivalent library in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, a challenging undertaking but one which would benefit from the lessons learnt from this study. In this context, we note with interest key recent advances in mycobacterial cytological profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 2020</xref>) which suggest the potential to combine these complementary approaches in applying CRISPRi-imaging to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p>In developing our analytical pipeline, we relied heavily on the pioneering work of Jacobs-Wagner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campos et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, we adapted a machine learning-based cleanup that leverages the power of MicrobeJ but adds a <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-specific post-processing step. This classifier should have downstream utility for future imaging studies in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> but will require retraining if utilized for <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. For analysis, we applied an unsupervised learning approach that combined UMAP dimensionality reduction with density-based clustering of our multidimensional dataset. UMAP is a generally applicable algorithm, but has enjoyed especially rapid uptake for the visualization of single-cell sequencing results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becht et al., 2018</xref>). In our pipeline, we also used UMAP for data visualization and as a preprocessing step prior to the application of density-based clustering approaches, analogous to the use of t-SNE by Jacobs-Wagner and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campos et al., 2018</xref>). While non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques must be used with caution, our extensive validation supports the utility of the approach. Additionally, our dataset should be amenable to further analysis using alternative analytic approaches, including deep-learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">von Chamier et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Using data obtained from our CRISPRi screen, we generated a quantitative atlas of morphological changes associated with essential gene silencing in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. For ~90% of the strains in our library, no prior morphological data were available at the outset of the study. Moreover, approximately 40% of the genes and their protein products had not been characterized at all, either functionally (biochemically or microbiologically) or structurally. It was notable, therefore, that almost 78% of the essential genes assayed here resulted in at least one dramatically aberrant morphological feature on CRISPRi knockdown. This number exceeds the ~60% of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> mutants that produce clear terminal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Peters et al., 2016</xref>) and may reflect increased sensitivity of our analytic approach and/or the differential compositions of the respective libraries. However, given that only 20% of the non-essential <italic>E. coli</italic> Keio Collection displays significant morphological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campos et al., 2018</xref>), it is evident that silencing of essential genes is more likely to disrupt core processes affecting maintenance of general bacillary morphology.</p><p>A number of CRISPRi mutants produced morphological alterations that were unexpected. For example, while filamentation is a well-described phenomenon consequent on interference in cell-division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dziadek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greendyke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Justice et al., 2008</xref>) and depletion of ClpP protease components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2010</xref>), it is not typically associated with genes involved in protein synthesis or export. Nevertheless, we recorded filamentation responses following silencing of ribosomal subunits, the Sec translocase, and histidine biosynthesis. These phenotypes contrast with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> where filamentation is not observed on silencing of the corresponding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Murray and Hartman, 1972</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frandsen and D'Ari, 1993</xref>), mutants overexpressing <italic>hisH</italic> and <italic>hisF</italic> are known to produce filaments, possibly through a scarcity of PBP3 substrates required for cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cano et al., 1998</xref>). To our knowledge, though, filamentation of histidine auxotrophs has not been reported in any bacterial species, including mycobacteria. The mechanism underlying the filamentation phenotype is unclear, though potentially attributable to interference in cell division through an unknown mechanism. Moreover, the fact that this phenotype manifests on knockdown of the L-histidine-tRNA ligase, <italic>hisS</italic>, suggests the involvement of a regulatory mechanism dependent on the presence of his-tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Raina and Ibba, 2014</xref>). However, further work is required to explain this observation.</p><p>While interfering in cell envelope biogenesis might be expected to cause aberrations in morphology, the increases in mycobacterial cell width observed on silencing essential steps in mycolic acid synthesis have limited precedent in the literature. One example is the association of temperature-sensitive mutants of <italic>inhA</italic> with analogous phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vilchèze et al., 2000</xref>). The phenotypic consistency across the pathway was nevertheless surprising; again, however, the precise mechanism remains elusive. It is possible that the cell-wall synthetic machinery acts together in a spatiotemporally related complex that requires the presence of all proteins for function. It might be instructive, for example, that fluorescently-tagged versions of InhA and MabA co-localize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vilchèze et al., 2000</xref>) and may be present in the same specialized membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Knockdown of individual components of the pathway might therefore impact multiple protein–protein interactions, collapsing numerous components of cell-wall synthesis to produce the same phenotypic outcome. Alternatively, it is possible that biosynthetic precursors accumulate, producing consistent alterations in cell structure. A further possibility is that mycolic acids might play a more important structural role in the maintenance of mycobacterial cell width – an intriguing prospect considering the absence of the prokaryotic actin homolog, MreB, in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). Further work is needed to resolve these possibilities and should benefit from the collection of CRISPRi mutants described here.</p><p>In general, the CRISPRi-induced morphological changes appeared consistent within pathways and following exposure to the various anti-mycobacterial drugs. This was especially true of genes involved in DNA replication, cell division, cell-wall metabolism, and energy metabolism – a property which allowed us to leverage the platform to assign functional predictions for a number of genes, and to infer antimicrobial MOA. An example is MSMEG_3213, which morphological profiling, transcriptomic profiling and combinatorial CRISPRi identified as methylase of a predicted Type II R-M system in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. The biological function of this system is currently unclear; however, one practical implication is that, if involved as expected in intrinsic phage defense, it might inadvertently eliminate phages, which could be otherwise useful for clinically relevant mycobacteria such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> or <italic>M. abscessus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dedrick et al., 2019</xref>). It is tempting to consider, too, if the differential complement of R-M systems among mycobacteria might determine the apparent species-selectivity of some mycobacteriophages – for example, DS6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mayer et al., 2016</xref>) – and whether the MSMEG_3213 methylase, which is conserved in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, functions in cell-cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wion and Casadesús, 2006</xref>) in addition to its role in self-defense.</p><p>Cytological profiling has been extensively exploited to determine antimicrobial MOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nonejuie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nonejuie et al., 2016</xref>), with a very recent report providing the first evidence of its utility in mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). To our knowledge, all approaches have consistently utilized whole-cell drug treatment to create profiles of known mechanisms. In this work, we instead applied a genetic approach, generating a database of phenoprints based on essential gene knockdown which were then compared with profiles produced by drug exposure of whole cells. Notwithstanding the fundamental difference between genetic (transcriptional) knockdown and pharmacological (small molecule) inhibition, we observed strong overlap in the resulting phenotypes, especially for compounds targeting energy metabolism (BDQ), the mycolic acid (INH) or arabinogalactan (EMB) components of the cell wall, as well as DNA metabolism (fluoroquinolones and griselimycin). In some cases, we noted, too, that different concentrations of compound could produce disparate morphological profiles, suggesting a possible dependence of MOA on drug concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernier and Surette, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, not all compounds produced defining phenotypes. For example, compounds targeting peptidoglycan synthesis (DCS and VAN) led to rapid lysis, while aminoglycosides did not cluster with the majority of ribosomal knockdowns. While these exceptions expose limitations in cytological profiling (discussed below), the approach nevertheless appears useful as rapid pre-screen of compound MOA in drug discovery pipelines, prior to more in-depth investigation. Moreover, the pioneering development by Aldridge and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Smith et al., 2020</xref>) of the MorphEUS (morphological evaluation and understanding of stress) system for mycobacterial cytological profiling suggests the potential to replicate the CRISPRi approach described here in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, a daunting but tractable challenge.</p><p>It was notable that MOXI-treated cells did not sit closely with <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> knockdowns and were instead associated with DNA metabolism, an observation common to other fluoroquinolones. While this separation in UMAP space might be deemed surprising, two factors are salient to the interpretation of this result: firstly, the role of mycobacterial DNA gyrase in the removal of torsional stress and the maintenance of template topology during RNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2017</xref>) is consistent with the dominant effect of <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> knockdown manifesting as more similar to RNA polymerase inhibition (here, the close association with <italic>rpoB</italic> in the UMAP analysis is potentially telling); and, secondly, the filamentation observed on fluoroquinolone exposure is SOS-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Drlica et al., 2008</xref>) and involves the formation of lethal double-strand DNA breaks following drug-mediated trapping of the DNA-gyrase complex – an effect which ATc-induced CRISPRi knockdown does not produce. Supporting this interpretation, the gyrase B inhibitor, NVB, did not trigger filamentation, and was instead closely associated with <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> knockdowns, a key observation given previous work noting the lack of SOS induction in NVB-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boshoff et al., 2004</xref>). A question which commonly arises is how the apparently discrepant <italic>gyrA</italic>/<italic>gyrB</italic> and moxifloxacin phenoprints can be reconciled with recent data from a pioneering high-throughput chemical-genetic screen which reported the identification of novel gyrase inhibitors by utilizing a library which included <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>gyrB</italic> hypomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). In addressing this dilemma, it is important to remember that hypomorphs provide a powerful means to identify hypersusceptibilities consequent on bacillary exposure to chemicals which inhibit the same (cognate) gene or pathway targeted by the knockdown system (i.e. the genetic and antibiotic targets are identical); in contrast, whole-cell morphotypes report on the physiological response to (or manifestation of) lethal stress induced by essential gene silencing. Importantly, a key element distinguishing antibiotic-mediated target inhibition or corruption from transcript depletion is time: antibiotic treatment inhibits (or corrupts) active processes, triggering intracellular catastrophe (in the case of MOXI treatment, an SOS response), whereas gene silencing is much more gradual, or ordered, avoiding the impact of instantaneous loss of function.</p><p>As for all large-scale assays, the approach detailed here inevitably carries inherent limitations which must be borne in mind when analyzing and applying the data: (i) Although motivated primarily by pragmatism, the decision to apply an 18 hr endpoint for all analyses might inadvertently have biased the ‘strongest’ phenotypes to genes involved in DNA replication, cell division, and cell-wall metabolism. One obvious complication pertains to the drug MOA analyses, and is evident in the striking frequency with which the data points for 1X, 2X and 4X concentrations map differently in UMAP space for different compounds. Intuitively, increasing drug concentration might be expected to have two principal effects – increasing the rate of cell death while retaining the primary MOA (put simply, cells treated at 4X MIC will be further along the ‘path to death’ at 18 hr than those treated at 1X MIC) or increasing the likelihood of hitting secondary targets. This issue has been noted previously in transcriptional profiling of the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> drug-exposure response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boshoff et al., 2004</xref>) in which optimizing the drug concentration and exposure time were critical in avoiding convergence on a common stress pathway, obscuring the informative, drug-specific transcriptional signature. Similarly, the propensity for the rate of gene-product depletion to impact qualitatively the terminal phenotype has been elegantly demonstrated in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). Notwithstanding the significant resources required, future work might therefore envisage the use of time-lapse imaging of all mutants to identify optimal gene-specific knockdown durations. (ii) This proof-of-concept study employed only aerobically grown mycobacteria cultivated at 37°C in media comprising Middlebrook 7H9 broth base, with glycerol as primary carbon source. There is ample precedent in the literature indicating that gene essentialities, metabolic vulnerabilities and drug susceptibilities can alter as a function of growth conditions; therefore, the phenotypes presented here are necessarily condition-specific, and could benefit significantly from expanding these analyses to other, ‘disease-relevant’ culture systems. By extension, there is also the potential to perform equivalent analyses in different genetic backgrounds, avoiding the well-described pitfalls of ‘wild-type’ laboratory strains. (iii) Morphological profiling appears to offer a rapid means of preliminary gene function assignment or compound MOA; however, definitive validation is required – via further biochemical and/or functional analysis – to ratify the functional assignments predicted using this tool. (iv) Future iterations should also aim to resolve the large cluster (Cluster 2) of genes exhibiting minimal morphological effects on knockdown into more informative sub-clusters, perhaps through the incorporation of additional features and/or by applying alternative fluorescent reporters (possibly in addition to the ParB reporter). Some approaches to consider include the use of sentinel genes and transcription factors involved in different aspects of macromolecular biosynthesis and/or metabolic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Naran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boot et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the potential for improved MOA delineation, such refinements are necessary to address the large number of hypothetical proteins whose functions were not significantly informed by the current morphological profiling algorithm.</p><p>In conclusion, we are hopeful that the library of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mutants – and the associated online database – will offer a potentially valuable resource for the mycobacterial research community, particularly given the utilization of the ParB-mCherry reporter background which, to our knowledge, is unique in coupling whole-cell morphological information with a measure of replicative status and ploidy. While a large collection of inducible protein-degradation mutants was recently described in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>), there is not yet an equivalent in the faster-growing model mycobacterium, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Moreover, in addition to the validated strains, the plasmids used to establish our library should enable relatively simple construction of either single mutants or mutant libraries in alternative genetic backgrounds and reporter strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

In addition to the 288 genes found universally essential in both Tn-seq and CRISPRi-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>), we added six components of the ATP synthase which were found to be non-essential in Tn-seq owing to gene duplication in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dragset et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While CRISPRi is a reliable technology for producing knockdown, it is subject to variation in knockdown efficacy, depending on the selected guide RNA. Moreover, when targeting a gene with CRISPRi, the efficacy of a particular guide is not known de novo, and activity prediction algorithms are still in their infancy, particularly for bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, it is generally best practice to target a gene with more than one sgRNA to account for differences in activity. However, in the case of arrayed mutant collections, this requirement becomes unwieldy; as such, previous arrayed CRISPRi mutant collections in bacteria have utilized one predicted sgRNA per gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Our previous CRISPRi-Seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Wet et al., 2018</xref>) allowed us to identify essential genes that were growth-suppressed by multiple sgRNAs, but additionally provided empirical data on sgRNA knockdown efficiency. As a result, we were able to identify the most efficient sgRNAs for any gene.</p><p>For each of the 294 selected genes, two oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were synthesized at 50 nmol and annealed by LGC Biosciences. For five genes, an additional set of oligonucleotides was used to validate the observed phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Oligonucleotides were delivered in 96-well plates, and were resuspended in water to a final concentration of 100 µM. Cloning was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rock et al., 2017</xref>) but adapted for scale. Briefly, pJR962 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rock et al., 2017</xref>) was digested overnight with BsmBI-FastDigest (Thermo) and gel purified. Ligations were performed in 96-well plates with 1U T4 Ligase (NEB) and incubated at room temperate overnight. Ligation reactions were transformed into 5 μl High-Efficiency DH5α cells (NEB) with heat-shock, rescued in TY Broth, and plated on LB agar prepared in 6-well plates. Following overnight growth at 37°C, single colonies were picked into 800 μl of LB broth, in 2 ml deep 96-well plates, and grown overnight at 37°C with vigorous shaking. All <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures were supplemented with Kanamycin (Roche) at a final concentration of 50 µg/ml. Plasmids were extracted with a Zyppy-96 Plasmid Miniprep kit (Zymo) according to manufacturer instructions and quantified via Nanodrop.</p><p>Approximately 100 ng of plasmid was electroporated into the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> ParB-mCherry reporter strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Santi and McKinney, 2015</xref>) and rescued in 7H9 broth supplemented with OADC and 0.05% Tween 80, for 3 hr at 37°C. Electroporation reactions were plated on 7H10 agar supplemented with OADC and Kanamycin at 20 µg/ml, prepared in 6-well plates, and grown at 37°C until visible colonies formed. Single colonies were picked into 400 μl 7H9 supplemented with kanamycin (20 µg/ml) and grown with shaking until stationary phase. Glycerol stocks of all transformants were stored at −80°C. Any failed ligations or transformations were repeated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sequencing validation</title><p>PCR Primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) designed to target the sgRNA-containing region of plasmid pJR962 were synthesized by Inqaba Biotech. PCR reactions were prepared with OneTaq Master-mix (NEB) in 96-well plates to a final volume of 20 μl. Using pipette tips, scrapings of glycerol stocks were taken and mixed with the PCR reaction. The PCR was performed with the settings described (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). PCR reactions were purified and sequenced by the Stellenbosch Central Analytic Facility using the same forward primer as the PCR reaction. Sequencing results were analyzed using a custom written R script. For PCR amplification, we opted not to use a high-fidelity polymerase owing to the number of reactions performed. Since this risked introducing artificial mismatches or ambiguities into the sequencing results, a sequence was considered correct if the mutant had a high-quality alignment with its expected sequence. We accepted ambiguities in the sequencing trace if the strain functionally validated in downstream growth analysis. PCR reactions that did not produce sequencing results were repeated; ultimately, sequence-validation was obtained for 238 mutants from the initial cloning workflow, a success rate of 83%. Of the invalidated mutants, 15 wells contained plasmid backbone, 15 were cross-contaminants which occurred at some point during the cloning process, and the remaining 20 failed to sequence. We maintained the plasmid-backbone strains in our library and downstream workflow as these represented useful empty vector sequences, so that control strains were nested within the arrayed library. Cloning was repeated for invalidated mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Growth validations</title><p>Square plates containing standard Middlebrook 7H10 OADC agar were prepared and supplemented with kanamycin (Roche,20ug/ml), with or without anhydrotetracycline (ATc, Sigma, 100 ng/ml). Fresh cultures were inoculated from glycerol freezer stocks into 400 μl Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin (Roche, 20 µg/ml) in deep 96-well plates. Cultures were grown with shaking until saturated. Stationary-phase cultures were diluted 1:10 000 into fresh 7H9 before spotting onto prepared 7H10 plates using a 96-well replicator pin (Sigma). All spotting was performed in triplicate. Plates were grown until colonies formed and photographed using a lightbox.

Exponential-phase cultures were inoculated 1:40 into 7H9 supplemented with kanamycin (Roche, 20 µg/ml) and ATc (Sigma 100 ng/ml) and grown for 18 hr, with shaking. Large-format agarose pads were prepared with water to a final concentration of 2%. Briefly, 2 ml of molten low-melt agarose was sandwiched between two rectangular coverslips (No. 1.5, 24 x 60 mm). The bottom coverslip was marked using a laser-cut stencil to indicate sample placement. Agarose pads were left to dry, and 1 μl of induced culture spotted onto the pads, using a multichannel pipette. Each pad contained eight samples. Twenty-four strains were imaged per day, and replicate imaging was performed for 137 samples to validate the reproducibility of the imaging workflow.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Large-format agarose pads were imaged using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 and ZEN 2 (blue edition) software, with the ZEN Tiles and Positions and ZEN Autofocus Modules installed. Images were captured using a Zeiss Axiocam 503 with 3X analogue gain. Using a low magnification 10X objective, each sample was localized on the pad. Approximately 24 fields-of-view were selected with a 100X Phase Contrast Objective (1.4NA), before capturing images using bright-field and fluorescent imaging. Fluorescence was excited using a Colibri Green LED (555/30 nm) and filtered at 590–650 nm. Exposure times were maintained across imaging sessions for Brightfield Images, and for fluorescent images. A software autofocus regimen was used before each field-of-view was captured. In the case of low-density samples, fields-of-view were manually chosen and increased in number. Raw images were saved as CZI files prior to processing and data extraction.</p><p>Time-lapse imaging was performed on 1.5% agarose pads embedded with 7H9 OADC medium containing ATc (Sigma, 100 ng/ml) and kanamycin (Roche, 20 µg/ml), in glass-bottomed dishes (NEST Biotechnology).

CZI Images were converted to TIFF images and were manually inspected and out-of-focus fields removed. To enhance foci in the fluorescent channel, a Gaussian blur filter was applied to the fluorescent channel and subtracted from the original image. Furthermore, overall intensity of each fluorescent channel was normalized throughout the imaging dataset, to a mean pixel intensity of 15.

Two fields-of-view were sampled from each mutant and replica dataset and processed and analyzed as described above. All detected objects were initially exported. To create a reference of correctly identified cells, cells were inspected with the interface built into MicrobeJ, and misidentified cells removed from the dataset. Thus, two datasets were exported: the full dataset of all identified objects, and the dataset of classified cells. In total, approximately 22,000 objects were manually classified. The classified data were imported into R and utilized to build a classification model. Briefly, 20% of the dataset was reserved as a test sample, and the remaining 80% was used to train a variety of models, using the Caret package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuhn, 2008</xref>). For model training, fivefold cross-validation was used, and resampling performed across the default tuning parameters. ROC was used to select the optimal tuning parameters for each model. A selection of models was tested and compared based on ROC AUC. An Averaged Neural Network was empirically chosen as the best-performing model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The trained classifier was used to classify the entire dataset and remove misidentified objects. Data were input through the curation pipeline and labeled based on sequencing results and growth validations. Reproducibility of the imaging workflow was tested by comparing length of the replica image sets.

For each technique, we tested a variety of optimization parameters to produce distinct clusters of points, while still maintaining a consistent cluster of wild-type samples. On comparison, UMAP produced the best separated clusters, while maintaining a relatively uniform wild-type cluster. UMAP is characterized by a degree of stochasticity during initialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lel et al., 2017</xref>); therefore, we generated 100 maps which were each clustered with hdbscan (minPts = 12).

Additionally, we generated heatmaps describing mean Z-scores of chosen features, for each cluster. We performed COG enrichment on each cluster, utilizing Fisher’s Exact Test, and adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure. For visualizing sub-clusters within the UMAP, we adapted an approach inspired by the previously described spatial analysis of functional enrichment (SAFE) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baryshnikova, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campos et al., 2018</xref>), to identify regions of the UMAP output that were enriched for particular functions. Briefly, for each point on our 2-dimensional UMAP projection, we examined surrounding points, within a predefined radius (the 10th percentile of the distribution of pairwise distances between all points) and tested for enrichment of either COG or KEGG ontologies using a hypergeometric test.

To this end, 10 μl of resazurin (Sigma) was added to 50 μl of cell culture, incubated for one hour at 37°C and color change determined visually. For imaging, cultures were spotted on agarose pads, and imaged and analyzed as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Cell cycle heatmaps</title><p>A population of cells at a single-timepoint contains a degree of temporal information, as the population contains cells at different stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campos et al., 2018</xref>). To visualize movement of ParB through the cell cycle, we utilized extracted maxima-localization data and cell length from MicrobeJ and processed the data further utilizing a bespoke R script. For each mutant, we arranged cells by length, and produced consensus heatmaps of ParB localization relative to cell length using ggplot2.

For CRISPRi knockdowns, the strain of interest was inoculated from an exponential-phase culture into 15 ml of 7H9-OADC supplemented with kanamycin (Roche, 20 µg/ml) and ATc (Sigma, 100 ng/ml) and cultured for 18 hr at 37°C with shaking. RNA was extracted using a FastRNA Blue Kit (MP Biomedicals) and ethanol-precipitated, according to manufacturer instructions. Extracted RNA was quantified by Nanodrop. Ten µg of RNA was treated with 2U DNase (NEB) at 37°C for 10 min, prior to cleanup with a Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer instructions. The purified DNAse-treated RNA was poly-A tailed using <italic>E. coli</italic> Poly(A) Polymerase (NEB), according to manufacturer instructions, prior to clean-up with a Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research). Ribosomal RNA was depleted with a Bacterial Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer instructions, prior to clean-up with a Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research). Library preparation for Nanopore sequencing was performed using either a Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing Kit (SQK-RNA001, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) or Nanopore Direct cDNA (SQK-DCS109, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) according to manufacturer protocols, and sequenced on MinION sequencers (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Base-calling was performed by MinKNOW software (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and data stored as FASTQ files for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA-Seq data analysis</title><p>Reads were aligned to the <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> mc<sup>2</sup>155 genome (NC_008596) with Minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li, 2018</xref>), utilizing the map-ont command.

PCR primers and reaction settings are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>. Golden Gate cloning was performed utilizing the purified MSMEG_3213-targeting plasmid cloned during establishing the library as a backbone. Briefly, a single-pot reaction was set up containing T4 ligase (10 000U) and buffer (NEB), SapI (NEB, 10Units), 75 ng of backbone, and purified PCR product at a molar ratio of 2:1. The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour, and at 55°C for 5 min, prior to transformation into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α (NEB). Colonies were screened by PCR using the sequencing primers, plJR962_Seq_F and plJR962_Seq_R, and OneTaq polymerase (NEB), as described previously, and positive clones sequenced by the Stellenbosch Central Analytic Facility utilizing plJR962_Seq_F to confirm the insertion.

important technological and biological advances in our understanding of how different essential pathways in mycobacteria intersect with effects on bacterial morphology, identifying previously unknown functional associations. This study provides a framework for future work that could accelerate our understanding of gene function in mycobacteria.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Arrayed CRISPRi and quantitative imaging describe the morphotypic landscape of essential mycobacterial genes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: E Hesper Rego (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript combines a CRISPRi library in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> with high throughput light microscopy and image analysis to investigate the effects of essential gene knockdown on bacterial morphology. The reviewers all agree that there are many technical advances presented in this paper, the experiments are well executed, and the data and its analysis is significant for the field. However, there are some questions regarding the reproducibility of the data and the utility of these data as a predictive tool. The reviewers believe that these questions should be straightforward to address, as described more below.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Questions of reproducibility: The authors state that &quot;Moreover, to verify the reproducibility of the imaging workflow, replicate imaging was performed on separate days for 134 strains.&quot;</p><p>Does this mean that the authors don't have replicate data for 29 strains? To ensure reproducibility, the authors should perform one or both of the following: 1) Finish collecting the replicate data sets to ensure reproducibility and/or 2) Address reproducibility by comparing the data for the 129 that have been replicated.</p><p>The authors should also validate a few genes with a second guide RNA to rule out off-target effects and confirm phenotypes.</p><p>2) Questions of utility as a predictive tool:</p><p>a) MSMEG_3213 isn't an example of defining the function of an uncharacterized gene instead it simply validates existing database predictions. Further, the data presented here do not demonstrate that MSMEG_3213 is the methylase of an R-M pair. Limitations should be made clear in the discussion of the data.</p><p>b) The approach and data falls short of broadly being able to predict the function for any essential gene of interest. The data as presented in Figure 6 do not help this case. While some functionally related genes cluster together, many do not, especially for genes that fall into cluster 2. The disorganization in the UMAP space may stem from the small number of observed phenotypes, whereas published work in other organisms reports much broader ranges of depletion phenotypes. That being said, this isn't a fault of the authors', but it does diminishes their claim to use this method as a predictive tool. The text should be reworded or restructured to clearly represent the utility (or limitations) of these data as a predictive tool.</p><p>c) Reshuffling or restructuring some of the sections may help to guide the reader towards understanding the utility of the methods and the data. For example, in addition to describing the methods of their technique, the author's validate or give examples of what their data contain (identification of cryptic putative RM system, histidine auxotroph phenotypes, effects of disrupting mycolic acid biosynthesis). They then discuss the potential to use CRISPRi to confirm compound MOA. This is a lot of information (10 figures with many subpanels), but none of these threads are really taken to completion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Arrayed CRISPRi and quantitative imaging describe the morphotypic landscape of essential mycobacterial genes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) &quot;An immediate priority is to expand the library to include all 423 predicted essential <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> genes from our pooled screening data (de Wet et al., 2018) and to perform additional replicate imaging for all mutants to enhance resolution and reproducibility.&quot;</p><p>While this passage might assuage a reviewer or provide the impetus for a sub-Aim of a proposal, it should possibly be omitted because it implies that the missing data are too important to omit and therefore it is premature to publish the current body of work. A stated immediate priority in a published report is acceptable when it describes the next logical step in a progression identified by conclusions of that publication, but it is less acceptable when it describes a gap in the present step. The wording in the passage sounds like the latter.</p><p>The subset of genes selected and currently presented is justified on the basis of conservation with <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and the degree of reproducibility demonstrated by an independent replicate of more than half of those suggest high value and reliable data.</p><p>2) &quot;Although morphological profiling appears to offer a rapid means of preliminary gene function assignment or compound MOA, this approach cannot claim single gene-level sensitivity. Definitive validation is therefore required – via further biochemical and/or functional analysis – to ratify the functional assignments predicted using this tool.&quot;</p><p>The phrase &quot;gene-level sensitivity&quot; may be misapplied in this context, or at least, confusing. A reviewer points out that the manuscript demonstrates gene-level sensitivity by reducing expression of a gene and the subsequent combination of morphologic effects (phenoprint) places that gene in the Euclidean neighborhood of other genes. The overall passage is aimed at qualifying a limitation of the screen in that it cannot biochemically discern the basis for its inclusion in the neighborhood. Therefore, a clearer and more concise passage would delete &quot;this approach cannot claim single gene-level sensitivity.&quot; The resulting single sentence says that phenoprint data does not assign gene function but gene membership to a process or pathway. This can then guide specific experiments of the functional basis for that membership.</p><p>3) &quot;Despite lacking single-gene resolution, morphological profiling has the capacity to identify mutants with unexpected phenotypes, providing a preliminary phenotypic characterization which can guide focused downstream investigations towards assigning gene function.&quot;</p><p>Same comment about the use of &quot;single-gene&quot;. Just starting with &quot;Morphological profiling…&quot; could be a clearer statement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60083.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Questions of reproducibility: The authors state that &quot;Moreover, to verify the reproducibility of the imaging workflow, replicate imaging was performed on separate days for 134 strains.&quot;</p><p>Does this mean that the authors don't have replicate data for 29 strains? To ensure reproducibility, the authors should perform one or both of the following: 1) Finish collecting the replicate data sets to ensure reproducibility and/or 2) Address reproducibility by comparing the data for the 129 that have been replicated.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in their interpretation that replicate imaging was performed on 134 (of 263) strains, with an additional 3 added during revision; in addition, 27 replicates were performed of the vector-only control strain. These numbers are clarified in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1. In obtaining replicate imaging data for a subset of strains, we were guided by the approach of Campos et al., 2018, who applied selective or partial replicate imaging to ensure reproducibility in their pioneering study. To avoid confusion, we have clarified this in the manuscript with the following statements:</p><p>“To confirm the reproducibility of data obtained from the single-timepoint, single-replicate imaging workflow, we selected 137 strains for re-imaging on separate days (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>The strong correlation we observed between replicates instilled confidence in the single-replicate imaging strategy, allowing us to adopt this approach for the remaining strains, all of which represent data obtained from a median of 400 single cells. We nevertheless acknowledge the desirability of including additional replicate imaging sets for the remaining strains and, when local conditions allow for a return to work post COVID-19 lockdown, we will perform the additional replicates and update our online data repository accordingly. We have added the following line in the Discussion to confirm this intention:</p><p>“An immediate priority is to expand the library to include all 423 predicted essential <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> genes from our pooled screening data (de Wet et al., 2018) and to perform additional replicate imaging for all mutants to enhance resolution and reproducibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also validate a few genes with a second guide RNA to rule out off-target effects and confirm phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in identifying off-target effects as a pervasive concern with CRISPRi-based approaches (Cui, Vigouroux, Rousset, et al., 2018 Nat Commun <bold>9,</bold> 1912 doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-04209-5). To mitigate the impact of off-target effects, we utilized two approaches previously in constructing our genome-scale library (de Wet et al., 2018) and, therefore, in developing the ranking of guide efficacies which informed guide selection here: first, we applied an <italic>in silico</italic> approach for guide selection that was optimized to avoid close homology; and, secondly, empirical data on individual sgRNA efficacies – inferred from quantitative analyses of mutant abundances – were utilized to inform guide choice in the current study.</p><p>We also agree that, ideally, each phenotype should be validated with additional guide RNAs. However, this becomes impractical at scale and, in evaluating our experimental approach, we were reassured by:</p><p>i) literature precedent (<italic>e.g</italic>., Liu et al., 2017) supporting the use of single mutant phenotypes;</p><p>ii) the observation that, through a comprehensive literature review, we were able to align most reported phenotypes (where available) with those described herein; and</p><p>iii) the consistency of phenotypes observed for genes contained within operons, where polar effects are most predicted (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) – in essence, different guides targeting the same transcriptional unit produce the same phenotype.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, we had data available from previous validations of a small panel of genes; these results are now included in new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, which confirms the consistency of the reported phenotypes with additional sgRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Questions of utility as a predictive tool:</p><p>a) MSMEG_3213 isn't an example of defining the function of an uncharacterized gene instead it simply validates existing database predictions. Further, the data presented here do not demonstrate that MSMEG_3213 is the methylase of an R-M pair. Limitations should be made clear in the discussion of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which rightly cautions against overinterpreting the utility of this approach. It is correct that the functionality of MSMEG_3213 was predicted in the REBASE database, although we submit that the existing annotation was without functional validation and, moreover, was not contained in databases commonly accessed by mycobacteriologists; for example, Mycobrowser (Kapopoulou et al., 2011; Tuberculosis (Edinb). 91, 8-13).</p><p>We also agree that while our data are strongly suggestive of methylase function, they are not definitive. Additional in vitro biochemical data validating protein function, or in vivo data confirming a decrease in DNA methylation consequent on knockdown, are required to establish unequivocally that MSMEG_3213 is a methylase. Our results provide the impetus for the proposed follow-up studies.</p><p>In acknowledging the caveats outline above, we have inserted the following statement in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Further biochemical and/or functional characterization is required before MSMEG_3213 can be definitively assigned as methylase; however, the evidence derived here from morphological profiling, transcriptomic profiling and combinatorial CRISPRi strongly support the identification of a predicted Type II R-M system in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.”</p><p>In addition, we have modified the Abstract as follows:</p><p>“Leveraging statistical-learning, we demonstrate that functionally related genes cluster by morphotypic similarity and that this information can be used to inform investigations of gene function. Exploiting this observation, we infer the existence of a mycobacterial restriction-modification system, and identify filamentation as a defining mycobacterial response to histidine starvation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The approach and data falls short of broadly being able to predict the function for any essential gene of interest. The data as presented in Figure 6 do not help this case. While some functionally related genes cluster together, many do not, especially for genes that fall into cluster 2. The disorganization in the UMAP space may stem from the small number of observed phenotypes, whereas published work in other organisms reports much broader ranges of depletion phenotypes. That being said, this isn't a fault of the authors', but it does diminishes their claim to use this method as a predictive tool. The text should be reworded or restructured to clearly represent the utility (or limitations) of these data as a predictive tool.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment which again stresses the need for prudence in interpreting the utility of this approach. In acknowledging this caution, we have updated the Discussion with the following statement:</p><p>“Although morphological profiling appears to offer a rapid means of preliminary gene function assignment or compound MOA, this approach cannot claim single gene-level sensitivity. Definitive validation is therefore required – via further biochemical and/or functional analysis – to ratify the functional assignments predicted using this tool.”</p><p>In addition, we have included additional text noting these limitations within the Results section of the paper, adding:</p><p>“Despite lacking single-gene resolution, morphological profiling has the capacity to identify mutants with unexpected phenotypes, providing a preliminary phenotypic characterization which can guide focused downstream investigations towards assigning gene function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Reshuffling or restructuring some of the sections may help to guide the reader towards understanding the utility of the methods and the data.

They then discuss the potential to use CRISPRi to confirm compound MOA. This is a lot of information (10 figures with many subpanels), but none of these threads are really taken to completion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment which echoes our own deliberations in how best to present both the methodology and its potential uses. In line with the reviewers’ suggestion, we have extended and adapted the scope of the section on the putative RM system to include additional examples of utility, specifically:</p><p>“Other examples supporting the utility of morphological profiling to inform single-gene functional analyses arose during the course of this work (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). For example, the <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> homolog of <italic>MSMEG_0317</italic> is required for lipomannan maturation and lipoarabinomannan (LM/LAM) synthesis (Cashmore et al., 2017). We observed that <italic>MSMEG_0317</italic> clustered closely with genes involved in arabinogalactan synthesis and localized to the cell wall (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). It was pleasing, therefore, when a separate study emerged suggesting that <italic>MSMEG_0317</italic> was involved in the transport of LM/LAM (Gupta et al., 2019). In another example, the transcriptional regulator, <italic>whiA</italic>, which is involved in sporulation in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (Bush et al., 2013), appears to play a key role in the mycobacterial cell cycle, clustering with other components of cell division (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, <italic>MSMEG_6276</italic> – a putative mur ligase – clusters closely with the peptidoglycan synthesis protein, <italic>mviN</italic> (Gee et al., 2012), and exhibits strong homology to <italic>murT/gatD</italic> from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (Morlot et al., 2018) (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In combination, these additional examples support the utility of image-based profiling for informing or validating hypothetical or predicted gene function – particularly those involved in cell wall metabolism or DNA metabolism and cell cycle regulation.”</p><p>While this does not take any thread “to completion”, we have attempted to emphasize each of the biological examples (identification of cryptic putative RM system, histidine auxotroph phenotypes, effects of disrupting mycolic acid biosynthesis, and MOA determination) as illustrative of utility, rather than composite studies in-and-of themselves. Again, our intention here is to demonstrate the capacity for morphotypic phenotypes – especially where compared against a database of other gene-specific morphotypes – to provide the impetus for downstream analyses which might yield functional information. That is, as a key tool in functional genomics.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) &quot;An immediate priority is to expand the library to include all 423 predicted essential M. smegmatis genes from our pooled screening data (de Wet et al., 2018) and to perform additional replicate imaging for all mutants to enhance resolution and reproducibility.&quot;</p><p>While this passage might assuage a reviewer or provide the impetus for a sub-Aim of a proposal, it should possibly be omitted because it implies that the missing data are too important to omit and therefore it is premature to publish the current body of work.
