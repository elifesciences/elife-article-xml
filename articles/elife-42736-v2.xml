They may appear stiff and unyielding, but our bones are actually dynamic structures. Early in life, most bones start as small ‘templates’ made of another, flexible tissue called cartilage. As the templates grow into adult bones, the cartilage is gradually replaced by bone and fat, but this process is still poorly understood. For example, it is not clear whether cartilage cells simply die and make way for new cells, or instead if they turn into bone and fat cells. To investigate this question, Giovannone, Paul et al. set out to follow the fate of early cartilage cells in zebrafish, and to compare this with what happens in mammals. Zebrafish were chosen because their skeleton and ours develop in similar ways; yet, these animals are much easier to study, in particular because their embryos are transparent.</p><p>Young cartilage cells were ‘tagged’ with a long-lasting fluorescent protein in genetically engineered zebrafish embryos, and then followed over time. As the embryos started to form bones, the cartilage cells gave rise to bone cells, fat cells, and also potentially adult stem cells within the marrow, which can become other types of cells. This process required a protein called Mmp9, which also helps shape bone development in other organisms, including humans.</p><p>Defects in how early cartilage templates morph into bone and fat may contribute to dwarfism and other severe conditions. Fully grasping the molecular mechanisms that preside over this complex transition may one day help design drugs to treat skeletal disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chondrocyte</kwd><kwd>adipocyte</kwd><kwd>osteoblast</kwd><kwd>endochondral bone</kwd><kwd>skeletal stem cell</kwd><kwd>Mmp9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 DE027550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crump</surname><given-names>J Gage</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farmer</surname><given-names>D'Juan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 025549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giovannone</surname><given-names>Dion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 DE027218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smeeton</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cartilage cells transition through a proliferative intermediate to give rise to bone and marrow fat cells in long bones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vertebrate bones develop via two largely distinct processes. Intramembranous (i.e. dermal) bone, which makes up a large portion of the skull, arises through the direct differentiation of mesenchymal precursors into osteoblasts and then osteocytes. In contrast, endochondral bone, which comprises the majority of the axial and limb skeletons, arises through the progressive remodeling of an embryonic cartilage template. On the outside of developing endochondral bone, perichondral cells mature into periosteal progenitors that contribute to the bone collar. The cartilage templates of endochondral bone are organized into distinct zones of chondrocytes: resting, proliferative, pre-hypertrophic, and hypertrophic. In mammals, chondrocytes at the edge of the developing hypertrophic zone largely disappear as the cartilage matrix is degraded, a process concurrent with the invasion of blood vessels, hematopoietic cells, and progenitors for osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maes et al., 2010</xref>). This growth plate remodeling contributes to the establishment of trabecular bone, complementing the cortical bone largely derived from the periosteum, and the marrow cavity supports continued hematopoiesis. As with mammals, zebrafish also have intramembranous and endochondral bones. Their endochondral bones are hollow and filled predominantly with fat yet do not support hematopoiesis as in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Witten and Huysseune, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weigele and Franz-Odendaal, 2016</xref>). It has remained unclear, however, whether zebrafish bone arises solely through osteoblast differentiation in the periosteum, or also through invasion of the vasculature and conversion of growth plate cartilage to bone as in mammals. The source of marrow adipocytes also remains unclear in either fish or mammals.</p><p>It has long been appreciated that many hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo cell death during endochondral ossification, with osteoblasts forming from periosteal cells brought into the bone along with the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maes et al., 2010</xref>). At the same time, there are numerous studies showing that cultured chondrocytes can dedifferentiate into mesenchymal progenitors and/or transdifferentiate into osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shimomura et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mayne et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">von der Mark and von der Mark, 1977</xref>). Recent lineage tracing studies of hypertrophic chondrocytes, using constitutive and inducible <italic>Col10a1-Cre-</italic> and <italic>Aggrecan-Cre</italic>-based transgenes in mice, has revealed that such transdifferentiation may also occur in vivo, with chondrocytes making a major contribution to osteoblasts within trabecular bone and potentially also the bone collar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2015</xref>). A limitation of these studies is the use of population-based labeling by Cre recombination, which cannot exclude low-level and/or leaky labeling of other cell types. It is also unclear whether hypertrophic chondrocytes can give rise to other cell types, such as marrow adipocytes, and whether hypertrophic chondrocytes directly transform into osteoblasts or do so through a stem cell intermediate. Finally, it is unknown whether the ability of chondrocytes to generate osteoblasts and other cell types is specific to mammals or a more broadly shared feature of vertebrates.</p><p>In this study, we address the long-term fate of growth plate chondrocytes in zebrafish, as well as potential mechanisms of their fate plasticity. We use the ceratohyal (Ch) bone of the lower face as a model. This long bone, which is derived from cranial neural crest cells, exhibits properties in common with the long bones of mammalian limbs, including two prominent growth plates at either end and a marrow cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we describe remodeling of the Ch from a cartilage template to a fat-filled bone in juvenile stages, which coincides with extensive vascularization. Using inducible Cre and long-lived histone-mCherry fusion proteins, driven by regulatory regions of the chondrocyte genes <italic>sox10</italic> and <italic>col2a1a</italic>, we reveal contribution of chondrocytes to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and mesenchymal cells within the adult Ch. In mouse, <italic>LepR</italic> expression marks bone marrow cells that contribute to osteoblasts and adipocytes primarily after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>). In zebrafish, we find that growth plate chondrocytes express <italic>lepr</italic> and re-enter the cell cycle during the late hypertrophic phase, raising the possibility that <italic>Lepr</italic> +skeletal stem cells may derive from growth plate chondrocytes. Further, we find that delayed remodeling of the hypertrophic cartilage zone in zebrafish <italic>mmp9</italic> mutants correlates with a paucity of marrow adipocytes. Unlike in mouse where Mmp9 functions in hematopoietic cells for timely growth plate remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vu et al., 1998</xref>), we find that Mmp9 is sufficient in neural crest-derived chondrocytes of zebrafish for growth plate remodeling. Our studies reveal that growth plate chondrocytes generate osteocytes and adipocytes in zebrafish bones, potentially by transitioning through a proliferative intermediate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Remodeling of the Ch bone in juvenile zebrafish</title><p>In order to characterize the progressive remodeling of an endochondral bone in zebrafish, we performed pentachrome staining on sections of the Ch bone from juvenile through adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The Ch bone is shaped like a flattened barbell, and here we sectioned it to reveal the thin plane of the bone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) for a view along the thicker perpendicular plane). Unlike the unidirectional growth plates in the mouse limb, the two growth plates of Ch are bidirectional with a central zone of compact, proliferative chondrocytes flanked by hypertrophic chondrocytes on either side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike in many other fish species, the Ch bone, as with other bones in zebrafish, also contains embedded osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Witten and Huysseune, 2009</xref>). At 11 mm standard length (SL) (approx. 4.5 weeks post-fertilization (wpf)), the Ch contains chondrocytes throughout its length with the exception of a small marrow space at the anterior tip. The Ch is surrounded by a thin layer of cortical bone that has been shown to derive from osteoblasts located on the outside of the cartilage template (i.e. periosteum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>). By 12 mm SL (approx. five wpf), both tips of the Ch contain marrow spaces, and on the central sides of the growth plates we begin to observe small fissures in the cortical bone and disruption of the hypertrophic zone. By 13 mm SL (approx. 5.5 wpf), breaks in the cortical bone become more prominent and are accompanied by further degradation of the cartilage matrix. At later stages (16 and 19 mm SL) (approx. 7 and 9 wpf), cortical bone regains integrity and increases in thickness, and marrow adipocytes containing LipidTOX +lipid vesicles are seen throughout Ch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By adulthood (one year of age), the marrow cavity is filled with large fat cells and the growth plates appear largely mineralized. While we focus on the Ch for this study, a number of other cartilage-derived bones in the face and fins have been reported to have a similar structure in zebrafish, including growth plates and prominent marrow fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weigele and Franz-Odendaal, 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42736.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time-course of Ch remodeling in juvenile zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pentachrome staining of a longitudinal section through the head of a 19 mm fish.

First, we constructed an inducible <italic>sox10</italic>:CreERT2 line and crossed it to a ubiquitous <italic>bactin2</italic>:loxP-tagBFP-stop-loxP-DsRed reporter (Blue to Red conversion: <italic>B &gt; R</italic>). The zebrafish <italic>sox10</italic> promoter drives expression in early cranial neural crest cells from 10 to 16 hpf, followed by a second wave of expression in all chondrocytes from two dpf onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dutton et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we took advantage of this second wave of expression to label developmental chondrocytes. Upon addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) at 15 dpf, we observed extensive labeling of chondrocytes within 5 days, as well as some cells in the perichondrium surrounding Ch and other cartilages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We did not observe leaky conversion in the absence of 4-OHT at either embryonic or adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then converted <italic>sox10/B &gt; R</italic> fish by 4-OHT treatment at 14 dpf and raised these to adulthood (27 mm SL) for analysis, with inclusion of an <italic>ocn</italic>:GFP transgene allowing us to label osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Confocal maximum intensity projections through Ch revealed extensive labeling of growth plate chondrocytes. We also observed numerous cells throughout the Ch, including in and around the marrow cavity. In sections through the middle of Ch, we observed labeling of a number of large diameter cells of adipocyte morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We therefore employed a Cre-independent approach to independently assess the fate of growth plate chondrocytes. To do so, we expressed a Histone2A-mCherry fusion protein in <italic>col2a1a</italic>+ cells. An advantage of this type of lineage approach is that the levels of Histone2A-mCherry protein, which is stably incorporated into chromatin, reflect those of endogenous <italic>col2a1a</italic> in chondrocytes provided continued cell division does not dilute out the fusion protein. This is in contrast to Cre-mediated approaches in which a strong ubiquitous promoter determines the level of a reporter protein; hence, even low levels of Cre recombinase activity outside of chondrocytes (e.g. in osteochondroprogenitors) can result in strong reporter expression. In zebrafish, <italic>col2a1a</italic> is expressed at high levels in the proliferative zone of the Ch growth plate and then downregulated in the hypertrophic zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>).

As the Ch bone is generated from neural crest-derived cells, we used transplantation of ubiquitously labeled wild-type ectodermal cells into the neural crest precursor domain of unlabeled <italic>mmp9</italic>-/- shield-stage hosts to generate wild-type Ch bones in otherwise mutant hosts. At adult stages, we were able to recover eight mutant recipients with contribution of wild-type cells to chondrocytes of the Ch growth plate.

As a control, transplantation of wild-type neural crest cells into wild-type animals had no effect on Ch growth plate width and adipocyte number. These results indicate that <italic>mmp9</italic> is required in the neural crest lineage, and potentially chondrocytes themselves, for efficient remodeling of the growth plate and the generation of marrow adipocytes from chondrocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite anatomical differences between zebrafish and mammalian bones, we find that growth plate remodeling is remarkably well conserved and thus likely ancestral to bony vertebrates. The zebrafish Ch undergoes a transient breakdown of cortical bone near the growth plates, which coincides with extensive vascularization and an Mmp9-dependent replacement of hypertrophic chondrocytes with fat and bone. Using multiple methods of lineage tracing, including a Cre-independent technique, we show that late-stage hypertrophic chondrocytes generate not only osteoblasts but also marrow adipocytes in zebrafish. Further support for the ability of chondrocytes to generate adipocytes is that delayed growth plate remodeling in <italic>mmp9</italic> mutants results in a paucity of marrow adipocytes in adults. Lastly, we show that hypertrophic chondrocytes re-enter the cell cycle and contribute to <italic>lepr</italic>+ mesenchymal cells, raising the possibility that partial dedifferentiation into proliferative progenitors underlies chondrocyte fate transitions inside endochondral bones.</p><p>As zebrafish have hollow bones that lack hematopoiesis, one possibility was that most if not all of the cortical bone of adult zebrafish would be simply derived from the periosteum. However, we find significant contribution of chondrocyte-derived cells to both the endosteal and periosteal surfaces of the Ch bone, similar to what has been described in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jing et al., 2015</xref>). We also reveal chondrocytes to be a significant source of marrow adipocytes in zebrafish. Although the incomplete conversion efficiency of the CreER lines, as well as the expression of <italic>sox10</italic>:CreER outside of chondrocytes, made it difficult to precisely quantify what proportion of osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes derive from chondrocytes, there are likely other sources for these cells, in particular the periosteum which houses several types of skeletal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings raise the question of whether marrow adipocytes also derive in part from chondrocytes in mammals. Indeed, older studies have demonstrated the ability of murine chondrocytes to differentiate into adipocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heermeier et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hegert et al., 2002</xref>). Further, <italic>Col2a1</italic>:CreER cells converted at postnatal day three in mouse were found to give rise to adipocytes in the metaphyseal bone marrow, although a caveat is that <italic>Col2a1</italic>:CreER marks both chondrocytes and progenitors at early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ono et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The finding that late-stage hypertrophic chondrocytes can re-enter the cell cycle and express <italic>lepr</italic> suggests that at least some of these cells may dedifferentiate into stem-like cells, which subsequently expand in number and differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes. Future molecular profiling of these chondrocyte-derived marrow mesenchymal cells will be needed to better characterize their relationship to previously identified skeletal stem cells. We also cannot rule out that some hypertrophic chondrocytes directly change into adipocytes and/or osteoblasts in the absence of cell division (i.e. ‘transdifferentiation’). Indeed, the detection of osteoblasts with strong <italic>col2a1a</italic>:Histone2A-mCherry signal suggests that in some cases chondrocytes can form osteoblasts with little to no cell division, as otherwise the Histone2A-mCherry signal would have been diluted out with successive cell divisions. On the other hand, osteoblasts farther from the growth plate tended to have weaker Histone2A-mCherry signal, suggesting proliferation of a progenitor intermediate, and we directly observed late-stage hypertrophic chondrocytes undergoing cell division. Whereas it has been suggested in mouse that only chondrocytes near the periosteal surface, that is ‘borderline chondrocytes’, may be capable of lineage plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianco et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maes et al., 2010</xref>), we detected lineage clones containing growth plate chondrocytes, mesenchymal cells, and adipocytes in the central part of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), arguing against such a model.</p><p>A notable feature of <italic>LepR</italic>-lineage cells in mice is that they contribute to osteoblasts and adipocytes primarily in postnatal phases, that is when growth plate remodeling is already underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). It would therefore be interesting to test whether <italic>LepR</italic>-expressing skeletal stem cells have a similar origin from hypertrophic chondrocytes in mammals. One caveat is that we detect endogenous <italic>lepr</italic> expression in both marrow cells and growth plate chondrocytes in zebrafish. However, the more specific labeling of marrow cells by the <italic>LepR</italic>-Cre in mouse likely reflects the Cre insertion being in the long <italic>LepR</italic> isoform (containing exon 18b) that displays more restricted expression than the short isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>). Indeed, <italic>LepR</italic> mRNA and protein has also been reported in chondrocytes of mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoggard et al., 1997</xref>), rat, and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morroni et al., 2004</xref>), a finding we confirmed in the postnatal mouse femur, including the same higher expression in immature versus hypertrophic chondrocytes that we observe in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Without a comparable long-isoform <italic>lepr</italic>-Cre line in zebrafish, we cannot therefore conclude whether zebrafish <italic>lepr</italic>+ marrow cells are comparable to those described in mouse. The future generation of Cre lines to specifically mark <italic>lepr</italic>+ marrow cells in zebrafish will be needed to determine whether these chondrocyte-derived marrow cells also act as stem cells for osteoblasts and adipocytes in post-embryonic fish.</p><p>A similar delay in the remodeling of the hypertrophic zone in mouse <italic>Mmp9</italic> and zebrafish <italic>mmp9</italic> mutants reveals genetic conservation of growth plate remodeling from fish to mammals. In contrast to mice, we find that Mmp9 in zebrafish appears to function primarily in chondrocytes for growth plate remodeling. We also observed rescue of marrow adipocyte number by wild-type chondrocytes, though this had moderate statistical significance (p = 0.06), potentially owing to low sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 8), the mosaic contribution of wild-type cells to the growth plate, and/or roles of cells outside the growth plate to marrow adipocyte generation. In mice, loss of <italic>Mmp13</italic> in chondrocytes does result in a growth plate remodeling delay, with global <italic>Mmp13</italic> deletion enhancing the remodeling defects of <italic>Mmp9</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stickens et al., 2004</xref>). It may be that MMPs are derived from both chondrocytes and invading hematopoietic cells (e.g. osteoclasts), with the relative importance of each cell source varying between zebrafish and mammals. Compensation by <italic>mmp13</italic> might also explain why we detected growth remodeling defects in <italic>mmp9</italic> zebrafish mutants at 21 and 27–31 mm SL stages, but not at 17 mm SL. Mmp9 and Mmp13 have known roles in degrading components of the cartilage extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Page-McCaw et al., 2007</xref>), consistent with our observed loss of collagen-rich matrix in hypertrophic chondrocytes at the edges of the zebrafish growth plate. Secreted Mmp9 may therefore function simply to degrade cartilage matrix and facilitate release of dedifferentiating chondrocytes into the marrow. Intriguingly, Mmp9 has recently been shown to have an additional, non-canonical function in the nucleus for histone H3 tail cleavage. Whereas this has only been demonstrated so far for osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), it remains possible that Mmp9 could have a similar non-canonical function in altering the chromatin structure of hypertrophic chondrocytes to allow them to acquire new potential. In conclusion, our data support conservation of mammalian-like growth plate remodeling in zebrafish, which provides new opportunities for better understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which hypertrophic chondrocytes transform into osteoblasts, marrow adipocytes, and potentially adult skeletal stem cells within endochondral bones.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

H34477) for 15 min and rinsing in embryo medium as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Minchin and Rawls, 2017</xref>). Paraffin embedding and histology were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>). We cut blocks into 5 μm sections on a Shandon Finesse Me+ microtome (cat. no. 77500102) and collected sections on Apex Superior Adhesive slides (Leica Microsystems, cat. no. 3800080). Pentachrome and Trichrome staining were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Movat-Russell modified pentachrome stain kit, Newcomer Supply cat. no. 9150A; Gomori One-Step, Aniline Blue, trichrome stain kit, Newcomer Supply cat. no. 9176A).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization</title><p>For cell proliferations assays, fish were immersed in system water containing 4.5 mg/ml BrdU (Sigma Aldrich, cat. no.

Immunohistochemistry was performed as described except that we blocked with 2% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no. 005-000-121). After cutting thin sections, we performed antigen retrieval by treating slides with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a steamer set (IHC World, cat. no. IW-1102) for 35 min. Primary antibodies include rat anti-BrdU (1:100, Bio-Rad, cat. no. MCA2060GA) and rabbit anti-mCherry (1:250, Novus Biologicals, cat. no. NBP2-25157). We used AlexaFluor secondary antibodies and Hoechst to visualize nuclei. Colorimetric in situ hybridization was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul et al., 2016</xref>). The <italic>mmp9</italic> riboprobe was generated by PCR amplification of zebrafish genomic DNA with primers 5’-GTCTCCAATACTAAAGCTCTGAAGAAG-3’ and 5-‘TAGGATGTCGAAGGTCTATAGAGAATG-3’ and cloning into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Life Technologies). RNA probe was synthesized with T7 polymerase (Roche) after linearizing the plasmid with BamHI restriction. RNAscope probes for <italic>leptin receptor</italic> (<italic>lepr</italic>) and <italic>runx2b</italic> were synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics in Channel 1 and Channel 2, respectively, and for mouse <italic>Lepr</italic> in channel 1. Paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, and the RNAscope fluorescent multiplex v2 assay combined with immunofluorescence was performed according to manufacturer’s protocols and with the ACD HybEZ Hybridization oven.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neural crest transplantations</title><p>At six hpf, donor ectoderm from the animal cap of <italic>bactin2</italic>:loxP-tagBFP-loxP-DsRed embryos was transplanted into the neural crest precursor domain of <italic>mmp9<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hosts as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Crump et al., 2004</xref>).

Focus stacking of multiple images was done in Adobe Photoshop CS5. Fluorescence images were captured on a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope, with representative sections or maximum intensity projections shown as specified. Tiling was performed using ZEN software or manually stitched together using Fiji. Brightness and contrast were adjusted in Adobe Photoshop CS5 with similar settings for experimental and control samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification and statistical analyses</title><p>We stage-matched control and experimental zebrafish by measuring standard body length (SL) from the tip of the snout to the edge of the hypuralia. Adipocyte counts and area/width measurements of growth plates were calculated using Fiji. The proliferative zone of the growth plate was defined as the central region of compact chondrocytes. All measurements were performed blinded to genotype. Statistical significance was determined by a student’s t-test for pair-wise comparisons or Tukey-Kramer HSD tests for multiple comparisons, using GraphPad’s Prism software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Megan Matsutani and Jennifer DeKoeyer Crump for fish care, Francesca Mariani for insightful conversations, David Traver for the <italic>bactin2</italic>:loxP-tagBFP-stop-loxP-DsRed line, and Ken Poss, Leonard Zon, and Rodney Dale for plasmids.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—original draft, Project administration, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Maridas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewing Editor: All agree the work is novel and represents potentially important differences with the more frequently studied mammalian systems. As such there is support for the manuscript. But there are several limitations that need to be addressed in a revision. First a clearer characterization of <italic>LepR</italic>+ cells is required since the authors conclusions differ from the kinetics in mice, raising an important distinction if true between fish and mammals. The comparisons between species however, are further limited by the difference in the <italic>LepR</italic> isoform used in the Cre lines between those of Morrison and in this work. Second, several components of Figure 3 are not clear and raise questions about labeling and timing of 4OHT- this aspect will require more experiments. Third, the results from the <italic>MMP9</italic> mutation are not directly related to the major tenet of the manuscript and the rescue experiments are based on small numbers of fish. Finally, it is conceptually difficult to appreciate the authors conclusions that the marrow adipocytes represent a fat reserve and that hematopoiesis follows later- there are no data to support that assumption. Are the authors suggesting the adipocyte depot represents a place holder for subsequent hematopoiesis?</p><p>As such these four points plus other comments from the reviewers will require more experiments and a comprehensive revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This elegant and well written manuscript describes how chondrocytes in the zebrafish CH cartilage template gives rise to osteoblasts and adipocytes during CH bone maturation. The studies show that the CH cartilage template undergoes remodeling and vascularization during juvenile stages to generate fat-filled bones in the adult. Growth plate chondrocytes re-enter the cell cycle, and express the progenitor cell marker leptin receptor, suggesting dedifferentiation into progenitor cells, and then re-differentiation into osteoblasts, adipocytes and mesenchymal cells within the adult CH.</p><p>This study answers the important question as to whether zebrafish bone arises through invasion of the vasculature and conversion of growth plate cartilage to bone, as occurs in mammals. And also whether hypertrophic chondrocytes directly transform into osteoblast, or do so through a stem cell intermediate. This study identifies growth plate chondrocytes as a source of osteocytes and adipocytes in zebrafish bones, and suggest that dedifferentiation into proliferative progenitors as the likely mechanism.</p><p>The authors describe the bidirectional growth of the zebrafish CH growth plates (in contrast to mammalian unidirectional growth plates in long bones), and use beautiful lineage labeling studies to show chondrocyte clonal cell contributions to mesenchymal cells and adipocytes – and possibly osteoblasts – after growth plate remodeling.</p><p>Multiple approaches are used to demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes and their osteoblast derivatives undergo cell division, indicating a dedifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Conversion of hypertrophic chondrocytes to osteoblasts/adipocytes via transdifferentiation or through partial de-differentiation into a proliferative progenitor was examined using BrdU labeling. The expression of the progenitor cell marker <italic>lepr</italic> was used to monitor hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and de-differentiation into a progenitor cell-like state.</p><p>The authors conclude that growth plate remodeling is a conserved feature of bony vertebrates, and that chondrocyte dedifferentiation is a mechanism to generating osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes in the zebrafish. They also describe roles for <italic>Mmp9</italic>/13 in this process.</p><p>I recommend that this manuscript be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1) Beautiful imaging, well described and careful studies.</p><p>2) The finding that late-stage hypertrophic chondrocytes give rise to osteoblasts and marrow adipocytes in the zebrafish CH.</p><p>3) Chondrocytes also give rise to both endosteal and periosteal surfaces fo the Ch bone, similar to mouse.</p><p>4) Demonstration that <italic>mmp9</italic> is required, in the neural crest cell lineage and perhaps in chondrocytes themselves, for Ch growth plate width, remodeling and adipocyte number, using both <italic>mmp9</italic> mutant and rescue by WT cell transplantation into <italic>mmp9</italic> mutant zebrafish.</p><p>5) The finding that growth plate remodeling is well conserved between mammals and fishes.</p><p>6) Use of three different methods of lineage tracing, including a Cre independent technique, to show that late-stage hypertrophic chondrocytes generate not only osteoblasts but also marrow adipocytes in zebrafish.</p><p>7) The interesting hypothesis that evolutionarily, fish bone marrow may represent the ancestral condition of being primarily a fat reservoir, with hematopoiesis moving into the bone later during tetrapod evolution.</p><p>8) The intriguing hypothesis that <italic>mmp9</italic> may have additional non-canonical function in the nucleus for histone H3 tail cleavage in hypertrophic chondrocytes, as has been demonstrated for osteoclasts.</p><p>9) Discrepancies with the mouse <italic>lepr</italic> expression patterns is discussed, and proposed that this may be due to the more restricted expression of the long <italic>LepR</italic> isoform (mouse) as compared to the short isoform. Direct analyses of the two isoforms in zebrafish is proposed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript elegantly demonstrates the significant contribution of hypertrophic chondrocytes to bone marrow fat in zebrafish. The authors also provide solid data to back their conclusions and suggest a novel mechanism of de-differentiation.</p><p>However, I have two comments about the context and the data presented in this article:</p><p>1) Although they mentioned the possibility that chondrocytes differentiate into adipocytes in mammals in the discussion, the authors missed on placing their findings with the current literature in mammals, notably mouse studies. Murine chondrocytes cultures can differentiate in adipocytes in vitro. Also, Ono et al., 2014, have previously showed that Col2CRE-ER dtomato mice do not show adipocyte labelling at 1 week, 1month or even 1 year after tamoxifen induction. It would be interesting for the authors to mention whether this specific to fish or not.</p><p>2) Would it be possible for the authors to quantify the contribution of chondrocytes to the total number of adipocytes? In other words, what is the ratio of labelled vs non-labelled adipocytes in their adult animals?</p><p>3) Is it possible that WT donor cells coming from WT did not rescue the number of adipocytes in <italic>mmp9</italic> mutants because of the low n in that experiment (i.e. n = 2)? If so, the authors should mention the limitation of a low n.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Giovannone et al. examine the results of neural crest and cartilage lineage tracing in a zebrafish model, that chondrocytes can contribute to mesenchyme in the endosteal compartment. Overall, the observations made here mostly mirror previously published studies in mouse systems. While there are novel insights to be gained from further lineage tracing studies in a zebrafish system to understand if these findings are conserved, the existence of extensive prior literature utilizing this approach in mice generally limits the additional novel insights to be gained unless the findings of this system are pursued in substantial depth, which is largely not the case in the present manuscript.</p><p>A few potentially significant novel observations are made but not followed up upon. For example, the labeling with the <italic>Col2a1</italic> system performed here is very restricted compared with use of similar reagents in mice. This is of interest for suggesting that the presence of chondrocyte-like gene expression signatures in bona fide MSCs is restricted to mammalian systems and therefore a recent evolutionary development. However, this is not explored in sufficient detail to flesh out this possibility and draw clear conclusions on this point. Similarly potentially interesting observations are made regarding the origin of <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cells, however these are not explored in sufficient detail to provide clear answers as to the origin of marrow resident <italic>LEPR</italic> cells. Additional specific comments are described below:</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It is unclear if the timing of 4-OHT administration truly restricts Sox10-cre ERT driven recombination to cartilage and not to other populations of neural crest-derived progenitors of the Ch bone. Indeed, the labeling of the periosteum observed suggests that the latter possibility is more likely. Given that Sox10 may label neural crest-derived mesenchymal progenitors beyond just chondrocytes, the use of Sox10-based lineage tracking is problematic for experiments designed to inform on chondrocyte conversion into osteoblast or adipocyte-lineage cells. The comparison to the broader deletion mediated by the human Sox10-cre is helpful, but does not exclude labeling of other non-cartilage MSC populations. It is appreciated that the <italic>Col2a1</italic> system addresses some of these weaknesses of the Sox10 system.</p><p>2) The images shown in Figure 3E are not convincing that they represent solely labeling of 3 independent clones as the regions of the distinct clones appear to partially overlap in the image available, undercutting the claim of clonal labeling. Titration studies of 4-OHT are needed to establish the dose ranges where clonal labeling is observed. Moreover even with full validation of a dose titration series, it is impossible to be certain that labeling represents true single clone derivatives unless either serial imaging is performed or a multiclone reporter similar to the confetti mouse is used. The suggestion that <italic>col2a1</italic>-mediated labeling is restricted in zebrafish relative to observations made in mice is interesting for suggesting that the presence of a chondrocyte-like gene expression program in MSC populations is restricted to mammals. However, further experiments to directly assess this would be needed to flesh out this possibility.</p><p>3) A major limitation of this study is that it only tracks cells but does not assess their functional contribution to mineralizaiton, for instance by deleting a gene required for mineralization using <italic>Col2a1</italic>-cre in zebrafish and observing the actual phenotypic contribution of post-chondrocyte osteoblasts to skeletal mineralization.</p><p>4) The investigation of cartilage cells as a source of <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cells is primarily of interest for the suggestion that cartilage is the source of the <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cell populations described in mice. However, these part of the manuscript has limitations that prevent it from providing substantial insights into the question of the source of the <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cells as they are described in the murine system.</p><p>Aside from these concerns, one of the notable features of murine <italic>LEPR</italic>-cre marked cells is that <italic>LEPR</italic> generally excludes cells in the growth plate. Thus, the significance of <italic>LEPR</italic> labeling in cartilage in fish for mammalian physiology is unclear. Indeed, the labeling in cartilage appears quite weak relative to the labeling in cells adjacent to bone and it is unclear what degree of signal in this in situ hybridization based system would correspond to the cells marked by <italic>LEPR</italic>-cre in mice. There is also no characterization of the <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cells offered, so it is unclear to what degree these cells observed in zebrafish correspond functionally to murine <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cells. Additionally, a defining feature of murine <italic>LEPR</italic> osteogenic cells is that they do not emerge until adulthood. What are the kinetics of <italic>LEPR</italic>+ cells emerging during the lifetime of the fish?</p><p>5) The work on <italic>MMP9</italic> is not strongly related to the rest of the manuscript. No direct evidence is offered to show that any of the phenotypes seen with the <italic>MMP9</italic> loss of function relate to transdifferentiation of cartilage cells.</p><p>6) In Figure 6, how can it be excluded that the Brdu labeling observed is due to labeling of proliferating chondrocytes that have progressed to the hypertrophic stage by the time of visualization?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42736.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewing Editor: All agree the work is novel and represents potentially important differences with the more frequently studied mammalian systems.

The <italic>mmp9</italic> mutant analysis is used to make two major points. First, it was previously unclear whether fish growth plates undergo the same type of remodeling seen in mammalian bones. A common delay in growth plate remodeling in fish <italic>mmp9</italic> and mouse <italic>Mmp9</italic> mutants therefore supports genetic conservation of remodeling in both species. Second, we show that zebrafish <italic>mmp9</italic> functions in chondrocytes themselves for remodeling. By increasing our <italic>n</italic> number for rescue experiments (from <italic>n=2</italic> to <italic>n=8</italic> in the revision) we now see that restoring <italic>mmp9</italic> in chondrocytes rescuesadipocyte generation (revised Figure 7G).

A re-examination of (Ono et al., 2014) revealed that they did in fact observe adipocyte labeling post-chase –“During an extended chase period over a year after the pulse, Col2<sup>creER</sup>-P3 cells continued to yield chondrocytes, osteoblasts and stromal cells in the metaphysis, and also became adipocytes in the metaphyseal bone marrow (Figure 3C,D and Supplementary Figure 2F)”.

Further, <italic>Col2a1</italic>:CreER cells converted at postnatal day 3 in mouse were found to give rise to adipocytes in the metaphyseal bone marrow, although a caveat is that <italic>Col2a1</italic>:CreER marks both chondrocytes and progenitors at early postnatal stages (Ono et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Would it be possible for the authors to quantify the contribution of chondrocytes to the total number of adipocytes?

First, conversion efficiency is variable in our CreER lines. Second, perhaps due to gene silencing or the small amount of cytoplasm in mature adipocytes, we cannot always definitively detect the reporter allele (converted or unconverted) in all adipocytes. Thus, while we could certainly attempt to quantify the proportion of lineage cells, any quantification would be an under-representation of chondrocyte contribution to adipocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is it possible that WT donor cells coming from WT did not rescue the number of adipocytes in mmp9 mutants because of the low n in that experiment (i.e. n = 2)? If so, the authors should mention the limitation of a low n.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed additional transplantation experiments and have increased our n from 2 to 8, which reveal a strong trend toward rescue of adipocyte numbers (revised Figure 7G).</p><p>“We also observed rescue of marrow adipocyte number by wild-type chondrocytes, though this had moderate statistical significance (p = 0.06), potentially owing to low sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 8), the mosaic contribution of wild-type cells to the growth plate, and/or roles of cells outside the growth plate to marrow adipocyte generation.”</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript, Giovannone et al. examine the results of neural crest and cartilage lineage tracing in a zebrafish model, that chondrocytes can contribute to mesenchyme in the endosteal compartment. Overall, the observations made here mostly mirror previously published studies in mouse systems. While there are novel insights to be gained from further lineage tracing studies in a zebrafish system to understand if these findings are conserved, the existence of extensive prior literature utilizing this approach in mice generally limits the additional novel insights to be gained unless the findings of this system are pursued in substantial depth, which is largely not the case in the present manuscript.</p><p>A few potentially significant novel observations are made but not followed up upon. For example, the labeling with the Col2a1 system performed here is very restricted compared with use of similar reagents in mice. This is of interest for suggesting that the presence of chondrocyte-like gene expression signatures in bona fide MSCs is restricted to mammalian systems and therefore a recent evolutionary development. However, this is not explored in sufficient detail to flesh out this possibility and draw clear conclusions on this point. Similarly potentially interesting observations are made regarding the origin of LEPR+ cells, however these are not explored in sufficient detail to provide clear answers as to the origin of marrow resident LEPR cells. Additional specific comments are described below:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that we had not previously explained key differences in the way the zebrafish <italic>col2a1a</italic>-CreER line was constructed compared to its equivalent in mouse. We now clarify that the col2a1a-CreER transgene was made with a cartilage-specific enhancer that we have extensively validated in a previous study (Askary et al., 2015). This avoids the weak expression of zebrafish <italic>col2a1a</italic> in perichondrium/periosteum, which we now reference. In the future, a zebrafish <italic>col2a1a</italic>-CreER knock-in line that reports full <italic>col2a1a</italic> expression (including in the perichondrium/periosteum) would be needed to test whether <italic>col2a1a</italic>+ MSCs similar to those reported by (Ono et al., 2014) also exist in zebrafish.</p><p>“In mice, <italic>Col2a1</italic>:CreERT2-mediated conversion at embryonic and early postnatal stages broadly labels not only chondrocytes but also osteochondroprogenitors, such as those in the perichondrium and periosteum (Ono et al., 2014). […]Treatment of <italic>col2a1a/B&gt;R</italic> fish with a single dose of 4-OHT at 5 dpf resulted in extensive labeling of <italic>col2a1a-BAC</italic>:GFP+chondrocytes at 12 dpf, but no labeling of the perichondrium, periosteum, and osteoblasts as marked by the <italic>sp7</italic>:GFP transgene (Figure 4A, B; Figure 3—figure supplement 1B).”</p><p>In a new Figure 4A,B, we present additional controls (including high magnification views of the perichondrium) showing co-localization of col2a1a-CreER-converted cells with the chondrocyte marker <italic>col2a1a-BAC</italic>:GFP but not the osteoblast and perichondrium/periosteum marker <italic>sp7</italic>:GFP. These additional controls further validate the use of this CreER line to follow the long-term fates of fish chondrocytes in a specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) It is unclear if the timing of 4-OHT administration truly restricts Sox10-cre ERT driven recombination to cartilage and not to other populations of neural crest-derived progenitors of the Ch bone. Indeed, the labeling of the periosteum observed suggests that the latter possibility is more likely. Given that Sox10 may label neural crest-derived mesenchymal progenitors beyond just chondrocytes, the use of Sox10-based lineage tracking is problematic for experiments designed to inform on chondrocyte conversion into osteoblast or adipocyte-lineage cells. The comparison to the broader deletion mediated by the human Sox10-cre is helpful, but does not exclude labeling of other non-cartilage MSC populations. It is appreciated that the Col2a1 system addresses some of these weaknesses of the Sox10 system.</p><p>2) The images shown in Figure 3E are not convincing that they represent solely labeling of 3 independent clones as the regions of the distinct clones appear to partially overlap in the image available, undercutting the claim of clonal labeling. Titration studies of 4-OHT are needed to establish the dose ranges where clonal labeling is observed. Moreover even with full validation of a dose titration series, it is impossible to be certain that labeling represents true single clone derivatives unless either serial imaging is performed or a multiclone reporter similar to the confetti mouse is used. The suggestion that col2a1-mediated labeling is restricted in zebrafish relative to observations made in mice is interesting for suggesting that the presence of a chondrocyte-like gene expression program in MSC populations is restricted to mammals. However, further experiments to directly assess this would be needed to flesh out this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer about the limitations of using <italic>sox10</italic>:CreER given its additional activity outside chondrocytes (e.g. in the perichondrium). In our hands, conversion with 4OH-T at 14 dpf gave the most robust conversion in cartilage, and we have yet to find a time of 4OH-T treatment that only activates in cartilage. We also acknowledgethe limitations of our original clonal analysis given the overlapping nature of the clones. We have therefore performed new experiments using the multicolor zebrabow reporter, which operates similarly to the confetti mouse. New data in Figure 3F now more clearly support clonal contribution of chondrocytes to adipocytes and putative osteocytes.</p><p>“To more definitively follow growth plate clones, we also examined <italic>sox10</italic>:CreERT2; <italic>ubb</italic>:Zebrabow fish in which 4OH-T treatment at 14 dpf resulted in conversion of RFP (red) to various color combinations of CFP, YFP, and RFP at 23 mm SL. Analysis of uniquely colored clones in the growth plate revealed those that contained both chondrocytes and adjacent adipocytes in the marrow, as well as those that contained chondrocytes and cells embedded in cortical bone, consistent with an osteoblast/osteocyte identity (Figure 3F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A major limitation of this study is that it only tracks cells but does not assess their functional contribution to mineralizaiton, for instance by deleting a gene required for mineralization using Col2a1-cre in zebrafish and observing the actual phenotypic contribution of post-chondrocyte osteoblasts to skeletal mineralization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an informative experiment in the future. Unfortunately at present, precise integration of loxP sites into the zebrafish genome is technically very challenging. To our knowledge, there is only one report to date claiming to have accomplished this (lab of David Grunwald). Even if possible, it would be a lengthy process constructing these fish, and as such we feel attempting this would be well beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The investigation of cartilage cells as a source of LEPR+ cells is primarily of interest for the suggestion that cartilage is the source of the LEPR+ cell populations described in mice. However, these part of the manuscript has limitations that prevent it from providing substantial insights into the question of the source of the LEPR+ cells as they are described in the murine system.</p><p>Aside from these concerns, one of the notable features of murine LEPR-cre marked cells is that LEPR generally excludes cells in the growth plate. Thus, the significance of LEPR labeling in cartilage in fish for mammalian physiology is unclear. Indeed, the labeling in cartilage appears quite weak relative to the labeling in cells adjacent to bone and it is unclear what degree of signal in this in situ hybridization based system would correspond to the cells marked by LEPR-cre in mice. There is also no characterization of the LEPR+ cells offered, so it is unclear to what degree these cells observed in zebrafish correspond functionally to murine LEPR+ cells. Additionally, a defining feature of murine LEPR osteogenic cells is that they do not emerge until adulthood. What are the kinetics of LEPR+ cells emerging during the lifetime of the fish?</p></disp-quote><p>In a new Figure 6—figure supplement 1, we perform <italic>lepr</italic> in situs at 4 additional stages in zebrafish, as well as <italic>Lepr</italic> in situs in mouse. These new data show conserved expression of fish/mouse <italic>Lepr</italic> in growth plate chondrocytes, with strongest expression in the proliferative zone. They also reveal emergence of <italic>lepr</italic>+ marrow cells in zebrafish only after initiation of growth plate remodeling (i.e. at 15, 20, 27 mm stages, but not at 8 and 12 mm). We discuss that this likely reflects the <italic>Lepr</italic>-Cre line only reporting expression of the long-isoform version of <italic>Lepr</italic>.</p><p>“One caveat is that we detect endogenous <italic>lepr</italic> expression in both marrow cells and growth plate chondrocytes in zebrafish. However, the more specific labeling of marrow cells by the <italic>LepR</italic>-Cre in mouse likely reflects the Cre insertion being in the long <italic>LepR</italic> isoform (containing exon 18b) that displays more restricted expression than the short isoform (Zhou, BO et al., 2014). Indeed, <italic>LepR</italic> mRNA and protein has also been reported in chondrocytes of mouse (Hoggard et al., 1997), rat, and human (Morroni et al., 2004), a finding we confirmed in the postnatal mouse femur, including the same higher expression in immature versus hypertrophic chondrocytes that we observe in zebrafish (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>LEPR does not in and of itself specify a skeletal stem cell as mentioned in the text. Rather it labels a heterogeneous population of cells (as shown in Zhou BO et al. 2014) that may include a stem cell subset, though this has yet to be directly addressed experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to provide a more conservative treatment of LEPR as suggested.</p><p>“In mice, <italic>LepR</italic> expression marks a heterogeneous population of cells in endochondral bone, including a putative postnatal skeletal stem cell population (Zhou, BO et al., 2014)… These results are consistent with <italic>lepr</italic>+ cells in the bone marrow deriving from growth plate chondrocytes in zebrafish, although direct evidence will be needed to determine if any of these chondrocyte-derived <italic>lepr+</italic> marrow cells behave as skeletal stem cells in zebrafish.”</p><p>“Without a comparable long-isoform <italic>lepr</italic>-Cre line in zebrafish, we cannot therefore conclude whether zebrafish <italic>lepr</italic>+ marrow cells are comparable to those described in mouse. In the future, the generation of new Cre lines to specifically mark <italic>lepr</italic>+ marrow cells in zebrafish will be needed to determine whether these chondrocyte-derived marrow cells also act as stem cells for osteoblasts and adipocytes in post-embryonic fish.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The work on MMP9 is not strongly related to the rest of the manuscript. No direct evidence is offered to show that any of the phenotypes seen with the MMP9 loss of function relate to transdifferentiation of cartilage cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the <italic>mmp9</italic> mutant data make several points of interest that relate to the manuscript. First, it establishes a similar genetic dependency of growth plate remodeling in zebrafish and mouse. Prior to our work, it was unclear whether mammalian-like growth plate remodeling operated in fish. Combined with the lineage tracing data presented, the similar <italic>mmp9</italic> phenotypes further support conservation. In this revision, we have also performed additional <italic>mmp9</italic> rescue experiments (increasing <italic>n</italic> from 2 to 8), which allow us to conclude that Mmp9 likely functions in chondrocytes for marrow fat production, thus providing additional supporting evidence for the conversion of chondrocytes into adipocytes (see response to reviewer 2 for caveats to this analysis in the revised Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6, how can it be excluded that the Brdu labeling observed is due to labeling of proliferating chondrocytes that have progressed to the hypertrophic stage by the time of visualization?</p></disp-quote><p>We explain in the Materials and methods that fish were treated with BrdU for 1 hour followed by immediate fixation, hence detecting only cells that are actively proliferating or have only very recently divided. Progression of chondrocytes from the proliferative to the hypertrophic stage occurs on the order of days.</p></body></sub-article></article>
