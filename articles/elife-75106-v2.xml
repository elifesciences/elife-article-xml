SRF directly regulates and is required for immediate early gene (IEG) and actin cytoskeleton-related gene expression. SRF coordinates these competing transcription programs through discrete sets of cofactors, the ternary complex factors (TCFs) and myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs). The relative contribution of these two programs to in vivo SRF activity and mutant phenotypes is not fully understood. To study how SRF utilizes its cofactors during development, we generated a knock-in <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele in mice harboring point mutations that disrupt SRF-MRTF-DNA complex formation but leave SRF-TCF activity unaffected. Homozygous <italic>Srf<sup>aI/aI</sup></italic> mutants die at E10.5 with notable cardiovascular phenotypes, and neural crest conditional mutants succumb at birth to defects of the cardiac outflow tract but display none of the craniofacial phenotypes associated with complete loss of SRF in that lineage. Our studies further support an important role for MRTF mediating SRF function in cardiac neural crest and suggest new mechanisms by which SRF regulates transcription during development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SRF</kwd><kwd>MRTF</kwd><kwd>TCF</kwd><kwd>craniofacial development</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE022363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soriano</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DE026678</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dinsmore</surname><given-names>Colin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel allele of serum response factor (SRF) reveals distinct co-factor requirements in different developmental contexts, raising issues of redundancy, threshold requirements, or novel co-factor usage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular development requires the precise management of cellular behaviors including proliferation, migration, and differentiation. These are coordinated through intercellular communication pathways, such as growth factor signaling, that couple extracellular information with internal effectors, including transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). The balance between opposing transcription programs is tuned by signaling pathways which activate specific TFs or in some cases cofactors that direct the behavior of a common TF. One example of the latter is the essential transcription factor Serum Response Factor (SRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>). SRF is necessary for the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in cells stimulated with serum or growth factors, as well as many genes related to the actin cytoskeleton, contractility, and muscle differentiation.</p><p>SRF binds a conserved DNA regulatory sequence known as a CArG box, a motif found at many cytoskeletal and growth-factor inducible gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mohun et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Norman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sun et al., 2006b</xref>). SRF can, however, effect at least two unique transcriptional programs by coupling with two families of cofactors that compete for a common binding site on SRF itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2004</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The ternary complex factors (TCFs) are E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family proteins activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mylona et al., 2016</xref>). Once activated, they bind DNA and promote cellular proliferation by transcribing IEGs in coordination with SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esnault et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gualdrini et al., 2016</xref>). There are three TCF members in mouse and human: ELK1, ELK3/NET, and ELK4/SAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>). Opposing SRF-TCF activity are the Myocardin Related Transcription Factors (MRTFs). These cofactors rely on SRF to bind DNA, promote cytoskeletal gene expression, and are particularly important in muscle differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>). MRTFs bind to and are inhibited by G-actin. Polymerization of G-actin into F-actin liberates MRTFs to translocate to the nucleus and bind SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miralles et al., 2003</xref>). This can be promoted by multiple signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), that stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange factors to activate F-actin-promoting Rho-family GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brachmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanna and El-Sibai, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiménez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). MRTFs are also positively and negatively regulated by extensive phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Panayiotou et al., 2016</xref>). Three MRTFs are known to interact with SRF: Myocardin itself, MRTF-A/MKL1/MAL, and MRTF-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parmacek, 2007</xref>). <italic>Myocd</italic> is expressed specifically in muscle while <italic>Mrtfa</italic> and <italic>Mrtfb</italic> are more broadly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>). A fourth MRTF, MAMSTR/MASTR, interacts with MEF2 proteins and is not known to bind SRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creemers et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Srf in NC affects cytoskeletal gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting SRF, its TCF and MRTF cofactors, and the upstream signals that regulate them.

However, studies comparing <italic>Srf</italic> and <italic>Mrtfa; Mrtfb</italic> mutants are not always identical.

Whether the differences in <italic>Srf</italic> versus <italic>Mrtfa; Mrtfb</italic> loss-of-function studies are due to SRF-TCF activity, SRF-independent MRTF activity, or TCF/MRTF-independent SRF activity remains uncertain. These studies are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>One tissue in which SRF was found to be essential is the neural crest (NC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newbern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). The NC is a transient developmental population of cells that arises from the dorsal neural tube, migrates ventrally throughout the embryo, and gives rise to numerous cell types including the bone and connective tissue of the face, as well as smooth muscle cells in the cardiac outflow tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bronner and Simões-Costa, 2016</xref>). The extensive migration, proliferation, and various differentiation outcomes these cells undergo requires accurate coordination, and decades of study have revealed a panoply of signaling pathways and transcription factors important in these processes, including the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway, and SRF itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dinsmore and Soriano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newbern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rogers and Nie, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tallquist and Soriano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). We and others have previously shown that <italic>Srf</italic> is required in the NC for craniofacial and cardiovascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newbern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, mice homozygous for a hypomorphic allele of <italic>Mrtfb</italic> die shortly after birth with cardiac outflow tract defects and can be rescued by a neural crest-specific transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2005b</xref>). Assays in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells (MEPMs) indicated that stimulation with the secreted ligands fibroblast growth factor (FGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) promoted SRF-TCF complex formation, but only PDGF promoted SRF-MRTF interactions, in a PI3K-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). Supporting the importance of SRF-MRTF interactions, <italic>Srf</italic> interacted genetically with <italic>Pdgfra</italic> but not <italic>Fgfr1</italic> in NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>). However, the contributions of each SRF-cofactor transcriptional program to the overall <italic>Srf</italic> NC phenotype are unclear.</p><p>In this study, we further characterize the molecular consequences of losing <italic>Srf</italic> expression in the NC through marker analysis and expression profiling, finding the most highly downregulated genes to be cytoskeletal in nature. We then test the presumed requirement of SRF-MRTF interactions using a novel <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele carrying mutations that prevent SRF-MRTF-DNA ternary complex formation to circumvent MRTF redundancy and control for possible SRF-independent MRTF activity. These embryos have striking developmental defects that are outwardly similar to <italic>Myocd</italic> mutant mice. Conditional NC mutants reveal an essential role for optimal SRF-MRTF activity in the cardiac crest, whereas the mutation is well-tolerated in the cranial NC. These observations raise the possibility that non-cardiovascular tissue may be able to develop with only minimal SRF-MRTF activity or that SRF can support cytoskeletal gene expression on its own or with other cofactors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup> mice develop a midfacial cleft and bleb, characterized by reduced cytoskeletal gene expression</title><p>To establish a phenotypic baseline for embryos lacking <italic>Srf</italic> in NC, we first examined conditional null embryos at E11.5 and E12.5 and assessed their morphology.

To determine the underlying cause of cyanosis, we examined the cardiac outflow tract at P0 as the smooth muscle in this region is NC-derived and responsible for proper remodeling of the aortic arch vessels during development. We found a highly penetrant (9/14) patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) exclusively in <italic>Srf<sup>aI/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> neonates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). In this condition, the embryonic shunt from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, the ductus arteriosus, fails to close after birth, making circulation to the lungs inefficient and likely explaining the postnatal cyanosis. We also noted one instance of aberrant right subclavian artery, in which the right subclavian artery originates from the descending aorta instead of the brachiocephalic artery, which only supplies the right common carotid artery in this condition. We also inspected P0 mice from a similar cross on a <italic>Pdgfra<sup>H2B-EGFP/+</sup></italic> background to assess whether heterozygosity for <italic>Pdgfra</italic> would exacerbate phenotypes at this stage, but neonates were recovered in the expected Mendelian ratios with similar outflow tract defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Two <italic>Srf<sup>aI/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup>; Pdgfra<sup>+/+</sup></italic> from this set of crosses displayed a more severe outflow tract defect: right aortic arch with mirror image branching (2/9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, far right).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>NC Srf<sup>aI</sup> conditional mutants succumb postnatally with outflow tract defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kaplan-Meyer survival curve for neonatal <italic>Srf<sup>aI/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> (Mutant) compared to littermates of all other genotypes (Control).

These cofactors, in turn, are regulated both by specific expression patterns (e.g. <italic>Myocd</italic> specifically in muscle) and by signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2 and PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Posern and Treisman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We sought to better understand the relationship between SRF, its cofactors, and mutant phenotypes in both a general and a tissue-specific manner.</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated a requirement for <italic>Srf</italic> in the NC lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</xref>), so we first investigated how loss of SRF in this tissue affected gene expression. We found normal early NC patterning but misexpression of cytoskeleton-related genes in <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2E</xref>). Comparing the DEGs with known SRF and cofactor targets showed particular enrichment for MRTF targets in our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-G</xref>), consistent with SRF’s well-known function regulating cytoskeletal genes and the dominant role of MRTF cofactors in the serum response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esnault et al., 2014</xref>). To test the supposition that SRF-MRTF activity would be the main driver of NC SRF activity, we made a new <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> mouse model harboring point mutations that specifically disrupt SRF-MRTF-DNA complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zaromytidou et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Homozygous <italic>Srf<sup>aI/aI</sup></italic> embryos died at E10.5 with defects in the yolk sac vasculature, heart, and neural tube and exhibited reduced F-actin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Both the timing of lethality and gross appearance of the embryos strongly resemble <italic>Myocd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2003</xref>). The phenotype is much less severe than <italic>Srf<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, however, which die around E7.5 and fail to induce mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arsenian et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Niu et al., 2005</xref>). Expression of the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele specifically in the <italic>Mesp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mesodermal lineage also resulted in lethality at E10.5 and defects almost as severe as complete loss of <italic>Srf</italic> in this same lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The similarity of the two alleles in the <italic>Mesp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> lineage compared against their strikingly different phenotypes in gastrula-stage embryos suggested there may be time or tissue specific requirements for SRF-MRTF activity.</p><p>We went on to test the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele in the NC lineage, where we presumed it would be critically important. Similar to the early embryo, expression of the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele was well tolerated in NC and we found no facial cleft or bleb in our <italic>Srf<sup>aI/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> mice, as in <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The allele also failed to interact genetically with <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in this lineage, suggesting PDGF signaling may rely on MRTF-independent SRF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Nevertheless, this mutation in NC does have a profound developmental effect as <italic>Srf<sup>aI/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> mice completed gestation but died by postnatal day 2 with visible cyanosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Examination of the cardiac outflow tract revealed numerous defects including PDA, right aortic arch, and one instance of VSD with PTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). This result is reminiscent of mice with a hypomorphic gene trap mutation in <italic>Mrtfb</italic> and mice carrying a conditional deletion of <italic>Myocd</italic> in the NC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2005b</xref>), both of which result in early postnatal lethality due to defects in outflow tract development. Similarly, NC conditional <italic>Srf</italic> mutants on a genetic background that permitted later development exhibit outflow tract defects at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Newbern et al., 2008</xref>). These studies and our own results together highlight a critical role for SRF-MRTF interactions in cardiac NC development. A summary of the tissue-specific sensitivities we found to loss of <italic>Srf</italic> or <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> expression is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>.</p><p>We considered three possible explanations for the tolerance of the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele in NC and early embryo, which are not mutually exclusive: (i) that TCFs are more important than previously recognized or are redundant with MRTFs in some respects, (ii) that different tissues may have different thresholds for SRF-MRTF activity and that our point mutant may interact differently with different MRTF family members, and (iii) that SRF may utilize cofactors other than MRTFs and TCFs or have cofactor-independent (i.e. basal) activity sufficient to support development in some contexts.</p><p>The first possibility is that TCF factors play a more important role than previously thought or can act redundantly with MRTFs. Because TCF triple mutant embryos survive until E14.5 without obvious morphological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costello et al., 2010</xref>), we find it unlikely that TCF-specific activity could explain the tolerance of <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> during gastrulation or in NC. However, it has been shown that some SRF targets can be bound and regulated by both MRTF and TCF factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esnault et al., 2014</xref>), raising the possibility of cofactor redundancy. Yet, most studies to date indicate that rather than acting redundantly, MRTFs and TCFs mediate distinct and opposing phenotypic outcomes, contractility and proliferation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gualdrini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, a potential result of this competition is that the consequences of suppressing SRF-MRTF interactions could vary according to the level of TCF expression in a given cell type. While we cannot rule out the possibility that TCFs are the primary SRF cofactors in NC or function redundantly to MRTFs without further genetic experiments, this explanation is difficult to reconcile with the existing literature. Although there is no known <italic>Srf</italic> allele that blocks TCF binding while leaving MRTF binding unperturbed, the V194E mutation (V189E in mouse) disrupts SRF interaction with both cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ling et al., 1998</xref>). Generating a mouse model of this allele would shed considerable light on the question of TCF/MRTF redundancy.</p><p>A second explanation is that non-muscle lineages may be able to function with minimal, but not zero, SRF-MRTF activity. It is possible that the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele substantially impairs but does not eliminate SRF-MRTF-DNA complex formation and functions as a hypomorph. In vitro gel shift assays for SRF-MRTF-DNA complex formation using purified components and single molecule imaging of SRF in cells both indicate a substantial disruption of SRF-MRTF activity for this allele, but the gel shift experiments that first characterized these mutations detected 5–10% residual complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zaromytidou et al., 2006</xref>). Our own data demonstrate that homozygous <italic>Srf<sup>aI/aI</sup></italic> embryos grossly phenocopy <italic>Myocd<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and <italic>Srf<sup>aI/flox</sup>; Mesp1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Mesp1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> embryos were similar, though not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, double conditional mutants for <italic>Mrtfa/Mrtfb</italic> largely <italic>do</italic> phenocopy <italic>Srf</italic> conditional mutants in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cenik et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Trembley et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we may be observing differing dosage requirements for SRF-MRTF activity in distinct tissues. Muscle lineages, such as cardiovascular cells affected by <italic>Mesp1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and NC-derived outflow tract smooth muscle affected by <italic>Wnt1-Cre,</italic> may need optimal SRF-MRTF output and are therefore strongly affected by the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele. Non-muscle lineages such as the cranial NC may survive and develop properly with only residual SRF-MRTF transcription. The <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele might more strongly suppress Myocardin compared to MRTFA/B, which could also contribute to the tissue-specific requirements we observe. Two predictions of this threshold model are that conditional ablation of <italic>Mrtfa/Mrtfb</italic> in NC would phenocopy conditional loss of <italic>Srf</italic> and that <italic>Mrtfa/</italic>Mrtfb double mutant embryos should succumb around E7.5 as <italic>Srf</italic> null embryos do. Conversely, non-muscle lineages where conditional ablation of <italic>Mrtfa/Mrtfb</italic> yields <italic>Srf</italic>-like phenotypes, such as podocytes and epicardium, should be indifferent to the <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> mutations.</p><p>The issue of SRF tissue-specific dosage effects may have relevance to human disease. A recent study performed targeted sequencing of <italic>SRF</italic> in nonsyndromic conotruncal heart defect patients and identified two novel mutations with reduced transcriptional output, one from a patient with VSD and the other with Tetralogy of Fallot with right aortic arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mengmeng et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, tuning of SRF output may modulate disease in a tissue-specific manner. Along these lines, mutations in <italic>MYOCD</italic> cause congenital megabladder and associated cardiovascular phenotypes such as PTA and VSD in humans, but monoallelic mutations affect only males whereas biallelic mutations affect both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Houweling et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, heterozygosity for <italic>FLNA</italic>, a gene we found strongly affected by loss of <italic>Srf</italic> in mouse NC, causes the human disease Periventricular Heterotopia I and affected females present with PDA, whereas hemizygous males die during gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox et al., 1998</xref>). Intriguingly, NC-specific conditional knockout of <italic>Flna</italic> causes perinatal lethality with outflow tract defects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2006</xref>). It would be interesting to further explore the notion of tissue-specific thresholds for SRF-cofactor complexes in future studies.</p><p>A third explanation is that SRF functions with additional factors that regulate gene expression independent of or redundantly with MRTFs (and/or TCFs) or has sufficient basal activity to support development in some tissues. Although MRTFs and TCFs are the most well-studied SRF cofactors, many other TFs have been shown to interact with SRF, including but not limited to Homeodomain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grueneberg et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shin et al., 2002</xref>), GATA factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belaguli et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morin et al., 2001</xref>), and Forkhead-family transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freddie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2005</xref>), as well as the Initiator-binding protein TFII-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grueneberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 1998</xref>). Many of these studies were performed in muscle cells and it is unclear which cofactors might act independently of MRTFs. However, several of these genes or their orthologues are expressed in the cranial NC at E10.5 and E11.5, when cleft formation begins in <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Minoux et al., 2017</xref>). One candidate is the homeodomain protein PRRX1/PHOX1/MHOX, which was shown to form complexes with SRF mediated by TFII-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grueneberg et al., 1997</xref>). Double mutants for <italic>Prrx1</italic> and its orthologue <italic>Prrx2</italic> have defects of the craniofacial skeleton, aortic arch arteries, and ductus arteriosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergwerff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lu et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Gtf2i</italic> mutants (the gene encoding TFII-I) rarely survive past E10.5 but can exhibit a facial cleft, hemorrhaging, and hypoplastic pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Enkhmandakh et al., 2009</xref>). Whether SRF mediates transcription on its own, independently of MRTFs and TCFs, or perhaps using additional tissue-specific cofactors, would be exciting to determine.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that the primary transcriptional consequence of losing <italic>Srf</italic> in NC was a defect in actin cytoskeleton-related gene expression. Using a novel <italic>Srf<sup>aI</sup></italic> allele to perturb SRF’s interactions with MRTFs, the primary cofactors regulating the cytoskeletal transcription program, we uncovered a crucial role for SRF-MRTF activity in the cardiac NC, but surprisingly found the mutation well-tolerated in the cranial NC. Further study will be necessary to determine the relevant SRF-cofactor ensembles in different developmental contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Homology arms of 2 kb and 6.4 kb were cloned into the pPGKneoF2L2DTA backbone. The longer arm was assembled in three fragments using HiFi assembly cloning (NEB) and included a 3 x FLAG tag introduced with a primer. Fragments were amplified from 129S4 genomic DNA using Q5 polymerase (NEB) except for the middle segment of the long arm (i.e. the coding sequence of exon 1), which was amplified from a cDNA clone before or after introducing the αI helix mutations via site-directed mutagenesis. The targeting constructs were linearized and electroporated in AK7 (129S4 lineage) embryonic stem cells. Clones were selected with G418, screened by long-range PCR, and verified by Southern blot. Correctly targeted clones were injected into C57BL6/J E3.5 blastocysts, transferred to pseudopregnant F1 (C57BL6/J X 129S4) surrogates, and chimeras selected based on coat color.

If the given species lacked a hit for a particular search, the search was repeated for the entire taxon. Ctenophora were searched using amino acid sequences for mouse SRF and MEF2C, yeast MCM2, snapdragon Deficiens, and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Agamous.

A total of eight embryos across two litters representing four mutants and four controls were collected. Total RNA was immediately extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by Tapestation and all samples had RIN scores ≥ 9.8. Samples were sent to GeneWiz for PE150 sequencing. There were 14.6–30 m reads / sample and an average of 24.2 m reads / sample.</p><p>Reads were pseudo-aligned to the mouse transcriptome (mm10 partial selective alignment method, downloaded from refgenie) using salmon 1.5.0 and the flags –validateMappings –gcBias –numBootstraps 30. Pseudoalignments were processed with wasabi 1.0.1 and analyzed with sleuth 0.30.0–4 with the flag gene_mode = true. Analysis was performed using a full model that accounted for genotype, litter/batch, and tissue-of-origin (for combined tissue analysis only) versus a reduced model consisting only of litter/batch (and tissue-of-origin). Fold-changes and q-values were computed using the Wald test. Volcano plots were made with VolcaNoseR. Heat maps were generated using the Shinyapp HeatMappr. Gene set enrichment analysis for GO terms, ENCODE datasets, etc. were done with the web utility Enrichr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). Enrichment for a custom list of targets was performed using GSEA software 4.10 and normalized read counts for the entire dataset. Analysis for the joint tissue model was run in phenotype mode ( &gt; 7 samples per condition) and for the individual tissue samples in gene_set mode ( &lt; 7 samples per condition) according to the software developer. The maximum number of genes per set was raised to 800 to accommodate the target lists. All other parameters were default.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MEPM culture</title><p>Mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells were generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2017</xref>). Briefly, palatal shelves were dissected from E13.5 embryos in ice cold PBS using fine forceps. Yolk sac tissue was used for genotyping. Palates from individual embryos were held on ice until dissection was complete and palates were then dissociated using 0.125% Trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 10 min with occasional trituration using a P1000 pipet. Trypsin was neutralized with an equal volume of growth media (DMEM High Glucose supplemented with Glutamine, Penicillin-Streptomycin, and 10% Fetal Calf III serum) and plated onto culture dishes coated in 0.1% gelatin. Cells were passaged as they approached confluency, every 2–3 days, and used for experiments at passage 2. MEPM cell lines were not screened for mycoplasma as they were used and extinguished by passage 2, but there was no evidence of mycoplasma by DAPI staining and other immortalized cell lines used in the lab tested negative for mycoplasma, so the risk of contamination was negligible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>MEPM cells were seeded on #1.5 coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin. For starvation experiments, cells were starved overnight in 0.1% serum then stimulated 30’ with 10% serum. Cells were fixed using 4% PFA in PBS for 10’ at 37 °C. Embryos were dissected in ice cold PBS, fixed one hour in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C, rinsed in PBS, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and embedded in OCT. Sections were cut at 10 µm thickness using a Leica cryostat. Yolk sacs were fixed one hour in 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C and stained whole. All samples were rinsed in PBS, blocked and permeabilized in blocking media (PBS, 0.3% TritonX-100, 1% BSA, 5% calf serum) one hour at RT, primary antibody was diluted in fresh blocking media and samples treated overnight at 4 °C, washed 3 x PBS at RT, incubated in Alexa Fluor Plus-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500 in fresh blocking media with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 1–2 hr at RT or overnight at 4 °C, and finally washed 3 x in PBS at RT. Samples were mounted in Prolong Diamond (Invitrogen) mounting media and imaged on a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss 780 upright confocal microscope. Thresholding was performed and scalebars added in the FIJI implementation of ImageJ. All images for a given experiment were processed identically with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> where the mutant embryos were brightened compared to the control embryo to better illustrate phenotypes.</p><p>Quantitation of cell proliferation and cell death was performed by staining frozen sections with the indicated antibodies. Sections at the level of the heart were imaged using a 10 x objective on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope, a 1024 × 1024 pixel count and 6 μm step size. Tiling was used with 10% overlap when necessary to image the entire section. Maximum intensity projections were made in the FIJI implementation of ImageJ and identical thresholds used for each embryo to calculate the DAPI-positive and cleaved Caspase 3-positive or phospho-Histone H3 (Ser 10)-positive area on sections at the level of the heart. Any of the embryo’s posterior present in the section was ignored as this region was not present in all sections for all embryos.</p><p>Antibodies used were, rat anti-CD31 (BD Pharmingen, 553370) 1:50, rabbit anti-cleaved Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling 9665, 1:400), rabbit anti-phospho Histone H3 (Ser10) (Millipore 06–570, 1:500), rabbit anti-MKL1 (Proteintech, 21166–1-AP) 1:100, rabbit anti-SMA (Cell Signaling, 19245) 1:200.

Embryo facial prominences were dissected in cold PBS and transferred to 1.5 ml microfuge tubes on ice. Following the indicated stimulation regimes when applicable, cells/tissue were lysed in 300 μl RLT buffer supplemented with BME, and RNA isolated using the RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was quantified using a Nanodrop. One μg total RNA was used for reverse transcription. RNA was primed using a 2:1 molar ratio of random hexamer and polydT (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed with Superscript IV (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture’s protocol. Resulting cDNA was diluted 5 x with water and stored at –20 °C. One μl cDNA was used per qPCR reaction. qPCR was performed using Luna 2 x Master Mix (NEB) on an iQ5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad) in triplicate.

Specific points to address:</p><p>Figure 1. This revisits the 2014 GD data for the Wnt1-cre SRF knockout. Its real value for this study would be to act as a control for analysis of the Wnt1-cre SRF-alpha1 mutant, but this is not done. This is important, because it may give insights into potential gene expression differences between the null and SRF-alpha1. The authors should do this experiment.</p><p>Figure 4. While serum stimulation is of interest, a more pertinent analysis, given the fact that there is no genetic interaction bewteen SRF-alpha1 and PDGFR, would be to look at PDGF stimulation, either in this system or MEPMs. What happens? Are there differences between Wnt1-cre SRF KO and SRF-alpha1?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors suggest in the discussion that TCF factors may compensate for loss of SRF-MRTF activity. Could the authors provide some in vivo staining to show the expression patterns of genes involved in these two complexes? Although bulk-RNAseq data shows that these two complexes are both involved in samples collected from the craniofacial region, it's hard to conclude whether these two complexes could compensate for each other without information about their in vivo expression patterns.</p><p>2. Defects of the neural tube are not visible in Figures 2A and 2C. Could the authors adjust the orientation of the samples for better visualization and clarification of the phenotype?</p><p>3. Since MRTF-A translocated to the nucleus in response to serum in control and mutant cell lines, the authors need to provide explanation as to why there are no differences observed in control groups with/without serum?</p><p>4. Bulk RNA-seq analysis using tissue from Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup> mice strongly suggests that the SRF-MRTF complex plays a critical role in craniofacial development. Therefore, the authors generated Srf αl mice, in which they mutated the αI helix of the SRF DNA-binding domain to disrupt SRF-MRTF complex formation while leaving SRF-TCF-DNA complex formation unaffected. However, in the neural crest conditional mutant (Srf<sup>αI/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup>) mice, the defects were detected not in the craniofacial tissues but in cardiac development. Could the authors provide more explanation for these results? Are there downstream genes targeted by both SRF-MRTF and SRF-TCF in the craniofacial tissues so that the SRF-TCF complex can compensate for the lost function of the SRF-MRTF complex?</p><p>5. Why did the authors study the function of SRF-MRTF in the mesoderm-derived lineage? Is this an attempt to show the efficiency of the Srf<sup>αI/al</sup> model? Do Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup> mice have outflow tract defects?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75106.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Page 4: it would be nice to show a supplementary a table with the summary of the phenotypes of the co-factor knock outs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and now include these phenotypes as Supplementary Table 1.

One could imagine the change in beta-catenin levels to be caused through direct transcriptional regulation, through altered cytoskeletal behavior (speculatively, by increased recruitment and/or stabilization at junctions in an attempt to compensate for reduced F-actin levels or through altered cadherin levels), or by changes in beta-catenin protein’s stability, most obviously through a change in canonical Wnt activity. Increased canonical Wnt signaling should lead to beta-catenin stabilization or alternately, increased beta-catenin stabilization might ectopically activate or increase sensitivity to Wnt. We note that the enhanced beta-catenin expression remained enriched at cell junctions and did not build up within the nucleus. Further, we did not detect a strong Wnt signature in our RNA-seq studies. However, we realize nuclear beta-catenin levels can be difficult to detect (<italic>Apc</italic> mutants can show stabilized junctional, not nuclear, beta-catenin, e.g. Buchert et al., 2010) and a Wnt phenotype may be specific to the <italic>Srf<sup>αI</sup></italic> allele or the early embryo and not neural crest. However, the existence, strength, and mechanism of this effect in the context of our <italic>Srf</italic> mutant remains unclear. Several reports have suggested a link between <italic>Srf</italic> and the Wnt pathway including the suppression of SRF-mediated IEG expression by Wnt, Wnt regulation of <italic>Mrtfa</italic> expression, SRF-mediated regulation of Wnt pathway targets, and phosphorylation of SRF by GSK3 promoting SRF-MRTF activity. Most intriguingly, one study found an effect on Wnt through SRF-mediated expression of a microRNA that regulates EMT and E-Cadherin, indirectly affecting beta-catenin localization. However, after considering these numerous potential explanations, we feel this result might be more distracting than helpful in the present manuscript. We hope to include this result in a future manuscript where the connections between SRF, adherens junctions, beta-catenin, and potentially the Wnt pathway can be explored – and tested – in greater detail. Therefore, we have opted to remove those two panels from the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Page 13, line 285. Please add a sentence describing the interpretation of the findings in this paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a clause explaining that we expected MRTF-A’s localization to be unaffected by our mutations in <italic>Srf</italic>. The upstream actin dynamics and signaling pathways that regulate MRTFs should remain intact in our point mutant background. There was a formal possibility that mutating <italic>Srf</italic> could cause an indirect change in the pathways that control MRTF localization. If this were true, we might interpret transcriptional changes as being due to the failure of SRF<sup>αI</sup> to interact with MRTF, when in fact it may be due to the unexpected failure of MRTF to translocate to the nucleus at all. We agree that in the original manuscript, ending the paragraph with a rather bluntly (un)explained control experiment was confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Line 398: typo: but not does…</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.

We added further description of the experiment to clarify this matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) How do the authors explain that the gene expression changes are the same between the null and the point mutation mutant but the phenotypes are different? Are very subtle gene expression changes enough to cause the phenotypic differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this confusing point. We found strong phenotypic and gene expression changes in cultured MEPM cells derived from the <italic>Srf<sup>αI</sup></italic> conditional mutants (Figure 4). <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> conditional (<italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>) mutants do not survive long enough to culture similar MEPM cells. The gene expression experiments in Figure 1 were from E11.5 craniofacial tissue. To conduct a comparison of these two genetic models using an identical tissue source and assay, we performed RT-qPCR from E11.5 <italic>Srf<sup>αI/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup> Wnt1-Cre</italic> conditional mutants and littermate controls. We find that the cytoskeletal genes we assayed were downregulated in both models, but more strongly in the conditional knockouts than in the conditional point mutants. This likely explains the different phenotypes: there is one threshold for failure in the craniofacial crest (and possibly also the gastrula-stage embryo) and another for failure in the cardiac crest (which forms smooth muscle) and the <italic>Mesp1</italic> mesodermal lineage. However, whether this expression is due to residual MRTF activity or transcription of the same targets supported by other cofactors remains to be determined. We have now added these important data as figure 4E-F and commented where relevant, although these data ultimately do not substantially change the possible mechanistic interpretations covered in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I strongly support publication of this paper, with some modifications.

The <italic>Srf<sup>lox/lox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre</italic> mice do not survive long enough on our genetic background to generate MEPMs and compare directly with the cells in Figure 4. We were also concerned that repeating the RNA-Seq analysis on the conditional point mutants would take an excessive amount of time. However, we agree that a side-by-side assessment of the two models in NC at the level of gene expression, rather than phenotype, was warranted and therefore performed RT-qPCR on several of the most differentially regulated genes from our RNA seq on freshly isolated E11.5 craniofacial prominences from both conditional point mutant and conditional knockout embryos (Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014). We find a reduction in gene expression in both models, but the effect is roughly 2x more profound in the conditional knockouts. We think this is consistent with the observed phenotype. The residual gene expression must be sufficient in craniofacial NC (and perhaps gastrula) but not in <italic>Mesp1</italic> or cardiac NC lineages. The qPCR data are now included as Figure 4E-F and the Discussion has been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4.

The <italic>Srf</italic> NC conditional mutants do not survive long enough on our genetic background to generate MEPMs. Some experiments were performed in our previous study using cultured <italic>Srf</italic> conditional knockout cells derived from an earlier timepoint, but these were only immunofluorescent experiments on a small number passage 0 cells, as these cells did not take well to culture. The experiment could best be done by crossing the relevant alleles into an immortalized background such as <italic>Ink4a</italic> or generating <italic>Srf</italic> null and point mutant cell lines in an already immortalized but otherwise wild type cell line via CRISPR. However, generating these materials would take a longer amount of time than can be expected for the manuscript revision.<italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Some of these data were presented in a previous publication (Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014). We also now include previously published RNA-Seq data on sorted NC cells, whole palate, and passage 2 MEPM cells showing co-expression of <italic>Srf</italic> and its cofactors in these cells and tissues in Figure 1 Supplement 2E, as well as our own bulk RNA seq data for the same genes, showing a similar pattern. We attempted to perform immunofluorescent staining for cofactors in frozen sections but did not obtain convincing staining, possibly due to the lower relative expression levels of ELK1 and MRTFA, which have the most well-validated antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Defects of the neural tube are not visible in Figures 2A and 2C. Could the authors adjust the orientation of the samples for better visualization and clarification of the phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the images were rather dim and small in the initial version of the figure. Therefore, we have first readjusted the brightness of the mutant embryos in figure 2A. They were initially imaged and thresholded identically to the control, but as they are smaller with fewer cells, this resulted in a dimmer image. We readjusted them (and added a note to the Methods section) and added arrowheads pointing out the phenotypes. We think the open neural tube/exencephaly and wavy neural tube are now much easier to see. Second, we added a new set of panels where two of the E9.5 embryos were reimaged at a higher magnification using a confocal microscope. The pharyngeal arch defect and open midbrain are now much clearer. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Since MRTF-A translocated to the nucleus in response to serum in control and mutant cell lines, the authors need to provide explanation as to why there are no differences observed in control groups with/without serum?</p></disp-quote><p>See response to reviewer 1, point 6. Briefly, MRTF translocation should be unaffected, but once in the nucleus it should have reduced or absent formation of a productive SRF-MRTF-DNA ternary complex with our SRF point mutant compared to wild type SRF. The experiment was a control that nothing upstream was unexpectedly affected. We added clarification in the manuscript on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Bulk RNA-seq analysis using tissue from Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup> mice strongly suggests that the SRF-MRTF complex plays a critical role in craniofacial development. Therefore, the authors generated Srf αl mice, in which they mutated the αI helix of the SRF DNA-binding domain to disrupt SRF-MRTF complex formation while leaving SRF-TCF-DNA complex formation unaffected. However, in the neural crest conditional mutant (Srf<sup>αI/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup>) mice, the defects were detected not in the craniofacial tissues but in cardiac development. Could the authors provide more explanation for these results? Are there downstream genes targeted by both SRF-MRTF and SRF-TCF in the craniofacial tissues so that the SRF-TCF complex can compensate for the lost function of the SRF-MRTF complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed RT-qPCR testing of <italic>Srf<sup>αI/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup></italic> to get a better comparison of gene expression differences in NC among the two alleles and find downregulation of actin cytoskeletal genes in both models, but to a lesser degree in the point mutant compared to the conditional knockout. Whether this is due to TCF compensation (it has been suggested that TCF and MRTF coregulate some targets), residual MRTF function, and/or TCF/MRTF-independent SRF function is unknown at this time, but we discuss these possibilities within the Discussion. We have reorganized the Discussion section to incorporate ideas raised by reviewer 2 and we hope this makes these points more clearly. Reviewer 2 suggested several excellent experiments to test these ideas including generation of an <italic>Srf<sup>V194E</sup></italic> allele that should disrupt both TCF and MRTF interactions. Another good test would be conditional ablation of <italic>Mrtfa/b</italic> in the NC. We are excited to pursue these possibilities going forward but agree with reviewer 2 that these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript. Finally, to address the reviewer’s question concerning craniofacial vs cardiac phenotypes, it seems likely given the strong effect in the <italic>Mesp1</italic> lineage and SRF’s known role in muscle that the <italic>Srf<sup>αI</sup></italic> allele has a particularly strong effect in the cardiac crest because these cells mostly differentiate into smooth muscle, whereas craniofacial NC cells become other cell types such as bone, cartilage, neurons, glia, melanocytes, and dermal mesenchyme. Therefore, a threshold effect is likely at work where cells requiring high levels of actin-related gene expression (i.e. muscle) are more affected by <italic>Srf<sup>αI</sup></italic> than those that require more modest expression levels. Further testing of this idea with new genetic models will be key.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Why did the authors study the function of SRF-MRTF in the mesoderm-derived lineage? Is this an attempt to show the efficiency of the Srf<sup>αI/al</sup> model? Do Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Wnt1-Cre<sup>Tg/+</sup> mice have outflow tract defects?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. Because vascular and cardiac mesoderm are known to rely on SRF-Myocardin activity, we wanted to test the efficiency of the <italic>Srf<sup>αI</sup></italic> allele compared to the <italic>Srf<sup>-</sup></italic> allele (and published mutants such as <italic>Myocd<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) in this context. Further, we wondered if the wavy neural tube was (at least partially) non-autonomous and due to mesoderm defects. We did see this phenotype in <italic>Srf<sup>αI/flox</sup>; Mesp1<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> embryos at E9.5, supporting this interpretation. We failed to mention this observation in the initial manuscript and have now added this rationale and finding to the Results section.</p><p><italic>Srf<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Wnt1-Cre</italic> mice do have cardiac outflow tract defects, as reported by Newbern et al. We mention this finding within the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
