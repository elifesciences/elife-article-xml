L-1 (<italic>APOL1</italic>) provide increased protection against African trypanosome parasites while also significantly increasing the risk of developing kidney disease in humans. APOL1 protects against trypanosome infections by forming ion channels within the parasite, causing lysis. While the correlation to kidney disease is robust, there is little consensus concerning the underlying disease mechanism. We show in human cells that the APOL1 renal risk variants have a population of active channels at the plasma membrane, which results in an influx of both Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We propose a model wherein APOL1 channel activity is the upstream event causing cell death, and that the activate-state, plasma membrane-localized channel represents the ideal drug target to combat APOL1-mediated kidney disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>membrane channels</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>apolipoprotein l1</kwd><kwd>polymorphism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM34107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rodriguez-Boulan</surname><given-names>Enrique Javier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1249166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raper</surname><given-names>Jayne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cytotoxicity associated with APOL1 renal-risk variants occurs through its plasma-membrane localization, where aberrant channel activity drives a sustained sodium and calcium influx leading to cell swelling and eventually cell death.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apolipoprotein L-1 (<italic>APOL1</italic>) is a primate-specific innate immunity gene, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Malik, 2009</xref>) which provides protection against protozoan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Samanovic et al., 2009</xref>) by forming cation channels within the pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina-Portela et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>). APOL1 circulates on specialized high-density lipoprotein particles termed trypanosome lytic factors, which are endocytosed by the parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hager et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rifkin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raper et al., 1999</xref>). Once inside, APOL1 leads to an ion flux that drives trypanolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina-Portela et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rifkin, 1984</xref>). Its activity is governed by a two-step process: Activation at acidic pH followed by channel opening at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>). This mechanism is inhibited in human-infective <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">PÃ©rez-Morga et al., 2005</xref>) and <italic>T.b. gambiense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capewell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uzureau et al., 2013</xref>), leading to sleeping sickness.</p><p>A molecular arms race between humans and African trypanosomes has led to the evolution of African <italic>APOL1</italic> variants, G1 (rs73885319 - S342G, rs60910145 - I384M) and G2 (rs71785313 - â 388:389 NY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genovese et al., 2010</xref>), which provide protection against the human infective trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2017</xref>). This resistance, however, significantly increases the risk of developing a spectrum of chronic kidney diseases when two copies of these renal risk variants (RRVs) are present, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, hypertension-associated end stage kidney disease, and HIV-associated nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Genovese et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kopp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tzur et al., 2010</xref>). The RRVs are also associated with sickle cell nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashley-Koch et al., 2011</xref>) and lupus nephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freedman et al., 2014</xref>), and drive faster progression from chronic kidney disease to renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parsa et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, 5 million African Americans are estimated to carry two copies of G1 or G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The major isoform of <italic>APOL1</italic> encodes a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monajemi et al., 2002</xref>) and likely traffics along the secretory pathway, thereby allowing for secretion from hepatocytes onto high density lipoprotein particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shukha et al., 2017</xref>) or localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Toole et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olabisi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heneghan et al., 2015</xref>). The majority of intracellular APOL1 remains localized within the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>APOL1</italic> is expressed by several kidney cell types including the podocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2015</xref>), and multiple studies point to kidney intrinsic APOL1 as the driver of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reeves-Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2012a</xref>), rather than the circulating APOL1 associated with trypanosome lytic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozlitina et al., 2016</xref>). While the discovery of the RRVs provided an explanation for the increased rates of kidney disease in African Americans, there remains little consensus on how the variants cause disease or which pathways to target for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Overexpression of the RRVs in multiple cell lines and transgenic mouse models causes cytotoxicity, however the mechanism responsible remains unclear. It has been proposed that RRV cytotoxicity is mediated by several possible pathways such as autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wan et al., 2008</xref>), lysosomal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lan et al., 2014</xref>), pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckerman et al., 2017</xref>), mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), impairment of vacuolar acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kruzel-Davila et al., 2017</xref>), activation of stress-activated kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olabisi et al., 2016</xref>), and ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wen et al., 2018</xref>). This lack of consensus is unsatisfactory and hinders progress towards developing therapeutics. However, whilst these pathways are seemingly unrelated, most are affected by or activated to combat pore-forming toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huffman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cancino-Rodezno et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennedy et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, as APOL1 forms cation channels within trypanosomes after endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina-Portela et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>), we hypothesize cell intrinsic G1 and G2 also form cytotoxic channels, and that this mechanism links the disparate pathways together.</p><p>To perform this study, we focused on the channel forming properties of APOL1. Interestingly, APOL1 led to an intracellular accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> after 72 hr of overexpression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heneghan et al., 2015</xref>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has been associated with the activation of several aforementioned pathways linked to APOL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krebs et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, treatment of African trypanosomes with human serum led uptake of Ca<sup>2+Â </sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rifkin, 1984</xref>). The APOL1 channel is permeable to monovalent Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>), and its trypanolytic activity is inhibited by reducing extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Molina-Portela et al., 2008</xref>). As the plasma membrane is already highly permeable to K<sup>+</sup>, we focused on the potential roles of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in driving APOL1 cytotoxicity. We utilized planar lipid bilayers to evaluate APOL1 as a possible non-selective cation channel, and live-cell fluorescent microscopy with the cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and membrane voltage sensor FliCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelfattah et al., 2016</xref>) to test for increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> flux linked to RRV-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, utilizing the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>), in combination with live-cell and immunofluorescence microscopy, we evaluated the importance and timing of events leading up to RRV-induced cell death, including ER exit and the delivery of APOL1 to the PM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of the <italic>APOL1</italic> renal risk variants G1 and G2, but not G0, leads to cell death</title><p>As an innate immunity gene, <italic>APOL1</italic> is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nichols et al., 2015</xref>).

Before recording, the cis side was adjusted to pH 6.9 and then 1 Âµg APOL1 G0 was added to the cis side.

Once recording began, the cis side was adjusted to pH 6.6, allowing for APOL1 insertion and channel formation. A large increase in the conductance upon re-neutralization of the cis side (pH 7.2) indicates pH-dependent channel opening. E<sub>rev</sub> (+1.75 mV) was determined by adjusting the voltage until the current read zero. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was then titrated into the cis compartment to the indicated concentrations. Upon each addition there was an upward shift in the current and the E<sub>rev</sub> became more negative, indicating Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of the APOL1 channel.

While APOL1 undoubtedly leads to a K<sup>+</sup> efflux, the cell is already highly permeable to K<sup>+</sup> due to the presence of leak channels in the plasma membrane, allowing the cell to rapidly respond to changes in membrane potential or cell volume. Conversely, the cell membrane is minimally permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and this permeability could significantly increase in the presence of open G1 and G2 channels at the cell surface. Therefore, we hypothesized cytotoxicity is driven by the influx of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rather than solely by the efflux of K<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>We sought to replicate the conditions of the CKCM experiment performed by Olabisi et al.

As channel activity leading to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> influx is the earliest observed event leading to cell death, and because Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a potent signaling molecule that can activate many signaling and cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berridge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhivotovsky and Orrenius, 2011</xref>), we propose this upstream event links the many APOL1-associated cell death pathways together.</p><p>We first replicated previously reported results that the RRVs lead to cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olabisi et al., 2016</xref>), which was marked by membrane blebbing and a swollen cell phenotype (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>), the latter of which was also observed in human serum treated trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rifkin, 1984</xref>). Importantly, we used the naturally occurring alleles of <italic>APOL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A study by OâToole et al. reported that G0 and the RRVs were equally cytotoxic, however their approached utilized artificially synthesized RRVs where C-terminal mutations were introduced into the G4 allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Toole et al., 2018</xref>), which has been shown to have reduced cytotoxicity compared to the naturally occurring haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lannon et al., 2019</xref>). As the lytic activity of APOL1 is sensitive to even single amino acid changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuypers et al., 2016</xref>), it is imperative to only use the naturally occurring alleles to draw relevant conclusions regarding kidney disease. While we have used the most prevalent haplotype of G0 with amino acid K150 as our control, it is important to consider the use of G0 E150 for future studies, as G1 and G2 arose in the E150 haplotype background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). It should be noted that there was no difference in cytotoxicity between G0 E150 and G0 K150 as reported by Lannon et al.</p><p>We are the first to report that the APOL1 channel is permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, however the selectivity of APOL1 has been controversial. Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity was first reported, however this study utilized a truncated rAPOL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">PÃ©rez-Morga et al., 2005</xref>) that was later shown to be non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Molina-Portela et al., 2008</xref>). Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity was also reported using KCl-loaded large unilamellar vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruno et al., 2017</xref>), however, Cl<sup>-</sup> selectivity only occurred at pH 5.0, and they reported APOL1 was K<sup>+</sup> selective at pH 7.1. While APOL1 may indeed be permeable to Cl<sup>-</sup>, this occurs at pH 5.0 where only a minor current is recorded in planar lipid bilayers. Once neutralized, the current increases several hundred-fold due to the opening of the APOL1 cation channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>). Opening of these cation channels (but not the minor conductance at acidic pH) was also inhibited by recombinant SRA protein, suggesting a relevance to trypanosome lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015</xref>). Additionally, APOL1 causes the dissipation of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>) and K<sup>+</sup> gradients in animal cells and trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rifkin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olabisi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heneghan et al., 2015</xref>), and its trypanolytic activity is inhibited when extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> is replaced by larger cations that are APOL1-impermeant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molina-Portela et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâb</xref>). The results in this paper, together with the previous studies strongly implicate a role for the APOL1 cation channel in biological function, whereas any relevance of Cl<sup>-</sup> flux remains to be demonstrated.</p><p>Through the use of live-cell microscopy with Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors GCaMP6f and ER-LAR-GECO and the membrane voltage sensor FliCR, we were able to discern that the upstream event leading to cell death is a cytoplasmic influx of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This was robustly reproduced in multiple cell lines and with the RUSH system, revealing that trafficking of APOL1 out of the ER was required for cytotoxicity. While we described an APOL1-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in this study, another group reported no changes in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Toole et al., 2018</xref>). However, their approach utilized the dye Fura-2 measured via fluorescent plate reader at a single timepoint. Using the genetically encoded GCaMP6f and the more sensitive technique of time-lapse, live-cell fluorescent microscopy allowed us to observe the robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx caused by the RRVs.</p><p>K<sup>+</sup> efflux has been proposed as the mechanism that drives APOL1-mediated cell death, however our data demonstrate that this event is likely a response to Na<sup>+</sup> influx. Unlike K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> have a very low permeability across the plasma membrane meaning that APOL1 channels reaching the cell surface will conduct a measurable influx of Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Na<sup>+</sup> influx will lead to the observed swelling and depolarization, both of which cause the classic cellular response of K<sup>+</sup> efflux, which in turn can also affect cell viability via stress activated protein kinases as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olabisi et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, the observed protection offered by CKCM media (replacement of all Na<sup>+</sup> with K<sup>+</sup>) is likely due to the fact that Na<sup>+</sup> has been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). As APOL1 is also permeable to K<sup>+</sup>, it likely contributes directly to the efflux of K<sup>+</sup>, though not to the same degree as Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx due to of the presence of other K<sup>+</sup> channels at the PM. Independent of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> flux, a sustained influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> over several hours, which is usually tightly regulated by the cell, can activate a multitude of signaling pathways that may also contribute to cell death.</p><p>In order for G1 and G2 to drive a cytotoxic influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we reasoned that they must reach the PM within the 120 min where an increase of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is first detected. Indeed, high-throughput confocal immunofluorescence revealed that all variants of RUSH-APOL1 trafficked with similar kinetics to the PM, which occurred within 60â90 min of biotin treatment (release of ER-retained APOL1). Upon reaching the PM, APOL1 formed a punctate staining pattern. Additionally, localization of APOL1 to the PM was corroborated by other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O'Toole et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olabisi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heneghan et al., 2015</xref>). We also report that APOL1 localizes to the peri-nuclear region in some cells, indicating passage through the Golgi and/or endosomes. Interestingly, we observed that the ER had receded from its association with the PM in swollen cells, potentially due to an increase in hydrostatic pressure. A similar phenotype was observed in human submandibular gland cells treated with a hypotonic solution, which caused a loss of ER:PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). This may help explain the previously reported case of APOL1-mediated ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While all three variants are equally permissive for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and traffic to the PM in a similar fashion, only the RRVs are cytotoxic. It has been postulated that an SRA-like chaperone may exist to prevent G0 cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limou et al., 2015</xref>), however no such binding partner has been found. We discovered that by artificially acidifying and therefore activating the non-toxic G0 after PM-localization, followed by re-neutralization, G0 led to cell death. Under these conditions RRV-mediated cytotoxicity was also exacerbated. Conversely, pre-treatment with ammonium chloride protected cells from RRV cytotoxicity. This demonstrates the importance of acidic activation for APOL1 channel activity, and that unlike G0, the RRVs more readily arrive at the PM in a channel active state.</p><p>It is imperative to elucidate the mechanism that prevents G0 cytotoxicity in order to understand how APOL1-mediated kidney disease manifests. Additionally, future work should determine how an acid-neutral pH gradient across a membrane activates APOL1 to form a channel, which may alter conformation or drive oligomerization. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, G0 becomes cytotoxic only after additional acidification and neutralization. It may be that the RRVs are slightly more sensitive to acidification and therefore become activated more readily compared to G0, leading to kidney disease.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that the kidney disease associated variants of APOL1 form cytotoxic cation channels at the cell surface. Live-cell analyses demonstrate an initial event leading to cell death is cation flux across the PM, with major ion components being extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This ion flux precedes cell swelling by several hours and is therefore the likely driver of cell death. Because many of the reported pathways associated with APOL1 cell death and disease can be activated by pore-forming toxins and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, we propose that the upstream event linking them is APOL1 channel activity at the PM. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the primary focus for drug development should be prevention of G1 and G2 channel activity and targeting of activated APOL1 channels at the PM within the kidney.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">APOL1-G0</td><td valign="top">NCBI</td><td valign="top">BC143038.1</td><td valign="top">cDNA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">APOL1-G1</td><td valign="top">NCBI</td><td valign="top">AF305428.1</td><td valign="top">cDNA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">APOL1-G2</td><td valign="top">1000 genomes project, this <break/>paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">cDNA <break/>*Constructed from mutagenesis from APOL1-G0.

Briefly, planar lipid bilayers were formed from soybean asolectin, a rich phospholipid mixture from which non-polar lipids had been removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kagawa and Racker, 1971</xref>). In some experiments, cholesterol was added to increase bilayer stability. The lipid solution in pentane (1.0% asolectin w/v, or 1.5% asolectin, 0.5% cholesterol w/v) was layered on top of the aqueous solutions and the solvent allowed to evaporate. The lipid bilayer was formed by alternately raising the solution volumes above aÂ ~Â 100 micron hole in a Teflon septum separating symmetric 1 ml compartments as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qiu et al., 1996</xref>.Â The cis solution was defined as the side to which protein was added. The voltage was reported as that of the cis with respect to the trans. The trans-bilayer current due to APOL1 was measured in response to a voltage which was set by the experimenter. Manipulation of the pH was achieved by adding pre-calibrated volumes of HCl or KOH to the cis buffer.</p><p>To test for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability, bilayers were formed between identical solutions of 1) CaCl<sub>2</sub>-buffer: 10 or 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend) 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM K-succinate, 5 mM K-HEPES, pH 7.1; or 2) excess KCl buffer: 150 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM K-MES, 5 mM K-HEPES, pH 7.2.

The raw data was then exported and analyzed using R to determine the change in mean fluorescence intensity for each cell using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where F<sub>0</sub> is the average mean fluorescence of the first 3 timepoints for each cell. For analysis with ER-LAR-GECO or FliCR, cells co-expressing GCaMP6f and exhibiting the established phenotype of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and cell swelling were analyzed.</p><p>To determine APOL1 trafficking kinetics in non-permeabilized immunostained cells, multiple FOVs were imaged at random at 20x. Image files were exported as maximum intensity Z-projections and analyzed using the scikit-image library in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, NuclearMask stained cell nuclei were segmented and dilated to approximate cell boundaries. Cells were then filtered for cell death through co-localization with the segmented calnexin channel. Finally, APOL1 stain intensity was summed for all cells individually, and the criteria for positive staining of APOL1 was defined as a cell having greater summed APOL1 stained intensity than the maximum summed intensity of any cell within the untransfected image sets. Data fromÂ â¥10 FOVs per experimental group were averaged over three replicates and plotted to determine the intensity and percent of cells expressing APOL1 at the PM for each timepoint and genotype.</p><p>Preparation of representative images and movies was performed in Fiji. Representative immunofluorescence images are all maximum intensity Z-projections of approximately 10, 0.22 Âµm slices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microscopes</title><p>For live-cell microscopy, a widefield setup was used. Live imaging was performed with a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axio Observer with 470, 555, or 625 nm LED excitation along with Zeiss filter cubes 38 (green), 20 (red), and 50 (far-red). Recording was performed using a sCMOS with 6.5 Âµm pixels (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan. Flash4.0 v2). Live experiments were performed within an incubation chamber at 37C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and humidity. For immunofluorescence, a Zeiss Axio Observer was fitted with a Yokogawa (Musashino, Japan) CSU-X1 spinning disk head. Excitation was performed with a 405, 488, or 639 nm laser. Recording was performed using a back-thinned EMCCD camera with 16 Âµm pixels (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ. Evolve 512).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>All graphing and statistical analyses were performed with Graph Pad Prism or the multicomp package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hothorn et al., 2008</xref>). Statistical significance was tested using one or two-way ANOVAs with multiple comparisons tests. All data are represented as mean with 95% confidence interval unless otherwise noted, and all relevant p-values are depicted directly on each graph.</p><p>Data derived from quantified immunofluorescence were fit to a general linear model, and a simultaneous multiple comparison procedure between genotypes and timepoints was conducted in R version 3.5.1. P-values were corrected for multiple comparisons via the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>), and significance was set to a minimum of p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Christian Brix Folsted Andersen and Gitte Ratz from Aarhus University for providing the stable cell line system.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This article contributes important new information concerning the ion permeability of the Apolipoprotein L-1 channels and suggests that this is an important cause of the renal pathology that is associated with some Apolipoprotein L-1 variants.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Apolipoprotein L-1 renal risk variants form active channels at the plasma membrane driving cytotoxicity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Suzie Scales (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviews of your manuscript were very mixed, which appears to reflect substantial controversy in the field. I have therefore decided that the manuscript should be reconsidered after results of further experiments are available. One reviewer felt that your demonstration that the APOL1 must reach the cell surface was sufficiently important on its own, but the others did not. None of the reviewers was convinced that calcium influx was the direct cause, rather than a consequence or symptom, of cell death. It was suggested that increased cellular calcium may result from increased potassium efflux instead. One reviewer indeed pointed out that LDH release and calcium influx appeared to be simultaneous. Clarification of this issue is critical.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several experiments were suggested in order to determine the relationship between calcium influx and potassium efflux. These were thought to be feasible within the 2-month period that is usually allowed by <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>Cell experiments:</p><p>1) Place the cells in high potassium media (&quot;CKCM&quot; of Olabisi et al., 2016) during biotin addition to determine if this prevents calcium influx and help clarify which cation is primarily responsible.</p><p>2) Experiments with low to zero extracellular calcium and with intracellular calcium chelators (BAPTA-AM) should be performed: currently, the lowest calcium concentration used was, according to one reviewer, higher than that in the Bowmans capsule.</p><p>3) Bilayer experiments: Studies with lower calcium concentrations, and to measure the permeability ratio between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (PCa/PK) are required.</p><p>4) If it turns out that potassium efflux is indeed the major primary effect, it is not clear that the results would be rated as sufficiently novel, at least by 2 of the three reviewers.</p><p>5) One reviewer had reservations concerning the combination of protein and cell haplotype used; obviously this cannot be changed but the concerns must be mentioned.</p><p>6) Showing &quot;typical&quot; results without any statistics is no longer acceptable; using standard deviation for three measurements is not really acceptable either, strictly speaking. Ideally, present all three measurements, either all on the figure or, if this is too confusing, place them in the supplement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper makes a really strong statement such as that the APOL1 mediated cytotoxicity is calcium mediated.</p><p>The key problem with the presented work that it does not show that the increased extracellular calcium is responsible for the cell death using a dox inducible system.</p><p>The presented data shows a dose and genotype dependent cell death, which has been shown before (Pollak and Susztak labs etc). It also shows a dose and genotype dependent increase in calcium. When cells die intracellular calcium will rise, so it is essential to show that the increase in intracellular calcium actually a cause of the cell death not the consequence of the cell death. This is a fundamental flaw in the presented work.</p><p>It is not clear whether APOL1 actually conducts calcium it would be essential to demonstrate this claim. Using bilayer studies removing calcium and substituting calcium etc. are key for such statement.</p><p>Figure 2E the control and the experiments are presented on 2 separate graphs. They should be measured and presented together and statistical analysis need to be performed at 30 hours before and after injection. Simply put cells die over 30 hours we need to see the difference between APOL1 and control cells.</p><p>Same issue for Figure 3E.</p><p>The biotin is a clever experiment.</p><p>Another fundamental issue with the model is that it depends on putative and mysterious chaperone that has been identified. Otherwise the model would not work. There is ample of APOL1 in the circulation and could randomly insert to ant plasma membrane inducing cytotoxicity, however the disease and toxicity is high specific for the podocytes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Giovinazzo et al. demonstrate that renal risk variants (RRVs, G1 and G2) of APOL1, but not wild type (G0) in HEK293 and CHO cells lead to cytotoxicity via cell swelling and lysis, an important confirmation of results from several other labs because they use naturally occurring variants of APOL1 for the RRVs, whereas the majority of labs merely mutate G1 and G2 into the RefSeq, yielding sequences that are not present in the 1000 Genomes Project. They further perform a series of elegant experiments using the RUSH (an ER retention and synchronized release) system to clearly demonstrate that APOL1 must reach the cell surface to mediate these cytotoxic effects. This clearly rules out ER stress as the mechanism of RRV-mediated toxicity, which is important because APOL1 is mainly localized to the ER, and the plasma membrane is more accessible to certain classes of potential therapeutics. They also provide evidence that recombinant APOL1 can conduct calcium ions across lipid bilayers, and that in APOL1 RRV-expressing cells calcium influx (monitored with GCaMP) precedes cytotoxicity. They suggest that this ubiquitous cation second messenger could explain why such a variety of seemingly disparate mechanisms of APOL1 action have been previously proposed. The data are well presented and represent an impressive advance in the field as they strongly suggest that targeting the ion channel activity of plasma membrane APOL1 should be a viable therapeutic avenue for APOL1 nephropathies, although it is not entirely clear which cation is the relevant one. This paper definitely merits publication, and I only have a few minor suggestions for strengthening their conclusions.</p><p>1) While calcium influx is clearly an upstream event in RRV-mediated cytotoxicity, it is not completely certain that calcium influx is the event that should be therapeutically targeted. As they mentioned in the Discussion, although the calcium influx is demonstrated to be relatively soon (â¤30 mins) after the arrival of APOL1 at the plasma membrane, it cannot be excluded that calcium influx from an unrelated calcium channel is secondary to efflux of e.g. K<sup>+</sup> ions (which they previously showed can also be conducted by recombinant APOL1 in bilayers), which has also been shown to be an upstream event in APOL1-expressing 293 cells by Olabisi et al., 2016. While measuring the relative timing of K<sup>+</sup> efflux in the RUSH system is surely outside the scope of their time and resources, it should be relatively easy to place the cells in high potassium media (&quot;CKCM&quot; of Olabisi et al.) during biotin addition to determine if this prevents calcium influx and help clarify which cation is primarily responsible.</p><p>2) On a related note, the 100mM calcium concentration at which they showed recombinant APOL1 conducted calcium ions in the bilayer assay is an extreme condition, up to 50x higher than the range at which cytotoxicity was observed in cells. To properly claim that APOL1 is permeable to calcium ions, they need to calculate the permeability ratio between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (pCa/pK).</p><p>3) Can the authors comment on the low level (~20%) of cytotoxicity obtained by the RRVs in the stable FT293 cell lines? Is this simply because the stable cells were polyclonal and not all expressing at sufficient levels to cause toxicity, given that O'Toole et al., 2018, have previously demonstrated that killing is dose-dependent? Is there any IF or FACS data demonstrating what percentage of stable cells actually express APOL1? It is particularly important to show that G0 is expressed in a similar % of cells to at least one of the RRVs since an equal signal by western blotting could come from e.g. twice the percentage of cells expressing half the amount of APOL1, which would impact the overall cytoxicity results, since it is likely threshold-dependent on a per-cell basis.</p><p>4) The authors propose in Figure 5C that a secretory chaperone that binds to APOL1-G0 better than the RRVs might explain why only the RRVs lead to calcium influx in cells when all three conduct equally in planar lipid bilayers. If this were the case, one might expect APOL1 G0 to arrive faster at the cell surface, which it does not. I wonder if an alternative explanation could be that the &quot;chaperone&quot; is actually more of a G0-channel closing protein acting at the cell surface (after the low pH Golgi membrane insertion step). Couldn't this be easily tested by adding NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to neutralize the channel after arrival of APOL1 at the plasma membrane (instead of before biotin addition) and see if it no longer inhibits the RRVs?</p><p>5) Since cytotoxicity correlates with extracellular calcium levels (at least from 2-8mM), it would be helpful to mention in the Discussion that Bowman's capsule has around 1.4mM calcium (according to Hautmann and Oswald (J. Urology 1983 129 p433)), as it means their results could be physiologically relevant.</p><p>6) It would be nice to show the no biotin controls at equivalent time points in the LDH assay in Figure 3B rather than just stating there was no effect. P-value asterisks in this figure need to be larger.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the current manuscript the authors examine the hypothesis that APOL1 mediated cell injury and thereby kidney disease is mediated by plasma membrane calcium channel activity. The authors demonstrate that APOL1 expression in lipid bilayers leads to a calcium current. Calcium conductance was similar in APOL1 kidney disease non-risk (G0), and risk (G1 and G2) genetic variants. The authors used a combination of confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and the RUSH system for controlled and synchronous gene product expression and controlled compartment-specific trafficking in these studies. They demonstrate that APOL1 expression in the ER is innocuous to cell viability. Rather, intracellular calcium and cell injury measures, such as increased LDH release was associated with APOL1 trafficking and localization to the plasma membrane. Increased intracellular calcium preceded cell death (measured by the cell death marker DRAQ7). In spite of similar calcium conductance and plasma membrane expression of the non-risk and renal risk genetic variants (RRVs) only the RRVs led to increased intracellular calcium and cell death. In addition, lowering the pH of the medium, enhanced cell injury in RRVs (and also infor WT APOL1), confirming the previously reported importance of an acidic milieu for APOL1 channel activity. While the increased cellular calcium can explain the different perturbations in several cellular pathways mediated by APOL1, there remain a number of questions: Is APOL1 a selective calcium channel? Does the measured increase in intracellular calcium reflect a cell-injury causal calcium channel opening or rather a downstream reflection of another primary pathway of cell injury, wherein the RRVs are more injurious compared to G0 and hence also results in greater calcium influx? What is the role of alkaline pH, that was demonstrated as an essential factor for APOL1 cation conductivity in previous publications?</p><p>Following are some specific comments that are suggested for consideration by the authors:</p><p>1) The authors are referred to Lannon et al., 2019. This report demonstrates that the appropriate background haplotype for APOL1 G0 for comparison with G1 and G2, is that which naturally occurs in the population in which G1 and G2 occur, and not a construct on a haplotype which does not occur in natural populations at all (namely G1 and G2 mutagenesis on the reference European haplotype APOL1-G0 (BC143038.1), as described in the current manuscript). Thus for example, G0 K150E is itself was more toxic than G0 E150K. In the current manuscript the G0 variant used had K (lysine) at residue 150 whereas RRV had 150E (the natural variant) (Figure 1). G0 was innocuous to cells as opposed to RRV. Even though the frequency of this variant is higher than G0 with E, the G0K150E should also be used in the comparative cellular studies to examine the significance of glutamic acid at this position as an explanation for the different cells toxicity and cellular calcium level in RRV vs. GO.</p><p>2) The authors titrated APOL1 protein expression in FT293-G0 cells to similar levels found in interferon-stimulated human podocytes (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A) in order to achieve physiologic expression. They conclude that 0.2 ng/mL doxycycline and 10 ng/mL interferon-Î³ lead to similar levels of APOL1. However, it appears that APOL1 expression after Dox induction (0.2 ng/mL doxycycline) is lower than its expression after interferon (most evident in lane 3-from the right). In addition, for Figure 1 and Video 1, a higher concentrations of Dox are reported â therefore the expression of APOL1 variants is expected to be higher than the claim of achieving physiologic levels similar to those which accompany interferon induction in the podocyte platform.</p><p>3) Increased extracellular CaCl<sub>2</sub> in cell culture media (from basal 2mM up to 8 Mm) was used to demonstrate the role of calcium influx and calcium content in cell injury in cells expressing the RRV compared to G0. The clinical relevance of elevated non-physiological extracellular calcium concentrations used in these experiments is not clear. In addition, the increased calcium influx could represent the consequence and not cause of non-specific cell injury, similar to previous reports regarding potassium depletion. In order to prove a causal role of extracellular calcium and consequent increased cytoplasmic calcium, experiments with low to zero extracellular calcium and with intracellular calcium chelators (BAPTA-AM) should be performed. In other words to prove the authors' claim that ion flux precedes cell swelling by several hours and is therefore the likely driver of cell death, can the authors state whether intracellular calcium buffering was used and if so, did it attenuate APOL1 cell injury?</p><p>4) The APOL1 plasmid used in the RUSH platform did not contain its natural signal peptide (Figure 3A), but rather the IL-2 signal peptide was used. Why is that and were studies conducted with APOL1 harboring its own signal peptide?</p><p>5) It is clear that increased calcium in cytoplasm preceded cell death (measured by measured by cell death marker DRAQ7), however increased LDH may represent an even earlier marker for cell injury. Looking at Figure 3: the earliest data presented regarding LDH release after adding biotin was after 6 hours â at that time point RRV (especially G2) lead to cell injury measured by LDH release. GCaMP6f fluorescence (calcium indicator protein) started to increase 3 hours after adding biotin. As increased cellular calcium may represent a non-specific marker for cell injury â please provide parallel data for LDH release 3 hours after adding biotin, in order to understand if increased calcium in cytoplasm precedes LDH release. Moreover, looking at Figure 5, LDH release was increased 2 hours after adding biotin, simultaneously with the increased calcium in cytoplasm, suggesting that increased calcium influx represents a nonspecific marker for cell injury.</p><p>6) Figure 4B: the experiments were conducted in non-permeabilized CHO cells, however, the staining of APOL1 after adding biotin seems to be in the ER and not only in the plasma membrane. Where is the calnexin stain mentioned in the text (as a control for non-permeabilized cells)?</p><p>7) Lower levels of G2 were detected at the plasma membrane compared to G0 (Figure 4). The authors explain this by invoking increased G2 cyto-toxicity. However, it is stated that the calnexin signal was used to filter out permeabilized cells (Figure 4C), which should mitigate such an effect as the explanation. That decreased G2 plasma membrane expression on one hand, and increased toxicity on the other hand, does not reconcile with the hypothesis that APOL1 channel activity at the plasma membrane is the most proximate causal mediator for cell death.</p><p>8) Increased calcium in cytoplasm is expected to increase ER calcium (Figure 4, Wu et al., 2014). Calcium release from ER should not exceed uptake to the ER. However, the data presented in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2, show stable concentration of calcium in the ER, without an expected increase.</p><p>9) The authors hypothesize that G0 is sequestered by an unknown chaperone while trafficking along the secretory pathway. In light of similar expression of all APOL1 variants in the plasma membrane, it seems that G0 sequestration does not occur prior to trafficking to the plasma membrane.</p><p>10) RUSH-APOL1 transfected cells were transiently acidified at pH 5.5 then returned to neutral pH. According to Figure 5A, acidification enhances cell injury for all APOL1 variants including G0. However, as reported previously and also in this current manuscript by electrophysiologic studies â APOL1 insertion into lipid bilayers requires an acidic melieu and has transient chloride permeability which turns into cationic conductance (potassium â as per Bruno et al., 2017) at neutral pH. Similarly, in the current manuscript (Figure 2A), there is a small transient current at pH 5.6, that is enhanced significantly at pH 7.1. In light of these findings one could expect that an acidic pH in essential for APOL1 toxicity. Moreover, changing into neutral pH (after priming with an acidic pH) is expected to increase APOL1 conductance and therefore cell injury mediated by this cationic channel conductance. The data presented in Figure 5, seem contradictory: return to neutral pH attenuates APOL1 cell injury. In addition, if indeed APOL1 RRVs form calcium channels at the plasma membrane which increase intracellular calcium concentrations in turn leading to cell death, then returning to neutral pH would be expected to lead to decreased calcium influx and correspondingly decreased intracellular calcium levels â the results of such experiment should be presented.</p><p>11) Since the authors did not demonstrate selectivity for calcium conductance caveats regarding author mechanisms need attention. For example, increased cellular calcium may result from increased potassium efflux and cellular potassium depletion that was reported in previous manuscripts (Olabisi et al., 2016), and as mentioned briefly by the authors in the Discussion. cell death and kidney disease should be further explored.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Apolipoprotein L-1 renal risk variants form active channels at the plasma membrane driving cytotoxicity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is an important advance that influx of Na+/Ca<sup>2+</sup>, rather than efflux of K<sup>+</sup> is the trigger for APOL1-mediated toxicity, as that will change the nature of potential screens for channel inhibitors. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the knowledge that APOL1 has to arrive at the plasma membrane to mediate toxicity, and that cation channel activity is the function that needs inhibiting to limit progression of CKD is vital for future therapeutic efforts. I therefore recommend this manuscript for publication.</p><p>A couple of points that I think still need to be changed:</p><p>1) In the absence of immunofluorescence or FACS data for the polyclonal APOL1-293 cells, the statement that the cells are expressing at physiological levels (compared to endogenous APOL1 in podocytes +IFNÎ³) needs to be toned down. It is still possible that the 20% of cells that die are the 20% highest expressers, which are effectively diluted out by the remaining non-expressers and thus the actual cells with active channels are higher expressing than the podocytes, especially as cytotoxicity is dose-dependent.</p><p>2) I agree with reviewer #3 and Essential revisions point 5 that the wrong G0 control (K150 instead of E150) was used for these studies. It is irrelevant that non-Africans (with G0 K150) happen to outnumber Africans (with G0 E150) selected for sequencing in the 1000 genomes project. E150 G0 would thus have been the correct haplotype to use. However, it is also true that E150 would likely only marginally diminish the difference between G0 and G1/G2 and so is not worth redoing the whole dataset. Nonetheless, the authors need to acknowledge that E150 would have been a better control and refer to Lannon et al. for the fact that it would have only made a small difference to the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51185.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Several experiments were suggested in order to determine the relationship between calcium influx and potassium efflux.

Lowering Na<sup>+</sup> from 150 mM to 52.5 mM, where the cation is replaced stoichiometrically with K<sup>+</sup>, led to a <italic>40% decrease</italic> in cell viability after 12 hours (Olabisi et al. assessed cytotoxicity/viability in their experiments after 24 hours in media with complete Na<sup>+</sup> replacement to K<sup>+</sup>). We also find an effect, though less dramatic, 20% deceased viability, with a similar ion replacement to choline<sup>+</sup>. Viability was further reduced when Na<sup>+</sup> was lowered to 20 mM with the 130mM balance being replaced with choline<sup>+</sup> (see Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A and B). Based on these findings, we avoided full replication of the CKCM conditions, and settled on lowering Na<sup>+</sup> to 85 mM for further experimentation (see Figure 6C and E). An additional point is high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> depolarizes the cell; addition of 50 mM KCl to standard media causes depolarization which is the original reason we chose not to address the Olabisi et al. publication and K<sup>+</sup> in our initial manuscript submission (see Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A). Ionic perturbations are very complicated in vivo and numerous factors need to be considered during interpretation of the data.</p><p>APOL1-G2 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is largely unaffected by partial replacement of Na<sup>+</sup> with choline<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> (Video 6).

The APOL1-G2 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was observed under all media conditions and occurred with similar timing. We conclude that the large Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurs independent of K<sup>+</sup> efflux.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Experiments with low to zero extracellular calcium and with intracellular calcium chelators (BAPTA-AM) should be performed: currently, the lowest calcium concentration used was, according to one reviewer, higher than that in the Bowmans capsule.</p></disp-quote><p>Extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was serially diluted in media from 1.8 mM to 0.1125 mM, and the cytotoxicity of the APOL1 renal risk variants (RRVs) were significantly reduced with Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels â¤ 0.45 mM (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C and also Figure 6D). This suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> participates in RRV-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><p>All experiments were performed with 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> unless otherwise noted (standard concentration in all variations of Eagle's / Essential Media). It was mentioned in the review that the Bowman's capsule contains approximately 1.4 mM CaCl<sub>2.</sub> While we have shown that lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels inhibit RRV cytotoxicity, no significant reduction in cytotoxicity was detected with 0.9 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C).

The cells easily detached once the Ca<sup>2+</sup> drops below 0.1mM, making the experiment difficult to be performed. With 0.1mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the media the trivial moles of BAPTA in the cell, relative to the bath moles, are easily saturated. This hurdle was something which would take a good deal of time to overcome and we believe the data we present are convincing enough to make the BAPTA experiment unnecessary.

We demonstrate that in the presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> alone, APOL1 channels are selective for Ca<sup>2+</sup> over Cl<sup>-</sup> (Figure 2B). For this experiment, symmetrical solutions of 150 mM KCl and 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> were used on both sides of the bilayer. Increasing cis CaCl<sub>2</sub> to 2 mM led to a positive shift in the current and a negative shift in the reversal potential (Figure 2D). The pCa/pK permeability ratio was calculated as 0.6, demonstrating that the APOL1 channel conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> at physiological salt conditions. For comparison, the PNa/pK permeability ratio was calculated as 1.1 (Figure 6B). Additionally, the APOL1-G2 mediated cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was unaffected by media containing high K<sup>+</sup> (Video 6, see response to Essential revisions point .1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If it turns out that potassium efflux is indeed the major primary effect, it is not clear that the results would be rated as sufficiently novel, at least by 2 of the three reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>The high potassium media &quot;CKCM&quot; of Olabisi et al., kills the cells on its own as discussed in the response to Essential revisions point 1 (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A and B). We further show the partially rescue of cells from RRV cytotoxicity that can be attributed to high potassium media is not because of the high K<sup>+</sup>, but rather because of lower Na<sup>+</sup> in the media (Figure 6C). This is clearly demonstrated, where Na<sup>+</sup> replacement with the impermeant choline<sup>+</sup> results in a similar level of rescue. Importantly, 65 mM choline<sup>+</sup> did not have as strong of a negative effect on general cell viability as the 65 mM K<sup>+</sup>(Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A).</p><p>As Na<sup>+</sup> influx can cause a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and cytoplasmic accumulation on its own, we attempted to discern when the RRV-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurred relative to Na<sup>+</sup>. Due to a lack of suitable genetically encoded Na<sup>+</sup> sensors, we opted to use the plasma membrane voltage sensor FliCR as a readout for Na<sup>+</sup> influx in combination with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6f. Using live-cell microscopy, we found that the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurred concurrently with the increase in membrane depolarization (Figure 6F, Figure 6âfigure supplement 2 and 3, Video 5). This data, along with the conductance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of 150 mM K<sup>+</sup> (see Figure 2D) suggest the APOL1-RRVs are directly conducting Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cell. The influx of Na<sup>+</sup> likely also contributes as the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger will be disrupted. Additionally, as Na<sup>+</sup> influx typically leads to cell swelling and depolarization, it will drive K<sup>+</sup> efflux, which is a cellular response to both events.</p><p>The effect that lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> levels have in rescuing cells from RRV cytotoxicity, along with the additive rescue when combined (Figure 6D) and their simultaneous influx (Video 5 and related figures) suggest that intracellular accumulation of these two cations represent the primary and upstream effect of RRV mediated cell death and disease, rather than the specific efflux of K<sup>+</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One reviewer had reservations concerning the combination of protein and cell haplotype used; obviously this cannot be changed but the concerns must be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We are of the belief that G0 K150 is the appropriate haplotype control for these experiments, as it is the most prevalent in the human population and is over an order of magnitude more prevalent than G0 E150.

To properly claim that APOL1 is permeable to calcium ions, they need to calculate the permeability ratio between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (pCa/pK).</p></disp-quote><p>The initial selectivity experiment was performed at the higher than physiological concentrations to get a strong signal to allow for the best analysis. However, we fully accept the need to perform experiments in more physiological conditions and have done the suggested experiment.</p><p>The results are explained in our response to Essential revisions point 3. In summary, APOL1 conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> (at 1-2 mM) in the presence of 150 mM K<sup>+</sup>(Figures 2B and D) The pCa/pK was calculated to be 0.6. In comparison, the pNa/pK is 1.1 (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors comment on the low level (~20%) of cytotoxicity obtained by the RRVs in the stable FT293 cell lines? Is this simply because the stable cells were polyclonal and not all expressing at sufficient levels to cause toxicity, given that O'Toole et al., 2018, have previously demonstrated that killing is dose-dependent? Is there any IF or FACS data demonstrating what percentage of stable cells actually express APOL1? It is particularly important to show that G0 is expressed in a similar % of cells to at least one of the RRVs since an equal signal by western blotting could come from e.g. twice the percentage of cells expressing half the amount of APOL1, which would impact the overall cytoxicity results, since it is likely threshold-dependent on a per-cell basis.</p></disp-quote><p>All the APOL1 expressing FT293 cell lines are polyclonal. They are derived from a single clone expressing the tet repressor, and then clones after transfection with APOL1 plasmid were pooled together (correct integration of the new plasmid leads to the loss of zeocin resistance and the gain of hygromycin b resistance). Unfortunately, we do not have single cell data of the FT293 cell lines to see if there is a difference in the number of cells expressing APOL1, and to what level. We find the varied expression to be typical even for clonal cell line. As with nearly all transgenes, promoters become differentially methylated and have variable expression on a cell to cell basis, even in clonal cell populations. This can be partially corrected by using a CpG free promoter or by implementing a âuniversal chromatin opening elementâ (UCOE) upstream of the promoter. Additionally, targeting the transgene into a safe-harbor locus such as the ROSA26-like region would have helped to keep the expression variability at a lower level, however this would have to be done in follow-up work. We appreciate this comment and will keep this in mind for future work.</p><p>As for the low level of cytotoxicity, if the experiment is extended higher levels of cell death will be observed. This could in part be due to expression of APOL1 from a single copy.</p><p>While we cannot provide more a satisfactory answer for the FT293 cells, the RUSH experiments are transient transfections and lead to similar protein levels between the variants. We can state that for the RUSH system, which gives similar results to the FT293 cells, that we expect a similar number of cells expressing G0. This is corroborated by the cell surface staining data in Figure 5D and E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose in Figure 5C that a secretory chaperone that binds to APOL1-G0 better than the RRVs might explain why only the RRVs lead to calcium influx in cells when all three conduct equally in planar lipid bilayers. If this were the case, one might expect APOL1 G0 to arrive faster at the cell surface, which it does not. I wonder if an alternative explanation could be that the &quot;chaperone&quot; is actually more of a G0-channel closing protein acting at the cell surface (after the low pH Golgi membrane insertion step). Couldn't this be easily tested by adding NH<sub>4</sub>Cl to neutralize the channel after arrival of APOL1 at the plasma membrane (instead of before biotin addition) and see if it no longer inhibits the RRVs?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and have responded to the merit of the chaperone in our model in our last response to Reviewer #1. We have removed the chaperone from our model and now only mention the hypothesis briefly in the Discussion. As for potential function of a putative chaperone, we are mostly in agreement as to how it functions i.e. somewhere along the secretory pathway and somehow regulating or modulating channel activity. With the lack of any chaperone discovered to date, however, it certainly could be another mechanism to explain the discrepancy in cytotoxicity. We present experiments and observations that G1 and G2 more readily form channels at the acidic pH encountered along the secretory pathway.</p><p>As for the acid/neutral experiments, we apologize for not being clearer. Adding ammonium chloride prior to biotin addition allows us to increase the pH within the cell, limiting APOL1 activation in the biosynthetic pathway. Moving the pH towards neutral in the normally acidic Golgi apparatus, trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments of the biosynthetic pathway is well-documented. In the experiment the APOL1 experiences less acidic pH as it transits the biosynthetic compartments. Our experiment with APOL1 in planar lipid bilayers suggests that APOL1 &quot;activation&quot; into a channel state is irreversible upon acidification. Then the only way to modulate its activity afterwards is to change the pH (neutral = open, acidic = closed). APOL1 arrives to the neutral environment of the plasma membrane after encountering an acidic environment along the way in the control setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Since cytotoxicity correlates with extracellular calcium levels (at least from 2-8mM), it would be helpful to mention in the Discussion that Bowman's capsule has around 1.4mM calcium (according to Hautmann and Oswald (J. Urology 1983 129 p433)), as it means their results could be physiologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment was addressed in the Essential revisions point 2 response. We performed the recommended experiment of lowering extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> rather than raising it to non-physiological levels. CaCl<sub>2</sub> was serially diluted from 1.8 mM to 0.1125 mM, and a significant reduction in cell death was only observed at levels â¤ 0.45 mM. Therefore, we do not believe there would be a significant difference in cytotoxicity between 1.4 and 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It would be nice to show the no biotin controls at equivalent time points in the LDH assay in Figure 3B rather than just stating there was no effect. P-value asterisks in this figure need to be larger.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in our presentation of the data. The graph does contain the no biotin control, but it was not properly presented. The new Figure 4B is now more clearly labeled. As for the p-value asterisks, we have moved to reporting the p-values themselves on each graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] While the increased cellular calcium can explain the different perturbations in several cellular pathways mediated by APOL1, there remain a number of questions:</p><p>Is APOL1 a selective calcium channel? Does the measured increase in intracellular calcium reflect a cell-injury causal calcium channel opening or rather a downstream reflection of another primary pathway of cell injury, wherein the RRVs are more injurious compared to G0 and hence also results in greater calcium influx?</p></disp-quote><p>We have demonstrated APOL1 to be a calcium channel, more specifically APOL1 is a cation channel. Selectivity of APOL1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> is further answered in detail in our responses to Essential revisions points 1 and 2. APOL1 is permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and can conduct Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of physiological K<sup>+</sup> levels. As for a cell injury causing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, we clearly show in all six videos that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurs upstream of any cell swelling and the subsequent lysis. Our method for detecting lysis is an approximately 600 â 700 dalton cell impermeable dye, DRAQ7 which is fluorogenic when bound to DNA. If APOL1 formed large pores in the plasma membrane similar to streptolysin O, DRAQ7 would be immediately detectable. Additionally, we show in the new Figure 6 and related video and supplementary figures that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurs alongside a Na<sup>+</sup> influx/mild depolarization and that they are the first measurable events of APOL1 channel activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the role of alkaline pH, that was demonstrated as an essential factor for APOL1 cation conductivity in previous publications?</p></disp-quote><p>Treatment of cells with ammonium chloride has been known to inhibit the lytic activity of human serum for decades (Raper et al., 1996). It is also well described that APOL1 requires two steps to function as a cation channel: an acidic pH activation step, driving an irreversible membrane association, and a neutral pH step to open the channel (Thomson and Finkelstein, 2015).</p><p>Bringing the pH to a less acidic value in the intracellular compartments of the cell can be accomplished with ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloride pre-treatment of trypanosomes and, we now show mammalian cells, before exposure to APOL1 inhibits APOL1 activation when the cell is exposed to APOL1. Our data shows APOL1 in the neutral ER is not cytotoxic. The transit of APOL1 through the biosynthetic pathway as it is delivered to the plasma membrane is where the APOL1 can be activated by acidity. This activation becomes fully mature only once the APOL1 is neutralized, which is the state of the plasma membrane. Our use of ammonium chloride is to bring up the pH of the normally acidic biosynthetic compartments. By reducing the acidity of the biosynthetic pathway before addition of biotin, we reduce the cytotoxicity of the RRVs of APOL1 in our RUSH based model of APOL1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following are some specific comments that are suggested for consideration by the authors:</p><p>1) The authors are referred to Lannon et al., 2019. This report demonstrates that the appropriate background haplotype for APOL1 G0 for comparison with G1 and G2, is that which naturally occurs in the population in which G1 and G2 occur, and not a construct on a haplotype which does not occur in natural populations at all (namely G1 and G2 mutagenesis on the reference European haplotype APOL1-G0 (BC143038.1), as described in the current manuscript). Thus for example, G0 K150E is itself was more toxic than G0 E150K. In the current manuscript the G0 variant used had K (lysine) at residue 150 whereas RRV had 150E (the natural variant) (Figure 1). G0 was innocuous to cells as opposed to RRV. Even though the frequency of this variant is higher than G0 with E, the G0K150E should also be used in the comparative cellular studies to examine the significance of glutamic acid at this position as an explanation for the different cells toxicity and cellular calcium level in RRV vs. GO.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is answered in detail in our response to Essential revisions point 5. We have made stable cells, which express G0 E150 and detected no cell death (see Author response images 1 and 2). Additionally, we are of the belief that the appropriate control is G0 K150, as it the most prevalent in the human population. It is not the scope of this study to compare variants of &quot;wild-type&quot; APOL1, but to understand why the variants are cytotoxic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors titrated APOL1 protein expression in FT293-G0 cells to similar levels found in interferon-stimulated human podocytes (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A) in order to achieve physiologic expression. They conclude that 0.2 ng/mL doxycycline and 10 ng/mL interferon-Î³ lead to similar levels of APOL1. However, it appears that APOL1 expression after Dox induction (0.2 ng/mL doxycycline) is lower than its expression after interferon (most evident in lane 3-from the right). In addition, for Figure 1 and Video 1, a higher concentrations of Dox are reported â therefore the expression of APOL1 variants is expected to be higher than the claim of achieving physiologic levels similar to those which accompany interferon induction in the podocyte platform.</p></disp-quote><p>We only demonstrate the use physiological levels in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1. This effort taken was to address comments made by O'Toole that physiological levels of RRV expression are not cytotoxic. However, in their studies they did not use any method to determine what was &quot;physiological&quot;. We show that expressing similar amounts of APOL1 as a podocyte in culture does in fact lead to cell death. FT293-APOL1 expression being lower than the podocytes on the western blot further bolsters the argument that physiologically inducible APOL1 levels as occurs in patients being treated with interferons can be cytotoxic in podocytes.</p><p>The lower the levels of APOL1, the slower the time to death. In the 0.2 ng/mL dox induction experiments we report the level of cytotoxicity after 48 hours. We see a more rapid progression of cell death with higher levels of APOL1 induction, the condition we then use in the rest of the manuscript. It is worth noting that we and others have seen that extremely high level of APOL1 expression has a toxicity even with the G0 variants. We carefully engineered two model systems to hold the APOL1 expression levels to best represent the physiologically relevant biology.</p><p>We did not use 0.2 ng/mL dox for future experiments because it would be extremely difficult to perform long-term live cell imaging. At this low dose, RRV cytotoxicity is severely delayed, and imaging for 3-4 days would be near impossible due to cell motility, cell division, and phototoxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Increased extracellular CaCl<sub>2</sub> in cell culture media (from basal 2mM up to 8 Mm) was used to demonstrate the role of calcium influx and calcium content in cell injury in cells expressing the RRV compared to G0. The clinical relevance of elevated non-physiological extracellular calcium concentrations used in these experiments is not clear. In addition, the increased calcium influx could represent the consequence and not cause of non-specific cell injury, similar to previous reports regarding potassium depletion. In order to prove a causal role of extracellular calcium and consequent increased cytoplasmic calcium, experiments with low to zero extracellular calcium and with intracellular calcium chelators (BAPTA-AM) should be performed. In other words to prove the authors' claim that ion flux precedes cell swelling by several hours and is therefore the likely driver of cell death, can the authors state whether intracellular calcium buffering was used and if so, did it attenuate APOL1 cell injury?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we have performed the suggested experiment and answered in detail in the manuscript and also in response to Essential revisions point 2. Lower extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to significantly lower RRV cytotoxicity at levels â¤ 0.45 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Further, the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> molar chelation capacity of intracellular BAPTA is easily overwhelmed by a continuous flux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cannot have a sustained protective effect for the cell. Continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases over several hours (see all videos) and perhaps some temporal toxicity effect could be parsed out of very carefully planned experiments, however we believe more simple demonstrations are presented and answer the concerns of the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The APOL1 plasmid used in the RUSH platform did not contain its natural signal peptide (Figure 3A), but rather the IL-2 signal peptide was used. Why is that and were studies conducted with APOL1 harboring its own signal peptide?</p></disp-quote><p>All FT293 cells contained the native APOL1 signal peptide. The RUSH system contains the IL-2 signal peptide and has been used in over a hundred publications with various other proteins with no negative effect. The signal peptide is simply to get the protein translated in the ER. N-terminal signal sequences are well known to be cleaved subsequent to the docking of the ribosome to the ER and we can find no reason for concern as to which signal sequence is utilized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is clear that increased calcium in cytoplasm preceded cell death (measured by measured by cell death marker DRAQ7), however increased LDH may represent an even earlier marker for cell injury. Looking at Figure 3: the earliest data presented regarding LDH release after adding biotin was after 6 hours â at that time point RRV (especially G2) lead to cell injury measured by LDH release. GCaMP6f fluorescence (calcium indicator protein) started to increase 3 hours after adding biotin. As increased cellular calcium may represent a non-specific marker for cell injury â please provide parallel data for LDH release 3 hours after adding biotin, in order to understand if increased calcium in cytoplasm precedes LDH release. Moreover, looking at Figure 5, LDH release was increased 2 hours after adding biotin, simultaneously with the increased calcium in cytoplasm, suggesting that increased calcium influx represents a nonspecific marker for cell injury.</p></disp-quote><p>LDH is a cytoplasmic protein encompassing 4 subunits. The full-size protein is approximately 144 kDa. In Video 1 and Video 2, all cells are treated with a cell impermeable dye, DRAQ7, which is approximately 600 â 700 Da. LDH would only be released, at its earliest, when DRAQ7 is first detected. DRAQ7 is not detected until after cell lysis (see Video 2). Therefore, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx occurs several hours prior to LDH release.</p><p>Regarding Figure 5 (now Figure 6) we apologize for the confusion and have corrected this. LDH was measured 12 â 24 h AFTER biotin release. The 2h signified that cells were acidified 2 h after biotin.</p><p>We find that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is not a non-specific, downstream event that occurs after cell injury. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is concurrent with a Na<sup>+</sup> influx, which we find as the first measurable effects of RRV channel activity (see Figure 6 and response to Essential revisions points 2, 3 and 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4B: the experiments were conducted in non-permeabilized CHO cells, however, the staining of APOL1 after adding biotin seems to be in the ER and not only in the plasma membrane. Where is the calnexin stain mentioned in the text (as a control for non-permeabilized cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>The merged images contain all three channels: Calnexin, APOL1, and nuclear stain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> shows the images of the calnexin channel alone, which shows no signal over background:</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51185-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>7) Lower levels of G2 were detected at the plasma membrane compared to G0 (Figure 4). The authors explain this by invoking increased G2 cyto-toxicity. However, it is stated that the calnexin signal was used to filter out permeabilized cells (Figure 4C), which should mitigate such an effect as the explanation. That decreased G2 plasma membrane expression on one hand, and increased toxicity on the other hand, does not reconcile with the hypothesis that APOL1 channel activity at the plasma membrane is the most proximate causal mediator for cell death.Lower RUSH-G2 levels were also detected via western blot (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). While Figure 5 shows lower amounts of total G2 at the cell surface, the fold change, depicted in Figure 5D and E, shows that the increase in cell surface localization after biotin addition is similar to G0 and G1. Basically, G2 can do &quot;more with less.&quot; That explanation is corroborated by the higher cytotoxicity of G2 compared to G1 seen in multiple experiments.</p><p>In the stable cells, however, similar levels of protein expression were found between all three variants, and the same results for cytotoxicity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are observed.</p><p>The timing of events should make it clear, that APOL1 gets to the cell surface only after biotin addition, and within a short amount of time only then is Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx detected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Increased calcium in cytoplasm is expected to increase ER calcium (Figure 4, Wu et al., 2014). Calcium release from ER should not exceed uptake to the ER. However, the data presented in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2, show stable concentration of calcium in the ER, without an expected increase.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4 of Wu et al., 2014, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> begins at 0 mM, and then a 20% increase in fluorescence (with the ER sensor) is detected when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is increased to 2 mM. It is true that the ER acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sink and buffer for the rest of the cell, however this experiment where a massive change in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs cannot be compared to a cation channel acting at the plasma membrane.</p><p>It is also important to note that in our Figure 3âfigure supplement 2, the sensors have vastly different Kd for Ca<sup>2+</sup> as they are working in the range of 100s of nM (cytoplasm) to 100s of ÂµM (ER). The APOL1 mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may lead to the ER taking up some of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>, however if that amount is only in the 10s or 100s of nM, then it may not be detected by the sensor. The ER-LAR-GECO sensor was primarily designed to measure release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors hypothesize that G0 is sequestered by an unknown chaperone while trafficking along the secretory pathway. In light of similar expression of all APOL1 variants in the plasma membrane, it seems that G0 sequestration does not occur prior to trafficking to the plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As mentioned in response to reviewer 1 point 5 and reviewer 2 point 4, we have decided to omit the chaperone from our working model as there is no evidence in the literature. It is only a hypothesis, which we now solely mention in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) RUSH-APOL1 transfected cells were transiently acidified at pH 5.5 then returned to neutral pH. According to Figure 5A, acidification enhances cell injury for all APOL1 variants including G0. However, as reported previously and also in this current manuscript by electrophysiologic studies â APOL1 insertion into lipid bilayers requires an acidic melieu and has transient chloride permeability which turns into cationic conductance (potassium â as per Bruno et al., 2017) at neutral pH. Similarly, in the current manuscript (Figure 2A), there is a small transient current at pH 5.6, that is enhanced significantly at pH 7.1. In light of these findings one could expect that an acidic pH in essential for APOL1 toxicity. Moreover, changing into neutral pH (after priming with an acidic pH) is expected to increase APOL1 conductance and therefore cell injury mediated by this cationic channel conductance. The data presented in Figure 5, seem contradictory: return to neutral pH attenuates APOL1 cell injury. In addition, if indeed APOL1 RRVs form calcium channels at the plasma membrane which increase intracellular calcium concentrations in turn leading to cell death, then returning to neutral pH would be expected to lead to decreased calcium influx and correspondingly decreased intracellular calcium levels â the results of such experiment should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the misunderstanding. The ammonium chloride experiment only works if it is done <italic>before</italic> APOL1 is exposed to acidified environments. It is used to neutralize the acidic compartments in the cell/trypanosome before exposure to APOL1. Once APOL1 has become activated via acidification, ammonium chloride will have no effect. The APOL1 channel requires two steps to function: Acidification to form a channel active followed by a neutral pH for the channel open.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Since the authors did not demonstrate selectivity for calcium conductance caveats regarding author mechanisms need attention. For example, increased cellular calcium may result from increased potassium efflux and cellular potassium depletion that was reported in previous manuscripts (Olabisi et al., 2016), and as mentioned briefly by the authors in the Discussion. cell death and kidney disease should be further explored.</p></disp-quote><p>The selectivity of APOL1 for Ca<sup>2+</sup> over Cl<sup>-</sup> was clearly demonstrated.

It is still possible that the 20% of cells that die are the 20% highest expressers, which are effectively diluted out by the remaining non-expressers and thus the actual cells with active channels are higher expressing than the podocytes, especially as cytotoxicity is dose-dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned-down the degree of confidence in achieving physiological podocyte expression levels of APOL1. While we did make single-integrated stable cell lines using the Flp-In technology under a tet-promoter, we agree softening our statements to be more accurate is well advised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I agree with reviewer #3 and Essential revisions point 5 that the wrong G0 control (K150 instead of E150) was used for these studies. It is irrelevant that non-Africans (with G0 K150) happen to outnumber Africans (with G0 E150) selected for sequencing in the 1000 genomes project. E150 G0 would thus have been the correct haplotype to use. However, it is also true that E150 would likely only marginally diminish the difference between G0 and G1/G2 and so is not worth redoing the whole dataset. Nonetheless, the authors need to acknowledge that E150 would have been a better control and refer to Lannon et al. for the fact that it would have only made a small difference to the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We address our use of the G0 K150 control as being suboptimal relative to the G0 E150 control in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
