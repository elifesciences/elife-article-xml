Lenacapavir, developed by Gilead Sciences, is the first capsid-targeting drug approved for medical use. Here, we investigate the effect of lenacapavir on HIV capsid stability and uncoating. We employ a single particle approach that simultaneously measures capsid content release and lattice persistence. We demonstrate that lenacapavir’s potent antiviral activity is predominantly due to lethal hyperstabilisation of the capsid lattice and resultant loss of compartmentalisation. This study highlights that disrupting capsid metastability is a powerful strategy for the development of novel antivirals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>capsid</kwd><kwd>drug mechanism of action</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1182212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><name><surname>Böcking</surname><given-names>Till</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>214344/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Towers</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Leo C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name><name><surname>Böcking</surname><given-names>Till</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1194263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP160101874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP200102871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The anti-HIV drug lenacapavir breaks the HIV capsid by stabilising regions of low curvature at the expense of maintaining a closed shell, leading to loss of viral DNA synthesis and inhibition of infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell is a hostile environment for HIV, as the reverse transcribed cDNA genome is a target for innate immune sensors which unleash a potent interferon response that can suppress replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zuliani Alvarez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lahaye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>). For a productive infection to occur, the reverse transcribing genome must be trafficked through the cytoplasm, enter the nucleus and integrate into the preferred sites in the host chromatin, all while evading detection by the host cell. The viral capsid facilitates these early steps in the replication cycle by encapsulating the genome and associated viral enzymes. In doing so, it protects the genome from being sensed and destroyed by nucleases, prevents loss of viral enzymes from the reverse transcription complex, and forms the interface through which all cytoplasmic, and many nuclear, host-virus interactions occur.</p><p>The conical capsid shell is comprised of ~1500 copies of the capsid protein (CA), which spontaneously assemble into a lattice. This lattice consists of mostly hexamers and exactly 12 pentamers to form a closed fullerene cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pornillos et al., 2011</xref>). While the capsid must be stable enough to transit the cytoplasmic compartment without exposing the genome, it must also be able to release the reverse transcribed cDNA at the appropriate time and in the appropriate location in the nucleus. This process is called capsid uncoating and its regulation and mechanism are poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that uncoating proceeds through two discrete steps in vitro: capsids opening, in which the integrity of the cone is compromised and encapsidated proteins are released; and catastrophic disassembly of the lattice by release of CA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>). We have also shown that recruitment of cellular cofactors or binding of pharmacological agents to the capsid can greatly alter both processes.</p><p>To engage with host cofactors, the mature HIV capsid utilises at least three cytoplasm-facing surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Temple et al., 2020</xref>). One of these is the central pore, which is formed by a ring of positively charged arginine residues (R18 ring) at the sixfold symmetry axis in CA hexamers and at the fivefold axis in pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacques et al., 2016</xref>). It serves to recruit nucleotides required for reverse transcription and as a binding site for inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6), a metabolite present at concentrations of ~40–50 μM in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunce et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Veiga et al., 2006</xref>). IP6 is specifically packaged into immature virions during assembly in producer cells, leading to a ≥10–fold enrichment, and its interaction with the central pore is essential for the assembly and stability of the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallery et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Obr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sowd and Aiken, 2021</xref>). The central pore has also been implicated in the capsid’s interaction with microtubule-based motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another important interface is the cyclophilin binding loop. As its name suggests, this largely unstructured loop protrudes from the capsid surface to recruit cyclophilin A (CypA). This interaction is mediated by a conserved glycine-proline motif (G89-P90) that inserts into the CypA active site. The implications of this interaction are still to be fully understood, but are thought to include viral evasion of innate host defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Towers et al., 2003</xref>). Importantly, we have previously shown that this interaction can be exploited in vitro to ‘paint’ the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>). By using a fluorescently labelled CypA, we found that it is possible to detect, quantify, and monitor disassembly of the CA lattice in permeabilised virions by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy without significantly influencing the capsid opening process.</p><p>The third host-interaction surface, the FG-binding site, is a hydrophobic pocket in the CA N-terminal domain situated near the intra-hexameric junction between CA molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This site serves as the binding interface for several host factors, including the cytoplasmic protein Sec24C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rebensburg et al., 2021</xref>), components of the nuclear pore complex including NUP153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>) and other permeability barrier-forming nucleoporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dickson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2024</xref>), and the nuclear protein CPSF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Sequential interactions with these proteins are crucial for nuclear entry and correct integration site targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejarano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>). Each of these proteins interacts with the capsid via a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif. Additionally, several generations of antiviral compounds also target this site by effectively mimicking the FG-motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the potency and mechanism of action of these agents varies, despite their shared binding site.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CA hexamer structures in complex with FG-binding pocket ligands.</title><p>Two neighbouring CA molecules (grey, light brown) are shown as surface representation.

BI-2 has a relatively small binding footprint on the CA N-terminal domain, barely extending beyond the FG-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This limited interaction is reflected in the relatively weak binding affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 1.2 μM) and high drug concentration required to inhibit infection by 50% during the early stage of infection (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50=3 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2014</xref>). PF74, on the other hand, extends its interaction beyond the FG-binding pocket to make additional contacts with a neighbouring CA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These bridging contacts are thought to be responsible for PF74’s 10-fold tighter <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> (120 nM) and IC50 (relative to BI-2). Both BI-2 and PF74 can compete with host cofactor binding (Sec24C, Nup153, and CPSF6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fricke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rebensburg et al., 2021</xref>), and also directly affect capsid structure and stability. While both compounds have capsid-opening activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fricke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shi et al., 2011</xref>), leading to a block of reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jennings et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallery et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sowd et al., 2021</xref>), PF74 also increases the stiffness of the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rankovic et al., 2018</xref>) and stabilises hexameric CA lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallery et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to BI-2 and PF74, which have found use exclusively in the laboratory, LEN is a first-in-class HIV-1 capsid inhibitor in clinical trials and approved by the European Union and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical use in patients with multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dvory-Sobol et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patel et al., 2023</xref>). Structurally, LEN makes extensive contacts across two neighbouring CA monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), allowing for a very high-affinity interaction (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 215 pM).

Indirect visualisation of LEN binding to authentic capsids in real time reveals that capsid breakage depends on the occupancy of FG binding pockets. In vitro assembly assays show that LEN and IP6 synergise to accelerate CA assembly but promote tubular (LEN) versus conical (IP6) structures, leading to the formation of aberrant capsid structures. Altogether, our data suggest that substoichiometric binding of LEN stabilises the hexameric CA lattice at the cost of fully closed capsids, leading to loss of reverse transcription. This mechanism becomes dominant in the high pM range, close to the inhibitory concentration that leads to 95% inhibition (IC95) of viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-virion analysis of intrinsic capsid stability and uncoating</title><p>We used a single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay to measure the intrinsic capsid stability and uncoating kinetics at the level of individual viral particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>) and then measured the effect of LEN treatment on these processes. As shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, we used pore-forming proteins to permeabilise GFP-loaded HIV particles immobilised at the bottom surface of a microfluidic channel device.

Upon membrane permeabilisation, virions with a ‘leaky’ capsid lost their entire GFP signal in a single step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, virions containing an intact capsid retained the pool of GFP inside the capsid. This residual (low intensity) GFP signal was lost in a second step upon spontaneous loss of capsid integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, ‘opening’), whereby the lifetime of each opening capsid was given by the time difference between the two GFP release steps.

HIV particles were produced using a proviral construct with internal GFP that is released from the viral Gag protein during maturation and packaged as a solution phase marker inside the two compartments bound by the viral membrane and the capsid, respectively. These GFP-loaded HIV particles are immobilised on the coverslip surface and permeabilised in the presence of AF568-labelled CypA while recording fluorescence traces at the locations of individual HIV particles by TIRF microscopy. Permeabilisation of the viral membrane (step a) with a pore-forming protein leads to loss of ~80–90% of the GFP signal corresponding to the pool of GFP outside the capsid. AF568-CypA molecules diffuse through the membrane pores and bind to the capsid to reach a level that is proportional to the number of CA subunits in the capsid.

Two broad stability types can be distinguished: (1) Unstable/non-functional capsids. ‘Leaky’ (total GFP release upon virion permeabilisation) and ‘opening–short-lived’ capsids (half-life of 1–2 min) are intrinsically unstable and cannot be rescued by IP6. These capsids are presumably incompletely or improperly assembled and non-functional. (2) Stable/functional capsids. The subpopulation of ‘opening–long-lived’ capsids (half-life of 8–16 min) can be stabilised by IP6, which keeps the closed cone intact by preventing loss of the first subunit(s), greatly increasing the half-life. Capsids that remain closed at the end of the experiment are presumed to have the same uncoating behaviour (i.e. are structurally and functionally the same) as ‘opening–long-lived’ capsids, whereby the imaging period was simply not long enough to observe the opening of all capsids in the field of view. <italic><underline>Limitations of the TIRF uncoating assay:</underline></italic> As with all imaging methodologies, the particle detection limit depends on factors that influence the signal-to-noise ratio (e.g. laser power, exposure time, penetration depth, imaging frequency, photophysical properties of the fluorophore). <italic><underline>Known artefacts of iGFP:</underline></italic> (1) Particles produced with iGFP have a broad distribution of GFP intensities, and dim particles with closed capsids that contain too little GFP can fall below the detection limit and thus appear as GFP-negative/CypA paint-positive spots.

We attribute this background of false positives (typically &lt;5% of the preparation) to particles containing residual uncleaved Gag-iGFP. <italic><underline>Known artefacts of CypA paint:</underline></italic> The efficiency of using CypA paint analysis to detect leaky capsids depends on the imaging frequency. This is because the CypA paint signal of leaky capsids is too short-lived (often appearing in only one frame or missed entirely when imaged at a low frequency) to be detected in a noisy baseline. For example, only ~20% of leaky capsids that are detected by GFP release are also detected by CypA paint at an imaging frequency of 1 frame every 6 s.

The survival curve for untreated virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, no drug) showed a biphasic decay profile with ~30% short-lived (half-life of 1.0±0.5 min) and ~70% long-lived (half-life of 15±3 min) capsids, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mallery et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Renner et al., 2023</xref>). Long-lived capsids can be stabilised by the host cofactor IP6 (see below) and are considered functionally relevant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for a detailed discussion of the capsid stability types observed in this assay). Control experiments showed that the fraction of IP6-stabilised capsids was independent of the concentration of the pore-forming protein used to permeabilise the viral membrane, confirming that it does not affect capsid stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>As a complementary measurement, we used AF568-labelled CypA as a ‘paint’ that binds transiently to the outside of the capsid, rapidly reaching a dynamic equilibrium, whereby the AF568-CypA intensity is proportional to the number of CA subunits in the lattice. Importantly, AF568-CypA was used at concentrations (0.5–1 μM) where fewer than 4% of the available cyclophilin loops are occupied, and we have previously shown that uncoating kinetics are not affected under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>). Single-molecule analysis showed that the AF568-CypA signal remained constant while the capsid was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, ‘closed’) but decayed to background levels after the capsid opened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, ‘leaky’ and ‘opening’). Analysis of all leaky and opening traces aligned to the time of capsid opening showed that the median CypA signal decayed with a half-life of less than 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This rapid decay is consistent with a failure cascade that propagates across the whole capsid resulting in complete lattice disassembly. Taken together, our single-molecule analysis shows that GFP release pinpoints the time the first defect appears in the capsid while the CypA paint signal provides an indirect read-out for the disassembly kinetics of the CA lattice thereafter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LEN induces capsid opening but prevents loss of CA from the lattice of open capsids</title><p>In the next set of experiments, we focused on the effect of LEN on the intrinsic capsid stability without capsid-binding cofactors; the interplay between IP6, which is essential for maintaining capsid stability in cells, and LEN is described in later sections. To measure the maximum effect of LEN on capsid uncoating, we added the drug at a concentration (500 nM) that leads to rapid binding to essentially all FG binding sites. Uncoating traces of single virions in the presence of 500 nM LEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) revealed two fundamental differences to the single-molecule profiles described above. First, LEN treatment caused earlier release of the encapsidated GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ‘opening’), resulting in a faster decaying survival curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, light green line) and a concomitant threefold decrease in the fraction of closed capsids at the end of the experiment. Second, the AF568-CypA signal of capsids that were defective to begin with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ‘leaky’) or started to uncoat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, ‘opening’) remained constant. This striking stabilisation effect was also clear in the heatmaps of all leaky and opening capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and 500 nM LEN). Since the CypA paint traces of leaky and opening capsids showed the same characteristics, we combined these classes in subsequent analyses to assess the extent to which LEN could stabilise the lattice of open capsids. Taken together, the GFP release and CypA paint analysis in the presence of 500 nM LEN suggest that binding of LEN induces rupture of capsids (leading to early GFP release) but prevents the loss of CA subunits from defective or ruptured capsids (stable CypA paint signal).</p><p>To further quantify these apparently opposing effects on capsid integrity and CA lattice stability, we measured GFP release and CypA paint traces in the presence of LEN at concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The survival curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) showed a pronounced concentration-dependent acceleration of capsid opening kinetics with an intermediate effect at 5 nM and the maximal effect at ≥50 nM LEN, leading to a two- to fourfold (5 nM and ≥50 nM LEN, respectively) decrease in the fraction of capsids that remained closed after 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Addition of LEN during the uncoating experiment causes a concentration-dependent increase in the fraction of single-step GFP release traces (reaching 65 ± 5% at 500 nM LEN), whereby we attribute the increase to rapid LEN-induced rupture of intact capsids (too fast to be resolved as a separate step in the uncoating traces recorded with a frame rate of 1 frame every 6 s).

LEN concentrations of ≥50 nM prevented disassembly of leaky and opening capsids, as evidenced by the stable CypA paint signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which persisted for at least 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Under the conditions used in the single-molecule uncoating assay, the capsid is exposed to the membrane-permeable drug for ~2 min before the pore forming protein permeabilises the viral membrane. Thus, we first calculated the occupancy at this time point to estimate the threshold required to prevent disassembly of defective capsids (see Materials and methods). Unsurprisingly, the low occupancy at 5 nM LEN (calculated to be &lt;10%) was insufficient for lattice stabilisation. In contrast, 32–66% occupancy at 50 nM LEN was sufficient to prevent CA lattice disassembly. Based on these considerations, we estimate that 2–4 LEN molecules per hexamer are sufficient to prevent the release of CA subunits from a CA lattice with open edges.</p><p>In summary, LEN dose-dependently increased the proportion of open capsids but increased the stability of their lattices. The dose-dependence observed here differs from previous in vitro uncoating measurements showing (partial) capsid lattice stabilisation down to 0.05 nM LEN; in those experiments 50–65% of cores stained with the irreversibly bound tetrameric probe CypA-dsRed remained detectable after 30 min of incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bester et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, our observation of capsids that do not lose CA despite having openings is consistent with the LEN dose-dependent increase in the number of CA-positive spots detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bester et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selyutina et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IP6 counteracts but does not prevent LEN-induced capsid rupture</title><p>We have previously shown that the cellular cofactor IP6 stabilises capsids and delays capsid opening in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallery et al., 2018</xref>). Since IP6 is present in cells (typically 40–50 μM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunce et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letcher et al., 2008</xref>) and therefore expected to impact the effects of LEN in vivo, we asked if IP6 could prevent LEN-induced rupture of the capsid. As before, IP6 (100 μM) strongly stabilised capsids in permeabilised virions, leading to reduced capsid opening kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and a ~twofold increase in the fraction of closed capsids at 15 min compared to the control without IP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). IP6 partially counteracted the capsid-breaking effect at 5 nM LEN (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), but even at this concentration the drug increased capsid opening kinetics relative to IP6 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At high LEN concentrations (≥50 nM), the survival curves measured in the presence and absence of IP6 were essentially the same, showing that IP6 was no longer able to slow the premature rupture of the capsid induced by the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This acceleration in capsid opening led to an eightfold reduction in the fraction of closed capsids at 15 min compared to the control with IP6 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We conclude that IP6 partially protects capsids from LEN-induced structural damage, but only at low drug concentrations. The higher susceptibility to structural damage in the absence of IP6 is consistent with the observation that LEN more potently inhibits reverse transcription in vitro and in cells when IP6 levels are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sowd et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we asked if IP6 could act in conjunction with LEN to stabilise the CA lattice after capsid opening. As observed for other polyanions binding at the R18 ring at the centre of the CA hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>), IP6 by itself slows but does not prevent the catastrophic collapse of CA lattices with open edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). CA lattice dissociation of leaky and opening capsids is further slowed when IP6 is added to 5 nM LEN (&lt;10% occupancy of FG sites at the time of membrane permeabilisation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). At 50 nM LEN (&gt;30% occupancy of FG sites), the CypA paint signal remains constant in the presence and absence of IP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>), such that differences in stability during the time frame of the experiment are difficult to ascertain. Overall, these data suggest that IP6 further stabilises LEN-stabilised CA lattices but not to the extent where it can prevent CA release from lattices at low LEN occupancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Slow LEN binding kinetics delay the structural drug effects at low concentrations</title><p>Next, we considered the kinetics of LEN binding to explain the observed differences in drug-induced capsid rupture between 5 nM and higher concentrations (50 and 500 nM). The LEN binding curves calculated using published association and dissociation rate constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) predict that LEN occupancies ≥95% are reached within &lt;2 min at 500 nM and ~15 min at 50 nM but reaching this level requires almost 3 hr at 5 nM LEN. Thus, we postulated that the intermediate capsid breakage kinetics observed at 5 nM LEN are due to slow binding kinetics such that occupancy levels required for fast capsid breakage are not reached quickly enough within the imaging period. To test this, we preincubated virions with 5 nM LEN for 4 hr, during which 95% of sites are occupied. Analysis of GFP release traces showed that preincubation with 5 nM LEN increased the extent of drug-induced capture rupture to that observed at 500 nM without preincubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, &gt;50% of the capsids had apparently already been ruptured inside the viral membrane, leading to an increase in ‘leaky’ traces relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that drug-induced capsid rupture manifests over time and that rupture, or build-up of the strain required for rupture, can already occur before release of the capsid from the virion. Finally, CypA paint analysis showed that CA lattice disassembly was inhibited with, but not without, preincubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the full extent of the capsid-altering effects is observed after binding occupancy reaches the requisite level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Indirect fluorescence imaging of LEN binding kinetics to HIV capsids via displacement of a ‘paint’ probe for the FG pocket</title><p>To corroborate the LEN binding kinetics, we developed a new imaging assay to measure LEN binding to authentic capsids in real time by displacement of a fluorescent peptide derived from CPSF6 as a ‘paint’ probe that binds dynamically to the FG binding pocket, whereby the binding level is proportional to the fraction of sites that remain unoccupied with the tightly binding drug molecule. The requirement for a paint probe in this assay is that it has fast binding and dissociation kinetics such that it rapidly reaches a dynamic binding equilibrium to probe free sites without blocking them for drug binding. A CPSF6 peptide (CPSF6p, residues 313–327) with a C-terminal cysteine labelled with a fluorescent dye fulfilled these criteria, binding with a half-life of 11 s to the capsids of permeabilised virions on the TIRF microscope coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using single-molecule photobleaching for calibration of the fluorescence intensity, we determined the number of labelled CPSF6p bound at equilibrium per capsid at a range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). At the CPSF6p paint probe concentration (200 nM) used in the LEN binding assay, ~40 labelled CPSF6p are bound at equilibrium per capsid, occupying &lt;3% of FG binding pockets.</p><p>The design of the LEN binding assay is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. GFP-loaded HIV on the coverslip surface were permeabilised using a pore-forming protein and incubated for 2 hr in the presence of IP6 (30 µM) and labelled CPSF6p. During this period all capsids that cannot be stabilised by IP6 (leaky and short-lived) decayed away such that only long-lived IP6-stabilised capsids remained. These were identified as spots positive for GFP (as a capsid integrity marker) and CPSF6. We then added LEN to the flow channel and tracked the GFP and CPSF6p signals at the locations of individual virions over time. LEN led to a concentration-dependent decay of the CPSF6p intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) as LEN increasingly (and irreversibly on the time scale of this experiment) occupies FG binding pockets on the lattice. (We note that photobleaching does not contribute to the signal decay because the bound paint probes continually exchange with fresh molecules from solution). Thus, the decrease in CPSF6p intensity is an indirect read-out for LEN binding, and we converted this data into kinetic curves of LEN binding to authentic HIV capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). An independent repeat of this set of experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>.

Importantly, the new assay design allows the functionally irrelevant subset of defective/IP6-insensitive capsids to disassemble before measuring the effect of LEN exclusively on the functionally relevant subset of IP6-stabilised capsids. This avoids the complexity of convolving intrinsic instability with drug-induced breakage. Remarkably, the stability of the IP6-responsive capsids in the absence of drug exceeded the level of IP6-mediated stabilisation we have previously observed, and we observed little or no loss of capsids over the 90-min imaging period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, 0 nM LEN). The same observation held when imaging was extended to 8 hr, and we estimate the half-life of IP6-stabilised capsids in this assay design to be on the order of day(s).</p><p>Survival analysis in the presence of 0.2–20 nM LEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) revealed the following drug effects on capsid stability. Firstly, rupture of IP6-stabilised capsids accelerated with increasing LEN concentrations. This is apparent from the concentration-dependent faster decay of the survival curves and the corresponding decrease of the half-life of the intact capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, note the log-log scale) from 4.5 hr at 0.2 nM to 1 hr at 1 nM, with rupture becoming essentially immediate at &gt;20 nM LEN (half-life of 2–3 min). Secondly, the survival curves are not purely exponential and show a lag period, especially at the lower end of the concentration range (discussed below). Thirdly, the overall efficiency of capsid rupture decreased sharply toward the lower end of the concentration range, dropping below 65% at 0.4 nM LEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We propose that the complex kinetics of LEN-induced capsid failure observed in our experiments are a convolution of (1) LEN concentration-dependent binding kinetics to gradually increase the occupancy of FG binding pockets with LEN and (2) occupancy-dependent kinetics of capsid rupture where higher occupancy leads to the capsid becoming more unstable. It is also likely that capsids have heterogeneous susceptibility to LEN-induced structural damage, reflecting the heterogeneity of capsid architectures. This is supported by the decrease in breakage efficiency with LEN concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>The power of using our combined CPSF6p paint and GFP release TIRF assay is that we can measure the LEN occupancy at the time of capsid opening and thus directly relate occupancy to drug-induced structural damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Interestingly, the mean LEN occupancy at the time of capsid rupture increased with LEN concentration. At sub-nM concentrations, LEN induced breakage when 20–30% of FG sites were drug-bound. At LEN concentrations ≥10 nM, the mean occupancy at the time of capsid breakage levelled off at ~70%. Taken together, our data suggest that LEN-induced capsid breakage can occur at low occupancies, albeit slowly. Breakage typically occurs at higher occupancies when LEN binding kinetics outpace the (occupancy-dependent) breakage kinetics. At high LEN occupancy (above 70%), capsids become so overwhelmingly unstable that it is practically impossible to bind LEN fast enough to get to complete occupancy before the capsid ruptures.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that efficient and rapid capsid breakage depends on reaching a sufficient occupancy of FG binding pockets, which itself depends on binding kinetics if drugs are added at the beginning of the experiment. At the lowest concentrations tested here (0.2 nM) LEN can break capsids, but slowly and only for a subset of capsids. In contrast, structural damage is induced on time scales that are relevant for infection in the range from high pM (&gt;0.4 nM) to nM concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Infection is inhibited at the stage of reverse transcription in the same concentration range that is required for efficient capsid rupture in vitro</title><p>Next, we tested whether preincubation of virions with LEN (to allow binding to the capsid to equilibrate prior to cell entry) would result in higher potency of the drug in Jurkat cells infected with VSV-G pseudotyped HIV encoding GFP as a reporter.

We monitored the assembly kinetics of recombinant CA by measuring the absorbance at 350 nm and collected samples at the end of each experiment for analysis by negative stain electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, we varied the concentration of IP6 and observed that CA (75 μM) assembled with similar kinetics in the presence of 100 μM or 150 μM IP6 but did not assemble at lower IP6 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left). As expected, negative stain EM images of assembly products formed with only IP6 showed primarily conical shapes with dimensions similar to those observed for native HIV capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right). When we repeated this titration in the presence of 50 μM LEN (substochiometric relative to CA), we observed CA assembly across the entire concentration range (10–150 μM IP6), with IP6 accelerating assembly kinetics and yields in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). Strikingly, LEN in the presence of low IP6 promoted formation of CA tubes (often closed at their ends) with lengths of &gt;500 nm, while increasing IP6 concentrations biased assembly increasingly towards shorter tubes and conical shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right). Next, we varied the concentration of LEN in the presence of 200 μM IP6. Addition of 1–50 μM LEN increased CA assembly efficiency in a concentration-dependent manner above the level observed for IP6 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, left). Notably, the highest LEN concentration (50 μM) did not promote CA (75 μM) assembly without IP6 in low salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). Negative stain EM images confirmed cone formation in the presence 200 μM IP6 and showed that addition of drug led to the formation of aberrant and broken structures in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, right). We conclude that LEN is insufficient to promote CA assembly by itself in low salt conditions but synergises with IP6 to increase assembly kinetics and yields. Importantly, IP6 promotes cone assembly, whereas LEN biases assembly toward tube formation such that closed tubes form in the presence of high drug and sufficiently low IP6. When both molecules are present at high concentrations, where neither molecule can dominate the assembly pathway, assembly proceeds in an aberrant fashion yielding heterogeneous structures.

In contrast to untreated virions which contained mostly single capsids comprised of a single CA layer (74%), almost all LEN-treated virions (96%) contained additional CA structures next to the main capsid (61%) and/or appeared with a double layered capsid (45%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We therefore sought to compare the effect of the above drugs with CPSF6, a host cell protein which also binds the FG-pocket, and bridges the gap between monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Price et al., 2012</xref>). CPSF6 colocalises with the capsids at the nuclear pore complex and inside the nucleus where it plays a role in facilitating nuclear entry and dictating integration site position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejarano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schaller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sowd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zila et al., 2021</xref>).

This apparently counterintuitive phenomenon is consistent with a model in which the lattice must be simultaneously stable but flexible. The antiviral mechanism of LEN can therefore be considered a form of ‘lethal hyperstability’ in which lattice stability is increased at the cost of its flexibility and ultimately capsid integrity. This is reminiscent of the ‘lethal mutagenesis’ mechanism of antiviral polymerase drugs such as favipiravir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias et al., 2014</xref>). Just as with capsid stability, viral replication has conflicting requirements – errors are necessary to promote mutagenesis and evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>) but too many errors and fidelity is compromised. Lethal mutagenesis drugs exert their antiviral affects by pushing viral polymerases to these unsustainable error rates. Similarly, lethal hyperstability capsid drugs like LEN push the capsid lattice to extremely stabilised structures that are incompatible with capsid integrity. Importantly, this mechanism dominates at drug doses required to suppress replication to clinically relevant levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dvory-Sobol et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The effects of lethal hyperstability are observable prior to reaching binding equilibrium or full occupancy and we estimate that efficient and rapid drug-induced capsid rupture and lattice stabilisation occurs when half of the binding sites are occupied. The overall kinetics of inducing structural effects depend on LEN binding kinetics and occupancy-dependent structural changes. As occupancy increases over time, breakage becomes increasingly likely and rapid. Due to the high affinity of the drug, sub-nM concentrations are sufficient to induce structural effects, but it takes hours to reach the requisite binding level. The cofactor IP6, which, in the absence of drug, would normally delay spontaneous capsid opening by many hours, counteracts but is ultimately unable to prevent LEN-induced capsid rupture. It is also worth noting that HIV capsids are pleiomorphic and exhibit different levels of intrinsic stability as evident from our single-molecule analysis, such that the occupancy required for LEN-induced structural changes is likely to vary between different capsid architectures.</p><p>The comparison of the single-molecule analysis of the three major drugs (BI-2, PF74, and LEN) offers insight into how binding stabilises the CA lattice, even when it is no longer a closed shell. BI-2 is the simplest compound, and only makes contacts within a single monomer and has the lowest affinity. As such it offers no potential for enhancing contacts between individual proteins within the lattice. It is therefore unsurprising that, even at 50 μM (approaching the solubility limit of the drug), BI-2 provides no significant lattice stabilisation once the capsid has ruptured. PF74 and LEN, on the other hand, both make contacts across the junction between monomers within the context of the hexamer, and both have been shown to have higher affinity for hexamers than monomers. This suggests that the two drugs lock monomers together within the hexamer, potentially limiting their ability to move with respect to each other - reducing degrees of freedom and hence flexibility within the lattice that is required to maintain a closed capsid. Evidence that the hexamers are stabilised comes from lattice assembly experiments in which LEN promotes CA assembly in the presence of IP6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) or high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bester et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Link et al., 2020</xref>). While PF74 does stabilise the CA lattice post-rupture, the lattice will deteriorate on a time scale of an hour. LEN-treated cores, on the other hand, show no lattice loss even after 5 hr post-rupture. The degree of lattice stabilisation, therefore, correlates with the degree to which the drugs bridge the junction between monomers.</p><p>How exactly stabilising the lattice triggers capsid rupture is less clear. It has previously been suggested that the binding of the drug reduces the flexibility of the CA molecule and therefore the lattice plasticity required to maintain capsid integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). These authors also suggest that, due to its hexamer preference, PF74 stabilises hexamers at the cost of pentamers. As precisely 12 pentamers are required, any process that disfavour pentamers, would necessarily lead to capsid rupture. A recent cryoEM study comparing the structures of hexamers and pentamers identified residues 58–61 as being a potential ‘switch’ between the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schirra et al., 2023</xref>); this switch was also confirmed in a second cryoEM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stacey et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, the pentamer configuration of these residues results in a remodelling of the FG-binding site. The authors speculate that LEN may result in an induced fit switch to the hexameric configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schirra et al., 2023</xref>), and our data would be consistent with such a model. Another cryoET study of HIV cores incubated under conditions that facilitate reverse transcription inside the capsid showed that treatment with GS-CA1 (an analogue of LEN) for 4 hr led to loss of CA lattice pieces and a flattening of the remaining lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christensen et al., 2020</xref>). The authors proposed that the compound restricts CA flexibility, causing a build-up of lattice strain, and consequently lattice fracture. We previously proposed a similar mode of action for the capsid-breaking activity of PF74 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Márquez et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, cryoEM of templated CA lattices confirmed that LEN binds exclusively to hexamers and suggested a critical role of IP6 for the formation of pentamers and high curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Highland et al., 2023</xref>), consistent with our observation that IP6 can partially antagonise LEN-induced rupture of the closed cone.</p><p>LEN also possesses antiviral activity during viral production. Not only does LEN compromise the integrity of existing capsid cores but it interferes with assembly/maturation as well. Our in vitro assembly experiments suggest that, while LEN promotes IP6-driven assembly it leads to improperly assembled cones that cannot be closed. This is consistent with the observation that LEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bester et al., 2020</xref>) and the closely related analogue GS-CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yant et al., 2019</xref>) lead to the formation of aberrant capsids in virions. IP6 binds to the electropositive ‘pore’ created by 6 (or 5) copies of Arg18 at the centre of each CA hexamer (or pentamer). By neutralising the charge repulsion, IP6 stabilises these structures and is thought to be particularly important for incorporation of pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renner et al., 2021</xref>) required for forming the high curvature lattice at the ends of the cone. On the other hand, LEN drives assembly of low curvature hexameric lattices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Both compounds together might lead to uncontrolled lattice growth without the ability to reverse defects and/or LEN might drive remodelling of pentamers at the growing lattice edge into hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grime et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the over-assembly phenotype that we observe upon drug treatment of mature virions supports the notion that LEN causes aberrant CA assembly in addition to distorting existing structures. While our data do not resolve how the LEN-induced capsid defects manifest structurally in isolated capsids, within mature virions this could be due to a build-up of strain within the primary capsid. In addition, ‘secondary CA lattices’ would likely compete for the limited IP6 present within the virion, effectively reducing the amount available to the primary capsid, thereby reducing its resistance to rupture and possibly also adjusting the hexamer/pentamer balance.</p><p>The antiviral multimodality of LEN is also seen in the biphasic response curve in the infection assay. The high-dose phase occurs above 0.5 nM LEN, above which the considerations of capsid rupture are relevant. The high-dose phase also corresponds to the concentrations at which reverse transcription is also inhibited. A biphasic inhibition curve has previously been seen for PF74 (and is repeated here) where, similarly, loss of reverse transcription accompanies this high-dose phase. We and others had previously attributed the loss of reverse transcriptase activity to the opening of the capsid lattice and release of the RT enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christensen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jennings et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sowd et al., 2021</xref>). Our data support this same explanation for LEN-induced loss of RT. However, LEN is not simply a tighter-binding version of PF74. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (LEN) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (PF74) show that when the drug response curves are plotted as a function of occupancy, LEN exerts its effects at much lower capsid occupancy than PF74. In a previous study, when BI-2 and PF74 were similarly compared, they were found to be identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Price et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that increased CA affinity only partially explains LEN’s superior potency and may speak to a greater ‘rigidification potential’ or ultrastructure-altering capability relative to prior compounds that target this same site.</p><p>While the second phase of the dose response curve has a clear explanation, the activity of the drugs at the first phase remains controversial. At these concentrations (&lt;0.5 nM for LEN;&lt;4 nM PF74,&lt;50 nM for BI-2) neither capsid rupture nor loss of viral DNA synthesis are observed. One possible explanation could be that at low drug concentration the low occupancy contributes to CA lattice stability, without the concomitant rupture observed at higher doses. In combination with the cone-stabilising activity of IP6, low dose LEN could render the capsid core too stable thereby leading to altered genome release kinetics during infection. However, the observation that 2-LTR circle formation is not reduced at the EC50 for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bester et al., 2020</xref>) is inconsistent with this model as failure to release the viral cDNA from the capsid would be expected as a result of capsid stabilisation. Alternatively, disrupting the ability of the capsid to interact with FG-containing cofactors (Sec24C, Nup153, and CPSF6) has also been proposed to inhibit infection. Our data predict that, at its EC50, LEN occupies approximately 15-30% of the FG-binding sites, while PF74 occupies &gt;80% of sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, the true degree to which these drugs are able to compete with cofactor binding during infection is complicated by the spatial organisation of the cofactors in the cell, the unknown degree to which they compete with each other, the possibility that they exist as high-avidity multimers, and fluctuations in their abundances throughout the cell cycle and between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wei et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The fact that these drugs target a cofactor binding site (the FG pocket) and are capable of modulating capsid rupture and stability raises the question as to whether the virus is employing these cofactors to regulate uncoating. This has previously been suggested for cofactors binding at other CA lattice sites, such as the interactions between CypA and the cyclophilin loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>) or between IP6 and the R18 ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mallery et al., 2018</xref>). The best characterised of the cofactors interacting with the FG pocket is CPSF6, which binds via a linear peptide motif and, like PF74 and LEN, makes contacts across the junction between monomers. Our observation that CPSF6p stabilises the CA lattice is consistent with the notion that this bridging interaction promotes stability. A surprising result was the degree to which CPSF6p provided stabilisation, achieving this effect when as few as 20% binding sites are occupied. This could indicate that the nature of the bridging interaction is somehow more flexible than those observed for the drugs, leading to differences in the dependence of binding on the curvature of the CA lattice. Indeed, cryoET imaging of CA cones have shown that CPSF6 binding is independent of lattice curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stacey et al., 2023</xref>) while PF74 prefers low curvature regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu, 2020</xref>). We acknowledge that we are studying an isolated monomeric peptide motif, while endogenous CPSF6 will likely have a higher binding constant due to avidity, as it is expected to be at least a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ning et al., 2018</xref>), but possibly higher, as CPSF6 has been associated with phase separated condensates within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greig et al., 2020</xref>). The nuclear localisation of CPSF6 and the above stabilisation activity may account for the observation of capsid remnants in the nucleus discrete from integrated proviral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zila et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For decades, the concept that the HIV capsid must release its contents to complete infection has been accepted, and the metastability of the capsid has been recognised as critical for the viral life cycle. LEN is the first capsid-targeting drug for treatment of HIV infection. Our work here shows that LEN functions by lethal hyperstabilisation, and that this is a powerful mechanism for achieving multi-log impacts on viral infectivity. As such, this mechanism and the tools that we and others have developed for studying it will likely be relevant to the development of new therapeutics targeting a range of viral infections. Furthermore, LEN reveals that FG-pocket binding can drastically alter the capsid integrity. The exact nature of the induced ultrastructural defect warrants further study, as does the role of single and multiple endogenous cofactors on the uncoating process.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

All the morphological classes, including the double-layered capsids, were classified by visual inspection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83605-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The image analysis software is available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lilbutsa/JIM-Immobilized-Microscopy-Suite">GitHub</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walsh, 2021</xref>).

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Pharmacologic hyperstabilisation of the HIV-1 capsid lattice induces capsid failure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. We agree that the most interesting and novel aspect of the paper is the proposal that virus inhibition at low LEN concentrations occurs only when a sufficient number of drug molecules have bound the capsid. The reviewers are not convinced that the presented data are strongly supportive of this model.</p><p>New data that more strongly support the proposed model of &quot;lethal hyperstabilization&quot; are needed. The key here is the experimental validation of the occupancy estimates and a more precise determination of the &quot;requisite threshold occupancy&quot;. Also important is additional validation of the predictive value of the model, for example by more extensive testing of the effects of pre-incubation at low drug concentrations, or of time-of-addition effects on infectivity. We understand that this will take significant experimentation, and in such a case <italic>eLife</italic> recommends a decision to Reject.</p><p>Consolidated assessment:</p><p>(1) Experiments in Figures2-4 establish that LEN elicits the same capsid effects as PF74, which was characterized in a previous paper. LEN effects are observed at lower drug concentrations than PF74, consistent with its tighter binding affinity. IP6 counteracts the effects of LEN, but only at low drug concentrations. The concentration dependence is explained in terms of a &quot;requisite occupancy threshold,&quot; estimated to be 30% of the potential binding sites on the capsid, that needs to be reached before structural effects on the capsid are seen. Occupancy is estimated using a simple equilibrium binding model; at 500 nM LEN, the occupancy threshold is reached in &lt;2 min, and only after ~20 h at IC50. These experiments underlie the proposed &quot;lethal hyperstabilization&quot; model, i.e., that viral inhibition at low LEN concentrations occurs many hours after viral entry because it takes this long to reach the occupancy threshold. The model is tested in experiments that compare inhibition profiles of virions that are preincubated with drug vs untreated virions (Figure 5).</p><p>The model is an attractive explanation for how a capsid-targeting drug apparently inhibits integration, but the reviewers are not convinced that the data are strongly supportive of the claimed mechanism. Specifically: (1) there is no evidence presented that LEN occupancy is accurately described by a simple equilibrium model, (2) preincubation experiments show only a modest 1.3-fold effect at low LEN concentrations, (3) preincubation at low LEN does not indicate a clear difference in capsid stabilization and (4) alternative models that can explain LEN potency are not ruled out.</p><p>(2) Figures6-7 examine the effects of LEN on in vitro capsid assembly and purified virions. These effects manifest at high concentrations and are largely confirmatory of previous studies. It needs to be clarified if the &quot;extra&quot; capsid lattices in Figure 7 are due to LEN-induced assembly after maturation has been completed, and thus not strictly a capsid assembly defect. If so, their relevance to infectivity needs to be established.</p><p>(3) Finally, Figures8-9 examine the capsid effects of lower potency drugs (PF74 and BI-2) and a CPSF6-derived peptide, which binds to the same site as LEN. The results confirm previous results on PF74 and further validate LEN's potency. Results with CPSF6 peptide are suggested to indicate stabilization at lower occupancy compared to LEN, which is an interesting finding. However, only peptide occupancy is measured directly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>As shown by the authors in Figure 5, HIV infection shows sensitivity to Len below 1 nM concentrations. At these concentrations, the single virion analysis doesn't show any major sensitivity to Len. In short, infectivity is sensitive below 1nM, Single virion assay shows sensitivity at 50nM, and in vitro assembly at about 5uM. At 1nM, there is not sufficient occupancy to support the claimed mechanism suggested by the authors. It is therefore unclear, at what stage of the infection does Len work and if capsid stabilization plays a role in the drug's action.</p><p>Only a small fraction (1-10%) of released HIV virions are infectious, while the single virion assay observes all virions. The authors have done good work characterizing the single virion assay, however, there are many technical issues still unresolved. For example:</p><p>I couldn't find the fraction of GFP positive and CypA negative virions observed in their experiments, this number does inform on the efficiency of the maturation in the vector system they used to produce their particles.</p><p>The percentages of leaky virions measured from virions treated with 500nM of Len fluctuate significantly in between figures. Specifically, Figure 2E shows the percentage of leaky virions is the same between no drug and 500nM Len while Figure 3B shows a significantly larger fraction of leaky virions in the presence of 500nM Len. While this can be due to different batches of virions, it highlights that many of the observations are acutely sensitive to viral preparations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is surprising how much capsid breakage the authors observe in their single-molecule experiments in the presence of IP6 (Figure 4A-B). In this paper, they report only ~30% of capsids remain intact after 30 min in the presence of 100uM IP6. In their previous work (Mallery et al., 2018), using a similar single-molecule assay to track the loss of GFP as capsids break open, they estimated the half-life of intact capsids was 10 h in the presence of 100uM IP6. Is this related to a change in the method? Could the authors comment on the reproducibility of these experiments and the limitations of the assay?</p><p>2. It seems plausible that the concentration of DLY/SLO used to permeabilize the virus membrane (or PFO as used in Marquez et al., 2018) could impact capsid integrity. The authors should perform a titration with their pore-forming proteins and report whether lower concentrations reduce capsid leakiness at baseline or delay the time to capsid opening.</p><p>3. Related to points #1 and #2, several of the capsid survival curves presented in the paper are reported as recycled data (e.g. Figure 4 shows the uncoating data in the absence of IP6 from Figure 3; Figure 8 – Supplement 1 shows control and drug data from Marquez et al. 2018; and Figure 9 – Supplement 1 shows control data from Marquez et al. compared to CPSF6). If data are collected under different conditions, that is to say, collected using a different pore-forming peptide at the permeabilization step (such as with PFO in the case of Marquez et al), it would not be appropriate to compare the level of capsid breakage and then attribute differences to other variables (like IP6 or CPSF6).</p><p>4. To further support their findings, the authors should perform single-molecule experiments with CA mutants that are known to destabilize or stabilize (such as E45A as tested in Marquez et al. 2018) the capsid structure – these should shift the balance towards leaky or closed phenotypes, respectively.</p><p>5. Is GFP release or the CypA paint signal affected by LEN resistance-associated mutations such as Q67H<sup>+</sup>N74D or M66I? Do these mutations reduce the effects of LEN in these experiments?</p><p>6. Line 409: Given the aberrant structures shown from CryoET, and the fact that the authors observe rapid loss of GFP signal with LEN in their single-molecule assays, it is strange that the authors could not find examples of holes or capsid breakage in the tomograms of LEN-treated samples. If the authors generated reconstructions (as stated in the methods), it would be helpful to see what these aberrant structures look like in 3D, since it appears there could be breaks in some of the images depicted in Figure 7.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this article, Faisal et al., use a combinatorial approach to look at the mechanisms of HIV-capsid inhibition by the highly potent drug Lenacepavir (LEN). The effects of LEN on capsid assembly are nicely demonstrated and suggest that LEN might be involved in capsid stabilization. This conclusion is corroborated by IP6-LEN competition assay in vitro and cryo-ET analysis of native virions. The cryo-ET analysis provides novel insights into the formation of 2-layer capsid sheets. The authors seem to elude to excess capsid in virions by fluorescence analysis. However, whether the second layer originated from unassembled capsids (as proposed by the authors) or by incorporating excess gag into virions is unclear, as no quantitation of EM-tomograms is reported. Additionally, the details of cryo-ET volumetric segmentation and quantification are missing. The description and interpretation of the data in the Results sections and the conclusions are inconsistent, and somewhat confusingly presented for the general non-expert audience.</p><p>The paper mainly focuses on the effects of LEN and other low-potent molecules PF74, BI-2, or a small peptide of the host-factor CPSF6 on the stability of pre-formed in virio capsids. All these molecules, including the host-factor CPSF6 bind the same interface on the capsid, albeit with a different structural mechanism. The authors embark on multiple experiments to show the concentration-dependent effects of LEN on capsid stability. These experiments make use of a previously reported HIV-GagiGFP construct developed by other groups (PMID: 17728233, not cited) and employ single molecule TIRF imaging to sensitively quantify capsid opening, while also visualizing lattice disassembly by CypA-paint in an in vitro assay developed by the authors' group. Throughout the manuscript, CypA-paint heatmaps are shown for averaged single virus traces (albeit with different intensity associated with colors in the figures), with numbers and overlaid graphs to show lattice stabilization/ destabilization phenotypes. However, data showing the main population distribution analysis reveals a different story. Presumably, capsids retaining (1) iGFP (closed) and (2) lost-iGFP but retaining CypA-paint (opening) are the stabilized population of closed or open cores containing lattices, respectively. The others (3) leaky, and (4) short-lived are cores completely losing the lattice and are examples of instability. Taking this into consideration, data in Figure 2D, 3A, and 4A (-IP6), show that capsids open much quicker with increasing concentrations of LEN, and the lattice becomes highly unstable (sum of open + closed cones) in Figure 2E, 3B and 4B (-IP6) (note lattice stabilization is lost with LEN &gt; 5nM). The data thus shows opposite capsid de-stabilization effects by LEN and is thus inconsistent with the main conclusion that LEN induces 'lethal hyperstability' (line 507), and discordant with other cited reports (Bester et al). Quantification for the population of closed and open capsids in PF74, BI-2, and CPSF6-peptide is not shown. In these cases, only the iGFP-loss opening phenotype is plotted and control plots are extrapolated from a prior publication.</p><p>The existing literature suggests LEN 0.05-500nM, and PF74 10uM stabilize canonical virus strain pR9, and pNL capsids (Bester et al., PMID: 30393786, PMID: 27322072), and BI-2 to de-stabilize the same capsids (PMID: 27322072), using similar in vitro assays employed here and also in living cells. In my opinion, the disagreements appear to stem from the use of the HIV-iGFP virus system in the current work. The authors acknowledge the 'leaky' or unstable capsids in their system comprise the major population, which exhibits complete loss of iGFP and the lattice. A subpopulation of cores likely opened but with stabilized lattices, and only a few minor populations of presumably intact cores in their system. Concomitantly, they have also established previously that the major population of capsids derived from these iGFP viruses is deformed (aberrant cones and tubes) (PMID: 29877795), when compared with the major population of cones in mature particles of conventional pNL- or pR9- based virus systems. The unclear understanding of what relates to relevant classical cones found in infectious virions, in the iGFP-system is a caveat. Analysis of CypA-paint and proportions of capsids of native HIV particles (not iGFP-tagged) as shown in Figure 7C and Suppl. Figure 7, will be needed for a rigorous interpretation of their data.</p><p>Regarding capsid occupancy, the authors use previously determined binding constants (Kon, Koff) to model the occupancy of the drugs and CPSF6-peptide on the capsid, which is novel. Since occupancy is the main part of the story, their modelling should be experimentally verified. The pre-treatment experiments provide some light; however, the data interpretation is confusing. The total stabilized capsids (sum of closed and open) are the same for pre-treated cores, thus pre-treatment offers no particular advantage. These results do not validate their model.</p><p>It is unclear to me what is meant by occupancy, if not coating the whole capsids. Can they experimentally determine whether their occupancy modeling is correct? At least in the context of CPSF6-peptide and CypA, both of which bind with much lower affinity (uM range) to capsid, seem to show plateaued capsid occupancy curves within seconds at sub-KD concentrations (CPSF6-pep 5uM, and CypA 1uM) used in their experiments. Noted from Figure 9 Suppl. Figure 2, where a very nice titration experiment shows the binding of sub-KD concentrations of CPSF6-peptide. The difference in the plateau of fluorescence shows the different occupancy, but occupancy itself is complete within 20 sec (plateau), is it not the case? This data already shows that the lower concentration of CPSF6-peptides will not continue occupying additional capsid sites and show a linear curve. Contrastingly, in the models, LEN shows a slow rising curve extending days. At twice the KD 0.5 and 5 nM of LEN (KD ~230 pM, PMID: 36190128) there should be enough drug to occupy entire capsids, in the invitro assays. The authors should clarify and include the formula/calculations of the occupancy. Also, was the concentration of immobilized capsid itself in the invitro uncoating assay considered for occupancy modeling?</p><p>In summary, while I feel like the assembly effects are sufficiently supported, the disassembly and/or stabilizing effects need more rigor to be established. The Results section and discussion should be accordingly written and the fraction of CypA-paint puncta should be overlaid on GFP+ capsid plots for clarity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83605.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consolidated assessment:</p><p>1) Experiments in Figures2-4 establish that LEN elicits the same capsid effects as PF74, which was characterized in a previous paper. LEN effects are observed at lower drug concentrations than PF74, consistent with its tighter binding affinity. IP6 counteracts the effects of LEN, but only at low drug concentrations. The concentration dependence is explained in terms of a &quot;requisite occupancy threshold,&quot; estimated to be 30% of the potential binding sites on the capsid, that needs to be reached before structural effects on the capsid are seen. Occupancy is estimated using a simple equilibrium binding model; at 500 nM LEN, the occupancy threshold is reached in &lt;2 min, and only after ~20 h at IC50. These experiments underlie the proposed &quot;lethal hyperstabilization&quot; model, i.e., that viral inhibition at low LEN concentrations occurs many hours after viral entry because it takes this long to reach the occupancy threshold. The model is tested in experiments that compare inhibition profiles of virions that are preincubated with drug vs untreated virions (Figure 5).</p><p>The model is an attractive explanation for how a capsid-targeting drug apparently inhibits integration, but the reviewers are not convinced that the data are strongly supportive of the claimed mechanism. Specifically: (1) there is no evidence presented that LEN occupancy is accurately described by a simple equilibrium model, (2) preincubation experiments show only a modest 1.3-fold effect at low LEN concentrations, (3) preincubation at low LEN does not indicate a clear difference in capsid stabilization and (4) alternative models that can explain LEN potency are not ruled out.</p></disp-quote><p>Point (1) This is an important point. We have added a new experiment to measure LEN binding to authentic capsids as a function of time by displacement of labelled CPSF6 peptide as a “paint” probe for the FG binding pocket. This experiment directly relates occupancy to capsid rupture, and strengthens the lethal hyperstability mechanism that dominates in the mid-concentration range (≥0.5 nM).</p><p>Points (2) – (4) Our study does not investigate the inhibitory mechanism that dominates at concentrations close to the IC50 (~0.1 nM). Previous studies have shown inhibition in this regime occurs at the stage of integration, and we do not dispute these findings. Specifically, we do not suggest that lethal hyperstability explains inhibition at these low concentrations. To avoid confusion, we have rewritten the corresponding sections in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figures6-7 examine the effects of LEN on in vitro capsid assembly and purified virions. These effects manifest at high concentrations and are largely confirmatory of previous studies. It needs to be clarified if the &quot;extra&quot; capsid lattices in Figure 7 are due to LEN-induced assembly after maturation has been completed, and thus not strictly a capsid assembly defect. If so, their relevance to infectivity needs to be established.</p></disp-quote><p>The CA self-assembly experiment provides new insight by showing that IP6 and LEN synergise to promote CA assembly, but drive assembly of hexameric vs. conical lattices. This antagonism helps explain previous studies revealing aberrant capsid morphologies inside virions when LEN is added before virus maturation. Previous in vitro assembly experiments only showed that LEN accelerates CA assembly at high salt but did not test the opposing effects of IP6 and LEN on morphology we show here.</p><p>The cryoET analysis in Figure 7 indeed shows mature virions treated with LEN (as noted e.g. in the figure legend). The assembly of free CA (that is not already part of the mature capsid) into additional lattices confirms the overassembly phenotype observed in vitro, and we agree that LEN would already cause defects during maturation. We have condensed this section and moved this figure to the Supplement to keep the focus on the antagonism between IP6 and LEN that is mainly documented in the in vitro assembly experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Finally, Figures8-9 examine the capsid effects of lower potency drugs (PF74 and BI-2) and a CPSF6-derived peptide, which binds to the same site as LEN. The results confirm previous results on PF74 and further validate LEN's potency. Results with CPSF6 peptide are suggested to indicate stabilization at lower occupancy compared to LEN, which is an interesting finding. However, only peptide occupancy is measured directly.</p></disp-quote><p>The main point of this section is to show that different molecules binding to the FG binding pocket have different effects on capsid stability. The observed differences can be explained using existing structures (see discussion) and have implications for interpreting experiments that use these compounds as tools to modulate capsid uncoating. Further validation of occupancy for PF74 and BI-2 are the topic of future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>As shown by the authors in Figure 5, HIV infection shows sensitivity to Len below 1 nM concentrations. At these concentrations, the single virion analysis doesn't show any major sensitivity to Len. In short, infectivity is sensitive below 1nM, Single virion assay shows sensitivity at 50nM, and in vitro assembly at about 5uM. At 1nM, there is not sufficient occupancy to support the claimed mechanism suggested by the authors. It is therefore unclear, at what stage of the infection does Len work and if capsid stabilization plays a role in the drug's action.</p></disp-quote><p>The block to infection at LEN concentrations close to the EC50 (~0.1 nM) occurs at the stage of integration as shown in earlier work (PMID 33060363, PMID 32612233). In this manuscript, we describe the inhibitory mechanism (termed 'lethal hyperstabilisation') that becomes dominant at concentrations close to the EC95 (≥0.5 nM). Thus, we do not dispute the original findings, but add a mechanism that operates in a different concentration range. We have made this clearer by rewriting the introduction accordingly.</p><p>The data in our original manuscript showed that 5 nM LEN has an intermediate effect on capsid integrity when measured over 30 min (Figure 3). We argued that this is because drug binding is so slow such that the occupancy required for rapid breakage is not reached within the 30 min experiment. We used a pre-incubation experiment to show that low nM LEN can induce capsid breakage when sufficient time is allowed for drug binding to equilibrate. But we agree that we did not directly show a relationship between LEN binding and capsid breakage.</p><p>To fill this gap, we have added new long-term experiments in which we image LEN binding (via displacement of a fluorescent CPSF6 peptide) and capsid rupture (via GFP release). We observed that binding of LEN to IP6-stabilised cores causes the capsid to rupture (albeit very slowly) down to the sub-nM concentrations tested in the experiment. This shows that the lethal hyperstability mechanism is active at a concentration corresponding to the second inhibitory phase.</p><p>The new experiments have been added to the manuscript as Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only a small fraction (1-10%) of released HIV virions are infectious, while the single virion assay observes all virions. The authors have done good work characterizing the single virion assay, however, there are many technical issues still unresolved. For example:</p><p>I couldn't find the fraction of GFP positive and CypA negative virions observed in their experiments, this number does inform on the efficiency of the maturation in the vector system they used to produce their particles.</p></disp-quote><p>Immature particles can indeed be easily identified. Unlike particles that have undergone proteolysis, immature particles do not release GFP, because it remains part of the Gag polyprotein anchored to the viral membrane. CypA binding to these particles is slow. Particles identified as immature on the basis of these criteria are excluded from analysis since they do not contain a mature capsid.</p><p>The fraction of immature particles varies between virus preparation and is between 4–12% (mean of 7%) for iGFP particles used for Figures 2 and 3. As expected, the fraction of immature particles does not depend on addition of LEN or IP6 added during the uncoating experiment. We have added this quantification and example TIRF traces of immature particles as the new Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The percentages of leaky virions measured from virions treated with 500nM of Len fluctuate significantly in between figures. Specifically, Figure 2E shows the percentage of leaky virions is the same between no drug and 500nM Len while Figure 3B shows a significantly larger fraction of leaky virions in the presence of 500nM Len. While this can be due to different batches of virions, it highlights that many of the observations are acutely sensitive to viral preparations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a bar chart of the fraction of &quot;leaky&quot; capsids from independent TIRF uncoating experiments in absence and presence of LEN to show the variability within each condition and compare between conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). This analysis shows that the leaky fraction of experiments in Figures 2 and 3 is 56±5% for control virions. Addition of 500 nM LEN during the uncoating experiment causes an increase in the fraction of particles that immediately release GFP (65±7%), which we attribute to rapid LEN-induced capsid rupture (too fast to be resolved as a separate step in the uncoating traces recorded with a frame rate of 1 frame every 6 s).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It is surprising how much capsid breakage the authors observe in their single-molecule experiments in the presence of IP6 (Figure 4A-B). In this paper, they report only ~30% of capsids remain intact after 30 min in the presence of 100uM IP6. In their previous work (Mallery et al., 2018), using a similar single-molecule assay to track the loss of GFP as capsids break open, they estimated the half-life of intact capsids was 10 h in the presence of 100uM IP6. Is this related to a change in the method? Could the authors comment on the reproducibility of these experiments and the limitations of the assay?</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis of capsid stability ±IP6 in <italic>Mallery et al.</italic> focuses on the subset of assembled capsids (i.e. the plot excludes leaky capsids). In contrast, Figures 2–5 of our current manuscript show survival curves of all capsids, including the &quot;leaky&quot; fraction (as indicated by the y-axis label). As a result, the scale of the y-axis is different in these two papers.</p><p>This is confusing for the reader and we thank the referee for bringing this to our attention. We have reverted y-axis of survival plots to the previous format that excludes the leaky fraction to allow direct comparison with previous papers and provide separate analysis of the leaky fraction in Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>IP6-mediated stabilisation is reproducible as shown in six previous papers (see PMID 29848441, PMID 31851928, PMID 33524070, PMID 33692109, PMID 36624347, PMID 36289397), whereby we find that maximum stabilisation requires fresh IP6 solutions.</p><p>Limitations of the assay are explained in the legend of a new Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It seems plausible that the concentration of DLY/SLO used to permeabilize the virus membrane (or PFO as used in Marquez et al., 2018) could impact capsid integrity. The authors should perform a titration with their pore-forming proteins and report whether lower concentrations reduce capsid leakiness at baseline or delay the time to capsid opening.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted a titration of SLO, which shows that the pore-forming protein does not affect capsid stability (added as Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Related to points #1 and #2, several of the capsid survival curves presented in the paper are reported as recycled data (e.g. Figure 4 shows the uncoating data in the absence of IP6 from Figure 3; Figure 8 – Supplement 1 shows control and drug data from Marquez et al. 2018; and Figure 9 – Supplement 1 shows control data from Marquez et al. compared to CPSF6). If data are collected under different conditions, that is to say, collected using a different pore-forming peptide at the permeabilization step (such as with PFO in the case of Marquez et al), it would not be appropriate to compare the level of capsid breakage and then attribute differences to other variables (like IP6 or CPSF6).</p></disp-quote><p>All survival curves in a figure, including those curves that have been replotted to facilitate comparison with new treatments, were collected at the same time and with identical experimental conditions. Indeed, the reason for replotting these curves is that they constitute the appropriate control for the corresponding set of experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To further support their findings, the authors should perform single-molecule experiments with CA mutants that are known to destabilize or stabilize (such as E45A as tested in Marquez et al. 2018) the capsid structure – these should shift the balance towards leaky or closed phenotypes, respectively.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an experiment with a new protocol that includes an equilibration period during which broken and highly unstable capsids that do not respond to IP6 are allowed to decay away. We can then test the effect of LEN on the remaining IP6-responsive (functionally relevant) subset of capsids. This avoids the complexity of convolving intrinsic instability with drug-induced breakage, thus removing the need to include extensive controls that account for variability in the unstable (leaky/short-lived) fraction between viral preparations. The extensive analysis of LEN occupancy on capsid integrity from this new approach is presented in Figure 4.</p><p>We agree that testing mutants that modulate capsid stability and/or LEN binding is an interesting future direction to further dissect the interplay between intrinsic stability and LEN-induced hyperstability. In our opinion, this is outside the scope of this (data-rich) paper that provides strong evidence for drug occupancy-dependent capsid breakage of wild type capsids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Is GFP release or the CypA paint signal affected by LEN resistance-associated mutations such as Q67H<sup>+</sup>N74D or M66I? Do these mutations reduce the effects of LEN in these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tested these mutants, see response to Reviewer #2 Point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Line 409: Given the aberrant structures shown from CryoET, and the fact that the authors observe rapid loss of GFP signal with LEN in their single-molecule assays, it is strange that the authors could not find examples of holes or capsid breakage in the tomograms of LEN-treated samples. If the authors generated reconstructions (as stated in the methods), it would be helpful to see what these aberrant structures look like in 3D, since it appears there could be breaks in some of the images depicted in Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>At the resolution of our tomograms we are not confident in assigning apparent discontinuities as defined holes in the capsid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this article, Faisal et al., use a combinatorial approach to look at the mechanisms of HIV-capsid inhibition by the highly potent drug Lenacepavir (LEN). The effects of LEN on capsid assembly are nicely demonstrated and suggest that LEN might be involved in capsid stabilization. This conclusion is corroborated by IP6-LEN competition assay in vitro and cryo-ET analysis of native virions. The cryo-ET analysis provides novel insights into the formation of 2-layer capsid sheets. The authors seem to elude to excess capsid in virions by fluorescence analysis. However, whether the second layer originated from unassembled capsids (as proposed by the authors) or by incorporating excess gag into virions is unclear, as no quantitation of EM-tomograms is reported. Additionally, the details of cryo-ET volumetric segmentation and quantification are missing. The description and interpretation of the data in the Results sections and the conclusions are inconsistent, and somewhat confusingly presented for the general non-expert audience.</p><p>The paper mainly focuses on the effects of LEN and other low-potent molecules PF74, BI-2, or a small peptide of the host-factor CPSF6 on the stability of pre-formed in virio capsids. All these molecules, including the host-factor CPSF6 bind the same interface on the capsid, albeit with a different structural mechanism. The authors embark on multiple experiments to show the concentration-dependent effects of LEN on capsid stability. These experiments make use of a previously reported HIV-GagiGFP construct developed by other groups (PMID: 17728233, not cited) and employ single molecule TIRF imaging to sensitively quantify capsid opening, while also visualizing lattice disassembly by CypA-paint in an in vitro assay developed by the authors' group. Throughout the manuscript, CypA-paint heatmaps are shown for averaged single virus traces (albeit with different intensity associated with colors in the figures), with numbers and overlaid graphs to show lattice stabilization/ destabilization phenotypes. However, data showing the main population distribution analysis reveals a different story. Presumably, capsids retaining (1) iGFP (closed) and (2) lost-iGFP but retaining CypA-paint (opening) are the stabilized population of closed or open cores containing lattices, respectively. The others (3) leaky, and (4) short-lived are cores completely losing the lattice and are examples of instability. Taking this into consideration, data in Figure 2D, 3A, and 4A (-IP6), show that capsids open much quicker with increasing concentrations of LEN, and the lattice becomes highly unstable (sum of open + closed cones) in Figure 2E, 3B and 4B (-IP6) (note lattice stabilization is lost with LEN &gt; 5nM). The data thus shows opposite capsid de-stabilization effects by LEN and is thus inconsistent with the main conclusion that LEN induces 'lethal hyperstability' (line 507), and discordant with other cited reports (Bester et al). Quantification for the population of closed and open capsids in PF74, BI-2, and CPSF6-peptide is not shown. In these cases, only the iGFP-loss opening phenotype is plotted and control plots are extrapolated from a prior publication.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, our original manuscript did not explain our results clearly enough, which might have led to some confusion about our message.</p><p>The ‘lethal hyperstability’ mechanism proposes opposing effects of LEN on the low-curvature (hexameric) part of the capsid and the high-curvature (pentamer-rich) part of the capsid. LEN hyperstabilises the former at the expense of the latter, converting a closed cone to a highly stabilised CA lattice with open edges.</p><p>Bester et al. show that CA puncta persist for longer in cells treated with LEN but do not determine whether the cone is still intact or whether it has ruptured. To distinguish between these possibilities, we use a marker for capsid integrity (encapsidated GFP as a content marker) in combination with a reporter for the number of CA molecules in the lattice (CypA paint). Our data showing hyperstabilisation of CA lattices with LEN (CypA paint read-out) is consistent with the data by Bester et al., but we additionally show that these lattices no longer form a closed cone (GFP content marker release).</p><p>We do not suggest that ‘lethal hyperstability’ is dominant at IC50 and we do not dispute the LEN mechanisms that have been suggested to operate at lower concentrations (IC50) by Bester et al. (and other papers). Instead our paper specifically investigates the LEN mechanism at concentrations around the IC95.</p><p>Changes to the paper:</p><p>(1) We have revised our manuscript by removing unnecessary complexity in our analysis/writing and by adding new experiments with improved experimental design.</p><p>(2) We have rewritten the introduction to make this point clearer from the outset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The existing literature suggests LEN 0.05-500nM, and PF74 10uM stabilize canonical virus strain pR9, and pNL capsids (Bester et al., PMID: 30393786, PMID: 27322072), and BI-2 to de-stabilize the same capsids (PMID: 27322072), using similar in vitro assays employed here and also in living cells.

As outlined in the following paragraphs, we further note that (A) the HIV-iGFP virus system is well established and characterised in the context of capsid uncoating; (B) the presence different assembly states (incomplete vs intact) is similar to HIV without iGFP; (C) single-molecule analysis allows these subsets to be distinguished from each other such that we can resolve the effects of molecules (drugs, IP6) on the properties of intact capsids.</p><p>(A) The iGFP construct has been validated by different groups using live cell imaging studies to determine when and where the capsid first opens (e.g. PMID 28784755, PMID 33649225, DOI 10.1101/2023.08.22.553958 [bioRxiv preprint using iYFP]). These studies show that viruses with Gag-internal fluorescent protein lead to productive infection with normal kinetics, consistent with the formation of a proper capsid.</p><p>(B) As noted by the referee and consistent with our previous work (PMID 29877795), ~60% of iGFP virus particles contain &quot;leaky&quot; capsids that do not retain GFP. This observation is consistent with cryo-electron tomography analysis of 107 intact HIV particles showing that &quot;most of the cores showed one or more local regions where the CA lattice was disrupted or absent&quot; (PMID 27980210). Thus, the capsid assembly state of iGFP particles appears to be similar to what is observed in HIV particles without iGFP.</p><p>(C) The power of our single-molecule analysis is that we can distinguish leaky/short-lived capsid from properly formed (long-lived) capsids. We can then quantify the effects of LEN on these subsets relative to control conditions.

The difference in the plateau of fluorescence shows the different occupancy, but occupancy itself is complete within 20 sec (plateau), is it not the case?
