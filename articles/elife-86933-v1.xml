Macroscale features such as cortical folding and functional activation are accessed through spatially dense neuroimaging maps, whereas microscale cellular and molecular features are typically measured with sparse postmortem sampling. Here, we integrate these distinct windows on brain organization by building upon existing postmortem data to impute, validate, and analyze a library of spatially dense neuroimaging-like maps of human cortical gene expression. These maps allow spatially unbiased discovery of cortical zones with extreme transcriptional profiles or unusually rapid transcriptional change which index distinct microstructure and predict neuroimaging measures of cortical folding and functional activation. Modules of spatially coexpressed genes define a family of canonical expression maps that integrate diverse spatial scales and temporal epochs of human brain organization â ranging from proteinâprotein interactions to large-scale systems for cognitive processing. These module maps also parse neuropsychiatric risk genes into subsets which tag distinct cyto-laminar features and differentially predict the location of altered cortical anatomy and gene expression in patients. Taken together, the methods, resources, and findings described here advance our understanding of human cortical organization and offer flexible bridges to connect scientific fields operating at different spatial scales of human brain research.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Achieving a mechanistic understanding of cortical organization in health and disease requires integrating information across its many spatial scales: from macroscale cortical folds and functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) to the gene expression programs that reflect microscale cellular and laminar features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hawrylycz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kelley et al., 2018</xref>). However, a hard obstacle to this goal is that our measures of the human cortex at macro- and microscales are fundamentally mismatched in their spatial sampling. Macroscale measures from in vivo neuroimaging provide spatially dense estimates of structure and function, but microscale measures of gene expression are gathered from spatial discontinuous postmortem samples that have so far only been linked to macroscale features using methodologically imposed cortical parcellations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">LariviÃ¨re et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seidlitz et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, local transitions in human cortical gene expression remain uncharacterized and unintegrated with the spatially fine-grained topographies of human cortical structure and function that are revealed by in vivo neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gryglewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Markello et al., 2021</xref>). Finding a way to bridge this gap would not only enrich both our micro- and macroscale models of human cortical organization, but also provide an essential framework for translation across traditionally siloed scales of neuroscientific research.</p><p>Here, we use spatially sparse postmortem data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hawrylycz et al., 2012</xref>) to generate spatially dense cortical expression maps (DEMs) for 20,781 genes in the adult brain, with accompanying DEM reproducibility scores to facilitate wider usage. These maps allow a fine-grained transcriptional cartography of the human cortex, which we integrate with diverse genomic, histological, and neuroimaging resources to shed new light on several fundamental aspects of human cortical organization in health and disease. First, we show that DEMs can recover canonical gene expression boundaries from in situ hybridization (ISH) data, predict previously unknown expression boundaries, and align with regional differences in cortical organization from several independent data modalities. Second, by focusing on the local transitions in gene expression which are captured by DEMs, we reveal a close spatial coordination between molecular and functional specializations of the cortex and establish that the spatial orientation of cortical folding and function at macroscale is aligned with local tangential transitions in cortical gene expression. Third, by defining and annotating gene co-expression modules across the cortex at multiple scales we systematically link macroscale measures of cortical structure and function in vivo to postmortem markers of cortical lamination, cellular composition, and development from early fetal to late adult life. Finally, as a proof of principle, we use this novel framework to secure a newly integrated multiscale understanding of atypical brain development in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p><p>The tools and results from this analysis of the human cortex, which we collectively call Multiscale Atlas of Gene expression for Integrative Cortical Cartography (MAGICC), open up an empirical bridge that can now be used to connect cortical models (and scientists) that have so far operated at segregated spatial scales. To this end, we share (i) all gene-level DEMs and derived transcriptional landscapes in neuroimaging-compatible files for easy integration with in vivo macroscale measures of human cortical structure and function; and (ii) all gene sets defining spatial subcomponents of cortical transcription for easy integration with any desired genomic annotation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kwagstyl/magicc">https://github.com/kwagstyl/magicc</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Creating and benchmarking spatially dense maps of human cortical gene expression</title><p>To create a dense transcriptomic atlas of the cortex, we used AHBA microarray measures of gene expression for 20,781 genes in each of 1304 cortical samples from six donor left cortical hemispheres (âMaterials and methods,âTable S1<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We extracted a model of each donorâs cortical sheet by processing their brain MRI scan and identified the surface location (henceforth âvertexâ) of each postmortem cortical sample in this sheet (âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For each gene, we then propagated measured expression values into neighboring vertices using nearest-neighbor interpolation followed by smoothing (âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). Expression values were scaled across vertices and these vertex-level expression maps were averaged across donors to yield a single DEM for each gene, which provided estimates of expression at ~30,000 vertices across the cortical sheet (e.g., DEM for PVALB, upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These fine-grained vertex-level expression measures also enabled us to estimate the orientation and magnitude of expression change for each gene at every vertex (e.g., dense expression change map for PVALB, lower panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Creating and benchmarking spatial dense gene expression maps in the human cortex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Spatially discontinuous Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) microarray samples (red points) were aligned with MRI-derived cortical surface mesh reconstructions.

Thus, remedying the current lack of any spatially dense gene expression maps in the human cortex, we provide DEMs (and accompanying dense expression change maps) for 20,781 genes and establish that &gt;11k of these DEMs show a spatial reproducibility score of <italic>r</italic><sub>gene</sub> &gt; 0.5 between sets of unrelated individuals. Gene-level DEM reproducibility scores allow future users to filter on this feature as desired, and we establish that key analytic outputs from DEMs (see below) show good reproducibility between unrelated individuals and can be recovered at different DEM reproducibility filters.</p><p>Given that DEMs were generated by interpolating expression values between sampled regions, we assessed whether DEMs could recover sharp local microscale transitions in gene expression that could theoretically be obscured by interpolation. Of the very few such transitions that have been verified by ISH in humans, the best established occurs between occipital areas V1 and V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>). All four genes known to show a sharp V1/V2 expression boundary across layers by ISH â SYT6, TLE4, PCP4, PENK â exhibited qualitatively and quantitatively sharp expression transitions at the V1/V2 boundary in their DEMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a-d</xref>). Motivated by this validation, we next asked whether DEMs could identify previously unknown expression boundary markers in the human cortex. To achieve this, we took advantage of extensive existing ISH data between parahippocampal (area PeEc) and fusiform gyri (area TF). We ranked genes by the magnitude of their expression gradient between these cortical regions in DEMs (âMaterials and methodsâ) and identified four genes with sharp expression transitions predicted by DEMs â NGB,HTR2A (TF &gt; PeEc) and NTS, CHRNA3 (PeEc &gt; TF) â for which independent ISH data were available. Expression profiling in ISH slabs verified the existence of sharp expression transition for all four genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2e-g</xref>). As the V1/V2 and the PeEc/TF boundaries both involve transitions between classical laminar types in cortical regions with highly conserved anatomical patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">von Economo and Koskinas, 1925</xref>), we also tested whether DEMs could recover expression boundaries in more variable and uniformly laminated association cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ronan and Fletcher, 2015</xref>). No such expression boundaries have been described in humans by ISH, but there are reports of sharp expression boundaries between frontal areas 44 and 45b for several genes in non-human primates: SCN1B, KCNS1, TRIM55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). These genes also exhibited high DEM gradients at the boundary between human frontal areas 44 and 45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2h-g</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrate the capacity of DEMs to resolve sharp expression transitions and indicate that DEMs can be used to help target prospective postmortem validation of new expression boundaries in humans.</p><p>To benchmark and illustrate the use of DEMs to capture cortical features across contrasting spatial scales, we drew on selected micro- and macroscale cortical measures that DEMs should align with based on known biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1gâj</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ). To assess whether DEMs could recover microscale differences in cellular patterning across the cortical sheet, we considered the ground truth of neuronal cell-type proportions as measured by single-nucleus RNAseq (snRNAseq) across six different cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lake et al., 2016</xref>). We observed a strong spatial correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.6, p<sub>spin</sub>&lt;0.001) between regional marker gene expression in DEMs and regional proportions of their corresponding neuronal subtypes from snRNAseq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref> shows example marker gene DEMs for six canonical neuronal subtypes: three excitatory (FEZF2, RORB, THEMIS) and three inhibitory (PVAL, SST, VIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>). Next, to assess whether DEMs could recover regional variation in the mesoscale feature of cortical layering, we tested and verified that regional variation in the average DEM for layer IV marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maynard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>) was highly correlated with regional variation in layer IV thickness as determined from a 3D histological atlas of cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wagstyl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>).

Specifically, we found that each TD peak overlapped with a functionally specialized cortical region based on meta-analysis of in vivo functional neuroimaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>; âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and featured a gene expression signature that was preferentially enriched for a distinct set of biological processes, cell-type signatures, and cellular compartments (âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For example, the peaks overlapping area TGd and OFC were enriched for synapse-related terms, while BA2 and BA4 TD peaks were predominantly enriched for metabolic and mitochondrial terms.

We noted that these transition zones tended to overlap with cortical folds, suggesting an alignment between spatial orientations of gene expression and folding. To formally test this idea, we defined the dominant orientation of gene expression change at each vertex (âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and computed the angle between this and the orientation of folding (âMaterials and methodsâ).

A similar alignment was seen when comparing gradients of transcriptional change with the spatial orientation of putative cortical areas defined by multimodal functional and structural in vivo neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) (expression change running perpendicular to area long axis, p<sub>spin</sub>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ). Visualizing these expression-folding and expression-areal alignments revealed greatest concordance over sensorimotor, medial occipital, cingulate, and posterior perisylvian cortices (with notable exceptions of transcription change running parallel to sulci and the long axis of putative cortical areas in lateral temporoparietal and temporopolar regions). As a preliminary probe for causality, we examined the developmental ordering of regional folding and regional transcriptional identity. Mapping the expression of high-ranking TD genes in fetal cortical laser dissection microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller et al., 2014</xref>) from 21 PCW (post conception weeks) (âMaterials and methodsâ) showed that the localized transcriptional identity of V1 and TGd regions in adulthood is apparent during the fetal periods that folding topology begins to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chi et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1k</xref>).

Briefly, WGCNA constructs a connectivity matrix by quantifying pairwise co-expression between genes, raising the correlations to a power (here 6) to emphasize strong correlations while penalizing weaker ones, and creating a topological overlap matrix (TOM) to capture both pairwise similarities expression and connectivity. Modules of highly interconnected genes are identified through hierarchical clustering. The resultant WGCNA modules enable topographic and genetic integration because they each exist as both (i) a single expression map (eigenmap) for spatial comparison with neuroimaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ) and (ii) a unique gene set for enrichment analysis against marker genes systematically capturing multiple scales of cortical organization, namely cortical layers, cell types, cell compartments, proteinâprotein interactions (PPI), and GO terms (âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp4">Supplementary files 2 and 4</xref>). Furthermore, whereas prior applications of WGCNA to AHBA data have revealed gene sets that covary in expression across many different compartments of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawrylycz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kelley et al., 2018</xref>), using DEMs as input to WGCNA generates modules that are purely based on the fine-scale coordination of gene expression across the cortex. Using WGCNA, we identified 16 gene modules (M1âM16), which we then deeply annotated against independent measures of cortical organization at diverse spatial scales and developmental epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, âMaterials and methodsâ). Module eigenmaps were primarily driven by highly reproducible genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a</xref>) as were enrichments for annotational gene sets (median reproducibility of enriching genes = 0.59, p&lt;0.001 elevated vs. background).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cortex-wide gene co-expression patterns reflect multiple spatial scales and developmental epochs of brain organization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) pipeline applied to the full dense expression map (DEM) dataset.

At microscale, several WGCNA module gene sets showed statistically significant enrichments for genes marking specific cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maynard et al., 2021</xref>) and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darmanis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Habib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruzicka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

For example, M4, which was uniquely co-enriched for markers of endothelial cells and middle cortical layers, showed peak expression over dorsal motor cortices which are known to show expanded middle layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wagstyl et al., 2020</xref>) with rich vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pfeifer, 1940</xref>) relative to other cortical regions. Similarly, M6, which was enriched for markers of astrocytes, microglia, and excitatory neurons, as well as layers 1/2, showed peak expression over rostral frontal and temporal cortices which are known to possess relatively expanded supragranular layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wagstyl et al., 2020</xref>) that predominantly contain the apical dendrites of excitatory neurons and supporting glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">von Economo and Koskinas, 1925</xref>). We also observed that modules with similar eigenmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c</xref>), (including overlaps of multiple modules with the same TD peak) could show contrasting gene set enrichments. For example, M2 and M4 both showed peak expression of dorsal sensorimotor cortex (i.e., TD areas BA2 and BA4), but M2 captures a distinct architectonic signature of sensorimotor cortex from the mid-layer vascular signal of M4: expanded and heavily myelinated layer 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wagstyl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

We were able to verify each of these observations through independent validations including spatial overlap of M2 expression with meta-analytic functional activations relating to motor tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>); immunohistochemistry localization of high-ranking M2 genes to deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>; âMaterials and methodsâ); and significant enrichment of M2 genes for myelin-related GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

As observed for multiscale spatial enrichments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>), the developmental enrichments of modules were often closely coordinated with one another, and eigenmaps with similar patterns of regional expression could possess different signatures of developmental enrichment. For example, the M6 and M12 eigenmaps shared a similar spatial expression pattern in the adult cortex (peak expression in medial prefrontal, anterior insula, and medioventral temporal pole), but captured different aspects of human brain development that aligned with the cyto-laminar enrichments of M6 and M12 in adulthood. The M6 gene set, which was enriched for predominantly glial elements of layers 1 and 2 in adult cortex, was also enriched for markers of mid-fetal microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Polioudakis et al., 2019</xref>), the transient fetal layers that are known to be particularly rich in mid-fetal microglia (subpial granular, subplate, and ventricular zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Monier et al., 2007</xref>]), and the mid-late fetal epoch when most microglial colonization of the cortex is thought to be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Menassa and Gomez-Nicola, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, the M12 gene set, which was enriched for predominantly neuronal elements of layer 2 in adult cortex, also showed enrichment for marker genes of developing fetal excitatory neurons, the fetal cortical subplate, and windows of mid-late fetal development when developing neurons are known to be migrating into a maximally expanded subplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">MolnÃ¡r et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The striking co-enrichment of WGCNA modules for features of both the fetal and adult cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) implied a patterned sharing of marker genes between cyto-laminar features of the adult and fetal cortex.

Given that genetic risks for atypical brain development presumably play out through such levels of biological organization, we hypothesized that disease-associated risk genes would be enriched within WGCNA module gene sets. Testing this hypothesis simultaneously offers a means of further validating our analytic framework, while also potentially advancing understanding of disease biology.

ASD risk genes, including SCN2A, SYNGAP1, and SHANK2, resided within the M12 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), which is most highly expressed within a distributed cortical system that is activated during social reasoning tasks (p<sub>spin</sub>&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The M12 gene set is also enriched for: genes with peak cortical expression in late-fetal and early postnatal life; marker genes for the fetal subplate and developing excitatory neurons; markers of layer 2 and mature neurons in adult cortex; and synaptic genes involved in neuronal communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4bâe</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In contrast, ASD risk genes, including ADNP, KMT5B, and MED13L, resided within the M15 module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), which is most highly expressed in primary visual cortex and associated ventral temporal pathways for object recognition/interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kravitz et al., 2013</xref>) (p<sub>spin</sub>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The M15 module is also enriched for genes showing peak cortical expression in early fetal development, marker genes for cycling progenitor cells in the fetal cortex; markers of layer 2, inhibitory neurons and oligodendrocyte precursors in the adult cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4bâe</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The alignment of ASD risk genes with M12 and M15 was reinforced when considering all 135 ASD risk genes: spatial co-expression analyses split these genes into two clear subsets with mean expression maps that most closely resembled M12 and M15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1a, b</xref>). Thus, using only spatial patterns of cortical gene expression in adulthood, our analytic framework was able to recover the previous PPI and GO-based partitioning of ASD risk genes into synaptic vs. nuclear chromatin remodeling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parikshak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>), and then place these pathways into a richer biological context based on the known multiscale associations of M12 and M15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4a</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to address whether regional differences in M12 and M15 expression were related to regional cortical changes observed in ASD. To test this idea, we used two orthogonal indices of cortical change in ASD that capture different levels of biological analysis â the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) postmortem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haney et al., 2020</xref>), and the magnitude of changes in cortical thickness (CT) as measured by in vivo sMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Martino et al., 2017</xref>). Regional DEG counts were derived from a recent postmortem study of 725 cortical samples from 11 cortical regions in 112 ASD cases and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haney et al., 2020</xref>), and compared with mean M12 and M15 expression within matching areas of a multimodal MRI cortical parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>). The magnitude of regional transcriptomic disruption in ASD was statistically significantly positively correlated with region expression of the M15 module (<italic>r </italic>= 0.6, p<sub>spin</sub>&lt;0.05), but not the M12 module (<italic>r </italic>= â0.3, p<sub>spin</sub>&gt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). This dissociation is notable because M15 (but not M12) is enriched for genes involved in the regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Thus the enrichment of regulatory ASD risk genes within M15, and the intrinsically high expression of M15 in occipital cortex may explain why the occipital cortex is a hotspot of altered gene expression in ASD.</p><p>To compare M12 and M15 expression with regional variation in cortical anatomy changes in ASD, we harnessed the multicenter ABIDE datasets containing brain sMRI scans from 751 participants with idiopathic ASD and 773 controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Martino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Martino et al., 2013</xref>). We preprocessed all scans using well-validated tools for harmonized estimation of cortical thickness (CT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fischl, 2012</xref>) from multicenter data (âMaterials and methodsâ), and then modeled CT differences between ASD and control cohorts at 150,000 points (vertices) across the cortex (âMaterials and methodsâ). This procedure revealed two clusters of statistically significant CT change in ASD (âMaterials and methods,â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, upper panel) encompassing visual and parietal cortices (relative cortical thickening vs. controls) as well as superior frontal vertices (relative cortical thinning). The occipital cluster of cortical thickening in ASD showed a statistically significant spatial overlap with the cluster of peak M15 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, upper panel, âMaterials and methods,â Dice coefficient = 0.7, p<sub>spin</sub>&lt;0.01), and relative cortical thickness change correlated with the M15 eigenmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). In contrast, M12 expression was not significantly aligned with CT change in ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>). Testing these relationships in the opposite direction, that is, asking whether regions of peak M12 and M15 expression are enriched for directional CT change in ASD relative to other cortical regions, recovered the M15-specific association with regional cortical thickening in ASD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the above findings reveal that an occipital hotspot of altered gene expression and cortical thickening in ASD overlaps with an occipital hotspot of high expression for a subset of ASD risk genes. These ASD risk genes are spatially co-expressed in a module enriched for several connected layers of biological organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4bâd</xref>) spanning: nuclear pathways for chromatin modeling and regulation of gene expression; G2/M phase cycling progenitors and excitatory neurons in the mid-fetal cortex; oligodendrocytes and layer 2 cortical neurons in adult cortex; and occipital functional networks involved in visual processing. These multiscale aspects of cortical organization can now be prioritized as potential targets for a subset of genetic risk factors in ASD, and the logic of this analysis in ASD can now be generalized to any disease genes of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We build on the most anatomically comprehensive dataset of human cortex gene expression available to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hawrylycz et al., 2012</xref>), to generate, validate, characterize, apply, and share spatially dense measures of gene expression that capture the topographically continuous nature of the cortical mantle. By representing patterns of human cortical gene expression without the imposition of a priori boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawrylycz et al., 2015</xref>), our library of DEMs allows anatomically unbiased analyses of local gene expression levels as well as the magnitudes and directions of local gene expression change. This core spatial property of DEMs unlocks several methodological and biological advances. First, the unparcellated nature of DEMs allows us to agnostically define cortical zones with extreme transcriptional profiles or unusually rapid transcriptional change, which we show to capture microstructural cortical properties and align with folding and functional specializations at the macroscale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). By establishing that some of these cortical zones are evident at the time of cortical folding, we lend support to a âprotomapâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">OâLeary, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">OâLeary et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rakic, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rakic et al., 2009</xref>)-like model where the placement of some cortical folds is setup by rapid tangential changes in cyto-laminar composition of the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ronan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Toro and Burnod, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Van Essen, 2020</xref>). The DEMs are derived from fully folded adult donors, and therefore some of the measured genetic-folding alignment might also be induced by mechanical distortion of the tissue during folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heuer and Toro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Llinares-Benadero and Borrell, 2019</xref>). However, no data currently exist to conclusively assess the directionality of this gene-folding relationship.</p><p>We show that DEMs can recover sharp boundaries in gene expression despite being generated by interpolation algorithms that do not explicitly encode step changes in expression between cortical regions. This property of DEMs will help to target future studies of human cortical patterning (e.g., directing single-cell and spatial omics resources), and we illustrate this utility by applying DEMs to discover two new expression boundaries in the human cortex. Second, we use spatial correlations between DEMs to decompose the complex topography of cortical gene expression into a smaller set of cortex-wide transcriptional programs that capture distinct aspects of cortical biology â at multiple spatial scales and multiple developmental epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This effort provides an integrative model that links expression signatures of cell types and layers in prenatal life to the large-scale patterning of regional gene expression in the adult cortex, which can in turn, through DEMs, be compared to the full panoply of in vivo brain phenotypes provided by modern neuroimaging. Indeed, future work might find direct links between these module eigenvectors and similar low-frequency eigenvectors of cortical geometry have been used as basis functions to segment the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">LefÃ¨vre et al., 2018</xref>) and explain complex functional activation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pang et al., 2023</xref>). Third, we find that some of these cortex-wide expression programs in adulthood are enriched for disease risk genes, which offers a new path to nominating candidate disease mechanisms across different levels of biological organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For example, the M15 module defines a normative spatial pattern of cortical gene co-expression which not only captures a functionally enriched subset of ASD genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Satterstrom et al., 2020</xref>), but also shows multiscale enrichments and regionally specific expression patterns that tie together several independently reported aspects of ASD neurobiology. Specifically, M15 newly integrates (i) the concentration of ASD risk genes and dysregulated gene expression in upper-layer excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Velmeshev et al., 2019</xref>), (ii) the accentuation of altered gene expression and thickness in occipital cortical regions, and (iii) the early emergence among children at heightened genetic risk for ASD of behaviorally relevant changes in cortical structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Girault et al., 2022</xref>) within occipital systems important for the processing of visual information. Crucially, the strategy applied in our analysis of ASD risk genes can be generalized to risk genes for any brain disorder of interest to place known risk factors for disease into the rich context of multiscale cortical biology.</p><p>Finally, the collection of DEMs, annotational gene sets, and statistical tools used in this work is shared as a new resource to accelerate multiscale neuroscience by allowing flexible and spatially unbiased translation between genomic and neuroanatomical spaces. Of note, this resource can easily incorporate any future expansions of brain data in either neuroanatomical or genomic space. We anticipate that it will be particularly valuable to incorporate new data from the nascent, but rapidly expanding fields of high-throughput histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wagstyl et al., 2020</xref>), single-cell omics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>), and large-scale imaging-genetics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith et al., 2021</xref>).

This decision was made given evidence for potential asymmetries in gene expression within the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Kovel et al., 2018</xref>), and known differences in cortical shape between the hemispheres that complicate the reflection of sample locations from left to right cortical sheets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jo et al., 2012</xref>).

Vertex-wise, rather than sample-level, estimation of mean and standard deviation mitigates potential biases introduced by intersubject variability in the regional distribution and density of cortical samples. For Y-linked genes, DEMs were calculated from male donors only. For each of the resulting 20,781 gene-level expression maps, the orientation and magnitude of gene expression change at each vertex (i.e., the gradient) were calculated for folded, inflated, spherical, and flattened mesh representations of the cortical sheet using Connectome Workbenchâs metric gradient command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Benchmarking DEMs</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Spin tests for comparing two spatial maps</title><p>Cortical maps exhibit spatial autocorrelation that can inflate the false-positive rate, for which a number of methods have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>).

Using a parcellation of the cortex based on multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>), we identified the vertices along the boundary between a pair of regions (e.g., V1 and V2). The mean DEM gradient at these vertices was quantified for each gene, enabling us to rank genes by their exhibited border-like features at this cortical location. We then assessed the ranking of known lists of areal marker genes for a given border against a randomly sampled null distribution. To validate known areal marker genes derived from previous ISH studies, we took examples from the human visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>), macaque visual cortex, and macaque frontal regions 44 and 45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). To test the capacity of our resource to identify novel putative areal border genes, we calculated average gradients of all genes across the boundary between mesial temporal parahippocampal gyrus (perirhinal ectorhinal cortex, PeEc) and the fusiform gyrus (area TF) for which there is openly available ISH data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://human.brain-map.org/ish/search">https://human.brain-map.org/ish/search</ext-link>). Limiting analyses to those genes for which ISH was available, the two genes exhibiting the largest gradient in either direction (four in total) were selected. The ISH was visually inspected for the presence of area-like features in gene expression. For quantitative support, the cortex in each ISH image was manually segmented over the area of interest. The pixel-wise transverse distance along the cortical segmentation from left to right was calculated and subdivided into 200 equally spaced columns, spanning from pial to white matter surface. Staining intensity was averaged across each column. For each column, we computed the <italic>t</italic>-statistic between columns to the right and left, and identified the column with the largest <italic>t</italic>-statistic as the location of the putative interareal boundary.</p><p>We used the spun + interpolated null to test whether peaks in gene gradient could be driven primarily by local folding morphology impacting non-uniform interpolation. We quantified the average gradient for all genes along the V1-V2 border in the atlas, as well as for 10 iterations of the atlas where the samples were spun prior to interpolation. We computed the median gradient magnitude for the 20 top-ranked genes for each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2d</xref>).</p><p>We benchmarked DEMs against regional differences in cellular measures of cortical organization from single-nucleus RNA-sequencing studies (snRNAseq). Specifically, we correlated regional differences in the estimated proportion of 16 neuronal subtypes across six cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lake et al., 2016</xref>) with regional DEM estimates for the mean expression of provided markers for these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lake et al., 2016</xref>). The test statistic was tested against a null distribution generated through spinning and resampling the cell marker DEM estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For all four of these comparisons, alignment between maps was quantified and test for statistical significance using a strict spin-based spatial permutation method that controls for spatial autocorrelation in cortical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018</xref>) methods on statistical testing of pairwise cortical maps can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Characterizing the topography of DEMs</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>TD and PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâc</xref>)</title><p>TD of each cortical vertex was calculated as the mean of the absolute DEM value for all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Statistically significant peaks in TD, driven by convergence of extreme values across multiple genes, were identified as follows. The DEM for each gene was independently spun and TD was recalculated at each vertex over 1000 sets of gene-level DEM permutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018</xref>). The maximum vertex TD value for each permuted TD map was recorded and the 95th percentile value across the 1000 permutations was taken as a threshold value. This threshold represents the maximum TD one would expect in the absence of concentrated colocalisations of extreme expression signatures, and areas above this threshold were annotated as TD peaks. To disambiguate TD peaks that are spatially coalescent but potentially driven by extreme values of heterogeneous gene sets within different regions, we concatenated all suprathreshold TD vertices into a single vertex * gene matrix and vertices in this matrix were clustered based on their expression signatures.</p><p>Intervertex correlation of gene rankings was calculated and the matrix was clustered using a Gaussian mixture model. Bayesian information criterion was used to identify the optimum number of clusters (k = 6) from a range of 2â18. Automated labels to localize TD peaks were generated based on their intersection with a reference multimodal neuroimaging parcellation of the human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>). Each TD was given the label of the multimodal parcel that showed the greatest overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>The TD map was assessed for reproducibility through three approaches. First, the six-subject cohort was subdivided into pairs of triplets, for which there are 10 unique combinations. For each combination, independent TD maps were computed for each triplet and compared between triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). Second, for the full six-subject cohort genes were grouped into deciles according to the reproducibility of their spatial patterns in independent subcohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). For each decile of genes, a TD map was computed and compared to the TD map from the remaining 90% of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). Third, to assess whether the covariance in spatial patterning across genes could be a result of mesh-associated structure introduced through interpolation and smoothing, TD maps were recomputed for the spun + interpolated null datasets and compared to the original TD map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><p>The cortical regions defined by TD peaks were annotated according to their spatial overlap with the 24 cortical cell marker expression DEMs used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g and h</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakken et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lake et al., 2016</xref>). To establish that cell maps were aligned with TD peaks, we first tested whether the vertex with the highest DEM value for each cell map overlapped with a TD peak and compared the number of overlapping cells to a null distribution created through spinning the TD peaks independently 1000 times. We then identified the cell types whose expression most closely aligned with each TD peak, comparing mean TD expression with a null distribution generated through spinning the peaks 1000 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1h</xref>). TD peaks were also annotated for their functional activations using the meta-analytic Neurosynth database (see âMap-based annotationsâ).</p><p>Gene sets characterizing TD peaks were identified as follows. At the vertex with the highest TD value within a peak region, the 95th centile TD value across genes was selected as a threshold. Genes with z-scored expression values above this threshold or below its inverse were selected, allowing TD peaks to have asymmetric length gene lists for high- and low-expressed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These TD gene lists were submitted to a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis pipeline (see âGene set-based annotationsâ).</p><p>To contextualize the newly described TD peaks using previously reported principal components (PCs) of human cortical gene expression, we computed the first five PC of gene expression in our full DEM library. The percentage of variance explained by each PC was calculated and compared to a null threshold derived through fitting PCs to a permuted null given by 1000 random spatial rotations of gene-level DEMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). Taking the gene-level loadings from the first three PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1e</xref>), each vertex could be positioned in a 3D PC space based on its expression signature and also be colored based on its membership of a TD peak, thereby visualizing the position of TD peaks relative to the dominant spatial gradients of transcriptomic variation across the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>The assignment of TD regions as âpeaksâ implies a rapid emergence of the TD signature surrounding the peak boundaries, which we formally assessed by cortex-wide analysis of local tangential changes in gene expression (see âLocal gradient analysis<italic>â</italic>), and a spatially fine-grained comparisons of the physical vs. transcriptional distance between cortical regions. In the latter of these two analytic approaches, a rapid âborder-likeâ onset of TD features would appear as (i) TD regions showing a greater transcriptional distance from other cortical regions than would be expected from their physical distance from other cortical regions, and (ii) this disparity emerging sharply surrounding the peak. To achieve this test, we first quantified the geodesic physical distance and Euclidean transcriptomic distance between pairs of vertices. For computational tractability, we limited this analysis to a subsample of vertices, choosing central vertices from ROIs in a parcellation with 500 approximately evenly sized parcels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). We fit a linear generalized additive model to the data â predicting transcriptomic distance from geodesic distance â and calculated the residuals for each inter-vertex edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). For each sampled vertex, we averaged these residuals and mapped them back to the surface to visualize cortical areas that were transcriptomically more distinctive than their physical distance to other areas would predict (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Relating adult TD peaks to fetal gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1k</xref>)</title><p>We sought to establish whether the regional expression signatures characterizing TD peaks were present early in fetal development. This goal required measures of gene expression from multiple regions across the fetal cortical sheet, which are provided by the Allen Institute from Brain Sciences fetal laser micro-dissection microarray dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). In each sampleâs fetal brain, this dataset represents approximately 25 cortical brain regions tangentially, and radially 7 transient fetal layers/compartments: subpial granular zone (SG), marginal zone (MZ), outer and inner cortical plate (grouped together as CP), subplate zone (SP), intermediate zone (IZ), outer and inner subventricular zone (grouped together as SZ), and ventricular zone (VZ).</p><p>Probe-level data measures of gene expression for the two PCW21 donors in the AHBA fetal LMD microarray dataset were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brainspan.org/static/download.html">https://www.brainspan.org/static/download.html</ext-link>, providing log2-transformed measures of gene expression for 58,692 probes in each of the 536 tissue samples across both donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Preprocessing and normalization of these probe-level gene expression values were implemented as detailed by the Allen Institute for Brain Science White Paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/3506181/Prenatal_LMD_Microarray.pdf">https://help.brain-map.org/download/attachments/3506181/Prenatal_LMD_Microarray.pdf</ext-link>). Probe-level expression values were averaged for each gene to yield a single gene * sample expression matrix for each donor, which was filtered to include only cortical samples. Gene expression values were scaled across samples within each donor, and scaled gene expression values were compiled for the set of 235 cortical regions that was common to both donor datasets. We averaged scaled regional gene expression values between donors per gene and filtered for genes in the fetal LDM dataset that were also represented in the adult DEM dataset, yielding a single final 20,476 * 235 gene-by-sample matrix of expression values for the human cortex at 21 PCW. Each TD peak region was then paired with the closest matching cortical label within the fetal regions. This matrix was then used to test whether each TD expression signature discovered in the adult DEM dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was already present in similar cortical regions at 21 PCW.</p><p>The analysis of fetal regional patterning of TD peak gene sets was carried out as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1k</xref>). For a given TD peak, the significantly enriched genes for that peak (see above for definition of these gene sets) were identified in the fetal dataset and averaged at each fetal sample â capturing how highly expressed the TD signature was in each fetal sample. Next, we identified all samples in the fetal expression dataset that originated from regions underlying the TD peak and defined these as the âfetal target region setâ for that TD region (i.e., occipital samples in the fetal brain were the fetal target region set for analysis of gene enriched in the adult occipital TD region). We ranked all fetal samples by their mean expression of the TD marker set and normalized these ranks to between 0 (TD markers most highly expressed) and 1 (TD markers most lowly expressed). Normalization was done to adjust for varying numbers of areas recorded per compartment. This ranking enabled us to compute the median rank of the fetal target region set and test whether this was significantly lower compared to a null distribution of ranks from random reassignment of the fetal target region set labels across all fetal samples. Within this analytic framework, a statistically significant test means that the adult TD signature is significantly localized to homologous cortical regions at 21 PCW fetal life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1k</xref> ).

Regions with a significantly high average expression gradient were identified using a similar spatial permutation procedure as described for the identification of TD peaks. Briefly, the DEM gradient map for each gene was independently spun and an average expression gradient magnitude was recalculated at each vertex over 1000 sets of these spatial permutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander-Bloch et al., 2018</xref>). For each permutation, we recorded the maximum vertex-level average expression gradient value, and the 95th percentile value of these maximums across the 1000 permutations was taken as a threshold value. Vertices with observed average expression gradient values above this threshold represented cortical regions of significantly rapid transcriptional change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1j</xref>).</p><p>The principal orientation of gene expression change at each vertex was calculated considering the vectors describing gene expression gradients, thereby providing a single summary of local gene expression gradients that considers both direction and magnitude. PCA of gene gradient vectors was used to calculate the primary orientation of gene expression change at each vertex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) and the percentage of orientation variance accounted for by this PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1i</xref>). Gene-level PC weights for each vertex were stored for subsequent analyses, including alignment with folds and functional ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>, see âAnnotational analysesâ).</p><p>The rich DEM expression gradient information described above was applied in three downstream analyses. First, we used these resources to detail the emergence of TD expression signatures within the cortical sheet, focusing on all vertices that had been identified to show a significantly elevated mean expression gradient. Specifically, we ranked genes at these vertices by their loadings onto the first PC of gene expression gradients at each vertex and correlated these rankings with the rankings of genes by the expression at each TD peak vertex. This vertex-level correlation score, which quantifies how closely the gene expression gradient at a given vertex resembles that expression signature of a given TD peak, was regenerated for each of the six TD peaks (colors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1j</xref>). In each of these six maps, we were also able to plot the principal orientations of expression change at the vertex level (red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1i</xref>) to ask whether gradients of expression change for a given TD signature were spatially oriented towards the TD in question.</p><p>Second, we used the principal orientation of expression change at each vertex to assess whether local transcriptomic gradients were aligned with the orientation of cortical folding patterns. Orientation of cortical folds was calculated using sulcal depth and cortical curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). Gradient vectors for sulcal depth describe the primary orientation of cortical folds on the walls of sulci, while gradient vectors of cortical curvature better describe the orientation at sulcal fundi and gyral crowns. These two gradient vector fields were combined and smoothed with a 10 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel to propagate the vector field into plateaus, for example, at large gyral crowns where neither sulcal depth nor curvature exhibit reliable gradients. The folding orientation vectors were calculated with reference to a 2D flattened cortical representation for statistical comparison with the gradient vectors derived from gene expression maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). At each vertex, the minimum angle was calculated between the folding orientation vector and gene expression gradient vector. Aligned vector maps exhibit positive skew, with angles tending toward zero. Therefore, the skewness of the distribution of angles across all vertices was calculated, and to test for significance, folding and expression vector maps were spun relative to one another 1000 times, generating a null distribution of skewness values against which the test statistic was compared (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A similar analysis was applied to test the association between module eigenmap gradient vectors and cortical folding (see âWeighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)â).</p><p>Third, we sought to quantify the alignment between cortical expression gradients and cortical areas as defined by multimodal imaging. Orientation of each MRI multimodal parcel ROI from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glasser et al., 2016</xref> was calculated taking the coordinates for all vertices within a given ROI. PCA of coordinates was used to identify the short and long axis of the ROI object. The vector describing the short axis was taken for comparison with mean of expression gradient vectors for vertices in the same ROI. For each ROI, the minimum angle was calculated and the skewness of the angles across all ROIs was calculated and compared to a null distribution created through spinning maps independently 1000 times, recalculating angles and their skewness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3aâc</xref>)</title><p>Genes were clustered into modules for further analysis using WGCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). Briefly, geneâgene cortical spatial correlations were calculated across all vertices to generate a single square 20,781 * 20,781 signed co-expression matrix. This co-expression matrix underwent âsoft-thresholding,â raising the values to a soft power of 6, chosen as the smallest power where the resultant network satisfied the scale-free topology model fit of <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>). Next, a similarity matrix was created through calculating pairwise topological overlap, assessing the extent to which genes share neighbors in the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yip and Horvath, 2007</xref>). The inverse of the TOM was then clustered using average linkage hierarchical clustering, with a minimum cluster size of 30 genes. The eigengene for each module is the first PC of gene expression across vertices and provides a single measure of module expression at each vertex (hence, âeigenmapâ). As per past implementation of WGCNA, pairs of modules with eigengene correlations above 0.9 were merged. These procedures defined a total of 23 gene co-expression modules ranging in size from 77 to 3725 genes, and a single set of unconnected genes (gray module 265 genes). We filtered the gray module from further analysis, as well as all six other modules that were also statistically significantly enriched for NCExp genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>, Fisherâs test, all p&lt;0.0001), leaving a total of 16 modules for downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Output coefficient and cluster maps were registered from fsaverage to fs_LR32k and compared with the M12 and M15 eigenmaps as described above.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>receives consulting income from Octave Bioscience and compensation for reviewership duties from the American Medical Association</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Study participants demographics.</title><p>(1) Demographics of adult donors Allen Human Brain Atlas microarray data.

following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Wagstyl et al. describes an extensive analysis of gene expression in the human cerebral cortex and the association with a large variety of maps capturing many of its microscopic and macroscopic properties. The core methodological contribution is the computation of continuous maps of gene expression for &gt;20k genes, which are being shared with the community. The manuscript is a demonstration of several ways in which these maps can be used to relate gene expression with histological features of the human cortex, cytoarchitecture, folding, function, development and disease risk. The main scientific contribution is to provide data and tools to help substantiate the idea of the genetic regulation of multi-scale aspects of the organisation of the human brain. The manuscript is dense, but clearly written and beautifully illustrated.</p><p>Main comments</p><p>The starting point for the manuscript is the construction of continuous maps of gene expression for most human genes. These maps are based on the microarray data from 6 left human brain hemispheres made available by the Allen Brain Institute. By technological necessity, the microarray data is very sparse: only 1304 samples to map all the cortex after all subjects were combined (a single individual's hemisphere has ~400 samples). Sampling is also inhomogeneous due to the coronal slicing of the tissue. To obtain continuous maps on a mesh, the authors filled the gaps using nearest-neighbour interpolation followed by strong smoothing. This may have two potentially important consequences that the authors may want to discuss further: (a) the intrinsic geometry of the mesh used for smoothing will introduce structure in the expression map, and (b) strong smoothing will produce substantial, spatially heterogeneous, autocorrelations in the signal, which are known to lead to a significant increase in the false positive rate (FPR) in the spin tests they used.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks to the reviewer for their considered feedback. We have addressed these primary concerns into point-by-point responses below. The key conclusions from our new analyses are: (i) while the intrinsic geometry of the mesh had not originally been accounted for in sufficient detail, the findings presented in this manuscript paper are not driven by mesh-induced structure, (ii) that the spin test null models used in this manuscript [including a modified version introduced in response to (i)] are currently the most appropriate way to mitigate against inflated false positive rates when making statistical inferences on smooth, surface-based data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Structured smoothing</p><p>A brain surface has intrinsic curvature (Gaussian curvature, which cannot be flattened away without tearing). The size of the neighbourhood around each surface vertex will be determined by this curvature. During surface smoothing, this will make that the weight of each vertex will be also modulated by the local curvature, i.e., by large geometric structures such as poles, fissures and folds. The article by Ciantar et al (2022, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-022-02536-4">https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-022-02536-4</ext-link>) provides a clear illustration of this effect: even the mapping of a volume of <italic>pure noise</italic> into a brain mesh will produce a pattern over the surface strikingly similar to that obtained by mapping resting state functional data or functional data related to a motor task.</p><p>Comment 1</p><p>It may be important to make the readers aware of this possible limitation, which is in large part a consequence of the sparsity of the microarray sampling and the necessity to map that to a mesh. This may confound the assessments of reproducibility (results, p4). Reproducibility was assessed by comparing pairs of subgroups split from the total 6. But if the mesh is introducing structure into the data, and if the same mesh was used for both groups, then what's being reproduced could be a combination of signal from the expression data and signal induced by the mesh structure.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1</p><p>The reviewer raises an important question regarding the potential for interpolation and smoothing on a cortical mesh to induce a common/correlated signal due to the intrinsic mesh structure. We have now generated a new null model to test this idea which indicates that intrinsic mesh structure is not inflating reproducibility in interpolated expression maps. This new null model spins the original samples prior to interpolation, smoothing and comparison between triplet splits of the six donors, with independent spins shared across the triplet. For computational tractability we took one pair of triplets and regenerated the dataset for each triplet using 10 independent spins. We used these to estimate gene-gene null reproducibility for 90 independent pairwise combinations of these 10 spins. Across these 90 permutations, the average median gene-gene correlation was R=0.03, whereas in the unspun triplet comparisons this was R=0.36. These results indicate that the primary source of the gene-level triplet reproducibility is the underlying shared gene expression pattern rather than interpolation-induced structure.</p><p>In Methods 2a: &quot;An additional null dataset was generated to test whether intrinsic geometry of the cortical mesh and its impact on interpolation for benchmarking analyses of DEMs and gradients (Fig S1d, Fig S2d, Fig S3c). In these analyses, the original samples were rotated on the spherical surface prior to subsequent interpolation, smoothing and gradient calculation. Due to computational constraints the full dataset was recreated only for 10 independent spins. These are referred to as the âspun+interpolated nullâ.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Figure S1d: Gene predictability was higher across all triplet-triplet pairs than when compared to spun+interpolated null.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86933-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2</p><p>It's also possible that mesh-induced structure is responsible in part for the &quot;signal boost&quot; observed when comparing raw expression data and interpolated data (fig S1a). How do you explain the signal boost of the smooth data compared with the raw data otherwise?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 2</p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this issue of mesh-induced structure. We first sought to quantify the impact of mesh-induced structure through the new null model, in which the data are spun prior to interpolation. New figure S1d, S2d and S3c all show that the main findings are not driven by interpolation over a common mesh structure, but rather originate in the underlying expression data.</p><p>Specifically, for the original Figure S1a, the reviewer highlights a limitation that we compared intersubject predictability of raw-sample to raw-sample and interpolated-to-interpolated. In this original formulation improved prediction scores for interpolated-to-interpolated (the âsignal boostâ) could be driven by mesh-induced structure being applied to both the input and predicted maps. We have updated this so that we are now comparing raw-to-raw and interpolated-to-raw, i.e. whether interpolated values are better estimations of the measured expression values. The new Fig S1a&amp;b (see below) shows a signal boost in gene-level and vertex level prediction scores (delta R = +0.05) and we attribute this to the minimisation of location and measurement noise in the raw data, improving the intersubject predictability of expression levels.</p><p>In Methods 2b: &quot;To assess the effect of data interpolation in DEM generation we compared gene-level and vertex-level reproducibility of DEMs against a âground truthâ estimate of these reproducibility metrics based on uninterpolated expression data. To achieve a strict comparison of gene expression values between different individuals at identical spatial locations we focused these analyses on the subset of AHBA samples where a sample from one subject was within 3 mm geodesic distance of another. This resulted in 1097 instances (spatial locations) with measures of raw gene expression of one donor, and predicted values from the second donorâs un-interpolated AHBA expression data and interpolated DEM. We computed gene-level and vertex-level reproducibility of expression using the paired donor data at each of these sample points for both DEM and uninterpolated AHBA expression values. By comparing DEM reproducibility estimates with those for uninterpolated AHBA expression data, we were able to quantify the combined effect of interpolation and smoothing steps in DEM generation. We used gene-level reproducibility values from DEMs and uninterpolated AHBA expression data to compute a gene-level difference in reproducibility, and we then visualized the distribution of these difference values across genes (Fig S1a). We used gene-rank correlation to compare vertex-level reproducibility values between DEMs and uninterpolated AHBA expression data (Fig S1b).&quot;</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Figure S1: Reproducibility of Dense Expression Maps (DEMs) interpolated from spatially sparse postmortem measures of cortical gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Signal boost in the interpolated DEM dataset vs. spatially sparse expression data. Restricting to samples taken from approximately the same cortical location in pairs of individuals (within 3mm geodesic distance), there was an overall improvement in intersubject spatial predictability in the interpolated maps. Furthermore, genes with lower predictability in the interpolated maps were less predictable in the raw dataset, suggesting these regions exhibit higher underlying biological variability rather than methodologically introduced bias. (<bold>b</bold>) Similarly at the paired sample locations, gene-rank predictability was generally improved in DEMs vs. sparse expression data (median change in R from sparse samples to interpolated for each pair of subjects, +0.5).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86933-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How do you explain that despite the difference in absolute value the combined expression maps of genes with and without cortical expression look similar? (fig S1e: in both cases there's high values in the dorsal part of the central sulcus, in the occipital pole, in the temporal pole, and low values in the precuneus and close to the angular gyrus). Could this also reflect mesh-smoothing-induced structure?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 3</p><p>As with comment 1, this is an interesting perspective that we had not fully considered. We would first like to clarify that non-cortical expression is defined from the independent datasets including the âcortexâ tissue class of the human protein atlas and genes identified as markers for cortical layers or cortical cells in previous studies. This is still likely an underestimate of true cortically expressed genes as some of these ânon-cortical genesâ had high intersubject reproducibility scores. Nevertheless we think it appropriate to use a measure of brain expression independent of anything included in other analyses for this paper. These considerations are part of the reason we provide all gene maps with accompanying uncertainty scores for user discretion rather than simply filtering them out.</p><p>In terms of the spatially consistent pattern of the gene ranks of Fig S1f, this consistent spatial pattern mirrors Transcriptomic Distinctiveness (r=0.52 for non-cortical genes, r=0.75 for cortical genes), so we think that as the differences in expression signatures become more extreme, the relative ranks of genes in that region are more reproducible/easier to predict.</p><p>To assess whether mesh-smoothing-induced structure is playing a role, we carried out an additional the new null model introduced in response to comment 1, and asked if the per-vertex gene rank reproducibility of independently spun subgroup triplets showed a similar structure to that in our original analyses. Across the 90 permutations, the median correlation between vertex reproducibility and TD was R=0.10. We also recalculated the TD maps for the 10 spun datasets and the mean correlation with the original TD did not significantly differ from zero (mean R = 0.01, p=0.2, nspins = 10). These results indicate that folding morphology is not the major driver of local or large scale patterning in the dataset. We have included this as a new Figure S3c.</p><p>We have updated the text as follows:</p><p>In Methods 3a: &quot;Third, to assess whether the covariance in spatial patterning across genes could be a result of mesh-associated structure introduced through interpolation and smoothing, TD maps were recomputed for the spun+interpolated null datasets and compared to the original TD map (Fig S3c).&quot;</p><p>In Results: &quot;The TD map observed from the full DEMs library was highly stable between all disjoint triplets of donors (Methods, Fig S3a, median cross-vertex correlation in TD scores between triplets r=0.77) and across library subsets at all deciles of DEM reproducibility (Methods, Fig S3b, cross-vertex correlation in TD scores r&gt;0.8 for the 3rd-10th deciles), but was not recapitulated in spun null datasets (Fig S3c).&quot;</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Figure S3c: Correlations between TD and TD maps regenerated on datasets spun using two independent nulls, one where the rotation is applied prior to interpolation and smoothing (spun+interpolated) and one where it is applied to the already-created DEMs.</title><p>In each null, the same rotation matrix is applied to all genes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86933-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4</p><p>Could you provide more information about the way in which the nearest-neighbours were identified (results p4). Were they nearest in Euclidean space? Geodesic? If geodesic, geodesic over the native brain surface? over the spherically deformed brain? (Methods cite Moresi &amp; Mather's Stripy toolbox, which seems to be meant to be used on spheres). If the distance was geodesic over the sphere, could the distortions introduced by mapping (due to brain anatomy) influence the geometry of the expression maps?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 4</p><p>We have clarified in the Methods that the mapping is to nearest neighbors on the spherically-inflated surface.</p><p>The new null model we have introduced in response to comments 1 &amp; 3 preserves any mesh-induced structure alongside any smoothing-induced spatial autocorrelations, and the additional analyses above indicate that main results are not induced by systematic mesh-related interpolation signal. In response to an additional suggestion from the reviewer (Comment 13), we also assessed whether local distortions due to the mesh could be creating apparent border effects in the data, for instance at the V1-V2 boundary. At the V1-V2 border, which coincides anatomically with the calcarine sulcus, we computed the 10 genes with the highest expression gradient along this boundary in the actual dataset and the spun-interpolated null. The median test expression gradients along this border was higher than in any of the spun datasets, indicating that these boundary effects are not explained by the interpolation and cortical geometry effects on the data (new Fig S2d).The text has been updated as follows:</p><p>In Methods 1: &quot;For cortical vertices with no directly sampled expression, expression values were interpolated from their nearest sampled neighbor vertex on the spherical surface (Moresi and Mather, 2019) (Fig 1b).&quot;</p><p>In Methods 2: &quot;We used the spun+interpolated null to test whether high gene gradients could be driven by non-uniform interpolation across cortical folds. We quantified the average gradient for all genes along the V1-V2 border in the atlas, as well as for 10 iterations of the atlas where the samples were spun prior to interpolation. We computed the median gradient magnitude for the 20 top-ranked genes for each (Fig S2d).&quot;</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Figure S2d: Mean of gradient magnitudes for 20 genes with largest gradients along V1-V2 border, compared to values along the same boundary on the spun+interpolated null atlas.</title><p>Gradients were higher in the actual dataset than in all spun version indicating this high gradient feature is not primarily due to the effects of calcarine sulcus morphology on interpolation</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86933-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5</p><p>Could you provide more information about the smoothing algorithm?

Potentially inflated FPR for spin tests on autocorrelated data.&quot;</p><p>Spin tests are extensively used in this work and it would be useful to make the readers aware of their limitations, which may confound some of the results presented. Spin tests aim at establishing if two brain maps are similar by comparing a measure of their similarity over a spherical deformation of the brains against a distribution of similarities obtained by randomly spinning one of the spheres. It is not clear which specific variety of spin test was used, but the original spin test has well known limitations, such as the violation of the assumption of spatial stationarity of the covariance structure (not all positions of the spinning sphere are equivalent, some are contracted, some are expanded), or the treatment of the medial wall (a big hole with no data is introduced when hemispheres are isolated).</p><p>Another important limitation results from the comparison of maps showing autocorrelation. This problem has been extensively described by Markello &amp; Misic (2021). The strong smoothing used to make a continuous map out of just ~1300 samples introduces large, geometry dependent autocorrelations. Indeed, the expression maps presented in the manuscript look similar to those with the highest degree of autocorrelation studied by Markello &amp; Misic (alpha=3). In this case, naive permutations should lead to a false positive rate ~46% when comparing pairs of random maps, and even most sophisticated methods have FPR&gt;10%.</p><p>Comment 7There's currently several researchers working on testing spatial similarity, and the readers would benefit from being made aware of the problem of the spin test and potential solutions. There's also packages providing alternative implementations of spin tests, such as BrainSMASH and BrainSpace, which could be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 7</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the issue of null models. First, with reference to the false positive rate of 46% when maps exhibit spatial autocorrelation, we absolutely agree that this is an issue that must be accounted for and we address this using the spin test. We acknowledge there has been other work on nulls such as BrainSMASH and BrainSpace. Nevertheless in the Markello and Misic paper to which the reviewer refers, the BrainSmash null models perform worse with smoother maps (with false positive rates approaching 30% in panel e below), whereas the spin test maintains false positives rates below 10%.</p><fig id="sa3fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86933-sa3-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We have added a brief description of the challenge and our use of the spin test.</p><p>In Methods 2a: &quot;Cortical maps exhibit spatial autocorrelation that can inflate the False Positive Rate, for which a number of methods have been proposed(Alexander-Bloch et al. 2018; Burt et al. 2020; Vos de Wael et al. 2020). At higher degrees of spatial smoothness, this high False Positive Rate is most effectively mitigated using the spin test(Alexander-Bloch et al. 2018; Markello and Misic 2021; Vos de Wael et al. 2020). In the following analyses when generating a test statistic comparing two spatial maps, to generate a null distribution, we computed 1000 independent spins of the cortical surface using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://netneurotools.readthedocs.io">https://netneurotools.readthedocs.io</ext-link>, and applied it to the first map whilst keeping the second map unchanged.

However, there are multiple potential metrics to choose from and each of the DEMs would have their own value. To address this properly would require the creation of a set of validated tools and it is not clear how we could summarize this variety of potential metrics for 20k genes. Moreover, as discussed above the spin method is an adequate null across a range of spatial autocorrelation degrees, thus while we agree that in general estimation of spatial smoothness could be a useful imaging metric to report, we consider that it is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9</p><p>Could you clarify which version of the spin test was used?

Since one of the main points of the paper is the use of a dense map, I find it quite light in assessing the validity of this dense map. The reproducibility values they calculate by taking subsets of subjects are hugely under-powered, given that there are only 6 brains, and they don't inform on local, vertex-wise uncertainties. I wonder if the authors would consider using Gaussian process interpolation. It is really tailored to this kind of problem and can give local estimates of uncertainty in the interpolated values. For hyperparameter tuning, they could use leave-one-brain-out for that.</p><p>I know it is a lot to ask to change the base method, as that means re-doing all the analyses. But I think it would strengthen the paper if the authors put as much effort in the dense mapping as they did in their downstream analyses of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 1</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to explore Gaussian process interpolation.

More generally, could there be an effect of folds on TD?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 13</p><p>Please see our response to Reviewer 1, Comment 1 above, where we introduce the new null models now analyzed to test for effects of mesh geometry on our findings. These new null models - where original source data were spun prior to interpolation suggest that neither the sharp V1/2 border or the TD map are effects of mesh geometry. Specifically: (i) , the magnitudes of gradients along the V1/2 boundary from null models were notably smaller than those in our original analyses (see new figure S2d), and (ii) TD maps computed from the new null models showed no correlation with TD maps from ur original analyses (new Figure S3c, mean R = 0.01, p=0.2, nspins = 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 14</p><p>p5: Similar for the matching with the areas in Glasser's parcellation: the definition of these areas involves alignment through folds (based on freesurfer 'sulc' map, see Glasser et al 2016). If folds influence the geometry of TDs, could that influence the match?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 14</p><p>We note that Fig S3c provided evidence that folding was not the primary driver of the TD patterning. However, it is true that Glasser et al. use both neuroanatomy (folding, thickness and myelin) and fMRI-derived maps to delineate their cortical areas. As such Figure 2 f &amp; g arenât fully independent assessments. Nevertheless the reason that these features are used is that many of the sulci in question have been shown to reliably delineate cytoarchitectonic boundaries (Fischl et al., 2008).</p><p>In Results: &quot;A similar alignment was seen when comparing gradients of transcriptional change with the spatial orientation of putative cortical areas defined by multimodal functional and structural in vivo neuroimaging(Glasser et al., 2016) (expression change running perpendicular to area long-axis, pspin&lt;0.01, Fig 2g, Methods).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 15</p><p>p6: TD peaks are said to overlap with functionally-specialised regions. A comment on why audition is not there, nor language, but ba 9-46d is? Would that suggest a lesser genetic regulation of those functions?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 15</p><p>The reviewer raises a valid point and this was a result that we were also surprised by. The finding that the auditory cortex is not as microstructurally distinctive as, say V1, is consistent with other studies applying dimensionality-reduction techniques to multimodal microstructural receptor data (e.g. Zilles et al., 2017, Goulas et al., 2020). These studies found that the auditory microstructure is not as extreme as either visual and somatomotor areas. From a methodological view point, the primary auditory cortex is significantly smaller than both visual and somatomotor areas, and therefore is captured by fewer independent samples, which could reduce the detail in which its structure is being mapped in our dataset.</p><p>For the frontal areas, we would note that (i) the frontal peak is the smallest of all peaks found and was more strongly characterised by low z-score genes than high z-score. (ii) the anatomical areas in the frontal cortex are much more highly variable with respect to folding morphology (e.g. Rajkowska 1995). The anatomical label of ba9-46d (and indeed all other labels) were automatically generated as localisers rather than strict area labels. We have clarified this in the text as follows:</p><p>In Methods 3a: &quot;Automated labels to localize TD peaks were generated based on their intersection with a reference multimodal neuroimaging parcellation of the human cortex(Glasser et al., 2016). Each TD was given the label of the multimodal parcel that showed greatest overlap (Fig 2b).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 16.</p><p>p7: The proposition that &quot;there is a tendency for cortical sulci to run perpendicular to the direction of fastest transcriptional change&quot;, could also be &quot;there is a tendency for the direction of fastest transcriptional change to run perpendicular to cortical sulci&quot;? More pragmatically, this result from the geometry of transcriptional maps being influenced by sulcal geometry in their construction.</p></disp-quote><p>Response 16</p><p>Please see our response to Reviewer 1, Comment 1 above, where we introduce the new null models now analyzed to test for effects of mesh geometry on our findings. These models indicate that the topography of interpolated gene expression maps do not reflect influences of sulcal geometry on their construction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 17</p><p>p7: TD transitions are indicated to precede folding. This is based on a consideration of folding development based on the article by Chi et al 1977, which is quite an old reference. In that paper, the authors estimated the tempo of human folding development based on the inspection of photographs, which may not be sufficient for detecting the first changes in curvature leading to folds. The work of the Developing Human Connectome consortium may provide a more recent indication for timing. In their data, by PCW 21 there's already central sulcus, pre-central, post-central, intra-parietal, superior temporal, superior frontal which can be detected by computing the mean curvature of the pial surface (I can only provide a tweet for reference: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/R3RT0/status/1617119196617261056">https://twitter.com/R3RT0/status/1617119196617261056</ext-link>). Even by PCW 9-13 the callosal sulcus, sylvian fissure, parieto-occipital fissure, olfactory sulcus, cingulate sulcus and calcarine fissure have been reported to be present (Kostovic &amp; Vasung 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>Response 17</p><p>Our field lacks the data necessary to provide a comprehensive empirical test for the temporal ordering of regional transcriptional profiles and emergence of folding. Our results show that transcriptional identities of V1 and TGd are - at least - present at the very earliest stages of sulcation in these regions. In response to the reviewers comment we have updated with a similar fetal mapping project which similarly shows evidence of the folds between weeks 17-21 and made the language around directionality more cautious.</p><p>In Results: &quot;The observed distribution of these angles across vertices was significantly skewed relative to a null based on random alignment between angles (pspin&lt;0.01, Fig 2f, Methods) - indicating that there is indeed a tendency for cortical sulci and the direction of fastest transcriptional change to run perpendicular to each other (pspin&lt;0.01, Fig 2f).</p><p>As a preliminary probe for causality, we examined the developmental ordering of regional folding and regional transcriptional identity. Mapping the expression of high-ranking TD genes in fetal cortical laser dissection microarray data(Miller et al., 2014) from 21 PCW (Post Conception Weeks) (Methods) showed that the localized transcriptional identity of V1 and TGd regions in adulthood is apparent during the fetal periods when folding topology begins to emerge (Chi et al. 1977; Xu et al. 2022) (Fig &quot;S2d).</p><p>In Discussion: &quot;By establishing that some of these cortical zones are evident at the time of cortical folding, we lend support to a âprotomapâ(Rakic 1988; O'Leary 1989; O'Leary et al. 2007; Rakic et al. 2009) like model where the placement of some cortical folds is set-up by rapid tangential changes in cyto-laminar composition of the developing cortex(Ronan et al., 2014; Toro and Burnod, 2005; Van Essen, 2020). The DEMs are derived from fully folded adult donors, and therefore some of the measured genetic-folding alignment might also be induced by mechanical distortion of the tissue during folding(Llinares-Benadero and Borrell 2019; Heuer and Toro 2019). However, no data currently exist to conclusively assess the directionality of this gene-folding relationship.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 18</p><p>p7: In my supplemental figures (obtained from biorxiv, because I didn't find them among the files submitted to eLife) there's no S2j (only S2a-S2i).</p></disp-quote><p>Response 18</p><p>We apologize, this figure refers to S3k (formerly S3j), rather than S2j.

Each TD peak region was then paired with the closest matching cortical label within the fetal regions. This matrix was then used to test if each TD expression signature discovered in the adult DEM dataset (Fig 2, Table 3) was already present in similar cortical regions at 21 PCW.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 20</p><p>p7: WGCNA is used prominently, could you provide a brief introduction to its objectives? The gene coexpression networks are produced after adjusting the weight of the network edges to follow a scale-free topology, which is meant to reflect the nature of protein-protein interactions. Soft thresholding increases contrast, but doesn't this decrease a potential role of infinitesimal regulatory signals?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 20</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the introduction to WGCNA needed additional details and have amended the Results (see below). One limitation of WGCNA-derived associations is that it will downweigh the role of smaller relationships including potentially important regulatory signals. WGCNA methods have been titrated to capture strong relationships. This is an inherent limitation of all co-expression driven methods which lead to an incomplete characterisation of the molecular biology. Nevertheless we feel these stronger relationships are still worth capturing and interrogating. We have updated the text to introduce WGCNA and acknowledge this potential weakness in the approach.</p><p>In Results: &quot;Briefly, WGCNA constructs a constructs a connectivity matrix by quantifying pairwise co-expression between genes, raising the correlations to a power (here 6) to emphasize strong correlations while penalizing weaker ones, and creating a Topological Overlap Matrix (TOM) to capture both pairwise similarities expression and connectivity. Modules of highly interconnected genes are identified through hierarchical clustering. The resultant WGCNA modules enable topographic and genetic integration because they each exist as both (i) a single expression map (eigenmap) for spatial comparison with neuroimaging data (Fig 3a,b, Methods) and, (ii) a unique gene set for enrichment analysis against marker genes systematically capturing multiple scales of cortical organization, namely: cortical layers, cell types, cell compartments, protein-protein interactions (PPI) and GO terms (Methods, Table S2 and S4).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 21</p><p>WGCNA modules look even more smooth than the gene expression maps. Are these maps comparable to low frequency eigenvectors? Autocorrelation in that case should be very strong?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 21</p><p>These modules are smooth as they are indeed eigenvectors which likely smooth out some of the more detailed but less common features seen in individual gene maps. These do exhibit high degrees of autocorrelation, nevertheless we are applying the spin test which is currently the appropriate null model for spatially autocorrelated cortical maps (Response 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 22</p><p>If the WGCNA modules provide an orthogonal basis for surface data, is it completely unexpected that some of them will correlate with low-frequency patterns? What would happen if random low frequency patterns were generated? Would they also show correlations with some of the 16 WGCNA modules?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 22</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that if we used a generative model like BrainSMASH, we would likely see similar low frequency patterns. However, the inserted figure in Response 7 from Makello &amp; Misic provide evidence that is not as conservative a null as the spin test when data exhibit high spatial autocorrelation. The spatial enrichment tests carried out on the WGCNA modules are all carried out using the spin test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 23</p><p>In part (a) I commented on the possibility that brain anatomy may introduce artifactual structure into the data that's being mapped. But what if the relationship between brain geometry and brain organisation were deeper than just the introduction of artefacts?

The work of Pang et al(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.04.510897">https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.04.510897</ext-link>) suggests that the geometry of the brain plays a critical role in constraining its dynamics: they analyse &gt;10k task-evoked brain maps and show that the eigenvectors of the brain laplacian parsimoniously explain the activity patterns. Could brain anatomy have a downward effect on brain organisation?</p></disp-quote><p>Response 23</p><p>The reviewer raises a fascinating extension of our work identifying spatial modes of gene expression. We agree that these are low frequency in nature, but would first like to note that the newly introduced null model indicates that the overlaps with salient neuroanatomical features are inherent in the expression data and not purely driven by anatomy in a methodological sense.</p><p>Nevertheless we absolutely agree there is likely to be a complex multidirectional interplay between genetic expression patterns through development, developing morphology and the âfinalâ adult topography of expression, neuroanatomical and functional patterns.</p><p>We think that the current manuscript currently contains a lot of in depth analyses of these expression data, but agree that a more extensive modeling analysis of how expression might pattern or explain functional activation would be a fascinating follow on, especially in light of these studies from Pang and Lefebre.

They have paid attention to encode their data in standard formats, and their code was made in Python using freely accessible packages instead of proprietary alternatives such as matlab. All this should greatly facilitate the adoption of the approach. I think it would be important to state more explicitly the conceptual assumptions that the methodology brings. In the same way that a GWAS approach relies on a Mendelian idea that individual alleles encode for phenotypes, what is the idea about the organisation of the brain implied by the orthogonal gene expression modules? Is it that phenotypes - micro and macro - are encoded by linear combinations of a reduced number of gene expression patterns? What would be the role of the environment? The role of non-genic regulatory regions? Some modalities of functional organisation do not seem to be encoded by the expression of any module. Is it just for lack of data or should this be seen as the sign for a different organisational principle? Likewise, what about the aspects of disorders that are not captured by expression modules? Would that hint, for example, to stronger environmental effects? What about linear combinations of modules? Nonlinear? Overall, the authors adopt implicitly, en passant, a gene-centric conceptual standpoint, which would benefit from being more clearly identified and articulated. There are citations to Rakic's protomap idea (I would also cite the original 1988 paper, and O'Leary's 1989 &quot;protocortex&quot; paper stressing the role of plasticity), which proposes that a basic version of brain cytoarchitecture is genetically determined and transposed from the proliferative ventricular zone regions to the cortical plate through radial migration. In p13 the authors indicate that their results support Rakic's protomap. Additionally, in p7 the authors suggest that their results support a causal arrow going from gene expression to sulcal anatomy. The reviews by O'leary et al (2007), Ronan &amp; Fletcher (2014, already cited), Llinares-Benadero &amp; Borrell (2019) could be considered, which also advocate for a similar perspective. For nuances on the idea that molecular signals provide positional information for brain development, the article by Sharpe (2019, DOI: 10.1242/dev.185967) is interesting. For nuances on the gene-centric approach of the paper the articles by Rockmann (2012, DOI: 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01486.x) but also from the ENCODE consortium showing the importance of non-genic regions of the genome (&quot;Perspectives on ENCODE&quot; 2020 DOI: 10.1038/s41586-021-04213-8) could be considered. I wouldn't ask to cite ideas from the extended evolutionary synthesis about different inheritance systems (as reviewed by Jablonka &amp; Lamb, DOI: 10.1017/9781108685412) or the idea of inherency (Newman 2017, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-33038-9_78-1), but the authors may find them interesting. Same goes for our own work on mechanical morphogenesis which expands on the idea of a downward causality (Heuer and Toro 2019, DOI: 10.1016/j.plrev.2019.01.012)</p></disp-quote><p>Response 26</p><p>We thank the reviewer for recommending these papers, which we enjoyed reading and have deepened our thinking on the topic.
