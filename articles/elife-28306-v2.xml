R-loops are enriched at promoters where they have recently been shown to have important roles in modifying gene expression. However, the location of promoter-associated R-loops and the genomic domains they perturb to modify gene expression remain unclear. To resolve this issue, we developed a bisulfite-based approach, bisDRIP-seq, to map R-loops across the genome at near-nucleotide resolution in MCF-7 cells. We found the location of promoter-associated R-loops is dependent on the presence of introns. In intron-containing genes, R-loops are bounded between the transcription start site and the first exon-intron junction. In intronless genes, the 3' boundary displays gene-specific heterogeneity. Moreover, intronless genes are often associated with promoter-associated R-loop formation. Together, these studies provide a high-resolution map of R-loops and identify gene structure as a critical determinant of R-loop formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28306.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes contain coded instructions for making proteins. When the cell needs to use a gene, molecular machinery assembles near the start of the gene in regions called promoters. Part of this machinery then reads along the gene, making a copy of the code in the form of a DNA-like molecule called RNA. These RNAs typically contain regions called exons, which carry the instructions, interspersed with spacer regions called introns. As RNAs are made they are 'spliced' to chop out the introns, leaving behind the final instructions.</p><p>Most DNA exists in a double helix shape with two connected DNA strands, but the regions near the start of genes often contain structures called R-loops. In these structures, one strand of the DNA partners up with a single strand of RNA, forcing the other strand to bulge out on its own. Their location at gene promoters indicates that R-loops could change the cell's use of genes by impacting the machines that assemble near the start of genes. However, R-loops are not well understood. A major barrier to understanding the role of R-loops is that we do not know exactly where they are with respect to the start of genes.</p><p>Dumelie and Jaffrey now report a new method to map R-loops almost to the resolution of single letters of the DNA code – a method which they called bisDRIP-seq. The approach extends an existing technique called DRIP-seq, which uses antibodies to capture DNA sequences stuck to strands of RNA. It can find R-loops, but it cannot tell the difference between the loop itself and the DNA surrounding it. The new technique uses a chemical called bisulfite to alter the DNA letters. It only affects the loop of the R-loop because the RNA shields the other strand. Sequencing then pinpoints the modified letters, revealing the exact location of the loop.</p><p>For human cells grown in the laboratory, the technique found that R-loops form between the start of the gene and its first intron. Some genes do not have any introns, and in these cases, the R-loops extended deep into the code. Most human genes have only a small amount of DNA between the start site and the first intron, which may act to limit the effect of R-loops in these genes.</p><p>This new technique allows the high-resolution study of R-loops, and could help to reveal their role in regulating genes. Abnormal R-loops have already been linked to a small set of human diseases like fragile-X syndrome. As the tools to study R-loops improve, it is possible that scientists will make connections to other diseases. In time, improved understanding of these structures could lead to better diagnosis, and eventually treatment, for these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>RNA/DNA hybrids</kwd><kwd>promoters</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>splicing</kwd><kwd>introns</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009784</institution-id><institution>Starr Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WC2015-011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dumelie</surname><given-names>Jason G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA186702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaffrey</surname><given-names>Samie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide profiling of R-loops at near single-nucleotide resolution reveals distinct R-loop boundaries depending on the presence and location of the first exon-intron junction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>R-loops are nucleic acid structures in which a strand of RNA is hybridized to a strand of DNA, while the other strand of DNA is looped out. Recent techniques for genome-wide mapping of R-loops revealed that promoter regions are enriched in R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>). The presence of R-loops in promoter regions raises the possibility that they may regulate gene expression. Indeed, more recent studies provided evidence that R-loops in these critical regions can alter histone modifications and are associated with changes in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A major unanswered question is the precise location of these R-loops. The location of an R-loop in a gene is likely to dictate how that R-loop can impact promoter function. This is because eukaryotic promoter regions contain multiple functional domains that have distinct roles in transcription, including transcription start sites, transcription factor-binding sites, exon-intron junctions, CpG islands, and nucleosome-associated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenhard et al., 2012</xref>). The location of an R-loop within the promoter could influence transcription by disrupting or enhancing protein recruitment to any of these sites. Thus, understanding the precise location of R-loops can provide insight into how R-loops affect gene transcription.</p><p>A major barrier to discovering the exact location of R-loops is the low resolution of current genome-wide R-loop mapping methods like DRIP-seq (DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>). This method uses the S9.6 antibody which binds RNA-DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boguslawski et al., 1986</xref>). With this antibody, genome-wide R-loop maps are created by immunoprecipitating and sequencing the genomic fragments containing RNA-DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stork et al., 2016</xref>). However, DRIP-seq does not discriminate between the R-loop sequence and the surrounding non-R-loop sequence. Therefore, the exact boundaries of R-loops cannot be resolved using DRIP-seq.</p><p>Based on DRIP-seq and similar R-loop mapping methods, promoter-associated R-loops are thought to form within a few kilobases downstream of the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chédin, 2016</xref>). From these low-resolution experiments, it is not clear if R-loops have specific boundaries or if they are relatively amorphous structures that lack well-defined boundaries.</p><p>To understand where R-loops are positioned in genomic promoter regions, we developed bisDRIP-seq (bisulfite-DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing). bisDRIP-seq is an approach to map R-loops at near-nucleotide resolution throughout the genome. In this approach, we use bisulfite to selectively convert cytosine residues into uracil residues within genomic DNA regions that contain single-stranded DNA. We then identify single-stranded regions likely to be in R-loops based on preferential labeling of one strand of DNA and the requirement that the labeling be transcription dependent. Remarkably, we find that promoter-associated R-loops are typically bounded by the transcription start site and the first exon-intron junction in intron-containing genes. Thus, we find that the maximum size of promoter-associated R-loops is controlled by the location of the first exon-intron junction in intron-containing genes. We also identify prominent promoter-associated R-loop forming regions in intronless genes, including <italic>MALAT1</italic>, <italic>NEAT1</italic>, and the replication-dependent histone genes. In some of these genes, the R-loops are associated with well-defined 3’ boundaries that are located within the gene body. Thus our high-resolution map of promoter-associated R-loops defines the boundaries of R-loops and suggests a role for first exon length in regulating the formation of R-loops.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>bisDRIP-seq concept</title><p>It is not yet possible to define the exact size and location of R-loop-forming regions on a genome-wide scale. In contrast, it is possible to determine the exact location of a specific R-loop-forming region in a specific gene using a previously developed bisulfite mapping approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Essentially, this approach involved treating genomic DNA with bisulfite under non-denaturing conditions. Bisulfite specifically causes cytosine-to-uracil conversions in the single-stranded DNA portion of R-loops. On the other hand, cytosines in the RNA-DNA hybrid portion of the R-loop are protected from bisulfite conversion. Sequencing of both strands then revealed the location and strand in which cytosines were converted to uracils. The presence of an R-loop was identified by showing that the converted cytosines occurred primarily on one of the two strands of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). The location of bisulfite-induced conversions on a single strand of DNA was then used to define the boundaries of the R-loop at near-nucleotide resolution.</p><p>This use of bisulfite to detect single-stranded regions of DNA contrasts with the use of bisulfite in mapping 5-methylcytosine in DNA. For 5-methylcytosine mapping, DNA is denatured into single strands and then all cytosines are converted to uracils, while 5-methylcytosine is poorly converted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frommer et al., 1992</xref>). Thus, while mapping 5-methylcytosine involves searching for unconverted cytosines, mapping single-stranded DNA involves detection of converted cytosines.</p><p>The use of bisulfite to map R-loops on a genome-wide scale poses several significant challenges. First, non-physiological R-loop formation, removal, expansion, or contraction can occur between the time of lysis and the time when bisulfite is used to mark single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaback et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Landgraf et al., 1996</xref>). Second, high sequencing depth is needed to search for converted cytosines across the entire genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sims et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, bisulfite causes infrequent, but measurable, background conversions in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2003</xref>), which can generate a significant amount of noise on a genome-wide scale.</p><p>To map R-loops at near-nucleotide resolution, we developed a genome-wide bisulfite-based approach called bisDRIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This method incorporates steps to overcome each of the challenges listed above. In this approach, cells are lysed in the presence of bisulfite and SDS. By including bisulfite during lysis, genomic DNA structures have as little time as possible to change conformation prior to the bisulfite modification of cytosines in single-stranded DNA regions. To overcome the problem of needing high sequence coverage, the S9.6 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boguslawski et al., 1986</xref>) is used to enrich for R-loops. The S9.6 antibody has high affinity for RNA-DNA hybrids and lower affinity for other double-stranded RNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, after genomic DNA is sheared using restriction digestion, the S9.6 antibody enriches the bisulfite-modified R-loops for sequencing analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28306.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Near-nucleotide resolution mapping of R-loops.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram illustrating the work-flow of the bisDRIP-seq protocol.

In these plots, the template strand refers to the strand used for <italic>RPPH1</italic> transcription, rather than the template strand used for <italic>PAPR2</italic> transcription. In the top plot, cytosine-to-uracil conversions were mapped to the genomic region surrounding <italic>RPPH1</italic>. The number of conversions on the template strand and non-template strand were plotted below the x-axis (orange) or above the x-axis (blue), respectively. Shown are the total number of conversions observed in all bisDRIP-seq samples (n = 13). In the lower plot, the bisDRIP-seq scores were mapped to the genomic region surrounding <italic>RPPH1</italic> (mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 samples). The bisDRIP-seq score on the template strand and non-template strand were plotted below the x-axis (orange) or above the x-axis (blue), respectively. As can be seen, the genomic region containing <italic>RPPH1</italic> had both a high number of cytosine-to-uracil conversions and high bisDRIP-seq scores specifically on the non-template strand. By contrast, the <italic>PARP2</italic> gene had minimal bisDRIP-seq conversions and low bisDRIP-seq scores.

The bisDRIP-seq bisulfite treatment should create consecutive cytosine-to-uracil conversions in regions of single-stranded DNA. We expected to observe this in individual reads located in single-stranded regions. We also expected to observe a high aggregated number of conversions within regions of DNA that were frequently single-stranded. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the entire <italic>RPPH1</italic> gene appeared to preferentially contain single-stranded DNA on its non-template strand. Here we observe part of this region at higher resolution and in individual reads. At the top of the panel, a gene model is displayed of the genomic region located within 25 bp of the transcription start site of <italic>RPPH1</italic>. Above this gene model is the exact sequence of DNA in this region. Under the gene model of <italic>RPPH1</italic>, is the sequence of one of the reads that overlapped with the transcription start site of <italic>RPPH1</italic>. Within the sequence of the read, cytosines that were not converted by bisulfite are represented by a blue ‘C’. By contrast, putative bisulfite-converted cytosines are represented by a blue ‘T’. In this particular read, eight consecutive cytosines were converted near the transcription start site, while three consecutive cytosines were not converted further upstream of the transcription start site. This suggests that the read represented a region of DNA that was partially single-stranded and partially double-stranded immediately after cell lysis. In the lower plot, the total number of conversions on the template strand and non-template strand were plotted below the x-axis (orange) or above the x-axis (blue), respectively. Shown are the total number of conversions observed in all bisDRIP-seq samples (n = 13). Consecutive cytosines on the non-template strand had high numbers of conversion in the region immediately upstream of the transcription start site and in the region downstream of the transcription start site. This suggests that the conversions were due to the presence of single-stranded DNA in this region. (<bold>B,C</bold>) bisDRIP-seq scores are more clustered than expected if read location were determined through stochastic processes. Stochastic processes were modeled using a Monte Carlo simulation. In this simulation, all of the reads from a given sample were mapped to a randomly-assigned 1 kb region. This 1 kb region had to be within the same chromosome as the original read and it had to overlap with one bisDRIP-seq read. This process was repeated for all reads within each sample. Next, mean bisDRIP-seq scores were calculated for each 1 kb region in the genome using either real bisDRIP-seq reads (black, solid, n = 13) or using reads assigned to regions at random (blue, dashed, n = 13). We then compared the density of regions (y-axis) with a given mean bisDRIP-seq score (x-axis) for all regions (<bold>C</bold>) (n = 2956134) or just the regions that had the top percentile of scores (<bold>D</bold>) (n = 29561). The Monte Carlo simulation generated a larger proportion of regions with moderate scores, while the bisDRIP-seq scores from aligned reads were concentrated in a smaller subset of regions (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This is consistent with bisDRIP-seq showing greater specificity than expected by chance.

(<bold>D,E</bold>) bisDRIP-seq scores are more clustered than expected if the bisDRIP-seq scores of reads were determined through stochastic processes. A ‘shuffled scores’ control was generated by randomly assigning bisDRIP-seq scores to reads from the same chromosome in a given sample. This was repeated across all chromosomes and across all samples (n = 13). Next, bisDRIP-seq scores were calculated for each 1 kb region in the genome using either the bisDRIP-seq scores originally calculated for each reads (black, solid) or using the shuffled scores (blue, dashed). We then compared the density of regions (y-axis) with a given mean bisDRIP-seq score (x-axis, n = 13) for all regions (<bold>E</bold>) (n = 2956134) or just the regions that had the top percentile of scores (<bold>F</bold>) (n = 29561). The Monte Carlo simulation generated a larger proportion of regions with moderate scores, while the bisDRIP-seq scores generated from experiments were more concentrated in the regions with the highest scores (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This suggests that the intensity of bisDRIP-seq score is informative and was not just due to stochastic processes.

RNA-DNA hybrids are integral components of R-loops. RNA-DNA hybrids are known to bind the S9.6 antibody and to be degraded by RNase H. R-loop signal should therefore be lost in the absence of S9.6 immunoprecipitation or if the sample is treated with RNase H. In each of these plots, the template strand refers to the strand used for <italic>RPPH1</italic> transcription, rather than the template strand used for <italic>PAPR2</italic> transcription. Also, in each plot the bisDRIP-seq score on the template strand and non-template strand were plotted below the x-axis (orange) or above the x-axis (blue), respectively. In the top plot, bisDRIP-seq scores were mapped to the genomic region surrounding <italic>RPPH1</italic> from ‘input’ samples (mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 samples).

This computational pipeline also identifies single-stranded regions that are likely to contain R-loops as opposed to other single-stranded DNA structures in the genome. Additionally, the pipeline was designed to reveal the specific strand orientation of R-loops.</p><p>Thus, bisDRIP-seq provides an approach to map R-loops at near-nucleotide resolution on a genome-wide scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Near-Nucleotide resolution mapping of R-loops on a Genome-Wide scale</title><p>We used bisDRIP-seq to map single-stranded DNA throughout the genome. Thirteen bisDRIP-seq experiments were performed on different samples of MCF-7 cells. After performing bisDRIP-seq on these samples, the DNA fragments were sequenced using a traditional post-bisulfite library preparation method (see Materials and methods).</p><p>We next aligned the sequenced reads to the genome using Bismark, an alignment approach typically used for 5-methylcytosine mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>). This was necessary since the conversion of cytosines to uracils would confound traditional read alignment programs. Bismark was used to map conversions associated with single-stranded DNA as follows: first, reads were aligned to the genome. Then the cytosines that had been converted to uracils were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, reads were detected that contained only a single conversion, consistent with noise due to low-level double-stranded DNA cytosine conversions. However, reads and regions were also observed that contained consecutive cytosine conversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These reads are suggestive of single-stranded DNA.</p><p>We next applied our bioinformatic pipeline to distinguish the multiple conversions seen in single-stranded DNA regions from the stochastic conversions due to background noise.</p><p>In the first part of this pipeline, the stochastic rate of conversions was estimated. This was estimated based on the overall cytosine-to-uracil conversion rate in a given sample. Reads with a high percentage of conversions were excluded from this calculation since it was assumed that those conversions were not stochastic.</p><p>Next, we generated a ‘bisDRIP-seq score’ for each read. This score was calculated based on the number of cytosines converted in the read, relative to the likelihood of observing that number of conversions by stochastic noise (see Materials and methods for more details). Next, the score was normalized so that the sum of bisDRIP-seq scores within each sample was the same.</p><p>Next, we calculated bisDRIP-seq scores for individual nucleotide positions in the genome. The bisDRIP-seq score for each nucleotide position was calculated as the sum of the bisDRIP-seq scores of all of the reads that overlapped with that nucleotide position. These scores provide a read-length resolution map of single-stranded DNA that filters out stochastic conversions and that is more comparable between genomic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, bisDRIP-seq scores were substantially reduced at specific gene loci in samples treated with RNase H, which degrades RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This supports the idea that elevated bisDRIP-seq scores reflect R-loops.</p><p>We next performed two basic tests of the quality of data produced by bisDRIP-seq:</p><p>First, we asked whether reads with high bisDRIP-seq scores are randomly distributed across the genome or whether they are clustered in specific regions. To simulate a random distribution, Monte Carlo simulations were applied to our data. Relative to these Monte Carlo simulations, bisDRIP-seq scores were found to be clustered in specific regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).</p><p>Second, we performed correlation tests between the bisDRIP-seq scores obtained in each of our samples.

Based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>), R-loops are expected to form in active promoter regions, rather than in inactive promoter regions. R-loops can be identified by bisDRIP-seq based on preferential labeling of the non-template strand. Therefore, we compared the bisDRIP-seq scores on the non-template strand to the scores on the template strand and determined whether this correlated with promoter activity. Promoter activity and bisDRIP-seq scores were assessed in the region between the transcription start site and + 1000 bp. bisDRIP-seq scores were assessed separately for the non-template (blue) and template (orange) strands. For each strand, a LOESS smoothed curve was plotted of the bisDRIP-seq scores (y-axis) at different levels of promoter activity (x-axis). This was repeated for control-treated samples (solid, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 samples) and samples treated with the transcription-inhibitor triptolide (dashed, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 samples). bisDRIP-seq scores on both strands are correlated with promoter activity. Notably, with increasing promoter activity, the non-template strand is preferentially labeled. This suggests that sense-strand R-loop form in these promoters. Promoter activity was assessed using a MCF-7 GRO-seq dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hah et al., 2013</xref>.

The observation of R-loops by bisDRIP-seq should depend on RNA-DNA hybrid immunoprecipitation. We therefore asked whether that strand asymmetry is lost in metaplot analysis after performing background correction using bisDRIP-seq scores from input samples. Metaplots were generated separately for the non-template strand (blue) and template strand (orange) across active promoter regions (n = 15644). bisDRIP-seq scores were plotted for control-treated samples (dashed lines, n = 13 samples) and for control-treated samples after the subtraction of input bisDRIP-seq scores (solid lines, n = 13 control-treated samples and n = 2 input bisDRIP-seq samples). bisDRIP-seq scores decrease on both strands after input sample correction. However, there is no apparent decrease in the strand asymmetry of bisDRIP-seq score. This suggests that RNA-DNA hybrids enriched by S9.6 antibody are causing the strand asymmetry immediately downstream of the transcription start site. Input bisDRIP-seq samples were treated identically to bisDRIP-seq experiments, except that no S9.6 immunoprecipitation enrichment steps were performed. (<bold>B,C</bold>) Active promoter regions have high mean bisDRIP-seq scores relative to all promoter regions.

In (<bold>C</bold>), metaplots were generated by plotting the bisDRIP-seq score of active promoter regions (mean of n = 15644 promoter regions) at each nucleotide position relative to the transcription start site. For both panels, mean bisDRIP-seq scores were calculated separately for the nucleotide positions on the non-template strand (blue) and template strand (orange).

However, the mean bisDRIP-seq score for each strand is higher among active promoters. Additionally, the difference between strand mean bisDRIP-seq scores is higher among active promoters. This suggests that R-loop tend to form preferentially in active promoter regions.

Promoter regions were binned into ten nearly equal-sized bins based on promoter activity (n = 7821 or 7822). Metaplots with a higher promoter activity percentile have a higher promoter activity.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, there was evidence of antisense-strand R-loops upstream of the transcription start site. Since sense-strand R-loops were observed in promoter regions with high sense-promoter activity, we asked if antisense-strand R-loops form in promoter regions with high antisense-promoter activity. Antisense-strand R-loops can be identified by bisDRIP-seq based on preferential labeling of the template strand for canonical transcription. Therefore, we compared the bisDRIP-seq scores on the non-template strand to the scores on the template strand and determined whether this correlated with antisense promoter activity. Here, template strand refers to the template for transcription of the canonical gene rather than the antisense transcript. Antisense promoter activity and bisDRIP-seq scores were assessed in the region between −1000 bp and the transcription start site. bisDRIP-seq scores were assessed separately for the non-template (blue) and template (orange) strands. For each strand, a LOESS smoothed curve was plotted of the bisDRIP-seq scores (y-axis) at different levels of antisense promoter activity (x-axis). This was repeated for control-treated samples (solid, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 samples) and samples treated with the transcription-inhibitor triptolide (dashed, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 samples). bisDRIP-seq scores on both strands are correlated with promoter activity. Notably, with increasing antisense promoter activity, the template strand is preferentially labeled. This suggests that antisense-strand R-loops form in these promoters. Antisense promoter activity was assessed using a MCF-7 GRO-seq dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hah et al., 2013</xref>. Both antisense promoter activity and bisDRIP-seq scores were plotted on log2-transformed axes. ‘TSS’ refers to the transcription start site. (<bold>B</bold>) Transcription-dependent antisense-strand R-loops form in promoters with high antisense promoter activity. The presence of antisense-strand R-loops is suggested by negative bisDRIP-seq strand asymmetry as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>. For this plot, strand asymmetry was calculated as the log2-fold ratio of the bisDRIP-seq score of the non-template strand relative to the bisDRIP-seq score of the template strand (y-axis). Here, template strand refers to the template for transcription of the canonical gene rather than the antisense transcript. The distribution of promoter regions' strand asymmetry was plotted in separate violin plots for promoter regions with high antisense promoter activity (right, GRO-seq &gt; 24 reads, n = 3020 promoter regions), as well as an equivalent number of promoter regions with no antisense activity (left, GRO-seq = 0 reads, n = 3020 promoter regions). This was repeated for control-treated samples (green, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 samples) and triptolide-treated samples (pink, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 samples). Promoter regions with high antisense promoter activity typically had higher template bisDRIP-seq scores than non-template-strand bisDRIP-seq scores in control-treated samples. This negative strand asymmetry was significantly reduced in triptolide-treated samples. These results suggest that there were transcription-dependent antisense-strand R-loops in promoter regions with high antisense promoter activity. Antisense promoter activity and bisDRIP-seq scores were assessed in the region between −1000 bp and the transcription start site. Antisense-promoter activity was determined using a GRO-seq dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hah et al., 2013</xref>.

As illustrated, antisense-strand R-loops logically explain the strand ‘negative’ asymmetry observed in bisDRIP-seq scores. In particular, these antisense-strand R-loops contain single-stranded DNA on the template-strand, which should lead to preferential bisulfite labeling of this strand. In this model, template strand refers to the template for transcription of the canonical gene rather than the antisense transcript. The vertical black hash marks between nucleic acid strands indicate that two strands are hybridized. ‘asTSS’ refers to transcription start sites for antisense transcription. (<bold>D</bold>) Metaplot of R-loop signal in promoter regions with either high or low antisense-promoter activity. A metaplot of R-loop signal was plotted for promoter regions in the top ten percentile of antisense-promoter activity (blue, n = 7822) and for promoter regions in the bottom ten percentile of antisense-promoter activity (purple, n = 7822). Antisense-promoter activity was defined here as the number of GRO-seq antisense-strand reads measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hah et al., 2013</xref> in the region between −250 bp and the transcription start site. There is no clear negative R-loop signal observed in promoter regions with low antisense-promoter activity. By contrast, promoter regions with high antisense-promoter activity have a peak of negative R-loop signal 5' of the transcription start site. This negative R-loop signal suggests that antisense-strand R-loops form in this region. R-loop signal was defined as the triptolide-sensitive template-strand bisDRIP-seq score subtracted from the triptolide-sensitive non-template bisDRIP-seq score.

The location of these single-stranded structures is consistent with previous maps of single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouzine et al., 2013</xref>). However, the presence of R-loops is specifically suggested by asymmetric, preferential labeling of the non-template strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The small remaining difference in scores upon triptolide-treatment may reflect a real difference, but it may also reflect noise in our measurements.

To do this, we defined an ‘R-loop signal,’ which reflects the difference in bisDRIP-seq labeling of the non-template strand from the template strand after using the triptolide-treated samples for background correction. Thus, the template strand metaplot from the triptolide-treated sample was subtracted from the template strand metaplot from the control sample. The same background correction was used for the non-template strand metaplot. This background correction further enhances the demarcation of the transcription start site as the 5’ boundary of promoter-associated R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we subtracted the template strand metaplot from the non-template metaplot to generate a metaplot of the R-loop signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

On the other hand, 200–250 bp is reasonably close to the median distance between the transcription start site and the first exon-intron junction, which is 181 bp in our dataset (see Materials and methods). Also, previous studies found that knockdown of the 5' splice site-binding factor SRSF1 induces the formation of R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>), which could be explained if splicing is involved in bounding R-loop expansion.

These mean bisDRIP-seq scores were then summed at each position relative to the first exon-intron junction for all intron-containing gene promoter regions (n = 14538). These values were plotted separately for the template strand (orange) and for the non-template strand (blue). Immediately 5' of the exon-intron junction, the non-template bisDRIP-seq scores were greater than the template bisDRIP-seq scores in control-treated samples. This difference in bisDRIP-seq scores between the two strands was eliminated almost immediately 3' of the exon-intron junction.

(<bold>B</bold>) R-loop-forming regions expand further from both the transcription start site and the exon-intron junction in promoter regions with larger first exons. To test if the first exon-intron junction was acting as a boundary to R-loops, we created metaplots of R-loop signal in bins of promoter regions with different first-exon sizes. Promoter regions were binned into five groups based on the size of their first exon (n = 2907 or 2908 per bin). On the left side of the panel, metaplots of R-loop signal (blue) centered on the transcription start site were plotted for each bin of promoter regions. A vertical, dashed line (red) indicates the 3’-most location where R-loop signal was at half of the maximum signal in the metaplot. The arrow pointing to the dashed line indicates the distance from the line to the transcription start site. In the middle of the panel are schematics indicating the range of first-exon sizes observed in the bin of promoter regions that is examined in the adjacent metaplots. As illustrated, the smallest first exons are examined in the bin displayed in the top row and each subsequent row examines a bin containing larger first exons. On the right side of the panel, metaplots of R-loop signal (blue) centered on the first exon-intron junction were plotted for each bin of promoter regions. A vertical, dashed line (red) indicates the 5'-most location where R-loop signal was at half of the maximum signal in the metaplot. The arrow pointing to the dashed line indicates the distance from the line to the transcription start site. In metaplots representing genes with longer first exons, R-loop signal extended further 3' from the transcription start site and further 5' of the first exon-intron junction. These results suggest that R-loops were typically bounded between the transcription start site and the first exon-intron junction. ‘TSS’ refers to the transcription start site. In each case, R-loop signal at each nucleotide position was derived using the mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 control-treated samples and mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 triptolide-treated samples. (<bold>C</bold>) The 3' boundary of promoter-associated R-loops is within a few base pairs of the first exon-intron junction. To determine, at near-nucleotide resolution, the 3' R-loop boundary relative to the first exon-intron junction, we generated a metaplot of bisDRIP-seq-conversion asymmetry. To generate this metaplot, the total number of conversions was summed at each position relative to the first exon-intron junction for all intron-containing gene promoter regions (n = 14538). This was performed separately for each strand of the control-treated sample (mean of n = 13 samples) and then these values were background-corrected by subtracting the same values from the triptolide-treated samples (mean of n = 2 samples). Finally, the strand asymmetry of conversions was calculated as the log ratio of the number of conversions on the non-template strand relative to the template strand. This strand asymmetry of conversions (y-axis) was plotted for each position relative to the exon-intron junction (x-axis). In this metaplot, there is asymmetry in the strand orientation of conversions immediately 5' of the exon-intron junction, with more conversions on the non-template strand. However, within a few base pairs 3' of the exon-intron junction, conversions appear to be equally distributed on both the template and non-template strand. The consensus splice site confounds this analysis to some extent at the exact splice site. Nevertheless, this analysis suggests that the 3' R-loop boundary is located within base pairs of the first exon-intron junction.

To determine whether other splice junctions act as R-loop boundaries, we created metaplots of R-loop signal centered on the first three splice junctions. Metaplot were generated relative to the junction between the first exon and first intron (blue, n = 14538), the junction between the first intron and second exon (purple, n = 14538), and the junction between the second exon and second intron (green, n = 12100). While there is a positive R-loop signal peak immediately 5' of the first exon-intron junction, there was no similar peak observed for the other two splice junctions. In each metaplot, R-loop signal at each nucleotide position was derived using the mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 control-treated samples and mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 triptolide-treated samples. (<bold>B</bold>) The strand asymmetry of bisulfite conversions 5' of the exon-intron junction is due to a reduction in the percentage of template-strand cytosines that are converted. In our model of R-loop formation, we expect R-loops to cause strand asymmetry because the RNA binds the template strand and prevents it from reacting with bisulfite. To determine if this explains the conversion asymmetry 5' of the exon-intron junction, we generated a metaplot of the percentage of template-strand cytosines that were converted by bisulfite. At each position relative to the first exon-intron junctions of active promoter regions (n = 14538), we plotted the percentage of cytosines that were converted relative to the number of reads aligned to that site (blue). As expected, there is a reduction in the percentage of converted cytosines 5' of the first exon-intron junction. This mirrors the decrease in template-strand bisDRIP-seq scores 5' of the transcription start site and likely explains that decrease in template-bisDRIP-seq scores.

To do this, we asked if the size of the R-loop-forming region in promoter regions increases with the length of the first exon. To test this question, metaplot analysis was repeated on groups of promoter regions with different sized first exons. First, promoter regions were binned into five groups based on the annotated size of the first exon. Then, metaplots were created of the R-loop signal centered around either the transcription start site or the first exon-intron junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

On the other hand, cytosine-to-uracil conversions should map R-loops at near-nucleotide resolution. We therefore generated a metaplot of the strand asymmetry of cytosine conversions relative to the first exon-intron junction. First, the number of conversions on either strand were background corrected by subtracting the number of conversions observed in our triptolide bisDRIP-seq data. Next, the log ratio of conversions on the non-template strand relative to the template strand was plotted at each site relative to the exon-intron junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In this metaplot there is a decrease in the relative number of conversions on the non-template strand within base pairs of the exon-intron junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, it appears that the R-loop boundary is within a few base pairs of the first exon-intron junction.</p><p>We next asked whether other exon-intron junctions also act as R-loop boundaries.

The location of R-loops in the promoter regions of replication-dependent histone genes was examined using metaplot analysis. A metaplot was generated of bisDRIP-seq scores relative to the transcription start sites of all replication-dependent histone genes (n = 69). bisDRIP-seq scores were plotted separately for the template (orange) and non-template (blue) strands. This was repeated for control-treated samples (solid, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 samples) and triptolide-treated samples (dashed, mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 samples). The bisDRIP-seq scores on the non-template strand were higher than the scores on the template strand throughout the promoter region 3' of the transcription start site. Additionally, almost no signal was observed in the triptolide-treated samples. These results suggest that R-loops are the predominant structure observed by bisDRIP-seq in the promoter regions of this class of genes. ‘TSS’ indicates the location of the transcription start site.

R-loop formation was then plotted against (<bold>A</bold>) nuclear RNA levels or (<bold>B</bold>) POLR2A (RNA polymerase II) chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) signal for each promoter region. Promoter regions were plotted separately for non-histone genes (blue) and replication-dependent histone genes (orange). A linear regression for all genes was also plotted (blue). Both nuclear RNA levels and RNA polymerase II ChIP signal were weakly correlated with R-loop formation. Nevertheless, replication-dependent histone genes typically had higher R-loop formation scores than genes with similar promoter activity. This suggests that the nuclear RNA level of histones mRNAs in do not explain the high R-loop signal of these genes. It also suggests that the level of RNA polymerase II bound to histone genes does not explain the high R-loop signal observed at these genes.

In the top plot, bisDRIP-seq scores were derived from ‘input’ samples (mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 samples). These input samples received the entire bisDRIP-seq treatment except for the S9.6 immunoprecipitation enrichment steps. In the middle plot, bisDRIP-seq scores were derived from a bisDRIP-seq experiment that did not include an RNase H treatment (n = 1 sample). In the bottom plot, bisDRIP-seq scores were derived from an RNase H-treated bisDRIP-seq experiment (n = 1 sample). The bisDRIP-seq sample that was not treated with RNase H replicated the high non-template bisDRIP-seq scores observed in other bisDRIP-seq experiments at histone loci. On the other hand, almost no bisDRIP-seq signal was observed in either the input samples or in the bisDRIP-seq sample treated with RNase H. This suggests that the bisDRIP-seq signal observed at these gene loci is caused by R-loops. Transcription start sites are indicated by both ‘TSS’ and by dashed vertical lines. (<bold>D,E</bold>) bisDRIP-seq enrichment at (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>HIST1H2BG</italic> and (<bold>E</bold>) <italic>HIST1H1E</italic> is due to the presence of R-loops.

In both the middle and top plot, bisDRIP-seq scores from each experiment were mapped to the genomic region surrounding (<bold>D</bold>) <italic>HIST1H2BG</italic> and (<bold>E</bold>) <italic>HIST1H1E</italic>. At both loci, the bisDRIP-seq sample that was not treated with RNase H had similar bisDRIP-seq signal to our other bisDRIP-seq control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

In the middle of the panel are schematics indicating the range of first-exon sizes observed in the bin of promoter regions that is examined in the adjacent metaplots.

It was not clear if R-loops would be bounded in these genes since they lack introns and therefore they lack exon-intron junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>). Conceivably, the R-loops could extend to the entire length of the transcript. We therefore identified the boundaries of the R-loop signal in each of the nine histone genes that had the highest propensity to form R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As expected, the 5’ boundary of the R-loops appear to be near the transcription start site in all nine genes. In five of the nine histone genes, the entire R-loop appeared to be restricted to the initial portion of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). Sequence analysis of these boundaries does not reveal a clear sequence enrichment or motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), making it currently unclear how this boundary is determined.

To determine if the resolution of bisDRIP-seq R-loop mapping improves upon the resolution of previous R-loop mapping methods, we compared the data from bisDRIP-seq and DRIPc-seq. DRIPc-seq maps the location of RNAs that are incorporated into R-loops and, apart from bisDRIP-seq, it is the highest resolution method to map R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>). A metaplot of bisDRIP-seq R-loop signal (y-axis, solid blue) was plotted for active promoter regions (n = 15644) relative to the transcription start site. Overlapped onto the bisDRIP-seq metaplot are metaplots of sense-strand and antisense-strand DRIPc-seq reads. R-loop signal (blue) was highest in the region immediately 3' of the transcription start site and decreased 200–250 bp downstream of the transcription start site. Although there is also a peak of sense-strand DRIPc-seq reads 3' of the transcrption start site, there is no sharp 3' boundary to these reads within 5000 bp of the transcription start site. This suggests that bisDRIP-seq can map R-loop boundaries at a higher resolution than existing R-loop mapping methods. R-loop signal was defined as the triptolide-sensitive template-strand bisDRIP-seq score subtracted from the triptolide-sensitive non-template bisDRIP-seq score. This R-loop signal at each nucleotide position was derived using the mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 13 control-treated samples and mean bisDRIP-seq score from n = 2 triptolide-treated samples.

In the delayed bisDRIP-seq experiment (lower plot), R-loops were labeled with bisulfite 16 hr after cell lysis (black, y-axis, n = 1 sample) rather than during cell lysis.

To test this possibility, we performed a ‘delayed-bisulfite’ bisDRIP-seq experiment. In this experiment, we delayed the bisulfite step of our protocol so that samples were only treated with bisulfite 16 hr after cell lysis. In some genes, such as <italic>MALAT1</italic> and <italic>NEAT1</italic>, the bisDRIP-seq scores were similar when using the delayed-bisulfite protocol.

These regions were then mapped throughout the genome based on the location of bisulfite-induced cytosine-to-uracil conversions. In some regions, bisulfite-induced cytosine conversions are enriched on one strand of DNA, show a requirement for RNA transcription and are removed following RNase H treatment, supporting the idea that these regions contain R-loops. R-loops were previously thought to expand thousands of base pairs into gene bodies without any clear boundary to their expansion or formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chédin, 2016</xref>).

However, S9.6 is known to react to other nucleic acid structures, including structured RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>), and its full specificity relative to genomic DNA has not been examined. In our analysis, non-R-loop promoter single-stranded structures were immunoprecipitated by S9.6 antibody. This may reflect the poor specificity of the S9.6 antibody. Therefore, simply sequencing DNA recovered by S9.6 may not provide sufficient specificity for R-loop mapping.</p><p>bisDRIP-seq overcomes problems with the S9.6 antibody by adding multiple criteria to selectively identify which recovered fragments contain R-loops. These criteria included preferential labeling of a single strand of DNA and the requirement that the labeling be transcription-dependent. S9.6 antibody enrichment in protocols like DRIP-seq and bisDRIP-seq have been shown to be biased towards promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halász et al., 2017</xref>). The requirement for preferential bisulfite labeling of one strand of DNA should largely mitigate this bias. Still, it is worth nothing that these criteria may have resulted in us excluding specific genomic regions that form RNA-DNA hybrids on both DNA strands or that contain extremely stable R-loops. Nevertheless, these criteria allow us to exclude non-R-loop single-stranded structures that might otherwise be mistaken for R-loops.</p><p>The location of the 5' boundary of R-loops, identified here to be located at the transcription start site, suggests that R-loops are primarily formed using the canonical gene transcript. Conceivably, other transcripts could form R-loops in promoter regions, such as promoter upstream transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Preker et al., 2011</xref>) or extracoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Savell et al., 2016</xref>). Our data suggests that other transcripts initiating upstream or downstream of the canonical transcription start site are less likely to be the major source of RNA in promoter-associated R-loops.</p><p>Why would the exon-intron junction serve as the 3’ R-loop boundary? The simplest explanation is that RNA splicing limits the length of the hybrid that can form between the spliced RNA and the template strand of DNA. If the RNA that forms the R-loop is spliced, then the RNA would not be able to hybridize to intron-encoding DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Alternatively, R-loop expansion might be blocked by proteins that are bound to the 5' splice site in the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Both of these mechanisms could potentially explain the exon-intron junction R-loop boundary.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28306.030</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Two possible models to explain the R-loop boundaries observed in the promoter regions of intron-containing genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spliced RNA R-loop model. Promoter-associated R-loops may be bounded by the exon-intron junction because the RNA component of R-loops is spliced. If the first intron is spliced out of the RNA that is incorporated into promoter-associated R-loops, then the RNA cannot hybridize to the region of DNA encoding the first intron. This would prevent R-loops from expanding past exons. In this model, the template strand for canonical transcription is represented in orange, while the opposite, non-template strand is represented in blue. Black lines between two nucleic acid strands indicate that the nucleic acids are hybridized. ‘TSS’ refers to the transcription start site. (<bold>B</bold>) Protein-recruitment model. Alternatively, the first exon-intron junction may recruit proteins that prevent R-loop formation in the intron region. For example, the first exon-intron junction recruits splicesome proteins, which have been implicated in R-loop processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>). These or other proteins may bind the exon-intron junction and then block R-loop expansion. In this model, the template strand for canonical transcription is represented in orange, while the opposite, non-template strand is represented in blue. The red, green and blue circles represent proteins associated with first exon-intron junction. Black lines between two nucleic acid strands indicate that the nucleic acids are hybridized.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28306-fig8-v2"/></fig><p>Previous studies found that the relative location of the first exon-intron junction impacts the rate of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bieberstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brinster et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fong and Zhou, 2001</xref>). Smaller first exons are associated with higher rates of transcription and enhanced recruitment of transcription initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bieberstein et al., 2012</xref>). Conceivably, if smaller first exons are associated with less efficient or less stable R-loops, this may account for the higher transcription associated with these genes.</p><p>Although intronless genes lack exon-intron junctions, we identified R-loops and R-loop boundaries in these genes. Intronless genes were among the genes with the highest R-loop signal immediately downstream of the transcription start site. In particular, two classes of intronless genes were identified: intronless lncRNAs, including <italic>MALAT1</italic> and <italic>NEAT1</italic>, and replication-dependent histones.</p><p>Histone genes are notable for their unusual replication-dependent transcription regulation and for their non-canonical end termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>). During DNA synthesis, histone genes are transcribed and processed more efficiently than at other parts of the cell-cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hereford et al., 1981</xref>). Additionally, the histone genes are the only mRNAs that lack poly-A tails. Like <italic>MALAT1</italic> and <italic>NEAT1,</italic> the histone genes are terminated with a special stem-loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marzluff et al., 2008</xref>). This special processing has been previously linked to transcription and the absence of histone gene splicing. It is intriguing to speculate that either of these processes may relate to the robust R-loop structures that are seen at the 5’ end of these genes.</p><p><italic>MALAT1</italic> and <italic>NEAT1</italic>, which are both intronless genes, also had two of the strongest R-loop signals. These genes clearly show that promoter-associated R-loops can be bounded to specific regions of genes in the absence of an exon-intron junction. RNA-binding proteins might determine R-loop boundaries in these types of intronless genes. Indeed, we observed prominent binding of SRSF1 at a position that corresponds to the 3’ boundary of the R-loop in <italic>MALAT1</italic> in publicly-available datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, RNA-protein complexes may also limit the expansion of R-loops, especially in intronless genes.</p><p>Interestingly, all of the intronless genes that we studied are components of nuclear bodies. The histone RNAs, <italic>MALAT1</italic> and <italic>NEAT1</italic> associate with histone locus bodies, nuclear speckles and paraspeckles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clemson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutchinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). The strong R-loop signal in so many genes with roles in well-established nuclear bodies raises the possibility that R-loops may play a role in the formation or regulation of these bodies. In the case of at least the histone genes and <italic>NEAT1</italic>, formation of the nuclear bodies is known to occur near the DNA encoding these RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clemson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests the possibility that R-loop formation may be involved in tethering RNA to chromatin to facilitate ribonucleoprotein assembly. Future research will be needed to test this and other possibilities for why these nuclear body-associated genes are prone to R-loop formation.</p><p>Although bisDRIP-seq was used here to study steady-state promoter-associated R-loops, the method can be used for studying other questions regarding R-loops. For example, this method could be used to study the dynamic changes in R-loop size and location in response to various signals like estrogen. Moreover, as transcription termination sites become better annotated, high-resolution R-loop could guide the study of R-loops involved in transcription termination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"><bold>Reagent type (species) or resource</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Designation</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Source or reference</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Identifiers</bold></th><th valign="top"><bold>Additional information</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">cell line (human)</td><td valign="top">MCF-7 cells</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">HTB-22</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">S9.6 antibody</td><td valign="top">Kerafast</td><td valign="top">ENH001</td><td valign="top">Used at a concentration <break/>of 20 mg/L</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Pico-Methyl Seq <break/>Library Prep Kit</td><td valign="top">Zymo Research</td><td valign="top">D5455</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Ammonium sulfite <break/>monohydrate</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">358983–500G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">45% ammonium bisulfite</td><td valign="top">Pfaltz and Bauer Inc</td><td valign="top">A29946250g</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">sodium bisulfite</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">243973–100G</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">triptolide</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">3253</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Bismark</td><td valign="top">Babraham Bioinformatics</td><td valign="top">version 0.14.3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Flexbar</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodt et al., 2012</xref> <break/>PMID: 24832523</td><td valign="top">version 2.5</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF-7 cells were used for all experiments. Cell lines were originally obtained from ATCC. Cell identification was performed by ATCC, which identifies cell lines using STR profiling, and cell identity was regularly checked by visual inspection of morphologies. Independently prepared vials of cell lines were tested for mycoplasma by Hoechst staining; these cell lines were tested after the conduction of the experiments described here.</p><p>MCF-7 cells (10 million per 15 cm tissue culture dish) were cultured for three days at 37°C in 50 ml of Gibco's phenol red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Media was replaced after two days. In these experiments, we included MCF-7 cells treated for different amounts of time with 100 µM estrogen (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri) prior to lysis to ensure transcriptional activation at a broad set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hah et al., 2011</xref>). The use of estrogen in some samples ensures that we can maximally capture R-loops that occur in either basal and stimulated conditions.</p><p>Each of the thirteen control-treated bisDRIP-seq experiments and each of the two triptolide-treated bisDRIP-seq experiments were performed using a separate dish of MCF-7 cells.

The basic concept underlying this approach is that bisulfite can interact with single-stranded DNA, but cannot interact with DNA in a double helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). This contrasts with 5-methylcytosine mapping, which is performed under denaturing conditions that cause all double-stranded DNA to be single stranded and susceptible to bisulfite treatment. It is therefore worth noting that bisDRIP-seq could be affected by 5-methylcytosine. If 5-methylcytosine is present in the single-stranded DNA of the R-loop, there will be minimal conversion at those sites. This should not substantially impact R-loop mapping, since 5-methylcytosines are found only in a CpG sequence context and most R-loops will have some cytosines that are not followed by guanine. Nevertheless, this issue could be considered during data analysis.</p><p>Prior to performing bisDRIP-seq, lysis buffer was prepared containing 55.5 mg of ammonium sulfite monohydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri), 760 µl of 45% ammonium bisulfite (Pfaltz and Bauer Inc, Waterbury, Connecticut), 85.5 µl of 20 mM hydroquinone (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri) and 62.7 µl of 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a final volume of 2.85 ml.

Cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS. Cells were then scraped off of plates into ice-cold PBS. These cells were then transferred to a 15 ml conical tube. The conical tube containing cells was centrifuged for 3 min at 300 g . PBS was then removed from cells.</p><p>Next, cells were lysed in the presence of bisulfite. Bisulfite was included in the lysis buffer to achieve rapid single-stranded DNA modification that would minimize R-loop expansion or contraction. First, lysis buffer (1.5 ml) was added to the cells. Cells in lysis buffer (475 µl) were added to each of two microcentrifuge tubes, each of which contained 25 µl of lithium dodecyl sulfate. Samples were then incubated in a shaking incubator for 30 min at 37°C at 1100 rpm, while being protected from light.</p><p>Next, the concentration of bisulfite in samples was increased in order to increase the rate of the irreversible second hydrolytic deamination step in the bisulfite conversion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayatsu et al., 2004</xref>). The concentration of bisulfite was increased by transferring samples to a microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of ammonium bisulfite solution and 26.8 µl of 20 mM hydroquinone. Samples were then incubated in a shaking incubator for 2 hr at 37°C at 1100 rpm, while being protected from light.</p><p>Next, bisulfite was removed from the samples through dialysis. First, samples were added to 2.5 ml of dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM EDTA) in a 15 ml conical centrifuge tube. Samples were then added to an Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit with a 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Next, the samples were centrifuged following the instructions of the centrifugal filter unit manufacturer. After centrifugation, fresh dialysis buffer was added to the centrifugal filter unit and centrifugation was repeated. This dialysis process was repeated until the sample was nominally dialyzed at least 200 fold. Proteinase K buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8, 10 mM EDTA) was then added to the sample and centrifugation was repeated. This dialysis process was repeated until the sample was nominally dialyzed at least 5000 fold in Proteinase K buffer. At this point, the samples were resuspended in 1 ml of Proteinase K buffer and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube.</p><p>Next, we used Proteinase K (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) to degrade the proteins in our samples. In order to treat our samples with Proteinase K, 50 µl of 20% SDS and 200 µl of 20 µg/µl Proteinase K was added to each sample. Samples were then incubated overnight at 37°C while being rotated end over end.</p><p>Nucleic acids were purified from any remaining proteins present in the sample using phenol-chloroform. Samples were split into two microcentrifuge tubes. An equal volume of Phenol-chloroform (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) was added to each sample. Samples were mixed and then centrifuged for five minutes at 18400 g. The aqueous phase of each sample was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. Each sample was then combined with an equal volume of chloroform. Samples were mixed and centrifuged for two minutes at 18400 g. The aqueous phase of each sample was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube. Samples were then ethanol precipitated for 2 hr at 4°C. The precipitated DNA was then transferred and combined in a new tube by swirling the DNA around a pipette tip.

DNA libraries were sequenced following the manufacturer's instructions for single-index 100 bp paired-end read clustering.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Initial data processing</title><p>Sequencing data was first processed using CASAVA 1.8.2 (Illumina, San Diego, California) to obtain the nucleotide sequence of reads in FASTQ format.</p><p>We next aligned reads to the GRCh38 reference genome. Reads were aligned to the genome using the Bismark software library version 0.14.3 Bismark tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krueger and Andrews, 2011</xref>). The Bismark software library is specifically designed to align bisulfite-modified reads. In this analysis, the Bismark library used the Bowtie2 alignment tool version 2.2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) to perform the actual alignments. We also selected the Bismark option for post-bisulfite adapter tagging.</p><p>Read alignment was done in three phases. If we were unable to map a read in one phase, then we attempted to map the read in the following phase.</p><p>In the first alignment phase, full paired-end sequencing reads were aligned to the genome. First, reads were trimmed to remove both low confidence sequences and the very ends of reads. This was done using Flexbar version 2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodt et al., 2012</xref>) with the following settings: quality format i1.8, phred minimum of 30, 10 nt removed from 5' end of reads. Next, the Bismark tool was used to align reads to the genome. The settings employed for the alignment did not allow for mismatched nucleotides and restricted the gap between paired-end reads to no more than 1000 bp.</p><p>Next, the Bismark alignment tool was repeated on all reads that failed to map in the first alignment phase. In this second phase, the two ends of paired-end reads were treated as single-end reads. The settings employed for alignment did not allow mismatched nucleotides.</p><p>In the final alignment phase, we attempted to align all reads that were not aligned to the genome in the first two phases after additional preprocessing. In this phase, we continued to treat both ends of paired-end reads as single-end reads. However, we began this phase by using Flexbar version 2.5 to remove all nucleotides 55 nt or further 3' of the start of the read. Reads were then aligned with the Bismark tool using settings that did not allow for mismatched nucleotides.</p><p>Having aligned reads to the genome, we next removed putative read duplicates. To remove read duplicates, we ran the Bismark deduplicate_bismark tool.</p><p>Finally, we determined if cytosines within aligned reads had been converted by bisulfite. To determine whether individual cytosines had been converted to uracils, we used the Bismark bismark_methylation_extractor tool. In the case of paired-end alignments, we used the –no_overlap setting. With single-end alignments, we used the --ignore_3prime 10 setting. This setting removed the final ten nucleotides of each alignment. These nucleotides were removed from aligned reads because we observed bias in the fraction of cytosines converted in this region of reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Calculation of raw bisDRIP-seq read scores</title><p>Next, we developed a method to score reads based on the likelihood that a given read was single-stranded in our samples. This measure was intended to filter out conversions that occur due to spontaneous breathing of DNA. Additionally, we wanted to ensure that single-stranded reads containing large numbers of cytosines were not given greater value than single-stranded reads containing small numbers of cytosines. This method was applied to on each sample separately.</p><p>For the purposes of calculating bisDRIP-seq scores, we define the ‘original number of cytosines’ as the sum of converted cytosines and unconverted cytosines.</p><p>The goal of this method was to estimate the fraction of reads that had a set number of conversions due to chance alone. The inverse fraction was then defined as the bisDRIP-seq score for all reads with that number of conversions. Therefore, all of the reads from the same sample, with the same original number of cytosines, and with the same number of converted cytosines were given the same bisDRIP-seq score.</p><p>First, we made a rough estimate of the background conversion rate for each sample. Initially, we calculated the total fraction of cytosines that were converted in our aligned reads. Next, we repeated this calculation after removing reads that had greater than 2.5 fold more conversions than the average across all reads. This value was used as an estimate of the background conversion rate.</p><p>Next, we calculated the probability of observing a specified number of converted cytosines in a given read by chance. This probability was calculated using the binomial distribution. In this binomial distribution calculation, the size of the sample was the original number of cytosines in the read and the probability of a conversion was the estimated background conversion rate.</p><p>Next, we calculated the number of reads expected to have a given original number of cytosines and a given number of converted cytosines. First, we calculated the total number of aligned reads with a given original number of cytosines. Next, we multiplied that number with the probability of observing the specified number of converted cytosines in a read with that original number of cytosines by chance.</p><p>Next, a bisDRIP-seq score was calculated for each read. First, reads were binned together based on the original number of cytosines in the read and the number of converted cytosines in the read. Next, bins were grouped together if they had the same original number of cytosines. If a group of reads with a given original number of cytosines per read consisted of more than a thousand reads in total and the expected number of reads for each bin was above five, then we calculated the bisDRIP-seq for each bin as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>⩽</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This value was calculated first for reads with one original number of cytosines and then was calculated for reads with progressively higher numbers of original cytosines.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As stated by the reviewers the new method to map the position of R-loops at higher resolution than existing techniques is important to the field. The approach entails converting cytosines to uracils in the displaced DNA strand with bisulfite, while the cytosines in the opposite strand are protected by RNA. However all reviewers felt that it is crucial to include an RnaseH control. In addition since this is a methods paper it is necessary to discuss the differences and advantages of the reported method to those that have been previously developed and how the method and/or results represent a significant advance over the literature. We look forward to see an improved manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>R-loops are three-stranded structures consisting of a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA. R-loops are involved in multiple cellular processes, including mitochondria DNA replication, immunoglobulin class switch recombination, and transcription regulation. However, when dysregulated, R-loops could challenge genome integrity by introducing mutations, single-strand breaks, stalled replication forks and double-strand breaks. Precise genome-wide mapping of R-loops may provide insights into their functions and dynamics.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors developed a new method to map R-loops at near-nucleotide resolution. Their new method, named bisDRIP-seq, takes advantage of the unique three-stranded structures of R-loops. After fragmentation, RNA-DNA hybrids are pulled down using antibody S9.6, and cytosines in the displaced single-stranded DNA are converted to uracils by bisulfite. The cytosine-uracil-conversions can be mapped to the genome at near-nucleotide resolution. While this reviewer finds the approach novel, it does not appear to provide significantly higher resolution over the existing DRIPc-seq method developed recently by Chedin and coworkers (PMID: 27373332). Major concerns are listed below. In particular, baseline cytosine-uracil-conversions without S9.6 pull-down should be performed for the purpose of background elimination. Furthermore, as stated below, RNase H treatment prior to immunoprecipitation should be performed to validate the specificity of the bisDRIP-seq signals.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) It is crucial to confirm signals from bisDRIP-seq are indeed R-loop dependent. Simple bisDRIP-seq and DRIP-seq correlation is not sufficient. BisDRIP-seq with in vitro RNase H treatment should be performed.</p><p>2) In bisDRIP-seq, signals not only come from R-loops, but also from promoter single-stranded structures. Therefore it is important to include non-denatured cytosine-uracil-conversions (without S9.6 pull-down) as bisDRIP-seq input.</p><p>3) Template-strand bisDRIP-seq scores were subtracted from non-template-strand bisDRIP-seq scores to artificially recover R-loop signals. However, no assay was used to prove the validity of such a method.</p><p>4) Since previously reported DRIPc-seq already provides strand-specific, near base-pair resolution (PMID: 27373332), basic comparisons should be performed to test whether bisDRIP-seq outperforms DRIPc-seq in a significantly manner.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors describe a new method to map the position of R-loops at higher resolution than existing techniques. The approach entails converting cytosines to uracils in the displaced DNA strand with bisulfite, while the cytosines in the opposite strand are protected by RNA. To minimize the amount of sequencing they focus on regions immunoprecipitated by the S9.6 antibody specific for RNA-DNA hybrids. After bioinformatic processing the authors obtain a genome-wide &quot;bisDRIP-score&quot; which measures the frequency of single-stranded DNA present at a given locus. Asymmetric single-stranded regions are considered R-loops. R-loops are correlated with transcription and enriched in the promoter region of active genes. The high resolution of bisDRIP-seq allowed the authors to identify the TSS as a 5' boundary and the first exon-intron junction as a 3' boundary. Finally, they report that histone genes and lncRNAs MALAT1 and NEAT1 have a particularly strong R-loop signature.</p><p>R-loops are believed to play important roles in gene regulation and the manuscript by Dumelie et al. describes a creative strategy to better map their genomic localization. The results are well presented and the methods are described clearly and in much detail. Overall I support publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There are some major issues that need to be addressed, mostly ensuring that the authors are truly measuring R-loops and that no biases are skewing their analyses.</p><p>– BisDRIP score: I find the explanation of how this score was calculated rather convoluted. The choice of using the sum of the bisDRIP-score for cumulative anlayses seems questionable. This makes it impossible to compare axes when different number of regions are analyzed. For example 3C vs. 3E. Why not using the average?</p><p>– Validations: because bisDRIP-seq is a new genome-wide technique a high level of confidence in its measurements is required before it can be employed for new discoveries. 1) The authors show significant correlation genome-wide between DRIP-seq (the established technique) and their new bisDRIP-seq, but the correlation is obviously not perfect. Can the authors identify examples in which their new technique and the old technique differ and independently verify that the new mapping is more accurate? 2) To validate DRIP-seq typically RNaseH is used to remove RNA-DNA hybrids and prove the specificity of the signal. I believe this would be a more convincing control than triptolide also for bisDRIP-seq.</p><p>– Boundaries: the authors state that the TSS and the first exon-intron junction form 5' and 3' boundaries for R-loop formation, respectively, yet in several figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>) I see signal above background upstream and downstream of these boundaries. Is this because bisDRIP-seq is not exactly single-base resolution, because of smoothing artifacts, or because these are not hard boundaries? Also, it was reported that restriction enzyme digestion can lead to overrepresentation of ORFs and first exon bias (László Halász et al., Genome Res 2017). It is important that the authors exclude this possibility in their own analyses.</p><p>– Methylcytosines: it seems that the presence of methylated cytosines would make it difficult to detect R-loops in heavily methylated areas of the genome. Is this a problem? It should be discussed.</p><p>– Genes with strong R-loop signals: the authors conclude that not having introns is a reason why some of the genes make in the top 25 list shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> but alternative possibilities should be considered: 1) MALAT1, NEAT1 and histone RNAs are not terminated canonically; has that anything to do with R-loops? 2) What is the relationship between steady state RNA levels and formation of R-loops? GRO-seq measures transcription levels, and a weak correlation is visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but what about total RNA levels? Ribominus RNA-seq to measure steady-state levels of nuclear RNAs might be more suitable for this.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Dumelie et al. develop a new method, Bis-DRIP Seq, to identify the genomic localization of R loops at near-nucleotide resolution. Given the growing interest in understanding the function of R loops, this new method will benefit research in this area. Using this technique authors show that R loops are associated with the promoter regions of genes with or without introns. However, in genes with introns, 1st exon-intron junction defines the boundary of the R loop. We suggest a few minor experiments before publication of this manuscript.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors highlight that BisDRIP-Seq provides more information about R loop boundaries as compared to previous DRIP-Seq datasets. This new method is an extension of the previously established DRIP-Seq and in theory it is understandable why it is an improvement. But since this is a 'methodology paper', the authors must provide comparative evidence that it is better. A figure showing how their dataset compares with a DRIP-Seq dataset will be beneficial.</p><p>2) The authors show that the 1st exon-intron junction serves as the 3' R-loop boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref>) which they suggest might be due RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-B</xref>). To extend the biology a little more, the authors should look at a few genes that are known to have alternative splice forms to test if R loop boundaries show differences in genes that are known to have alternative splicing versus those that do not.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28306.059</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>R-loops are three-stranded structures consisting of a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA.

Still, the reviewer points out that the manuscript would be more compelling if we clearly showed how our method improves upon pre-existing DRIP-seq based techniques. Finally, the reviewer suggests several important experiments that could help us improve readers' confidence in the bisDRIP-seq method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) It is crucial to confirm signals from bisDRIP-seq are indeed R-loop dependent. Simple bisDRIP-seq and DRIP-seq correlation is not sufficient. BisDRIP-seq with in vitro RNase H treatment should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer's suggestion. We therefore performed an RNase H-control bisDRIP-seq experiment as suggested by the reviewer and as detailed below. We then demonstrated that R-loop signal was lost upon RNase H treatment. Additionally, we performed a matched control experiment to show that, absent RNase H, the same experiment with the same input material recapitulates our earlier results.</p><p>The RNase H treatment experiment was performed by repeating the initial bisDRIP-seq steps, including lysing the cells in the presence of bisulfite, degrading proteins with Proteinase K treatment and fragmenting the DNA. RNase I was added to deplete the sample of single-stranded RNAs that could bind the S9.6 antibody (Phillips et at., 2013). After this point, the sample was split into two. One sample received an RNase H treatment. This sample was treated with RNase H both immediately prior to RNA/DNA immunoprecipitation and during the final two wash steps of the immunoprecipitation. The other sample was treated in an identical manner, except that no RNase H was added to the sample. Sequencing libraries were then prepared from both samples using the bisDRIP-seq method.</p><p>After performing this experiment, we compared the RNase H and matched control libraries to the libraries generated by our other bisDRIP-seq experiments. Importantly, we show that the R-loops in the MALAT1, NEAT1, RPPH1 and the histone genes lack signal in the RNase H-treated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><p>To further demonstrate that RNase H depletes metaplot R-loop signal, the revised manuscript now includes metaplots of the bisDRIP-seq signal relative to transcription start sites from the RNase H and matched-control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In our initial manuscript, we observed strand asymmetry in metaplots of bisDRIP-seq scores both 5' and 3' of the transcription start site. This asymmetry was interpreted in our initial manuscript as representing antisense R-loops and sense R-loops, respectively. In our new matched-control bisDRIP-seq experiment, we continue to observe this strand asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Importantly, strand asymmetry is lost in the sample treated with RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This suggests that the observed strand asymmetry near transcription start sites is dependent on R-loops.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion since this important control experiment strengthens our manuscript by validating that the observed bisDRIP-seq strand asymmetry is due to R-loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In bisDRIP-seq, signals not only come from R-loops, but also from promoter single-stranded structures. Therefore it is important to include non-denatured cytosine-uracil-conversions (without S9.6 pull-down) as bisDRIP-seq input.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that sequencing the bisulfite-treated DNA used as input for the RNA-DNA hybrid immunoprecipitation helps ensure that artifacts are not contributing to our results.</p><p>To address this concern, we prepared sequencing libraries from two separate bisDRIP-seq “input” samples. These samples were treated identically to our bisDRIP-seq experiments, except that no bisDRIP-seq immunoprecipitation steps were performed on these samples. We then sequenced these two libraries using the bisDRIP-seq methodology.</p><p>We examined the amount of input bisDRIP-seq signal at individual R-loop forming regions. These regions included the RPPH1 gene, the histone gene loci, MALAT1 and NEAT1 promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In these R-loop forming region, almost no bisDRIP-seq signal was observed in the absence of S9.6 immunoprecipitation. This suggests that there is considerable enrichment of these R-loops by S9.6 immunoprecipitation.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we also used the results of the input bisDRIP-seq experiments to perform background correction. In general, there was very little signal in promoter regions. As a result, the input background correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) did not significantly alter the shape of the metaplot. This result suggests that the high bisDRIP-seq scores observed near transcription start sites requires the S9.6 immunoprecipitation of RNA-DNA hybrids.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this important validation of our method should provide readers with additional confidence in our methodology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Template-strand bisDRIP-seq scores were subtracted from non-template-strand bisDRIP-seq scores to artificially recover R-loop signals. However, no assay was used to prove the validity of such a method.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our manuscript did not sufficiently discuss the basis for using bisDRIP-seq score asymmetry as evidence for the presence of R-loops. We agree that providing additional evidence that R-loops lead to preferential bisDRIP-seq strand asymmetry adds additional clarity to the manuscript.</p><p>We have taken two main steps to address the reviewer's suggestion.</p><p>First, as discussed above, we now specifically show that strand asymmetry is lost when the sample is treated with RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This provides strong validation of our use of strand asymmetry as a measure of R-loop formation.</p><p>Second, we have improved the wording regarding the discussion of the theoretical and experimental basis for using strand asymmetry to map R-loops. Non-denaturing bisulfite mapping of R-loops is one of the best-established methods for mapping R-loops and is used to map R-loops at individual gene loci (Chédin, F., 2016). A critical aspect of this type of R-loop measurement is to show that bisulfite preferentially labels one strand relative to the other strand (Yu et al., 2003). We have included more of this discussion in the Results sections entitled “bisDRIP-seq concept” and “Transcription-dependent R-loops form downstream of transcription start sites” to give readers a better understanding of the historical basis for this approach.</p><p>We hope these changes will provide further assurance to readers that comparing the reactivity of each strand to bisulfite provides a method to predict the location of R-loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since previously reported DRIPc-seq already provides strand-specific, near base-pair resolution (PMID: 27373332), basic comparisons should be performed to test whether bisDRIP-seq outperforms DRIPc-seq in a significantly manner.</p></disp-quote><p>In our initial manuscript, we largely focused on comparing our data to the more established DRIP-seq technique. However, we agree with the reviewer that there is considerable value to comparing our technique to DRIPc-seq. The revised manuscript now has a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) specifically devoted to comparing our results with DRIPc-seq. These results are now discussed in the new section entitled “Comparison of bisDRIP-seq to existing R-loop mapping methods.” Additionally, we have made a number of smaller changes to the paper to highlight how our method advances R-loop mapping relative to existing methods.</p><p>In our new Results section, we discuss why DRIPc-seq, as performed on human cells in (PMID:27373332) by Sanz et al., is not expected to provide near-nucleotide resolution of R-loops. Most significantly, as described by Sanz et al., 2016, the technique is essentially a simple RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) experiment. Thus, both the RNA incorporated in the RNA-DNA hybrid and the surrounding RNA is immunoprecipitated by the S9.6 antibody and sequenced. This should reduce the resolution of DRIPc-seq to the full length of the RNA. The evidence that Sanz et al. provide for the method's improved resolution derives from the fact that they observe smaller peak sizes than they had observed with DRIP-seq. However, the strategy employed by Sanz et al., should theoretically map to the entire RNA and not just the portion of the RNA in an RNA-DNA hybrid. We believe this is important context prior to actually examining the data from each method.</p><p>In order to directly compare our data to the data from DRIPc-seq, we plotted a metaplot of DRIPc-seq signal overlapped with bisDRIP-seq R-loop signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Our map of R-loop formation shows a tight peak of R-loop signal near the transcription start site. By contrast, DRIPc-seq sense-strand signal shows enrichment near transcription start sites but remains high 5 kb downstream of the transcription start site. This is consistent with a model where bisDRIP-seq maps the exact location of R-loops and DRIPc-seq maps the location of the RNAs that are partially incorporated into the R-loop.</p><p>We also compared the bisDRIP-seq R-loop map to the DRIPc-seq map in individual genes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> we observe that both methods map R-loops to similar locations within the MALAT1 gene. However, the R-loop boundary is clearly better demarcated with bisDRIP-seq. Similarly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows that both methods map R-loops to the NEAT1 loci, but the boundary is better demarcated by bisDRIP-seq.</p><p>We also address whether the time at which the R-loop is mapped in the two protocols influences the resolution of R-loop mapping. In bisDRIP-seq, R-loop labeling commences at the cell lysis step since the lysis buffer contains bisulfite. In all other protocols, the location of R-loops is measured by immunoprecipitation several hours or days after cell lysis. It therefore remains possible that R-loops could expand, contract, or disappear ex vivo, which could affect the results of conventional R-loop mapping methods. While this issue is not discussed extensively in the modern literature, it was shown in the 1970s intron-mapping R-loop literature that R-loops can be unstable in solution (Kaback et al., 1979). Thus delaying the measurement of R-loops could allow R-loops to change their structure to be more thermodynamically favorable. Therefore, we performed a bisDRIP-seq protocol in which the bisulfite step is delayed until the second day of the protocol. In this protocol, we observed several examples where the borders of the R-loop were less well demarcated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and in some cases, R-loops could not be detected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). This experiment further highlights the value of bisDRIP-seq, which labels R-loops during cell lysis and is less likely to be affected by ex vivo changes in R-loops than conventional methods.</p><p>In addition to directly comparing our results with DRIPc-seq, we have added new figures that highlight how our method provides results that are unobtainable by DRIPc-seq. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>, we show examples of individual reads that display cytosines conversions on one side of the read, while no conversions are observed on the other side. Each of these reads likely derive from the border of an R-loops. Notably, these reads come from the MALAT1 R-loop-forming region. This type of resolution cannot be achieved using DRIPc-seq since a read can come from any part of the RNA associated with the R-loop: either the portion hybridized to the DNA or the portion of the RNA that is not hybridized to the DNA. Therefore, there is no way of knowing how the read is positioned relative to the R-loop.</p><p>We wish to thank the reviewer for suggesting that we compare our data with the data from DRIPc-seq. We believe that this comparison will help readers better understand how our method is different and, in many ways an improvement to existing methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors describe a new method to map the position of R-loops at higher resolution than existing techniques.

However, we fully agree with the reviewer that we could have provided a less convoluted explanation for how we calculated bisDRIP-seq scores. We have updated our explanation of this technique in the Results section to make it more concise and clear (subsection “Near-Nucleotide Resolution Mapping of R-loops on a Genome-Wide Scale”). We have removed some of the details and moved them to the Materials and methods section, which now contains a more detailed explanation for how we calculated bisDRIP-seq scores. The Materials and methods section entitled “Calculation of raw bisDRIP-seq read scores” has also been edited in an effort to make it easier to understand. We hope these textual changes will assist readers in fully understanding our method.</p><p>The reviewer asks why we used sums rather than averages in the metaplot of genes. We feel that this is a valid concern and recognize that using the cumulative sum of genes' bisDRIP-seq scores makes some comparisons more challenging. To address the reviewer’s concern, we have now added an additional figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>) where mean bisDRIP-seq scores are plotted rather than the cumulative sum. As can be seen, the overall result is very similar when using averages rather than sums. Nevertheless, we hope that this additional figure supplement will allow readers to more directly compare the mean bisDRIP-seq scores in this metaplots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Our main rationale for presenting the cumulative sum of bisDRIP-seq scores in the panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was to show that there is no change in the absolute differences in bisDRIP-seq scores between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and 3E</xref>. This demonstrates to readers that the bisDRIP-seq asymmetry observed in the metaplot of all promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is due exclusively to the active promoters. Outside of that, we believed that the most important aspect of our plots were their shape of the metaplot lines. The shape of the metaplot lines are not affected by whether we use cumulative scores or mean scores, since the transformation is applied evenly to all points (i.e.: the mean at each point is simply the cumulative sum divided by the number of genes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Validations: because bisDRIP-seq is a new genome-wide technique a high level of confidence in its measurements is required before it can be employed for new discoveries. 1) The authors show significant correlation genome-wide between DRIP-seq (the established technique) and their new bisDRIP-seq, but the correlation is obviously not perfect.

It is important that the authors exclude this possibility in their own analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the reviewer's comment. In the original manuscript, we only displayed bisDRIP-seq scores in metaplots. As a result, we did not fully use the benefits of our technique to display the location of R-loop boundaries. We have added new figures that more clearly show the location of the exon-intron boundary, which we believe will address the reviewer's comment regarding R-loop boundaries.</p><p>The reviewer is correct to note that there is R-loop signal 5' of the transcription start site. In regard to this comment, it is important to note that the location of transcription start sites are not well defined. This is because genes do not necessarily have a single site at which they begin transcription. Instead, they often begin transcription at numerous sites within a promoter region (Carninci et al., 2006). We discuss this briefly in subsection “Transcription-dependent R-loops form downstream of transcription start sites”. This uncertainty in the location of the transcription start sites likely contributes to the R-loop signal observed upstream of the transcription start site.</p><p>The reviewer is also correct to note that there is R-loop signal 3' of the first exon-intron junction. In contrast to transcription start sites, exon-intron junctions are well-defined. As such, our method should be able to observe a sharp R-loop boundary in relation to exon-intron junctions. A likely explanation for the observed R-loop signal 3' of the exon-intron junction is our use of bisDRIP-seq scores in our metaplots. Importantly, the bisDRIP-seq scores have read length resolution. In other words, the entire read is assigned a bisDRIP-seq score, even if the read crosses the border of the R-loop. This will reduce the resolution in the metaplots. This was not described clearly enough in the original manuscript, for which we apologize to the reviewer.</p><p>In order to allow readers to see the R-loop boundary at near-nucleotide resolution, we have added a metaplot of cytosine-conversion data. In this metaplot, we examine cytosine-conversion strand-asymmetry relative to the first exon-intron junction. Cytosine-conversion strand-asymmetry is defined as the ratio of the number of conversions on the non-template strand relative to the template strand after background correction. Unlike the bisDRIP-seq score metaplot, this plot should provide near-nucleotide resolution. Indeed, we observe with this plot that the strand asymmetry in cytosine conversions is lost within base pairs of the first exon-intron junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>We hope that this result provides additional clarity to readers regarding the location of the 3' R-loop boundary. Additionally, we believe this plot nicely highlights the capability of bisDRIP-seq to map R-loops at near-nucleotide resolution.</p><p>The reviewer also commented on the first exon bias observed by Halász et al., 2017, in DRIP-seq experiments. Halász et al. found that the sequence composition of first exons is biased so that this region is less likely to be fragmented by the restriction enzymes used in DRIP-seq approaches. As a result, DRIP-seq is biased towards immunoprecipitating first exons. We have added commentary to the Discussion section (first paragraph) regarding this issue. In particular, this first exon bias should result in higher bisDRIP-seq signal on both the template and nontemplate strands of DNA in the first exon. However, this should not lead to strand asymmetry between the signal on either strands of DNA. Since most of our conclusions are derived from strand asymmetry, we do not believe that the conclusions made in this manuscript should be significantly affected by the bias uncovered by Halász et al., 2017. We agree with the reviewer that this discussion is important to include in the manuscript and appreciate the thoughtful advice that they have provided here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Methylcytosines: it seems that the presence of methylated cytosines would make it difficult to detect R-loops in heavily methylated areas of the genome.

We have added discussion regarding this issue to the bisDRIP-seq protocol portion of the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Genes with strong R-loop signals: the authors conclude that not having introns is a reason why some of the genes make in the top 25 list shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> but alternative possibilities should be considered: 1) MALAT1, NEAT1 and histone RNAs are not terminated canonically; has that anything to do with R-loops? 2) What is the relationship between steady state RNA levels and formation of R-loops? GRO-seq measures transcription levels, and a weak correlation is visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, but what about total RNA levels? Ribominus RNA-seq to measure steady-state levels of nuclear RNAs might be more suitable for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the non-canonical transcription termination observed in histone genes, <italic>MALAT1</italic>, <italic>NEAT1</italic> and <italic>RPPH1</italic> may contribute to R-loop formation in these genes. Indeed, we think this a very interesting possibility. We have added additional commentary to the Discussion portion of the manuscript to discuss this possibility.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that steady state levels of RNAs are a potential explanation for genes having high R-loop signal. As suggested by the reviewer we compared R-loop signal to the RNA-seq levels of nuclear RNA from an MCF-7 RNA-seq dataset generated by ENCODE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Perhaps not surprisingly, RNA levels correlate slightly worse with R-loop levels than R-loops had correlated with GRO-seq data. This seems reasonable since R-loops appear to form with newly transcribed RNA. Nonetheless, we believe that adding this comparison makes our manuscript more complete and will address the concerns of many readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Dumelie et al. develop a new method, Bis-DRIP Seq, to identify the genomic localization of R loops at near-nucleotide resolution. Given the growing interest in understanding the function of R loops, this new method will benefit research in this area. Using this technique authors show that R loops are associated with the promoter regions of genes with or without introns. However, in genes with introns, 1st exon-intron junction defines the boundary of the R loop. We suggest a few minor experiments before publication of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer observes that there is “growing interest in understanding the function of R-loops” and they state that bisDRIP-seq “will benefit research in this area.” The reviewer therefore suggests “a few minor experiments before publication of this manuscript.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors highlight that BisDRIP-Seq provides more information about R loop boundaries as compared to previous DRIP-Seq datasets. This new method is an extension of the previously established DRIP-Seq and in theory it is understandable why it is an improvement. But since this is a 'methodology paper', the authors must provide comparative evidence that it is better. A figure showing how their dataset compares with a DRIP-Seq dataset will be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. This was raised by the other reviewers and a detailed description of our new comparisons is provided in our response reviewer #1, point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show that the 1st exon-intron junction serves as the 3' R-loop boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref>) which they suggest might be due RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-B</xref>). To extend the biology a little more, the authors should look at a few genes that are known to have alternative splice forms to test if R loop boundaries show differences in genes that are known to have alternative splicing versus those that do not.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be a very interesting possibility. We were not able to identify genes that have alternative splice forms with clear R-loop signal past the first exon. This may be a result of us not having good annotation of which genes have retained first introns in MCF-7 cells. Another possibility is that the cell may target mRNAs with retained first-introns that form R-loops to be degraded by RNase H. In this model, mRNAs with retained introns that are observable by RNA-seq must have mechanisms to prevent the RNA from forming a long R-loop that would be susceptible to RNase H degradation. We hope that we can better answer the reviewer's question in our future studies of R-loops.</p><p>We would like to thank all of the reviewers for taking the time and effort to provide ideas for enhancing our manuscript.
