We performed intracellular recordings from muscle of both genetic and pharmacologic mouse models of Becker disease to identify the mechanism underlying transient weakness. Our recordings reveal transient depolarizations (plateau potentials) of the membrane potential to −25 to −35 mV in the genetic and pharmacologic models of Becker disease. Both Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents contribute to plateau potentials. Na<sup>+</sup> persistent inward current (NaPIC) through Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 channels is the key trigger of plateau potentials and current through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels contributes to the duration of the plateau. Inhibiting NaPIC with ranolazine prevents the development of plateau potentials and eliminates transient weakness in vivo. These data suggest that targeting NaPIC may be an effective treatment to prevent transient weakness in myotonia congenita.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Myotonia is a neuromuscular condition that causes problems with the relaxation of muscles following voluntary movements. One type of myotonia is Becker disease, also called recessive myotonia congenita. This is a genetic condition that causes muscle stiffness as a result of involuntary muscle activity. Patients may also suffer transient weakness for a few seconds or as long as several minutes after initiating a movement. The cause of these bouts of temporary weakness is still unclear, but there are hints that it could be linked to the muscle losing its excitability, the ability to respond to the stimuli that make it contract. However, this is at odds with findings that show that muscles in Becker disease are hyperexcitable.</p><p>Muscle excitability depends on the presence of different concentrations of charged ions (positively charged sodium, calcium and potassium ions and negatively charged chloride ions) inside and outside of each muscle cells. These different concentrations of ions create an electric potential across the cell membrane, also called the ‘membrane potential’. When a muscle cell gets stimulated, proteins on the cell membrane known as ion channels open. This allows the flow of ions between the inside and the outside of the cell, which causes an electrical current that triggers muscle contraction.</p><p>To better understand the causes behind this muscle weakness, Myers et al. used mice that had either been genetically manipulated or given drugs to mimic Becker disease. By measuring both muscle force and the electrical currents that drive contraction, Myers et al. found that the mechanism underlying post-movement weakness involved a transient change in the concentrations of positively charged ions inside and outside the cells. Further experiments showed that proteins that regulate the passage of both sodium and calcium in and out of the cell – called sodium and calcium channels – contributed to this change in concentration. In addition, Myers et al. discovered that using a drug called ranolazine to stop sodium ions from entering the cell eliminated transient weakness in live mice.</p><p>These findings suggest that in Becker disease, muscles cycle rapidly between being hyperexcited or not able to be excited, and that targeting the flow of sodium ions into the cell could be an effective treatment to prevent transient weakness in myotonia congenita. This study paves the way towards the development of new therapies to treat Becker disease as well as other muscle ion channel diseases with transient weakness such as periodic paralysis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>myotonia</kwd><kwd>sodium channel</kwd><kwd>calcium channel</kwd><kwd>persistent sodium current</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR074985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>Mark M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005202</institution-id><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>602459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>Mark M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P23229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grabner</surname><given-names>Manfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P27392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grabner</surname><given-names>Manfred</given-names></name><name><surname>Dayal</surname><given-names>Anamika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transient weakness in myotonia congenita is caused by depolarization secondary to activation of persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current in skeletal muscle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myotonia congenita is one of the non-dystrophic muscle channelopathies.

Some patients with Becker disease report transient weakness in arm muscles as a greater impediment than muscle stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rüdel et al., 1988</xref>). This weakness can last up to 90 s and is brought on by exertion following rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ricker et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rüdel et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zwarts and van Weerden, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deymeer et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism underlying transient weakness in Becker disease has remained unknown since its initial description close to 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricker and Meinck, 1972</xref>). There appears to be loss of muscle excitability, as weakness is accompanied by a drop in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude during repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricker and Meinck, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aminoff et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deymeer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drost et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Modoni et al., 2011</xref>). This drop in CMAP is associated with reduction in muscle fiber conduction velocity, which has been proposed to progress to depolarization block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zwarts and van Weerden, 1989</xref>). What has remained unclear, and perhaps counterintuitive, is why a loss-of-function mutation of the muscle ClC-1 channels in myotonia congenita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lipicky et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinmeyer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koch et al., 1992</xref>) leads to transient loss of excitability. The primary defect caused by loss of ClC-1 current is hyperexcitability of muscle, which causes myotonia.</p><p>We established that a ClC-1 homozygous null (ClC<sup>adr</sup>) mouse model of Becker disease has transient weakness in vivo, mimicking the condition in human patients. Intracellular recording in both ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle and a pharmacologic model of Becker disease (due to block of ClC-1 with 9-AC) have elucidated a novel phenomenon: transient depolarizations to voltages between −25 and −35 mV, lasting many seconds, which we termed ‘plateau potentials.’ Blocking Na<sup>+</sup> persistent inward current (NaPIC) with ranolazine prevented both development of plateau potentials and transient weakness. We conclude that NaPIC plays a central role in the development of plateau potentials, which are the mechanism underlying transient weakness in Becker disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of transient weakness in mice with myotonia congenita</title><p>To study in vivo isometric motor performance in the <italic>Clcn1</italic><sup>adr-mto2J</sup> (ClC<sup>adr</sup>) mouse model of recessive myotonia congenita (Becker disease), a muscle force preparation that we used previously was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dupont et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Mice were anesthetized via isoflurane inhalation and the distal tendon of the triceps surae (gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus muscles) was dissected free and attached to a force transduction motor; then the sciatic nerve was stimulated with 45 pulses delivered at 100 Hz.

In unaffected littermates, this caused stable force production with a mild, gradual reduction that was likely due to fatigue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In myotonic mice, the same stimulation protocol revealed transient weakness, as force fell over the first 10–15 s and then recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To avoid inclusion of fatigue in measurement of transient weakness, we normalized to force at the end of the 1 min of intermittent stimulation. The plot of the mean normalized force revealed transient weakness, which peaked in severity 15–20 s after the initial stimulation and resolved within 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data indicate that transient weakness is present in ClC<sup>adr</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterization of plateau potentials in genetic and pharmacologic models of myotonia congenita</title><p>In myotonic patients, transient weakness is paralleled by a drop in CMAP amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ricker and Meinck, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Modoni et al., 2011</xref>). This finding suggests that weakness is due to loss of excitability. To look for inexcitability of ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle, intracellular current clamp recordings were performed. In both unaffected littermates and ClC<sup>adr</sup> mice, stimulation with a 200 ms injection of depolarizing current triggered repetitive firing of action potentials during the stimulus. In muscle from unaffected littermates, the firing ceased as soon as the stimulus was terminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In muscle from ClC<sup>adr</sup> mice, there was myotonia (continued firing of action potentials following termination of the stimulus) in 100% of fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The myotonia often persisted for many seconds. While most runs of myotonia ended with repolarization to the resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), in some instances, myotonia terminated with the development of depolarizations lasting 5 to &gt;100 s to a membrane potential near −35 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). During these prolonged depolarizations, there was a gradual repolarization of the membrane to near −45 mV, followed by sudden repolarization back to the resting potential. In some cases, the sudden repolarization was preceded by the development of oscillations in the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The prolonged depolarizations occurred in 30% of ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle fibers (n = 36/119 fibers from 10 mice). Of the 36 fibers with plateau potentials, 26 repolarized to within 4 mV of their initial resting potential.

While the depolarizations we identified could be due to similar mechanisms as those described in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, they seemed more similar to prolonged depolarizations in spinal motor neurons, which can last many seconds, and have been termed plateau potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alaburda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hounsgaard, 2017</xref>). We thus chose the term plateau potentials to describe them.</p><p>To determine whether plateau potentials cause inexcitability, ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle fibers were stimulated during the plateau phase. During and immediately following plateau potentials, action potential generation in response to current injection failed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). At later times following repolarization, action potential generation was again possible. The inexcitability at earlier times following repolarization is likely due to slow inactivation of Na channels following the many-second depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruff, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruff, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rich and Pinter, 2003</xref>). These data are consistent with the possibility that plateau potentials and the resultant inexcitability of muscle are the mechanisms underlying transient weakness in myotonia congenita.</p><p>In ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle, ClC-1 chloride conductance has been absent throughout development such that plateau potentials could be a compensatory response to muscle hyperexcitability. To test this possibility, we acutely blocked ClC-1 chloride channels in muscle from unaffected littermates with 100 µM 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9-AC). This dose of 9-AC blocks more than 95% of ClC-1 chloride channels in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palade and Barchi, 1977</xref>) and has been used to model myotonia congenita both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Lunteren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Desaphy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desaphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skov et al., 2015</xref>).

Following acute block of ClC-1 channels with 9-AC, all plateau potentials terminated with sudden repolarization to within 4 mV of the previous resting potential (49/49 fibers).

There was a strong correlation between the mean membrane potential during the final 500 ms of runs of myotonia and development of plateau potentials. In 22/22 fibers, the mean membrane potential was more depolarized in runs of myotonia that produced plateau potentials (mean = −40.1 ± 3.1 mV vs −49.0 ± 4.5 mV, p=5 × 10<sup>−11</sup>, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggested that a voltage-dependent current might be involved. However, another feature of myotonia that determines whether a plateau potential is triggered is the firing rate, which might correlate with changes such as build-up of K<sup>+</sup> in t-tubules or elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, we examined and found a strong correlation between the firing rate of myotonia runs and subsequent development of plateau potentials: In 21/22 fibers, the mean firing rate was higher for runs of myotonia ending in plateau potentials (mean = 31.2 ± 5.7 Hz vs 23.4 ± 2.9, p=7 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

We thus changed our stimulation protocol to a 2 s train of 3 ms stimulus pulses delivered at 20 Hz. This firing rate and duration of firing mimics the duration and rate of firing during runs of myotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawash et al., 2017</xref>). For trains of stimuli, the amplitude of 3 ms pulses of current were first adjusted to find the lowest current required to elicit an action potential.

Thus, we tested if ranolazine prevented plateau potentials by hyperpolarizing the mean membrane potential prior to the development of plateau potentials. Untreated fibers with additional action potentials and plateau potentials occurring during the 2 s stimulation (myotonia) were excluded from the analysis to ensure that the presence of myotonia or plateau potentials did not account for the difference in mean membrane potential. As all untreated fibers initially had plateau potentials or myotonia during repetitive stimulation, the analysis was not possible. To address this issue, the warm-up phenomenon was induced using 8 Hz 10 s trains, which lessens myotonia due to slow inactivation of Na channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Novak et al., 2015</xref>). It must thus be noted that the untreated muscle was not at baseline but had already undergone some Na channel inactivation. No induction of warm-up was necessary following treatment with ranolazine, as no fibers had myotonia or plateau potentials. In the absence of ranolazine, the mean membrane potential during the 500 ms prior to the plateau potential was −49.6 ± 2.5 mV (n = 5 muscles, 28 fibers). In the presence of 40 µM ranolazine, the mean membrane potential was less depolarized (−56.2 ± 2.9 mV, p&lt;0.05 vs untreated, n = 5 muscles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

We analyzed the contribution of each of these to the hyperpolarization caused by ranolazine. By the 30th action potential of the 20 Hz stimulation, action potential duration had increased to close to 8 ms. This widening of the spike-form was likely due to failure of the membrane potential to fully repolarize between action potentials, given that depolarization has previously been found to cause widening of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Renaud and Light, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yensen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miranda et al., 2017</xref>).

With 20 Hz stimulation, there is an action potential every 50 ms. After taking the mean membrane potential for the 8 ms encompassing the 30th action potential, there remained 42 ms in which there was no action potential.

The reason for the rapid transition between myotonia (hyperexcitability) and plateau potentials (inexcitability) is that both states are caused by depolarization secondary to loss of muscle Cl<sup>-</sup> current. The difference is one of degree: when depolarization is mild, Na<sup>+</sup> channels are not inactivated, such that repetitive firing of action potentials is triggered. When depolarization worsens, Na<sup>+</sup> channels inactivate, such that inexcitability and paralysis ensue. This proposal is similar to the current understanding of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, in which there is often myotonia at the beginning of attacks (during the initial, mild depolarization) and weakness at the height of an attack (when depolarization is maximal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Statland et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Voluntary contraction in myotonia congenita triggers a sequential progression through states of hyperexcitability and inexcitability.</title><p>Shown on the left is a motor unit consisting of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates. At rest, both the motor neuron and muscle fibers are hyperpolarized and muscle is relaxed. To initiate voluntary contraction, the motor neuron fires repeated action potentials, which activate the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to trigger repeated firing of action potentials in muscle (indicated by a yellow outline around the fiber). With the rapid firing of muscle action potentials, there is sustained contraction and force production (blue line). At the end of voluntary contraction, the motor neuron stops firing and the NMJ repolarizes, but in myotonic muscle there is continued involuntary firing of action potentials, which slows relaxation of muscle. When myotonia is terminated by transition into a plateau potential, muscle remains depolarized but cannot fire action potentials (black outline of the fiber), such that muscle is paralyzed. Finally, there is sudden repolarization and return of muscle to the resting state. Under the voltage trace our hypothesis regarding the contribution of NaPIC and current through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels is illustrated. NaPIC begins to turn on at the end of voluntary contraction and triggers myotonia. In some runs of myotonia, NaPIC continues to increase and contributes to initiation of plateau potentials. The initial plateau potential voltage is sufficiently depolarized to trigger opening of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels, which help to sustain plateau potentials. The gradual repolarization during plateau potentials causes Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels to close prior to termination of the potential. Rapid, voltage-dependent closing of Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the NaPIC mode contributes to termination of plateau potentials.

In runs of myotonia that terminated in a plateau potential, the mean membrane potentials averaged to include both action potentials and interspike intervals prior to development of a plateau potential was −40 mV, whereas, within the same fibers, runs of myotonia terminating with repolarization had a mean membrane potential prior to repolarization of −49 mV. The midpoint of the difference between these values is close to −44 mV. In ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle, the mean membrane potential prior to termination of plateau potentials was −46 mV, and in 9-AC treated muscle it was −45 mV. Thus, a mean membrane potential of −44 mV appears to predict both entry into, as well as termination of, plateau potentials.</p><p>Both Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 are voltage-gated channels that could depolarize muscle to potentials achieved during plateau potentials. In spinal motor neurons, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels play a central role in the generation of plateau potentials that last many seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alaburda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hounsgaard, 2017</xref>). Here, we show that the development of plateau potentials was not affected in <italic>nc</italic>DHPR muscle that lack Ca<sup>2+</sup> current through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1. However, there was a reduction in the duration of plateau potentials in <italic>nc</italic>DHPR muscle. These data suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels contributes to sustaining plateau potentials. This was a surprise, as the membrane potential during plateau potentials is more negative than voltages at which there is significant current through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García and Beam, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannister and Beam, 2013</xref>). One explanation is that in intact, mature fibers, prolonged depolarization during plateau potentials allows for activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 at more negative potentials than during the shorter step depolarizations typically used for voltage clamp studies. Our findings suggest that despite Ca<sup>2+</sup> current through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 having no essential role in healthy muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayal et al., 2017</xref>), it may contribute to pathologic depolarization in muscle channelopathies. It is not clear at this point whether the primary role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1 channels in prolonging plateau potentials is a direct effect of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance or whether it is due to effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation on other ion channels.</p><p>Partial block of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels with ranolazine eliminated plateau potentials, suggesting involvement of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4. However, the majority of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channels inactivate within ms (fast-inactivating Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 channels), such that they cannot contribute to prolonged depolarization during plateau potentials. There is a NaPIC in skeletal muscle that appears to arise from modal gating whereby, with very low frequency, any Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 channel may enter the non-inactivating mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Patlak and Ortiz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gage et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawash et al., 2017</xref>). The subset of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 channels in the non-activating mode appears to play a role in the development of plateau potentials.</p><p>Ranolazine has been found to preferentially block NaPIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El-Bizri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahlig et al., 2014</xref>). When myotonic muscle was treated with ranolazine to block NaPIC, depolarization of the mean membrane potential during repetitive firing was decreased and plateau potentials were prevented. An important contributor was lessening of depolarization of the membrane potential during the interspike interval. Previously, the only identified contributor to depolarization of the interspike membrane potential was K<sup>+</sup> build-up in the transverse (t)-tubules (invaginations of the sarcolemma), which depolarizes the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian and Bryant, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrian and Marshall, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wallinga et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fraser et al., 2011</xref>). The finding that block of NaPIC lessens depolarization of the interspike membrane potential suggests that NaPIC is activated during this interval.</p><p>We hypothesize that activation of NaPIC combines with K<sup>+</sup> build-up in t-tubules to depolarize muscle to a mean membrane potential of −44 mV during myotonia, such that a plateau potential is triggered. An additional contributor to this depolarization may be the lessening of inward rectifier potassium channel (Kir) conductance with depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Standen and Stanfield, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Struyk and Cannon, 2008</xref>). It is unclear whether NaPIC, K<sup>+</sup> build-up, and decreased Kir conductance can fully account for depolarization during plateau potentials. Based on the studies of sustained depolarizations (sometimes termed plateau potentials) in neurons, a family of ion channels that might contribute is the transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Phelan et al., 2012</xref>). Members of the TRP ion channel family are expressed in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brinkmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gailly, 2012</xref>), and we recently found that activation of TRPV4 plays a role in triggering percussion myotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupont et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While entry into plateau potentials was often gradual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it could also occur over two to four action potentials (~100–200 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Repolarization occurred over 200–300 ms. While we do not know all the channels involved, we hypothesize one contributor to the instances of rapid onset and termination of plateau potentials is activation and deactivation of NaPIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). NaPIC in muscle can activate and deactivate within 10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gage et al., 1989</xref>). The impression that gating of NaPIC is slow comes from the slow ramp protocols often used to study NaPIC. These protocols enable inactivation of fast Na current such that NaPIC can be studied in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawash et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Ion channels promoting repolarization are likely also involved in the sudden termination of plateau potentials. Oscillations in membrane potential often occurred at the beginning or end of plateau potentials. In motor neurons, oscillations in membrane potential are caused by a balance between two voltage-gated ion channels: one promoting depolarization and one promoting hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sciamanna and Wilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nardelli et al., 2017</xref>). K<sub>v</sub> channels could participate in oscillations occurring during plateau potentials given that K<sub>v</sub> conductance in muscle is large and the channels begin to activate at voltages reached during plateau potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beam and Donaldson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiFranco et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it may be possible to prevent plateau potentials by combining partial block of channels promoting depolarization such as NaPIC with partial opening of channels promoting repolarization such as K<sub>v</sub> channels.</p><p>As an example of how such an approach might work, plateau potentials in 9AC treated muscle were significantly shorter than in ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle. Two factors may explain the difference. The first is that ClC-1 conductance is not completely blocked following application of 100 µM 9-AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palade and Barchi, 1977</xref>). While small, the remaining current through ClC-1 channels promotes repolarization and shortens plateau potentials. The second is that NaPIC current is larger in ClC<sup>adr</sup> muscle compared to wild-type muscle (used for the 9-AC model of myotonia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawash et al., 2017</xref>). The combination of slightly higher ClC-1 conductance and slightly smaller NaPIC likely combine to shorten plateau potentials in the 9-AC model of myotonia. However, despite the shorter duration of plateau potentials in the 9-AC model of myotonia, they were more frequent (92% of fibers vs 30% of fibers). The reason for this difference is not known and raises the possibility that currents not yet identified play a role in development of plateau potentials.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Blocking NaPIC as therapy for transient weakness</title><p>In a mouse model of myotonia congenita, ranolazine prevents both development of plateau potentials in vitro and transient weakness in vivo. In open label trials of ranolazine in both myotonia congenita and paramyotonia congenita, there were statistically significant reductions in the degree of self-reported weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lorusso et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the clinical benefit of blocking Na<sup>+</sup> channels in some diseases with myotonia may result, in part, from prevention of transient weakness secondary to development of plateau potentials. Our data also raises the possibility that blocking of Cav1.1 channels might reduce transient weakness by shortening the duration of plateau potentials. Since blockers of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are used clinically to treat hypertension and have few side effects, a trial of their efficacy in reducing transient weakness may be worthwhile.</p><p>Mutations of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 responsible for hyperkalemic periodic paralysis increase NaPIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannon et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannon and Strittmatter, 1993a</xref>), which appears to play a central role in triggering the depolarization that underlies attacks of transient weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehmann-Horn et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jurkat-Rott et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon, 2015</xref>). This suggests that blocking NaPIC should be effective in treating hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. However, treating patients with Na<sup>+</sup> channel blockers that are effective in treating myotonia, such as mexiletine, was previously found to be ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricker et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ricker et al., 1986</xref>). The finding that blocking NaPIC with ranolazine lessens depolarization of the interspike membrane potential suggests it might be worth considering a trial of this FDA-approved drug’s efficacy in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified currents contributing to plateau potentials that are responsible for transient weakness in recessive myotonia congenita. We also determined that blocking a current contributing to plateau potentials provided effective amelioration of transient weakness. Currents contributing to plateau potentials are present in wild-type muscle; thus, they might contribute to depolarization in other muscle channelopathies with transient weakness, such as hyper- and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Identification of channels involved in generation of plateau potentials in skeletal muscle may thus advance understanding of regulation of excitability in both healthy and diseased muscle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Clcn1<sup>adr-mto</sup></italic>/J (ClC<sup>adr</sup>) mice</td><td>Jackson Labs</td><td>Stock #000939</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>nc</italic>DHPR mice</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dayal et al., 2017</xref> Nat Commun 8:475.</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>9-Anthracene-carboxylic acid (9-AC)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat. #: A4678</td><td>0.1 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>N-benzyl-<italic>p</italic>-toluenesulfonamide (BTS)</td><td>TCI America</td><td>Prod. #: B3082</td><td>0.05 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ranolazine</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat. #: R6152</td><td>0.04 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tetrodotoxin (TTX)</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat. #: 1069</td><td>0.001 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat. #: <break/>D7148</td><td>0.1 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ouabain</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat. #: 03125</td><td>0.01 mM</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Spike2</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ced.co.uk/downloads/latestsoftware">http://ced.co.uk/downloads/latestsoftware</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 8</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MATLAB</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/downloads">https://www.mathworks.com/downloads</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the policies of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wright State University and were conducted in accordance with the United States Public Health Service's Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p><p>The genetic mouse model of myotonia congenita used was <italic>Clcn1<sup>adr-mto</sup></italic>/J (ClC<sup>adr</sup>) mice, which have a homozygous null mutation in the <italic>Clcn1</italic> gene (Jackson Laboratory Stock #000939).

This study provides the most definitive experimental evidence to date for the mechanistic basis of transient weakness in myotonia congenita and also suggests ranolazine may be beneficial for prophylactic management. The results will be of interest to both muscle physiologists and clinicians that treat patients with myotonia congenita and other disorders of muscle hyperexcitability.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The mechanism underlying transient weakness in myotonia congenita&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The manuscript would be strengthened by the authors addressing the following issues.</p><p>1. In Figure 2E, the authors use short depolarizing current injections to monitor changes in membrane resistance during both sustained plateau potentials (PPs) and at the at the resting membrane potential (RMP) during the refractor period. From the representative trace shown in Figure 2E, it appears that the membrane potential becomes progressively more negative and the membrane resistance gradually increases during the PP. Together, these results are consistent with the closing of channels that produce inward/depolarizing current during the PP (e.g. Na/Ca channels), rather than opening of channels that produce an outward current (e.g. K channels). Is a similar pattern observed in other experiments? It would be helpful if the authors could carefully quantify average change in membrane resistance during the PP (or at least compare membrane resistance between early and late PP and during the RMP phase across all fibers). Indeed, such an analysis could provide additional support for the authors' proposed mechanism of termination of the PP.</p><p>2. The authors should speculate on or discuss the change in ion conductance(s) that likely underlie the relatively rapid repolarization to the resting potential observed at the end of the PP.</p><p>3. One observation that is not adequately discussed is the reason for why the PP duration in the acute 9AC model is so much briefer than that observed in the constitutive adr mouse model (e.g. Figure 3B)? This observation suggests, as hinted by the authors, that there are indeed compensatory mechanisms in Adr mice that increase PP duration. As one possibility, sustained NaPIC and/or CaV1.1 currents may be upregulated in Adr mice. In this regard, how does the magnitude of the PP resistance (which likely depends on PP inward currents as discussed above) compare between Adr mice and WT mice treated with 9AC? Is there any evidence for a similar increase in NaPIC and/or Cav1.1 currents in humans with myotonia congenital?</p><p>4. Since the incidence of PPs correlates with firing frequency during myotonia, the authors propose that increases in intracellular calcium could modulate the activity of channels responsible for the PP (lines 179-180). However, it not clear why this could not simply reflect voltage dependent changes in channel activity produced during the myotonia. Alternatively, higher firing rates would produce greater K accumulation and TT depolarization, which could also contribute to the observed correlation between firing frequency and incidence of PPs. In order to support the authors' preferred suggestion for a role of calcium-dependent mechanisms, experiments to more directly test this idea are needed (e.g. effect BAPTA-AM loading on firing rate, membrane resistance and plateau duration).</p><p>5. In Figure 6B, it would be helpful if the authors could also replot the untreated WT force data from Figure 1E as this would allow readers to more directly assess the relative degree of rescue by ranolazine treatment compared to control WT mice.</p><p>6. Unfortunately, force measurements in non-conducting Cav1.1. mice were not performed. Nevertheless, given the observed effect of Cav1.1 conductance on both PP duration and slope of repolarization as shown in Table 2, the authors should at least discuss the potential importance of Cav1.1 conductance in the transient weakness in myotonia congenita in the second to last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>7. The summary figure presented in the Discussion section (Figure 7) should also include information regarding the proposed role of NaPIC and CaV1.1 conductances in PP incidence and duration, respectively, which is the main contribution of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

In some of our early recordings of plateau potentials in ClCadr muscle, the repolarization was not as complete as in our recent recordings. We believe this difference is due to our improved recording techniques. We thus eliminated our early recordings of plateau potentials from the data set used for analyses. We performed new intracellular recordings from ClCadr muscle fibers, which we added to the data set. The criteria for successful return to resting potential was repolarization to within 4 mV of the original resting potential.

Following treatment of WT fibers with 9AC, all plateau potentials ended with repolarization to within 4 mV of the resting potential (49/49 fibers).

We previously compared NaPIC density in ClC-1 null fibers to control fibers and found a higher density in ClC-1 null mice (1.4 ± 0.2 nA/nF vs 0.9 ± 0.2 nA/nF) (Hawash et al., 2017). We have now added this point to a new Discussion section regarding the difference in duration of plateau potentials between ClC-1 null mice and 9-AC treated muscle. The difference in NaPIC in combination with incomplete block of ClC-1 channels with 9-AC likely explains the difference in duration of plateau potentials between the two groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):The data are of high quality, the results are intriguing, and the implications are of high importance to the field.

The response to current injection late in plateau potentials (just prior to repolarization) is clearly not passive as injection of current induces oscillations in membrane potential. It seems likely that one contributor to the oscillations following current injection during the late phase of plateau potentials is voltage dependent modulation of Kv channel conductance. This is now mentioned in the manuscript. Because of this we could not measure input resistance throughout plateau potentials. However, the response to current injection during the early phase of plateau potentials appeared passive, allowing us to measure input resistance. There was a statistically significant reduction in estimated input resistance during the early phase of plateau potentials, strongly suggesting there is a net increase in membrane conductance at that time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
