Previous studies have implicated mammalian eIF2A in GTP-independent binding of Met-tRNAi to the 40S subunit and its recruitment to specialized mRNAs that do not require scanning, and in initiation at non-AUG start codons, when eIF2 function is attenuated by phosphorylation of its α-subunit during stress. The role of eIF2A in translation in vivo is poorly understood however, and it was unknown whether the conserved ortholog in budding yeast can functionally substitute for eIF2. We performed ribosome profiling of a yeast deletion mutant lacking eIF2A and isogenic wild-type (WT) cells in the presence or absence of eIF2α phosphorylation induced by starvation for amino acids isoleucine and valine. Whereas starvation of WT confers changes in translational efficiencies (TEs) of hundreds of mRNAs, the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation conferred no significant TE reductions for any mRNAs in non-starved cells, and it reduced the TEs of only a small number of transcripts in starved cells containing phosphorylated eIF2α. We found no evidence that eliminating eIF2A altered the translation of mRNAs containing putative internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, or harboring uORFs initiated by AUG or near-cognate start codons, in non-starved or starved cells. Thus, very few mRNAs (possibly only one) appear to employ eIF2A for Met-tRNAi recruitment in yeast cells, even when eIF2 function is attenuated by stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>eIF2A</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd><kwd>uORF</kwd><kwd>IRES</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Intramural Research Program, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD001004-32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghobakhlou</surname><given-names>Fardin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eliminating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) from wild-type budding yeast had little impact on translation of individual mRNAs, including those with regulatory upstream open-reading frames, even when canonical initiation factor eIF2 activity was impaired.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic mRNAs are generally translated by the scanning mechanism, which commences with assembly of a 43S preinitiation complex (PIC) containing the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, a ternary complex (TC) of GTP-bound eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and methionyl initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi), along with various other initiation factors. The 43S PIC attaches to the 5′-end of the mRNA, activated by eIF4F bound to the m<sup>7</sup>G cap (comprised of cap-binding protein eIF4E, scaffolding subunit eIF4G, and DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A) and scans the 5′ UTR to identify the AUG start codon, using complementarity with the anticodon of Met-tRNAi to recognize the AUG triplet. The 48S PIC arrested at the start codon joins with the large (60S) subunit to form an 80S initiation complex ready to synthesize the first peptide bond in protein synthesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shirokikh and Preiss, 2018</xref>). A key mechanism for downregulating bulk translation initiation during stress entails phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2, which converts eIF2-GDP from substrate to inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, diminishing TC assembly. Translation of specialized mRNAs encoding certain stress-activated transcription factors regulated by inhibitory upstream open-reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′ UTRs is induced rather than inhibited by eIF2α phosphorylation because the reduction in TC levels allows scanning PICs to bypass the uORF start codons and initiate further downstream at the start codon for the transcription factor coding sequences (CDS). This mechanism, dubbed the Integrated Stress Response in mammals, governs the translational induction of <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA in budding yeast in response to amino acid starvation, dependent on the sole yeast eIF2α kinase, Gcn2. The Gcn4 protein thus induced activates the transcription of multiple genes encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunišová et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dever et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Various studies using cultured mammalian cells have implicated the auxiliary initiation factor eIF2A in translation initiation under stress conditions where eIF2 function is reduced by phosphorylation, in non-canonical initiation events where an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) bypasses the scanning mechanism for selecting AUG codons, or when a near-cognate codon (NCC) rather than AUG serves as initiation site (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komar and Merrick, 2020</xref>). eIF2A was originally characterized as a factor purified from rabbit reticulocytes that could stimulate GTP-independent recruitment of Met-tRNAi to the 40S subunit in response to an AUG codon, but could not stimulate the same reaction on native globin mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1975</xref>). Later studies suggested that the stimulation of Met-tRNAi binding was actually conferred by a protein co-purifying with eIF2A, identified as ligatin/eIF2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dmitriev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Skabkin et al., 2010</xref>), which was subsequently implicated in ribosome recycling at termination codons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dever and Green, 2012</xref>). Experiments in cultured cells suggested that eIF2A could functionally substitute for eIF2 in recruiting Met-tRNAi to the AUG start codons of viral mRNAs, including Sindbis virus 26S mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ventoso et al., 2006</xref>) and HCV mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), which is driven by an IRES, when eIF2α is phosphorylated in the virus-infected cells. Other evidence suggested that eIF2A functionally cooperates with eIF5B in recruiting Met-tRNAi to the 40S-HCV IRES PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), and it was implicated in IRES-dependent translation of c-SRC mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwon et al., 2017</xref>). However, several independent studies did not support a role for eIF2A in initiation on Sindbis or HCV mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jaafar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">González-Almela et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Other lines of evidence implicated mammalian eIF2A in initiation at CUG initiation codons decoded by a leucyl-tRNA versus Met-tRNAi in producing polypeptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Starck et al., 2012</xref>); and in initiation at an upstream CUG codon to produce an N-terminally extended form of PTENα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 2014</xref>). eIF2A was also reported to support non-AUG initiation events involved in translation through an expansion of GGGGGC repeats present in the C9ORF72 gene in neuronal cells exhibiting elevated eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sonobe et al., 2018</xref>). There is additional evidence that eIF2A mediates initiation at UUG- or CUG-initiated uORFs in the 5′ UTR of BiP mRNA that appear to enhance BiP translation when eIF2α phosphorylation is induced by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Starck et al., 2016</xref>). eIF2A has also been implicated in stimulating translation of positive-acting uORFs initiated by CUG or other NCCs during tumor initiation in a manner important for tumor formation in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, eIF2A knock-out mice were found to exhibit reduced longevity, dysregulated lipid metabolism, obesity, decreased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin resistance—all phenotypes of metabolic syndrome—and also decreased lymphocyte production and compromised immune tolerance, implicating eIF2A in several important physiological processes and disease states. The mice lacking eIF2A, however, did not exhibit defects in expression of BiP or a protein (CHOP) upregulated by eIF2α phosphorylation during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). It is unknown whether any of the abnormalities observed in eIF2A-deficient mice result from dysregulated translation, nor whether any of the translational functions ascribed to eIF2A in cultured mammalian cells operate in vivo.</p><p>The amino acid sequence of eIF2A is fairly well conserved between yeast and mammals across the length of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komar and Merrick, 2020</xref>), raising the possibility that it might function in IRES-mediated translation or non-canonical initiation at NCC codons in yeast. Analysis of a yeast mutant lacking the gene encoding eIF2A (<italic>YGR054W</italic>) indicated, as might be expected, that eIF2A did not participate in canonical, cap-dependent translation initiation, having no impact on bulk translation initiation in vivo. Yeast eIF2A was found, however, to co-fractionate with 40S and 80S ribosomes and to interact genetically with canonical initiation factors eIF4E and eIF5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komar et al., 2005</xref>). Surprisingly, analysis of the deletion mutant (referred to below as <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic>) indicated that eIF2A functions to suppress, rather than enhance, non-canonical initiation events that occur independently of scanning, including an IRES identified in the <italic>URE2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Komar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reineke and Merrick, 2009</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komar and Merrick, 2020</xref>). It is unknown whether yeast eIF2A can substitute for eIF2 in Met-tRNAi recruitment under conditions of eIF2α phosphorylation. One piece of evidence arguing against this idea is that the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation did not alter expression of a reporter for the <italic>GCN4</italic> transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>) that, as mentioned above, is induced by eIF2α phosphorylation. As translational control of <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA is highly specialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunišová et al., 2018</xref>), it seemed possible that other yeast mRNAs might utilize eIF2A as an auxiliary factor for Met-tRNAi recruitment to AUG codons, or for initiation at NCCs. In this study, we explored this possibility by conducting ribosome profiling of an <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant in the presence or absence of increased phosphorylation of eIF2α induced by amino acid limitation. Our results do not support the possibility that eIF2A frequently substitutes for eIF2 or participates in non-canonical initiation events, even under stress conditions of attenuated eIF2 function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Eliminating yeast eIF2A has little impact on translational reprogramming conferred by phosphorylation of eIF2α in cells starved for amino acids</title><p>To examine whether eIF2A provides an eIF2-independent initiation mechanism for any yeast mRNAs, we first examined bulk polysome formation in a yeast mutant lacking the gene <italic>YGR054W</italic> encoding eIF2A (denoted <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> below) and an isogenic wild-type strain (WT), both grown in nutrient-replete medium (SC) or under conditions of isoleucine/valine starvation, imposed by the drug sulfometuron methyl (SM), to induce eIF2α phosphorylation by Gcn2 and thereby reduce TC levels. We reasoned that if eIF2A can substitute for eIF2 to maintain translation initiation of a sizeable fraction of mRNAs when eIF2 function is reduced, then we might observe a depletion of polysomes in the SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant compared to SM-treated WT cells. As we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>), SM treatment of WT evoked a small reduction in the ratio of polysomes to monosomes (P/M), indicating a diminished rate of bulk translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A(i) and (iii)</xref>). Essentially identical P/M ratios were observed in the corresponding untreated and SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A(ii) and (iv)</xref>), suggesting that eIF2A does not function broadly to compensate for reduced eIF2 function in the yeast translatome.

Ribosome profiling entails deep-sequencing of 80S ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs, or ribosome footprints) in parallel with total RNA. The ratio of sequencing reads of RPFs summed over the CDS to the total mRNA reads for the corresponding transcript provides a measure of translational efficiency (TE) for each mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>). Owing to normalization for total read number in each library, the RPF and mRNA reads and the calculated TEs are determined relative to the average values for each strain. The RPF and RNA read counts between biological replicates for each strain and condition were highly reproducible (Pearson’s r ≈ 0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>).</p><p>To establish that SM treatment induced comparable levels of eIF2α phosphorylation in both the WT and <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant, we examined the ribosome profiling data for <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA, whose translation is induced by phosphorylated eIF2α by the specialized ‘delayed reinitiation’ mechanism imposed by the four uORFs in its transcript. Translation of the 5′-proximal uORFs (uORF1 and uORF2) gives rise to 40S subunits that escape recycling at these uORF stop codons and resume scanning downstream. At high TC levels, they quickly rebind TC and reinitiate at uORFs 3 or 4 and are efficiently recycled from the mRNA following their translation. When TC levels are reduced by eIF2α phosphorylation, a fraction of scanning 40S subunits fails to rebind TC until after bypassing uORFs 3–4, and then rebind the TC in time to reinitiate at the <italic>GCN4</italic> CDS, inducing <italic>GCN4</italic> translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gunišová et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Ribosome profiling revealed the expected strong induction of <italic>GCN4</italic> translation evoked by SM treatment of WT cells, as revealed by greatly increased RPFs in the CDS with little or no change in <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA reads, yielding an increase in TE (ΔTE) of ~40-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, WT+SM versus WT, cf. replicate cultures _a and _b for RPFs and RNA reads).

These data argue against the possibility that eIF2A contributes to recruitment of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> as an alternative to the TC by 40S subunits scanning downstream from <italic>GCN4</italic> uORFs 1–2. If this was the case, then the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation would impose a further delay in rebinding Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to the 40S subunits re-scanning downstream from uORFs 1–2 and thereby increase the proportion that bypass uORFs 3–4 when TCs are limiting, derepressing <italic>GCN4</italic> translation in SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus WT cells. The highly similar induction of <italic>GCN4</italic> translation in the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) argues against such a role for eIF2A in recruiting Met-tRNAi to 40S subunits scanning the <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA leader. These findings are in agreement with measurements of <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> reporter expression in SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus WT cells; although the induction by SM was quite modest in that study, and an auxiliary role for eIF2A might have gone undetected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We turned next to the question of whether eliminating eIF2A alters the translation of any other yeast mRNAs, reasoning that mRNAs able to utilize eIF2A in place of TC for recruitment of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> would exhibit greater TE reductions evoked by SM in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant versus WT cells. If such mRNAs could be translated efficiently utilizing TC alone, then they would require eIF2A conditionally, that is, only when eIF2 function is reduced during starvation. If instead such mRNAs rely primarily on eIF2A for efficient initiation regardless of TC levels, they would exhibit reduced TEs in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus WT cells in the absence of SM treatment. Importantly, DESeq2 analysis of the ribosome profiling data obtained for the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant and WT strains cultured in the absence of SM revealed no significant TE reductions in the mutant, as no mRNAs exhibited TE<italic><sub>eIF2AΔ</sub></italic>/TE<sub>WT</sub> ratios &lt; 1 at a false discovery rate (FDR &lt; 0.25) that is appropriate for two highly correlated biological replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamarre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Previously, we presented evidence that many of these TE changes conform to a pattern in which mRNAs that are efficiently translated in untreated WT cells tend to exhibit increased relative TEs, whereas poorly translated mRNAs tend to show reduced relative TEs, when phosphorylation of eIF2α is induced by SM. This same pattern was evident under two other conditions in which 43S PIC assembly is reduced, impaired recycling of 40S subunits from post-termination complexes at stop codons and depletion of an essential 40S ribosomal protein. We proposed that this stereotypical reprogramming of translation arises from increased competition among mRNAs for limiting PICs wherein strongly translated mRNAs outcompete weakly translated mRNAs to skew TE increases towards ‘strong’ mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). SM treatment of the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant also produced a broad reprogramming of TEs involving hundreds of mRNAs translated relatively better or worse on SM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Comparing the TE changes conferred by SM in WT versus <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> cells for the mRNAs showing TE changes in WT revealed that the majority of transcripts showed TE changes in the same direction on SM treatment of WT and <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, the majority of mRNAs dysregulated in the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant also showed TE changes in the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and a very strong positive correlation exists, with a coefficient of 0.91, between the TE changes conferred by SM in the two strains. Thus, elimination of eIF2A did not substantially alter the global reprogramming of translation produced by phosphorylation of eIF2α.</p><p>If certain mRNAs depend more heavily on eIF2A for Met-tRNAi recruitment when eIF2α is phosphorylated, we might expect to observe additive reductions in TE when combining elimination of eIF2A by the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation with inhibition of eIF2 by SM treatment. Interrogating the large group of 879 mRNAs that showed TE reductions on SM treatment of WT cells revealed that they show a relatively smaller, not larger, decrease in median TE on SM treatment of the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant versus SM treatment of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, column 12 versus column 9). Consistent with this finding, most of these mRNAs exhibit a small increase in TE on comparing SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> to SM-treated WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, column 11). (In these and all other box plots, when the notches of different boxes do not overlap, their median values are judged to differ significantly with a 95% confidence level.

These results suggest that the majority of mRNAs whose translation is diminished by eIF2α phosphorylation in WT cells do not utilize eIF2A for a back-up initiation mechanism that would mitigate their TE reductions when eIF2 is impaired. Our finding that most mRNAs exhibit somewhat greater TEs in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus WT cells when both are treated with SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, column 11) might indicate that eIF2A generally acts to repress the translation of these mRNAs rather than augmenting eIF2 function in Met-tRNAi recruitment. This would not be the case in the absence of SM, however, as the results in column 10 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> suggest a small positive effect of eIF2A on translation of these mRNAs in non-starved cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Only a few mRNAs exhibit translational reprogramming consistent with eIF2A functioning as a back-up to eIF2</title><p>To determine whether there are any individual mRNAs that show greater TE reductions in response to SM treatment when eIF2A is absent, we conducted DESeq2 analysis of the TE changes in SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus SM-treated WT cells.

The fact that the median TE of these mRNAs increases rather than decreases on SM treatment of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, column 3) might be explained by proposing that their ability to rely on eIF2A provides them with a competitive advantage with mRNAs that depend solely on eIF2 when the latter is impaired by phosphorylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Examination of a small group of mRNAs showing evidence of a conditional requirement for eIF2A when eIF2 is impaired.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> showing the log<sub>2</sub> ratios of translational efficiencies (TEs) in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> cells treated with sulfometuron methyl (SM) versus wild-type (WT) cells treated with SM (log<sub>2</sub>∆TE<italic><sub>eIF2A∆</sub></italic><sub>+SM/WT+SM</sub> values) for the 5482 mRNAs with evidence of translation.

Recently, groups of 557 mRNAs containing AUG-initiated uORFs and 191 mRNAs with NCC-uORFs were identified in which the uORFs were shown to influence translation of downstream CDSs by massively parallel analysis of reporters containing the native 5′ UTRs in comparison to mutant reporters lacking the uORF start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">May et al., 2023</xref>). It was reported that among the 407 mRNAs containing a single functional AUG-uORF wherein mutating the uORF significantly altered reporter expression by &gt;1.5-fold, all but 13 of the uORFs functioned to inhibit reporter expression. Among the 144 mRNAs containing a single functional NCC-uORF, only 13 of the uORFs influenced reporter expression either positively or negatively by &gt;1.5-fold, reflecting the weaker effects of NCC- versus AUG-initiated uORFs on downstream translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">May et al., 2023</xref>). Our analysis of the 394 mRNAs containing a single inhibitory AUG-uORF—the only group large enough for statistical analysis of TE changes—revealed little or no change in median TE in response to SM treatment or to the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation in the presence or absence of SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A(iii)</xref>, columns, 4–6 versus 1–3). These findings suggest that eIF2A has a minimal role in determining whether functional inhibitory AUG-initiated uORFs are translated or bypassed by scanning ribosomes in the presence or absence of eIF2α phosphorylation. These results support our findings above that the majority of mRNAs containing translated uORFs show little response to either eIF2α phosphorylation, the elimination of eIF2A, or a combination of both perturbations.</p><p>We probed more deeply into the three sets of uORF-containing mRNAs mentioned above by examining the subsets of each group that exhibit &gt;1.41-fold increases in TE in response to SM treatment of WT cells, making them novel candidates for mRNAs controlled by inhibitory uORFs that can be overcome by eIF2α phosphorylation. These uORF-containing mRNAs exhibit median TE increases of approximately two-fold on SM treatment of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B(i)–(iii)</xref>, maroon data), similar to the findings above for <italic>CPA1</italic> and <italic>CAD1</italic> mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Unlike the larger groups of uORF-containing mRNAs from which they derive (analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A(i)–(iii)</xref>), these subsets showing appreciable TE induction by SM exhibit slightly reduced median TEs in response to the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation in SM-treated, but not untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B(i)–(iii)</xref>, green versus orange data). One way to explain these findings would be to hypothesize that these mRNAs generally contain a positive-acting uORF that functions to overcome the translational barrier imposed by a second inhibitory uORF located further downstream in response to eIF2α phosphorylation, in the manner established for the positive-acting uORF1 in <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA, accounting for their increased TE conferred by SM treatment of WT cells. The TE reductions conferred by <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> exclusively in SM-treated cells would then arise from loss of eIF2A-dependent translation of the stimulatory upstream uORFs in these transcripts required for scanning ribosomes to bypass the downstream inhibitory uORFs when eIF2α is phosphorylated.</p><p>To explore this hypothesis further, we focused on the uORF-containing mRNAs that are the most dependent on eIF2A for their translation in SM-treated cells, showing a &gt;1.41-fold reduction in TE in SM-treated <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus SM-treated WT cells. Examining all such mRNAs containing either (i) annotated or conserved AUG-uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C(i)</xref>), (ii) annotated or conserved NCC-uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(ii)</xref>), or (iii) functional inhibitory AUG-uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C(iii)</xref>) revealed that all three groups show TE reductions in response to the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation only in the presence of SM (green versus orange data) and, except for the NCC-uORF mRNAs, also show TE increases in response to SM in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C(i)–(iii)</xref>, maroon data), generally supporting the aforementioned hypothesis. This is the same pattern we observed for all of the uORF-containing mRNAs showing appreciable TE increases on SM treatment of WT cells just described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B(i)–(iii)</xref>). Moreover, this pattern of TE changes was observed above for the group of 32 mRNAs showing highly significant TE reductions conferred by <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> in SM-treated cells versus SM treatment of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); although, as discussed above, only 17 of those transcripts conform to this pattern of TE changes (blue in column 4 but nearly white in column 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; dubbed ∆TE<italic><sub>eIF2AΔ</sub></italic><sub>+SM/WT+SM_down*</sub>).

Thus, we could not find compelling evidence that conditional dependence on eIF2A for efficient translation in SM-treated cells is conferred by positive-acting regulatory uORFs.</p><p>As an orthogonal approach to detecting a role for eIF2A in regulating the translation of negative-acting uORFs, we reasoned that decreased translation of inhibitory uORFs in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> cells would increase the translation of downstream CDSs, leading to a decrease in the ratio of RPFs in uORFs relative to RPFs in the CDSs, which we termed relative ribosome occupancy (RRO). To examine this possibility, we employed DESeq2 to identify statistically significant changes in RRO values for the same groups of mRNAs analyzed above in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref> containing annotated or conserved uORFs with either AUG- or NCC-start sites, and which also showed evidence of translation in both WT and <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> cells. We found that no mRNAs exhibited significant changes in RRO in the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant versus WT in the absence or presence SM, even at a relatively non-stringent FDR of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Furthermore, the groups of mRNAs with annotated or conserved AUG- or NCC-initiated uORFs showed little or no difference in median RRO in the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant versus WT cells in the absence or presence of SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>, yellow versus blue data). At least for the annotated uORFs, the median RRO values are generally higher for mRNAs containing AUG-initiated versus NCC-initiated uORFs in the presence or absence of SM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E and G</xref>, blue data), as would be expected from more efficient initiation at AUG versus NCC start codons. Thus, our results provide no compelling evidence that eIF2A frequently enhances initiation at negative-acting uORFs initiated by either AUG or NCC start codons in either starved or non-starved cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>eIF2A does not affect decoding rates at particular codon combinations during translation elongation</title><p>Translation elongation factor eIF5A acts broadly to stimulate the rates of decoding and termination, but is particularly important for certain combinations of codons, which include stretches of proline codons and various three-codon combinations of Proline (Pro), aspartic acid (Asp), and glyine (Gly) codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>). Slower decoding rates for these codon combinations were detected by ribosome profiling of yeast cells depleted of eIF5A by computing pause scores for all ~8000 three-amino acid motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schuller et al., 2017</xref>). The pause score for each motif is calculated from its 80S occupancy relative to the surrounding stretch of CDS and averaged across the translatome. Analyzing our profiling data revealed no significant increase in pause scores for any tripeptide motif in the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant versus WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As a positive control for the analysis, we examined our data on WT cells treated or untreated with SM, observing a marked increase in pause scores for all tripeptide motifs with valine (Val) in the third position, placing the corresponding Val codons in the A-site of the decoding ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Increased pausing at these motifs is expected from reduced levels of charged valyl-tRNA on inhibition of valine biosynthesis by SM and attendant slower decoding of all Val codons. It is unclear why increased pausing is not found at codons for isoleucine as SM inhibits an enzyme common to the Ile and Val biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jia et al., 2000</xref>); however, we note that flux through these pathways is differentially regulated and that the Val and leucine pathways compete for a common precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones and Fink, 1982</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that eIF2A plays no major role in stimulating translation elongation through particular tripeptide motifs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>eIF2A plays no major role in stimulating translation elongation for particular tripeptide motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scatterplot of average pause scores for 8006 tripeptide motifs, comparing the two biological replicates of ribosome profiling data for <italic>eIF2A∆</italic> versus wild-type (WT) cells.

These findings suggested that eIF2A might function as a positive regulator of de novo purine biosynthesis, such that the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation would mimic <italic>adeΔ</italic> mutations in reducing growth in combination with the <italic>hpt1Δ</italic> and <italic>fcy2Δ</italic> mutations as a result of simultaneously impairing both the de novo and salvage pathways for adenine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). To test this possibility, we generated the <italic>fcy2ΔeIF2AΔ</italic> double mutant and tested it for growth on synthetic minimal (SD) or synthetic complete (SC) medium supplemented with varying concentrations of adenine. Contrary to expectations, we failed to detect any reduction in growth in the double mutant versus either single mutant or the WT strain in the presence or absence of adenine supplements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We also interrogated our ribosome profiling data to examine the effects of the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation on expression of the 17 yeast genes encoding proteins involved in de novo synthesis of inosine, adenine, or guanine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier, 2012</xref>). The <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation conferred no significant reductions in the RPFs, mRNA levels, or TEs of any of 17 genes in non-starvation conditions. Moreover, assaying <italic>lacZ</italic> reporters for two such genes, <italic>IMD2</italic> and <italic>IMD3,</italic> in cells cultured under the conditions of our ribosome profiling experiments revealed no significant reductions in expression conferred by elimination of eIF2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Our findings do not support the possibility that eIF2A promotes expression of the biosynthetic genes for de novo purine biosynthesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The mammalian eIF2A protein has been implicated in substituting for eIF2 in recruiting Met-tRNAi to certain viral mRNAs that do not require ribosomal scanning for AUG selection under conditions where eIF2α is being phosphorylated and TC assembly is impaired in virus-infected cells. Other studies have identified a role for eIF2A in initiation at near-cognate initiation codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Komar and Merrick, 2020</xref>). As the yeast and mammalian eIF2A proteins show considerable sequence similarity, we looked for evidence that the yeast protein could provide a back-up mechanism for Met-tRNAi recruitment when eIF2α has been phosphorylated by Gcn2 in cells starved for isoleucine and valine using the antimetabolite SM. At an SM concentration adequate to reduce bulk polysome assembly and strongly derepress translation of <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA in WT cells, neither response was detectably altered by the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation. Ribosome profiling revealed a broad reprogramming of translational efficiencies conferred by SM treatment of WT cells, noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>), wherein efficiently translated mRNAs tend to show increased relative TEs at the expense of poorly translated mRNAs, which also appeared to be essentially intact in cells lacking eIF2A. Interrogating the TE changes of individual mRNAs, we found only three in the entire translatome that were significantly altered in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus WT cells in the absence of SM, with all three showing higher, not lower, TEs in the mutant. Thus, we failed to identify even a single mRNA among the 5340 transcripts with evidence of translation that is dependent on eIF2A for efficient translation in non-stressed cells containing normal levels of TC assembly. Under conditions of SM treatment, we identified 32 mRNAs showing significantly reduced TEs in <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> versus WT cells, consistent with the possibility that they require eIF2A for Met-tRNAi recruitment only when TC assembly is diminished by eIF2α phosphorylation. However, only 17 of these transcripts showed a pattern of TE changes fully consistent with a conditional requirement for eIF2A under conditions of reduced eIF2 function, exhibiting greater TE decreases when both eIF2 function was impaired by phosphorylation and eIF2A was eliminated from cells. Moreover, we could validate this conditional eIF2A dependence by <italic>LUC</italic> reporter analysis and by measuring TE changes of native mRNAs by polysome profiling for only a single mRNA, <italic>HKR1</italic>. A possible limitation of our <italic>LUC</italic> reporter analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> was the lack of 3′ UTR sequences of the cognate genes, which might be required to observe eIF2A dependence. Given that native mRNAs were examined in the orthogonal assay of polysome profiling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the positive results obtained there for <italic>SAG1</italic> and <italic>SVL3</italic> in addition to <italic>HKR1</italic> should be given greater weight. Nevertheless, our findings indicate a very limited role of yeast eIF2A in providing a back-up mechanism for Met-tRNAi recruitment when eIF2 function is diminished by phosphorylation of its α-subunit.</p><p>We also looked intensively at groups of mRNAs containing uORFs to determine if eIF2A might promote uORF translation and thereby influence translation of the downstream CDSs. As observed for <italic>GCN4</italic> mRNA, eliminating eIF2A had no effect on the TEs of <italic>CPA1</italic> and <italic>CAD1</italic> mRNAs, which contain single inhibitory uORFs that appear to be suppressed by eIF2α phosphorylation. We interrogated three different compilations of yeast mRNAs containing translated uORFs containing AUG or NCC start codons, including those with functional evidence of controlling translation of the downstream CDSs or showing evolutionary sequence conservation and, once again, found little evidence for a significant role of eIF2A in either increasing or decreasing the TEs of such transcripts. It remains to be seen if there are any uORFs in yeast mRNAs that depend on eIF2A for their translation. We also found no evidence indicating that eIF2A inhibits utilization of IRES elements identified previously in <italic>URE2, PAB1,</italic> and <italic>GIC1</italic> mRNAs; although, our results could be explained if the IRESs make only small contributions to the overall translation of these mRNAs. Finally, we found no evidence that eIF2A affects the rate of decoding of any particular tripeptide motifs in the elongation phase of protein synthesis.</p><p>The lack of evidence in our study for eIF2A function in translation initiation stands in contrast to findings of negative genetic interactions between the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> and mutations in yeast eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komar et al., 2005</xref>) and eIF5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>) wherein combining the mutations conferred a more severe cell growth defect. Synthetic negative interactions between <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> and deletions of each of the two genes encoding eIF4A (<italic>TIF1</italic> and <italic>TIF2</italic>) were also reported in a global analysis of synthetic phenotypes observed in double mutants that combine deletions or point mutations in ~90% of all yeast genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Leeuwen et al., 2016</xref>), compiled at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/">https://thecellmap.org/costanzo2016/</ext-link>. One possibility is that eIF2A is functionally redundant with these initiation factors rather than with eIF2. Another is that eliminating eIF2A affects a different cellular process and that expression of one or more genes involved in that process is diminished by mutations in eIF4E, –4A, and –5B.</p><p>A recent study indicated that human recombinant eIF2A inhibits translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) of all mRNAs tested, including one driven by the cricket paralysis virus IGR IRES that requires no canonical initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2023</xref>). Because the protein binds to 40S subunits and the addition of excess 40S subunits to RRL mitigates its inhibitory effect, it was concluded that human eIF2A sequestered 40S subunits in an inactive complex. While this finding is consistent with the conclusion that yeast eIF2A represses IRES-driven translation in yeast, the finding that <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> does not increase bulk translation or impact yeast cell growth obtained here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoll et al., 2002</xref>) suggests that eIF2A does not appreciably sequester 40S ribosomes in yeast cells, even in stress conditions of eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The similar finding that knocking out the eIF2A gene had no detectable effect on bulk translation in keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sendoel et al., 2017</xref>) led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2023</xref> to surmise that mammalian eIF2A is not normally present in the cytoplasm and would have to be released from a different cellular compartment to impact translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The profile of genetic interactions observed for the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutation in the aforementioned global analysis of synthetic phenotypes was found to resemble that of an <italic>ade1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Leeuwen et al., 2016</xref>), lacking an enzyme of de novo biosynthesis of AMP and GMP, which suggested that eIF2A might be a positive effector of purine biosynthesis. However, we could not confirm the reported negative genetic interaction between the <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> and <italic>fcy2Δ</italic> mutations, and our ribosome profiling data revealed no effect of <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> on the RPF or mRNA abundance of the 17 genes involved in de novo purine biosynthesis.</p><p>It is surprising that we found so little evidence that eIF2A functions in the yeast translatome even when the activity of the canonical factor eIF2 is attenuated by amino acid starvation. It is possible that eIF2A plays a more important role in translation in some other stress condition, for example, one in which it is released into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grove et al., 2023</xref>) or when eIF4E or eIF5B function is attenuated, or that it functions in a different cellular process altogether in budding yeast. eIF2A may have acquired a new role in controlling translation initiation during mammalian evolution, or it could have lost its function in translation and acquired a different one during fungal evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strain and plasmid construction</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

libraries</title><p>Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analyses were carried out in parallel on strains BY4742 (WT) and F2247 (<italic>eIF2AΔ</italic>), with two biological replicates for each strain, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, both strains were grown at 30°C in SC until reaching log phase at A<sub>600</sub> = 0.5–0.6 for untreated cells, or to A<sub>600</sub> = 0.5–0.6 in SC lacking isoleucine and valine (SC-Ile/Val) and treated with SM at 1 µg/mL for 25 min for SM-treated cells. Cells were harvested by high-speed vacuum filtration and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell lysis was performed using a freezer mill in the presence of lysis buffer containing 500 μg/mL of cyclohexamide, and RPFs were prepared by digesting cell lysates with RNase I. The 80S monosomes were resolved by sedimentation through a 10–50% sucrose gradient. The RPFs were purified from the monosomes using hot phenol-chloroform extraction. After size selection and dephosphorylation steps, a Universal miRNA cloning linker was attached to the 3' ends of the footprints. This was followed by reverse transcription, circular ligation, rRNA subtraction, PCR amplification of the cDNA library, and DNA sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq system at the NHLBI DNA Sequencing and Genomics Core at NIH (Bethesda, MD).</p><p>For RNA-seq library preparation, total RNA was extracted and purified from aliquots of the same snapped-frozen cells lysates described above using hot phenol-chloroform extraction. Then, 5 µg of randomly fragmented total RNA was used for library generation and sequencing, similar to the steps mentioned above except that the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina; MRZ11124C) was employed to remove rRNA after linker-ligation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Differential gene expression and uORF translation analysis of ribosome profiling data</title><p>Processing and analysis of sequence libraries of RPFs or total mRNA fragments, including Wiggle track normalization to the total number of mapped reads for viewing RPF or RNA reads in the IGV browser, were conducted exactly as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, sequencing reads were trimmed and noncoding RNA sequences were eliminated by aligning trimmed FASTA sequences to the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ribosomal database using Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>). The remaining reads were mapped to the yeast genome using TopHat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>), and DESeq2 was used for statistical analysis of mRNA reads, RPFs, and TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

DESeq2 was employed to conduct statistical analysis on changes in RRO values between the two biological replicates of different genotypes. uORFs with mean RPF counts below 2 or mean CDS RPF counts below 32 in the combined samples (two replicates each) were excluded from the analysis. The compilations of annotated translated uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Marcos et al., 2017</xref>), evolutionarily conserved translated uORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spealman et al., 2018</xref>), or functional uORFs whose elimination by start codon mutation conferred a consistent and statistically significant alteration in translation of the downstream GFP CDSs in reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">May et al., 2023</xref>) were all published previously and are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata5 fig6sdata6 fig6sdata7">Figure 6—source data 5–7</xref>.</p><p>Tripeptide pause scores were computed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meydan et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, this involved dividing the 80S reads per million (rpm) of a three-amino acid motif by the average rpm in the surrounding region (± 50 nt around each motif). Sites smaller than the ± 50 nt window were excluded from the analysis. To generate average pause scores, we calculated the mean of individual pause scores for each tripeptide motif across the translatome. Motifs represented in the genome less than 100 times were excluded to reduce noise in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Yeast biochemical methods</title><p>β-Galactosidase activities were assayed in WCEs using a modified version of a protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moehle and Hinnebusch, 1991</xref>) in which the cleavage of ONPG was determined manually after a 30 min incubation with the WCE. Expression of luciferase was assayed in WCEs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaikwad et al., 2021</xref>) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the supplier’s protocol, and luciferase activities were normalized to total protein levels in the WCEs determined using the Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Polysome profile analysis and measurement of TEs of individual mRNAs</title><p>To conduct bulk polysome profiling, cells were cultured as described in the figure legends, harvested by centrifugation, and WCEs were prepared by vortexing cell pellets, applying eight cycles of vortexing for 30 s followed by incubation on ice for 30 s, using two volumes of glass beads in ice-cold 1× breaking buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 200 μg/mL heparin, 50 μg/mL cycloheximide, and 1 cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail Tablet (Roche)/50 mL buffer). Fifteen A<sub>260</sub> units of WCEs were layered on a pre-chilled 10–50% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 2 hr at 4°C in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman). Gradient fractions were continuously scanned at A<sub>260</sub> using the BioComp Gradient Station, and polysome to monosome (P/M) ratios were calculated using ImageJ software for at least two biological replicates.</p><p>To determine polysome association of individual mRNAs and calculate their TEs, 20 A<sub>260</sub> units of WCEs from each of three replicate cultures were sedimented through a 10–50% sucrose gradient by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2.4 hr and the gradient fractions were scanned at A<sub>260</sub> nm. The fractions containing 80S monosomes or different polysomal species (2-mers, 3-mers, etc.) were collected using ‘the advanced fraction’ function of the BioComp fractionator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). RNA was extracted from 1/5th of the total volume of input WCEs and from 300 µL of each set of pooled fractions containing 80S or different polysomal species using QIAzol lysis Reagent (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription (RT) was done using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix (Invitrogen) with random hexamers, using 5 μg of RNA for each reverse transcription (RT) reaction. Transcript levels were quantified by qPCR using the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Agilent Technologies) on a Roche LightCycler 96 Instrument. Primers listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> were used to measure the individual mRNAs and 18S rRNA. The absolute mRNA/18S rRNA levels were calculated using the 2<sup>-CT</sup> method and corrected to account for differences in the proportions of the pooled fractions from which RNA was isolated by multiplying by a factor calculated by dividing the total fraction volume (in µL) by 300 µL. They were further corrected to account for differences in the proportion of the total RNA employed for RT by multiplying by a factor calculated as 25 µL (the total volume of extracted mRNA) divided by the volume of the pooled fraction (in µL) containing 5 µg of RNA. To account for potential losses during RNA extraction, RNA recovery normalization factors were calculated for each fraction by determining the proportion of total A<sub>260</sub> units across all gradient fractions that is present in each set of pooled fraction (calculated from the A<sub>260</sub> trace obtained during gradient fractionation) and dividing the results by the proportion of total 18S rRNA across the gradient found in the corresponding pooled fraction. A second normalization factor was calculated to correct for losses in recovery of monosomes/polysomes in the gradient separations of fixed amounts of input WCEs by calculating the total A<sub>260</sub> units found in monosomes/polysomes for each gradient, determining the mean value for all of the gradients/samples analyzed in parallel, and dividing the mean value by the value determined for each gradient. (This correction assumes that WT and <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> cells have the same total amounts of monosomes/polysomes per A<sub>260</sub> of WCE, as indicated by our repeated polysome profiling of biological replicates depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The absolute amounts of mRNAs measured in each pooled fraction were multiplied by both normalization factors to obtain the normalized mRNA levels for each pooled fraction, which was multiplied by the number of ribosomes per mRNA in that pooled fraction (i.e., one for monosomes, two for 2-mer polysomes, etc.) and summed across the gradient fractions to calculate the total number of ribosomes translating the mRNA. To calculate TEs, this last quantity was divided by amount of input mRNA measured in the starting WCE normalized to level of <italic>ACT1</italic> mRNA. For each of three biological replicate cultures of each strain, WT or <italic>eIF2AΔ</italic> mutant, we determined the ratio of TE in the presence versus absence of SM and calculated the mean and SEM values for ∆TEs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses and data visualization</title><p>Notched box plots were created using a web-based tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/">http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/</ext-link>).

Using ribosome profiling, RNA-Seq and reporter based assays authors evaluated the role of eIF2A protein under regular or stress conditions (cells starved for branched amino acids). Authors found that yeast cells depleted of eIF2A protein do not change significantly their translation initiation, or translation in general. In the contrast to previously reported data for human homolog yeast eIF2A does not significantly contribute to regulation of the uORFs, regardless if they start with canonical AUG or near cognate start codons. eIF2A is not involved in the repression of IRES element in URE2 gene or has a role in purine biosynthesis. It appears that in yeast eIF2A contributes to regulation of very limited number of mRNAs (32 with significant changes in translation efficiency), where only 17 of such messages indeed are consistent with eIF2A deletion and single mRNA (HKR1) could be validated in reporter assay.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the manuscript is complete analysis and unbiased approach using genomic analysis methods (ribosome profiling and RNA-seq) as well as reporter validation studies.

The weakness of this work is the lack of clarification on the function of eIF2A in general. The novelty of this study was limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe our study is valuable in providing strong evidence that eIF2A does not functionally substitute for eIF2 in tRNAi recruitment even when eIF2 function is impaired, and in showing that it does not contribute to translational control by uORFs or IRESs, thus ruling out the most likely possibilities for its function in yeast based on studies of the mammalian factor. We agree that the function of yeast eIF2A remains to be identified; however, we think this should be regarded as a limitation rather than a weakness in experimental design or data obtained in the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Related to this, it would be worth investigating common features in mRNAs selectively regulated (surveyed in Figure 3A).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not embark on this because only 17 of the 32 transcripts showing TE reductions in Fig. 3A showed a pattern of TE changes consistent with a conditional requirement for eIF2A under conditions of reduced eIF2 function, exhibiting greater TE decreases when both eIF2 function was impaired by phosphorylation and eIF2A was eliminated from cells. Moreover, we could validate this conditional eIF2A dependence by LUC reporter for only a single mRNA, HKR1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be worth analyzing the effect of eIF2A deletion on elongation (ribosome occupancy on each codon and/or global ribosome footprint distribution along CDS) and termination/recycling (footprint reads on stop codon and on 3′ UTR).</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the effects of deleting eIF2A on ribosome pausing at individual codons by calculating tri-peptide pause scores from our ribosome profiling data. The results shown in new Fig. 7 reveal that eIF2A plays no discernible role in stimulating the rate of decoding of any three-codon combinations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Given that native mRNAs were examined in the orthogonal assay of polysome profiling in Fig. 3E, the positive results obtained there for SAG1 and SVL3 in addition to HKR1 should be given greater weight. Nevertheless, our findings indicate a very limited role of yeast eIF2A in providing a back-up mechanism for Met-tRNAi recruitment when eIF2 function is diminished by phosphorylation of its α-subunit.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
