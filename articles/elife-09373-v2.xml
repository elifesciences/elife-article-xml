cells in an organism, plays an active role during morphogenesis. Here, we used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal system to study the complex relationship between the ECM and epithelial cells during development. We show that there is an active feedback mechanism between the apical ECM (aECM) and the apical F-actin in tracheal cells. Furthermore, we reveal that cell-cell junctions are key players in this aECM patterning and organisation and that individual cells contribute autonomously to their aECM. Strikingly, changes in the aECM influence the levels of phosphorylated Src42A (pSrc) at cell junctions. Therefore, we propose that Src42A phosphorylation levels provide a link for the ECM environment to ensure proper cytoskeletal organisation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09373.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09373.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal cells can secrete proteins and molecules into the space around them to create a support they can attach to. This structure – known as the extracellular matrix – comes in various forms and can help to shape tissues or influence the way in which cells behave. Inside cells, filaments made of a protein called actin also provide structural support.</p><p>In fruit fly larvae, “tracheal” cells create a network of tubes that will form the airways of the adult fly. Once this network is complete, these cells secrete the materials to make an extracellular matrix in the internal (apical) surface of the tubes. This matrix has a series of spiralling ridges made from a molecule called chitin. These ridges run along the tubes, spanning several cells and providing the mechanical strength needed to keep the airways open.</p><p>The ridges appear to form through a co-ordinated effort between the cells, and recent studies suggest that actin filaments may be involved in this process. Here, Öztürk-Çolak et al. investigate this idea further by carrying out a detailed analysis of the relationship between the extracellular matrix and the tracheal cells as the airways develop. The experiments reveal that rings of actin filaments form on the apical side of tracheal cells before the ridges appear. These rings generate regular folds in the membrane that surrounds each tracheal cell and are required for an enzyme to accumulate in the cells. This enzyme produces chitin, leading to its deposition in stripes above the actin rings.</p><p>Further experiments show that the junctions between cells play an important role in organising the pattern of the extracellular matrix. The active form of a protein called Src42A – which is known to regulate the way actin filaments are organized inside cells – accumulates at these junctions. Excessive Src42A activity in tracheal cells alters the networks of actin filaments and disrupts the formation of the matrix. Öztürk-Çolak et al. also find evidence of a “feedback” mechanism, in which the presence of chitin reduces the activity of Src42A to maintain the correct patterning of actin.</p><p>These findings reveal that actin and junctions between cells play a central role in co-ordinating the formation of the extracellular matrix in fruit fly airways. The next challenge will be to understand which proteins and other molecules are involved in the process that allows the extracellular matrix to communicate with the cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09373.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09373.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ECM</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>chitin</kwd><kwd>Blimp-1</kwd><kwd>Src42A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MO1714/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moussian</surname><given-names>Bernard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2009-07629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Öztürk-Çolak</surname><given-names>Arzu</given-names></name><name><surname>Araujo</surname><given-names>Sofia J</given-names></name><name><surname>Casanova</surname><given-names>Jordi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RYC-2007-00417</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Araujo</surname><given-names>Sofia J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-cell junctions and the actin cytoskeleton are key players in the organisation and patterning of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the apical side of tracheal cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><disp-quote><p><italic>“The anatomically internal lining of the trachea consists of a chitinous layer which presents what is usually termed a 'spiral thickening', but whose form is really that of a helicoid.

On the one hand, the ECM has a key role in cell signalling events, either acting as a storage compartment for growth factor molecules or by modifying and/or stabilising such growth factors. On the other hand, the ECM provides an environment with a variable degree of stiffness that, until recently, has been considered a physical support to ensure the arrangement of softer parts of body organs. However, increasing evidence indicates that the ECM not only provides a passive contribution to organ shape but also impinges on the cell behaviour and genetic programmes of the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daley and Yamada, 2013</xref>). The ECM is emerging as a direct modulator of many aspects of cell biology, rather than as a mere physical network that supports cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hynes, 2014</xref>). But how does the ECM influence cell biology and which molecules are involved?</p><p>There are many types of ECMs, ranging from cell walls and basement membranes to highly specialised structures such as tendons and shells. The assembly of these structures requires a complex set of diverse events involving protein secretion, as well as the modification of these proteins. In spite of the relevance of ECMs, it is not yet well understood how they are generated. In particular, a fascinating aspect of ECMs is the fact that they usually constitute a structure contributed to and shared by many cells. But how do individual cells participate in the generation of a supracellular ECM with an overall common organisation that overruns cellular borders?</p><p>We have addressed these issues by studying the apical ECM (aECM) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> trachea, the insect respiratory system. Once the different branches of the tracheal system have been established to cover the overall embryonic body, tracheal cells begin to secrete the components of a chitin-rich aECM that lines up the lumen of the tracheal tubes and can be visualised by the incorporation of chitin-binding probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moussian et al., 2005</xref>). A distinctive feature of this aECM are taenidial folds, a series of cuticle ridges that compose a helical structure running perpendicular to the tube length along the entire lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wigglesworth, 1990</xref>). Taenidia are believed to confer mechanical strength to the tubes and have been compared to a coiled spring within a rubber tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson, 1929</xref>) or to the corrugated hose of a vacuum cleaner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Manning and Krasnow, 1993</xref>). From the very first descriptions, it was noticed that taenidia are unaffected by the presence of cell boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson, 1929</xref>), thereby indicating that they are a supracellular structure and suggesting a substantial degree of intercellular coordination. More recently, it has been reported that taenidial organisation correlates with that of the apical F-actin bundles in underlying cells—the formation of these bundles preceding the appearance of taenidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kondo et al., 2007</xref>). However, the relationship between these bundles and taenidia is still poorly understood. In addition, physical modelling has recently revealed that the interaction of the apical cellular membrane and the aECM determines the stability of biological tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dong et al., 2014</xref>), thus generating more questions about how this interaction occurs.</p><p>Here, we report that there is a dynamic relationship between sub-apical F-actin and taenidial folds during tracheal lumen formation. We show that cell-cell junctions participate in organising F-actin bundles and the taenidial fold supracellular aECM and that this chitinous aECM contributes to regulating F-actin organisation in a two-way regulatory mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Time course of actin ring and taenidial fold formation</title><p>In order to obtain a detailed framework of taenidial fold formation during embryonic development, we began by performing a detailed analysis of the timing of taenidial formation. We focused on the main branch of the trachea, the dorsal trunk (DT), where taenidia are more conspicuous. It is worth mentioning that, prior to taenidial fold formation, a transient chitin filament is formed inside the tracheal lumen. This filament has been postulated to regulate tube length and diameter expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tonning et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moussian et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Luschnig and Uv, 2014</xref>). As this filament is a transient structure, its appearance in and disappearance from the lumen of the DT is a useful landmark to precisely stage embryos. Taenidia began to be detectable by late stage 16 when the chitin filament was still present in the tracheal lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Optical section analysis showed that taenidia develop at the more external luminal sections, while the chitin filament lies in a central position inside the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). From early stage 17, a stage when the luminal chitin fibre is already absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moussian et al., 2006b</xref>), taenidia became increasingly more prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As mentioned above, taenidial folds were organised as spiral rings that span many distinct cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of taenidial fold and actin ring formation.</title> <p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Dorsal Trunk detail of wild-type embryos stained with fluostain to label the chitin structures.

First F-actin bundles are formed at the fusion points during the fusion process of the DT (<bold>A’</bold>, arrows). These bundles are formed as a result of highly orchestrated cell shape changes during fusion events.

Then, very thin taenidial folds become visible (<bold>C</bold>). At first, they are not formed at fusion points (<bold>D</bold>). Later, taenidial folds at fusion points are also formed, thus generating a continuous taenidial structure along the tube (<bold>E</bold>).

For this purpose, we used fluostain and phalloidin to visualise chitin and F-actin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moussian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araújo et al., 2005</xref>). At early stage 16, when taenidia were not yet detectable, we distinguished some actin rings in the cells of the DT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). It is noteworthy that the first actin rings to appear in the trachea were those corresponding to the fusion cells, which are not related to taenidia but instead to the fusion between the lumen of adjacent segments of the DT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee and Kolodziej, 2002</xref>). Shortly after, actin rings in other cells were detected throughout the length of the DT, but these were much weaker than those present in the fusion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’’</xref>). At this stage, remnants of the chitin filament were still detectable but taenidial folds were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’</xref>). As the chitin filament faded away and taenidia became more visible, the actin rings became more defined and prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; for a more detailed time course of actin ring and taenidial fold formation see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To further study the functional link between actin rings and taenidial folds, we addressed whether these two structures are generated in frame. Maximum projection from confocal planes obtained from embryos stained with phalloidin and fluostain supported this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), similarly to what has been shown upon F-actin labelling in fluorescent and DIC images at larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I, J</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>]). In embryos, it is more difficult to reach a clear conclusion from confocal projection images, as the two structures are in different planes. However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the embryonic tracheal DT show the presence of electron dense structures in the cytoplasm underneath the taenidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, open arrow). These densities are likely to be cross-sections of actin filaments and not vesicles or microtubules because of their size. Whereas microtubules appear as circular structures of about 25 nm in diameter and vesicles are generally 5–20 times larger, actin filaments are only about 7 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grazi, 1997</xref>). Taken together these observations, lead us to conclude that actin filaments and taenidia are 'in-frame'.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Impairment of apical actin rings similarly reshapes taenidia</title><p>Alteration of the tracheal apical F-bundles by mutants in genes encoding actin polymerisation proteins also cause defects in taenidial arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>). Such is the case for mutants for <italic>tarsal-less (tal</italic>), also known as <italic>polished rice</italic> (<italic>pri</italic>), a gene transcribed into a polycistronic mRNA that contains short ORFs encoding 11 or 32 amino acid-long peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kondo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galindo et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>tal/pri</italic> is essential for the formation of actin bundles that prefigure two chitin structures, namely denticles in the embryonic cuticle and taenidia in the trachea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kondo et al., 2007</xref>). To further address the contribution of tracheal actin bundles to the arrangement of taenidia, we examined these two structures in the same mutant trachea to assess whether they are strictly correlated. In most <italic>tal/pri</italic> mutant embryos, the tracheal F-actin bundles formed but they were misoriented and did not follow the ring distribution found in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>); in some extreme cases, the bundles were completely disorganised. In all the cases studied, we found taenidia to be organised along the same pattern as the F-actin bundles, either running parallel to the tube axis when actin bundles were oriented in this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), completely disorganised, or completely misshapen in twisted tracheal tubes when F-actin fibres were aligned in a twisted manner.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Taenidial folds and F-actin rings in <italic>tal/pri, DAAM,</italic> and <italic>Btk29A</italic> mutants.</title> <p>Wild-type (<bold>A, B</bold>), tal/<italic>pri</italic> (<bold>C-D</bold>), DAAM (<bold>E-F</bold>), and Btk29A (<bold>G-H</bold>) mutant embryos stained with fluostain (<bold>A, C, E, G</bold>) to label taenidial folds and phalloidin (<bold>B, D, F, H</bold>) to label F-actin bundles.

In both mutants, we found heterogeneous patterns of F-actin bundling in the same trachea, with stretches of perpendicular bundles followed by stretches of parallel bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, H</xref>). In support of the close relationship between F-actin bundles and taenidia, we found the latter to reproduce the stretches of parallel and perpendicular orientation of the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>).

EM images have identified the accumulation of electron-dense material at the base of the taenidia that is thought to correspond to the chitin synthesis complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Uv and Moussian, 2010</xref>) and that appears to be located at the top of actin fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moussian et al., 2006b</xref>). Thus, the tracheal actin rings may instruct taenidial fold shaping by dictating the sites of chitin production. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> trachea, this production is carried out by the membrane-inserted chitin synthase encoded by the <italic>krotzkopf verkehrt</italic> (<italic>kkv</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ostrowski et al., 2002</xref>). The Kkv chitin synthase enzyme catalyses the linkage between N-acetyl-glucosamines supplied in the cytoplasm and extrudes the polymers across the plasma membrane (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moussian et al., 2006b</xref>]). Therefore, we analysed Kkv distribution in tracheal cells. For this purpose, we made use of a recently generated transgenic strain carrying a <italic>kkv-GFP</italic>-tagged construct under the control of the UAS promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moussian et al., 2015</xref>).

However, we did detect linear arrangements perpendicular to the tube length that resembled the actin rings detected by phalloidin and the chitin rings detected by fluostain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We have quantified the number of times these KkvGFP dots overlap with the fluostain rings and observed that they are indeed more frequent within each ring (on average, 25 dots per taenidium in contrast to 15 dots outside, n = 24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we also found that these KkvGFP dots are larger when they overlap with the fluostain rings than when they are present outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These findings support the notion that actin organisation, which dictates taenidial fold organization, participates in the distribution of the Kkv chitin synthase.

As when studying the contribution of tracheal actin rings to this process, we chose mutants that do not completely inhibit chitin deposition, as these mutants would probably heavily impair tracheal development, thus hindering specific analysis of the morphogenesis of taenidia. Thus, we turned to <italic>Blimp-1</italic>, an ecdysone response gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chavoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckstead et al., 2005</xref>) that encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the transcriptional factor <italic>B-lymphocyte-inducing maturation protein</italic> gene and whose mutants have been reported to have misshapen trachea almost completely devoid of taenidia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutant embryos were grossly inflated compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), a phenotype associated with weaker embryonic cuticles caused by mutations impairing the deposition or organisation of chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ostrowski et al., 2002</xref>). Consistent with this observation, <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutants showed a pale ectodermal cuticle with smaller denticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), although their phenotype is weaker than that of the <italic>kkv</italic> chitin synthase mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ostrowski et al., 2002</xref>). This observation suggests that, while chitin deposition is severely impaired, some still accumulated in the cuticle of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutant embryos. In support of this hypothesis, we detected lower levels of fluostain signal in the trachea of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutants compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Thus, we expected to find similarly less conspicuous taenidia, which was indeed the case. However, the most obvious abnormal feature of taenidia was their pattern, as they were not organised in folds perpendicular to the tube axis but instead ran parallel to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Given the close correlation between taenidia and actin bundle organisation, we examined actin arrangement in <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutants and found that it was severely impaired. In most <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutants examined (67%, n = 18), we did not observe tracheal actin rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). However, in the mutant embryos in which we detected apical actin bundles (33%, n = 18), these were oriented in parallel to the tube length (data not shown) like the chitin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, as is the case for the other mutant genotypes examined so far, in <italic>Blimp-1</italic> embryos the lack of a proper arrangement of taenidial folds correlates with either the absence or abnormal pattern of actin rings.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Taenidial folds, F-actin bundles, and chitin levels in <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutant embryos.</title> <p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Cuticle preparations of wild-type (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>Blimp-1</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) embryos visualised under dark field.

We were unable to generate mosaics by mitotic recombination since there are no cell divisions after tracheal invagination and RNAi-mediated knockdown often does not work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis; this was indeed the case upon expression of UAS-RNAi constructs for either <italic>tal/pri</italic> or <italic>Blimp-1</italic> in the embryonic tracheal cells. Thus, we turned to alternative approaches to produce tracheal cellular chimeras.</p><p>First, we took advantage of the effect of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> overexpression on taenidial formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ng et al., 2006</xref>). To generate tracheal DTs with distinct cellular composition, we used an <italic>AbdB-Gal4</italic> line that drives expression only in the posterior part of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Förster and Luschnig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Förster et al., 2010</xref>). This approach also allowed us to have an internal control within the same embryo. Upon expression of <italic>UASBlimp-1</italic> under these conditions, lower levels of chitin were detected in the posterior metameres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, chitin deposition seems to be highly dependent on the levels of Blimp-1 activity as both loss-of-function mutations and overexpression of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> induce low levels of chitin. We also noted that overexpression of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> gives rise to tracheal cells with a less elongated apical side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A’’</xref>), like that of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> and <italic>kkv</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). We then examined the trachea at the border of the <italic>AbdB-Gal4</italic> domain, finding a perfect correlation between the different physical appearance of taenidia and cells and their genotype, with either wild-type or increased levels of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We then generated flip-out clones expressing <italic>Blimp-1</italic> in a <italic>wild-type</italic> background and obtained similar results in these clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C</xref>, arrows).

However, in the case of the <italic>Blimp-1</italic> rescue experiment, taenidia tended to follow the orientation dictated by the genotype of their respective cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and F</xref>). Moreover, and due to the expression domain of the <italic>AbdBGAL4</italic> driver not being completely continuous, we observed single cells of one of the genotypes surrounded by cells of the other and could detect either mutant cells with a longitudinal arrangement of the taenidia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F’</xref>, arrow) or 'rescued' cells with a perpendicular arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F’</xref>, arrowhead); in this case, there was a correlation between the physical appearance of taenidia and the corresponding cell genotype. Interestingly, we also detected intermediate orientations between the prototypical longitudinal taenidia in the mutant domain and the perpendicular ones in the rescued domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F’</xref>, asterisk). These results suggest that cells 'adapt' the orientation of 'their' segments of the taenidia to the global orientation of the segments of the taenidia contributed by neighbouring cells.</p><p>These results show that tracheal taenidia can form proper rings even when the neighbouring cells do not.

A communal orientation of the intracellular apical actin bundles could arise from cells responding to a common extracellular cue. Alternatively, although not mutually exclusive, tracheal cells could coordinate the orientation of their apical actin bundles by means of their cell-cell junctions. Therefore, we sought to analyse the role of cellular junctions in the supracellular organisation of taenidial folds. We first attempted to downregulate cell-junction components in the embryonic trachea by means of expressing their corresponding double- stranded RNA constructs; however, we did not obtain a clear taenidial mutant phenotype. As mentioned before, RNAi-mediated knockdown often does not work during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis and so we repeated the same experiments in the trachea of the 3rd larval instar. Upon expression of a dsRNA targeted at the gene encoding alpha-catenin (α-cat), we found that DE-cad was strongly downregulated (undetected by antibody staining), demonstrating that adherens junction (AJ) formation is disrupted in the DT of these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1H</xref>). By downregulating AJs, we found that in these embryos taenidia organised in groups of independent units, not encompassing the overall tracheal tube diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9 B</xref>) (cell-cell junction taenidial disruption was detected in 123 out of 156 DT cells analysed (79%), n = 18 larvae). Strikingly, despite the observed role of cell-cell junctions in taenidial continuity, these are still placed perpendicular to the tube length. This suggests that tracheal cells are able to sense a global orientation cue and align their actin bundles appropriately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matusek et al., 2006</xref>), despite having their continuity disrupted at the level of the cell-cell junctions. Also, in this mutant background, taenidia organisation mimicked the distribution of actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which were similarly restricted to these independent units (100%, n = 17 larvae). Double labelling these trachea with fluostain and an apical cell membrane marker showed that these units corresponded to single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>), thereby confirming the role of cell-junctions in coordinating the pattern of F-actin bundles from neighbouring tracheal cells and ensuring a supracellular taenidia organisation encompassing the overall tracheal tube.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Taenidial folds in tracheal tubes with impaired cellular junctions.</title> <p>(<bold>A, B, C</bold>) Wild-type 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval tracheas, carrying either no constructs (<bold>A</bold>) or <italic>btl-GAL4</italic> and <italic>α-cat-RNAi</italic> constructs (<bold>B, C</bold>) stained with fluostain (red or grey) to label taenidial folds and anti-Spec (grey in <bold>A, B</bold> and <bold>C’</bold> and green in <bold>C</bold>) to label apical cell boundaries.

Less clear is how the chitin ECM could ensure the organisation of the tracheal actin rings. Previous work has also reported other effects of chitin on cytoskeletal organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tonning et al., 2005</xref>), and in this case neither is it known how this effect is mediated. To advance in this direction, we sought to identify the proteins that could act as a link between the extracellular environment and the cytoskeletal organisation. To this end, we focused our attention on Src42A because of the role of the Src kinases in mediating extracellular signals to modulate actin organisation (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parsons and Parsons, 2004</xref>]) and because of the influence of constitutive Src42A activity in taenidial organisation. In particular, constitutively active mutations of Src42A disturb tracheal actin bundling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Förster and Luschnig, 2012</xref>) and, consequently, taenidial formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 F</xref>).</p><p>We observed higher levels of Src42A phosphorylation in <italic>kkv</italic> and <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutants (data not shown). In the trachea, these increased levels have been shown to be coupled to an enhanced Src42A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Förster and Luschnig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nelson et al., 2012</xref>). However, the differences in Src42A phosphorylation were too variable to unequivocally analyse differences in levels. To clearly ascertain this effect, we used the <italic>AbdBGal4</italic> line, which allowed us to generate internal controls within the same embryos. Although the <italic>kkv</italic> RNAi inactivation appeared to be highly inefficient in this context as we obtained very few embryos with lower levels of chitin at their posterior tracheal metameres, in all these cases (n = 4) there was an increased level of phosphorylated Src42A in the metameres where <italic>kkv</italic> expression was downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, D</xref>). This observation was confirmed by the difference in levels of phosphorylated Src42A between <italic>kkv</italic> mutant and <italic>kkv</italic>-rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C, F</xref>). In addition, lower levels of phosphorylated Src42A were detected in regions with higher chitin levels upon Blimp-1 rescue of the posterior tracheal region of <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B, E</xref>). This observation was confirmed by Kkv rescue of <italic>kkv</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C, F</xref>). To check whether these differences could be attributed to differences in overall Src protein levels, we analysed Src protein in <italic>kkv</italic> mutant embryos and in embryos where Kkv was downregulated at the posterior end. In all cases, we could not detect any differences in Src protein levels in <italic>kkv</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

A functional redundancy could account for this observation and Src64 would be a likely candidate for such a phenomenon. However, we did not detect any actin ring phenotype in the trachea of double mutant embryos for both <italic>Src42A</italic> and <italic>Src64B</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Thus, and irrespective of the nature of the role of Src42A activity on actin ring patterning, these results suggest that the feedback mechanism of the chitin aECM through Src42A is not mainly in instructing actin ring organisation but in preventing its disturbance by downregulating Src42A phosphorylation to levels compatible with proper actin ring organisation. Accordingly, genetic removal of <italic>Src42A</italic> in <italic>Blimp-1</italic> homozygous embryos, rescues the taenidial organisation phenotype to wild-type levels, while keeping other <italic>Blimp-1</italic> mutant features in all double mutant embryos observed (n = 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G-I</xref>), confirming the biological role of Src42A in the mechanism underlying the supracellular organisation of the tracheal aECM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>A model for the generation of the supracellular taenidia</title><p>The role for the apical chitin ECM in tracheal actin organisation indicates a feedback mechanism to generate the supracellular taenidial structures. In the light of the above and previously published results, we propose the following model for the formation of the taenidial folds that expand the overall diameter of the tracheal tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). On the one hand, actin polymerises in rings at the apical side of the tracheal cells in a <italic>tal/pri</italic>-dependent process; these actin rings are then required for the particular accumulation of the <italic>kkv</italic> chitin synthase and for the appearance of folds in the plasma membrane. In turn, <italic>kkv</italic> accumulation leads to a localised increased production and deposition of chitin along specific enriched stripes above the actin rings in a <italic>Blimp-1</italic>-mediated process. On the other hand, the cellular AJs are instrumental in ensuring that apical F-actin bundles from each cell follow a supracellular organ arrangement. It has to be noted that each cell appears to independently organise or maintain, to a certain degree, the proper orientation of their actin bundles, as determined by <italic>Blimp-1</italic> clonal analysis and the disruption of cell adhesion by downregulation of α-Cat and, consequently, DE-Cad. These results further suggest cell polarity along the circumferential axis of the tracheal tube. Nevertheless, this is not an absolute value as cells also have the capacity to modify the orientation of their sections of the taenidia to keep the continuity of these structures along the tube. In this regard, cell adhesion is central to ensure the continuity of the intracellular actin bundles as a patterning element for the overall tube. Subsequently, the chitin aECM feeds back on to the cellular architecture by stabilising F-actin bundling and cell shape via the modulation of Src42A phosphorylation levels. The combination of all these phenomena &quot;<italic>explain just how it is that the cells of the tracheal epithelium can cooperate unconsciously so as to form a helicoid [chitinous] thickening continuous from one end of the trachea to another&quot;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thompson, 1929</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.021</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the generation of the supracellular taenidia.</title> <p>Model depicting the relationship between chitin synthesis and taenidial fold and F-actin organisation during taenidial fold formation. Drawn is the dorsal trunk at later stages of embryonic development and the effects of Tal/Pri, Blimp-1 and Kkv on F-actin and chitin organisation, respectively. This schematic representation depicts a time progression of events in taenidial formation. Large blue circles represent the Kkv localisation that is predominant within each taenidium, but it is also found in 'non-taenidial' regions of the membrane (smaller blue circles). The inhibitory effect of chitin in Src42A activation is depicted and well as the feedback from this inhibition back to the stabilisation of the F-actin rings.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09373.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09373.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09373-fig11-v2"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains and genetics</title><p>All <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains were raised at 25°C under standard conditions.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>The manuscript reports on an interesting interplay of the apical cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix lining the tracheal tubes. The authors characterize the construction and alignment of parallel actin filaments and chitin ECM structures (taenidia) constructed perpendicular to the tube axis. They describe the phenotypes of tal/pri (peptides with both extracellular and intracellular functions), blimp (TF) mutants by in situ stainings and TEM. The new intriguing observation is that in blimp mutants the cytoskeletal filaments are disrupted but some remaining mis-oriented chitin assemblies are formed suggesting that the structure and alignment of the chitin polymers contributes to the construction of cytoskeletal elements. As src42 activity has been shown to control cell shape changes during tracheal tube growth the authors investigated the effect of blimp and kkv inactivation on the levels of phospho-src in the tubes. They show that p-src levels vary in response to the level/structure of intraluminal chitin. The paper closes with a model proposing the interplay between chitin ECM and the cytoskeleton indicating that blimp regulates chitin filament formation and tal/pri the construction and alignment of junctions.</p><p>Review summary:</p><p>The reviewers found the subject and the work interesting. They find that the authors have tackled an important problem (ECM – cell interactions) and that the paper is clearly written. The reviewers are also unanimous in feeling that the conclusions from the experiments are in places overstated, and the following revisions are needed for the paper to be accepted by <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors demonstrate that changes in ECM alter the levels of phospho-src, the absence of an actin ring phenotype in src mutants severely undercuts evidence for a feedback mechanism in matrix organization. The authors need to either establish a role for src42 in actin ring formation, for example by showing that src42; src64 double mutants have an actin ring phenotype at a stage when changes in phospho-src are observed, or by showing that ECM changes result in changes in phosphorylation or activity of Btk, which does have a ring phenotype.</p><p>2) Although the authors clearly show that ECM is involved in tracheal morphogenesis, the experiments in the manuscript do not, as stated in the Abstract, investigate the &quot;stiffness&quot; or other physical properties of the ECM.

The authors could bolster the evidence for involvement of adherens junctions by examining E-cad mutants, or demonstrating that adherens junction formation is disrupted in a-cat mutants. Alternatively, the existing evidence could be discussed in terms of an apparent requirement for linkage actin cytoskeleton to adherens junction complexes. The authors should also address concerns that while a-cat mutants clearly have disrupted ECM patterning near cell junctions, there still appears to be some registration of the taenidial ring between cells in the a-cat mutants.

The authors should also check the signs of the arrows in the model, as well as the localization of src (which is shown as an extracellular protein), as there appears to be errors in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>.

It is unusual for <italic>eLife</italic> to ask for a second revision, and in this case we agree that you have made many important changes, including to the model. Unfortunately, the central issue about the involvement of src has remained unanswered. For the manuscript to be considered for publication, please address the following two points. The first by performing one more set of experiments and the second by addressing the issue in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>1) Requires new experiment</italic></p><p>In the first review of the manuscript, we asked for evidence establishing a role for src42 in actin ring formation, for example by showing that src42; src64 double mutants have an actin ring phenotype at a stage when changes in phospho-src are observed, or by showing that ECM changes result in changes in phosphorylation or activity of Btk, which does have a ring phenotype. It is now clear that the src42; src64 double does not have an actin ring phenotype, and it is understandable that making a triple mutant for src42, src64 and btk is technically difficult and phospho-Btk reagents do not appear to be available. The new model in which feedback from the ECM to Src prevents Src over-activation that would disrupt actin ring formation is very elegant and does account for the known results, but an equally plausible possibility is that ECM-regulated changes in Src phosphorylation are &quot;off pathway&quot; and do not have biological significance. Consequently, it is unclear whether this manuscript has defined an important feedback loop between ECM and actin organization and thus whether the manuscript will have a substantial impact on the field.</p><p>For the paper to reach the standards of <italic>eLife</italic>, as stated in the original review, it is critical to establish a role Src in actin ring formation. If the current model is correct that Src is not required for actin ring formation, but that Src activity must not be too high, then it should be the case that a Blimp-1;src42 or kkv;src42 double will have intact actin rings because there is no Src activity to disrupt them. The reviewers appreciate that it is quite possible, perhaps even likely, that ECM will have a more complex role in actin ring formation than keeping Src activity low, and thus that the proposed double mutants will still have abnormal actin rings, but it is essential for this paper to demonstrate an actual role for Src in actin ring formation. The proposed double mutant experiments are not presented as required experiments, but rather as possible experiments that could, using loss-of-function approaches, demonstrate a role for Src in actin ring formation. Alternative experiments would be acceptable, as long as they demonstrate a biologically meaningful role for Src in actin ring formation.</p><p>Parenthetically, it is possible that the anti-p-src stainings in the paper reflect src activity. It is also possible that they also reflect p-Abl activity (M. Tamada et al., Dev. Cell, 2012, 309-319). Please include controls to show that the staining is eliminated in src mutants.</p><p><italic>2) Modifications to the text</italic></p><p>The last paragraph of the subsection “Tracheal actin rings relate to the spatial distribution of the chitin synthase” suggests kkv does not align with actin in tal/pri mutants. However, the actin patterns look strikingly similar to the taenidial patterns, and the last paragraph of the subsection “Chitin deposition and actin bundling contribute to proper taenidial fold organization “says there is &quot;close interplay between actin and chitin in both tal/pri and Blimp-1 mutants&quot;. If kkv is not aligned with the actin in these mutants, this result actually undermines the argument that actin organizes kkv, which in turn produces an organized chitin pattern. Please clarify and explain in the text.</p><p>The issue raised above in #1 is critical for this manuscript to be accepted.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09373.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Although the authors demonstrate that changes in ECM alter the levels of phospho-src, the absence of an actin ring phenotype in src mutants severely undercuts evidence for a feedback mechanism in matrix organization. The authors need to either establish a role for src42 in actin ring formation, for example by showing that src42; src64 double mutants have an actin ring phenotype at a stage when changes in phospho-src are observed, or by showing that ECM changes result in changes in phosphorylation or activity of Btk, which does have a ring phenotype.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are completely right on the fact that it is not clear at all which is the role of Src42 in actin organization. Indeed, as they point out, there is not an actin ring phenotype in <italic>src42</italic> mutants (Luschnig, Nat Cell Biol, 2012). However, in the same work it has been shown that constitutive phosphorylation of Src42 produces an alteration of the same actin structure. Thus, while Src42 protein is not an absolute requirement for actin ring formation (see below), its phosphorylation needs to be below a given threshold to ensure that the actin rings form properly.</p><p>And precisely, what our results show is that mutants affecting the chitin ECM produce an increase in Src42 phosphorylation. In other words, a proper ECM is required to &quot;downregulate&quot; Src42 phosphorylation and thus to maintain the actin ring organization. Thus, we think this points out to a mechanism by which matrix organization ensures a proper actin organization, which in turn is critical to ensure a proper ECM, therefore establishing what we call a feedback mechanism.</p><p>Having said so, the puzzle remains: high phosphorylation of Src42 disrupts actin ring organization while the protein itself is dispensable for actin ring organization (Forster and Luschnig, Nat Cell Biol, 2012 and Nelson et al., Nat Cell Biol, 2012). A possible explanation to account for this observation could be another protein having a redundant function; among those Src64 would be a likely candidate. In this regard and as suggested, we examined <italic>Src42;Src64</italic> mutant embryos but we did not observe any actin ring phenotype in these double mutants. This observation does not completely rule out the redundant hypothesis as other proteins, such as Btk also mentioned by the reviewers, could substitute for Src42 and/or Src64 functions on what regards actin ring organization. In this regard, we would like to mention that Btk is supposed to be downstream of both <italic>Src42A</italic> and <italic>Src64B</italic> and there are some data showing that Btk enhances the hypomorph phenotype of <italic>Src42A</italic> (Tateno et al. Science 200 and Roulier et al., Mol Cell 1998) while, on the other hand, Btk is also said to be activated in a Src-independent way by other kinds of kinases (Takahashi, et al., Development 2005; Matusek et al. Development 2006, Roulier et al. Mol Cell 1998, Lu et al., EMBO J. 2004 and Thomas and Wieschaus, Development 2004). Altogether, the analysis of a possible redundancy involving three or more elements becomes very complicated. On the other hand, we have not been able to identify in the literature an anti-p-Btk antibody which would have allowed us to assess changes in Btk phosphorylation upon changes in the ECM.</p><p>Nevertheless, whereas the exact role of these proteins in actin ring organization remains an open issue, what is clear is that an increased phosphorylation of Src42A has to be prevented to allow for a proper actin ring organization and our results precisely show that ECM chitin organization prevents an increased phosphorylation of Src42A, thus providing a causal link between proper ECM and proper actin ring organization. We have now rewritten the manuscript to include the new data and to discuss further this point addressing the comments from the referees.</p><p><italic>2) Although the authors clearly show that ECM is involved in tracheal morphogenesis, the experiments in the manuscript do not, as stated in the Abstract, investigate the &quot;stiffness&quot; or other physical properties of the ECM. The authors need to either measure discussed physical properties or alter the text to accurately reflect the experimental data.</italic> </p><p>We have changed the text accordingly. More importantly, we have changed the reference to ECM stiffness in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>3) The perpendicular actin and its co-localization with kkvGFP are difficult to see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The authors need to provide more convincing, high-magnification pictures, with quantification, to support their claims. Similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the reported longitudinal chitin filaments are visible, but there are also some perpendicular arrangements, which undermine the argument that specific localization of kkv dictates ECM organization.</italic> </p><p>We have analysed and quantified KkvGFP localization in L3 larvae, where it is easier to analyse and can provide higher magnifications. In addition, we have inserted another embryonic image in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, for technical reasons we were not able to visualize kkvGFP and actin localization in the same images. Thus, as an alternative and due to the overlap between actin fibers and taenidia folds, we analized KkvGFP and chitin in the same images and found that more Kkv dots overlap with the taenidia and that the kkv dots associated with the taenidia are larger than the Kkv dots not overlapping with the taenidia. We have changed the text accordingly.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> the horizontal lines observed are an artefact from the SPE confocal laser and image acquisition on this channel. Sometimes we detect a fragmentation of the confocal image in an horizontal striped pattern when the image is acquired using a Leica SPE confocal due to the high magnification and low frequence required. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> it might be more clear due precisely to its magnification and is absolutely unrelated to the chitin signal.</p><p><italic>4) The authors need to be exact in their discussion of the a-cat mutant phenotype. Since a-cat is not an integral junctional adhesion protein, the presented data do not show the cell-cell junctions are key players ECM patterning. The authors could bolster the evidence for involvement of adherens junctions by examining E-cad mutants, or demonstrating that adherens junction formation is disrupted in a-cat mutants. Alternatively, the existing evidence could be discussed in terms of an apparent requirement for linkage actin cytoskeleton to adherens junction complexes. The authors should also address concerns that while a-cat mutants clearly have disrupted ECM patterning near cell junctions, there still appears to be some registration of the taenidial ring between cells in the a-cat mutants. The authors should comment on this, and consider alternative models for the importance of kkv localization.</italic> </p><p>We have analysed adherens junctions by means of DE-Cad and found that in all α-catenin downregulated tracheal tubes, we detected the phenotype and also a strong DE-Cad downregulation (n=8 embryos, no detectable DE-Cad staining). We have inserted a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and made changes to the text to incorporate these data.</p><p>We have also added a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, showing a higher magnification of a junctional region, where it is clear there is an interruption of the taenidial continuity.</p><p>It is striking that despite the role of cell junctions in taenidial continuity, these are still placed perpendicular to the tube length. This suggests, as It was first suggested by Matusek et al., that tracheal cells are able to sense a global orientation cue and align their actin bundles appropriately, despite having their continuity disrupted. We have added reference to this in the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>5) While models are necessarily imprecise abstractions of data, the reviewers feel the presented model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> over interprets multiple aspects of the presented data, including the colocalization of kkv with chitin, the importance of src in the feedback loop to actin ring organization and the specificity of tal and Blimp-1 acting only on actin and chitin.

Most importantly, we have now represented Src-phosphorylated, rather than just Src. We believe this new model is a more accurate description of our hypothesis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We agree that you have made many important changes, including to the model.
