In many cell types, formation of the cilium is initiated by recruitment of preciliary vesicles to the distal appendage of the mother centriole. However, the distal appendage mechanism that directly captures preciliary vesicles is yet to be identified. In an accompanying paper, we show that the distal appendage protein, CEP89, is important for the preciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other steps of cilium formation (Kanie et al., 2025). The lack of a membrane-binding motif in CEP89 suggests that it may indirectly recruit preciliary vesicles via another binding partner. Here, we identify Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89. NCS1 localizes to the position between CEP89 and the centriole-associated vesicle marker, RAB34, at the distal appendage. This localization was completely abolished in <italic>CEP89</italic> knockouts, suggesting that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage. Similar to <italic>CEP89</italic> knockouts, preciliary vesicle recruitment as well as subsequent cilium formation was perturbed in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells. The ability of NCS1 to recruit the preciliary vesicle is dependent on its myristoylation motif and <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells expressing a myristoylation defective mutant failed to rescue the vesicle recruitment defect despite localizing properly to the centriole. In sum, our analysis reveals the first known mechanism for how the distal appendage recruits the preciliary vesicles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>ciliogenesis</kwd><kwd>distal appendage</kwd><kwd>intracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>ciliary vesicle</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanie</surname><given-names>Tomoharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM151013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanie</surname><given-names>Tomoharu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 (NCS1) is a protein that captures the preciliary vesicle in the early step of the cilium formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary cilium is an organelle that consists of the microtubule-based axoneme surrounded by the ciliary membrane, which accumulates specific membrane proteins (e.g., G-protein-coupled receptors) to serve as a sensor for extracellular environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). The cilium extends from the mother centriole, and cycles assembly and disassembly, as the cell needs to disassemble the cilium prior to mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vorobjev and Chentsov Yu, 1982</xref>) to allow the centrosome to function within the spindle pole during mitosis. The process of ciliary formation, described first by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sorokin, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sorokin, 1968</xref> has been classified into the extra- and intracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>). In the extracellular pathway used, for example, by Mardin–Darby canine kidney cells, the mother centriole is believed to first dock to the plasma membrane before the extension of the axonemal microtubule as well as ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jewett et al., 2021</xref>). In the intracellular pathway used, for example, by retinal pigment epithelia (RPE) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>) and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sorokin, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>), the first step of cilium formation is attachment of the small vesicles, or so-called preciliary vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), to the distal end of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sorokin, 1962</xref>), or more specifically to the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>). The distal appendage is a ninefold blade-like structure attached to the distal end of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). The preciliary vesicle recruitment is followed by the fusion of the small vesicles to form a large ciliary vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), removal of CP110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), which is believed to cap the distal end of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>), and subsequent axonemal extension, which is mediated at least partially by intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Craft et al., 2015</xref>). While the distal appendage is indispensable for all those steps, how exactly the distal appendage controls these multiple processes is largely unknown.</p><p>To understand the molecular roles of the distal appendage, we first need to uncover its molecular composition and identify critical functions of distal appendage proteins. In an accompanying paper, we comprehensively analyzed all known distal appendage proteins to date and revealed that the Centrosomal Protein 89 (CEP89) is important for preciliary vesicle recruitment, but not for other processes organizing cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). Since CEP89 lacks apparent lipid-binding motifs, we hypothesized that an interacting partner of CEP89 may bind to preciliary vesicle directly. We sought to identify and understand the protein directly recruiting the preciliary vesicle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Discovery of Neuronal Calcium Sensor-1 as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89</title><p>To identify interacting partners of CEP89, we performed tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry (TAP-MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rigaut et al., 1999</xref>). Localization and affinity purification (LAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cheeseman and Desai, 2005</xref>) tagged CEP89 was expressed in RPE immortalized with human telomerase (RPE-hTERT), and CEP89 was immunoprecipitated first by Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) antibody beads followed by a second affinity precipitation by S-protein beads.

NCS1 was first identified as Frequenin in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a protein that can facilitate neurotransmitter release in neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pongs et al., 1993</xref>). Since then, numerous papers proposed models wherein NCS1 is involved in both presynaptic and postsynaptic functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dason et al., 2012</xref>). However, how exactly NCS-1 regulates neuronal function is still not well understood. As described later in this paper, NCS-1 is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues, consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gierke et al., 2004</xref>). While previous studies reported the roles for NCS1 in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>) and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ratai et al., 2019</xref>), the function of NCS1 in non-neuronal cells remain enigmatic. A centrosomal role of NCS1 has never been described.</p><p>CEP89 binding to NCS1 required the N-terminal region (1–343 a.a.)

The C-terminal portion of CEP89 (344–783 a.a.) is required for its centrosomal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sillibourne et al., 2013</xref>). An in vitro binding assay using in vitro translated proteins revealed that HA-tagged CEP89 directly binds to MYC-tagged CEP15 and NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas HA-CEP15 did not bind to NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

When observed via a wide-field microscopy, NCS1 localized to the mother centriole, marked by CEP170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Some cytoplasmic staining was also observed. Both centriolar and cytoplasmic staining was highly specific as the signal was strongly reduced in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The cytoplasmic localization of NCS1 is inconsistent with a previous study, where C-terminally Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP)-tagged NCS1 constitutively localized to membranous compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O’Callaghan et al., 2002</xref>). We tested if the difference in localization is due to the tagging. We also tested whether membrane binding, myristoylation motif, of NCS1 affects its localization by making the myristoylation defective mutant by converting the position 2 glycine to alanine (NCS1-G2A). N-terminally LAP (EGFP and S)-tagged wild-type or G2A mutant of NCS1 localized to mother centriole as well as cytoplasm, similar to endogenous NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Consistent with the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O’Callaghan et al., 2002</xref>), C-terminally LAP-tagged wild-type NCS1 localized to membrane compartments, such as plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the myristoylation defective mutant (G2A) diffusely localized to cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). This result suggests that C-terminal tagging of NCS1 changes its localization potentially via exposing the myristoylation motif of NCS1, and endogenous NCS1 may sequester its myristoylation motif to allow localization to cytoplasm. A small amount of nuclear localization observed in LAP-tagged NCS1 likely derives from LAP tagging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), as the endogenous NCS1 did not localize to nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to NCS1, C-terminally LAP-tagged CEP15 localized to the location between acetylated tubulin, a cilium marker, and Pericentrin, a centrosome marker, suggesting that it also localizes specifically to the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). NCS1 localization to the mother centriole was enhanced upon serum deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a condition that induces cilium formation in RPE cells, much like several other distal appendage proteins (see Figure 1D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). When observed via 3D-structured illumination microscopy with a resolution twice as high as a diffraction limited microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu and Shroff, 2018</xref>), C-terminally LAP (EGFP-S)-tagged CEP15 localized to a position slightly distal to the distal appendage protein, CEP164, in side view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When top (or axial) view of the mother centriole was visualized, LAP-CEP15 formed a ring-like structure that is slightly smaller than the CEP164 ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which mirrors the ninefold symmetrical structure of the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Paintrand et al., 1992</xref>). Similarly, NCS1 localized slightly distal to CEP164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) as well as the binding partner, CEP89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and slightly proximal to the centriole-associated vesicle marker, RAB34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Like CEP15, NCS1 formed a slightly smaller ring than CEP164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Consistent with this, the ring diameter of NCS1 and CEP15 was 319.5 ± 7.7 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 13, average ± SEM) and 348.8 ± 8.0 nm (<italic>n</italic> = 16, average ± SEM), respectively (see Figure 1C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). It is notable that both CEP15 and NCS1 also localized to the region close to subdistal appendage in some but not all centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F</xref>), consistent with what was observed for CEP89 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chong et al., 2020</xref>). This near subdistal appendage localization explains why CEP15 was previously classified as a subdistal appendage protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that NCS1 localizes to the distal appendage and more precisely to a position sandwiched between CEP89 and the RAB34 positive vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>We next determined the hierarchy of the three proteins. Centriolar localization of CEP89 was not affected by depletion of either NCS1 nor CEP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). NCS1 failed to localize to the mother centriole without altering its cytoplasmic localization in <italic>CEP89</italic> knockout cells but not in <italic>CEP15</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), indicating that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage. The lack of NCS1 localization at the centriole in <italic>CEP89</italic> knockouts cells was rescued by expressing untagged CEP89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). CEP15 localization required CEP89, but not NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This is further corroborated by the structural modeling using Alphafold2, which shows that CEP89 interacts with both NCS1 and CEP15 whereas CEP15 does not interact with NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The expression level of neither NCS1 nor CEP15 was affected by CEP89 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>). These results suggest that both NCS1 and CEP15 are recruited to the distal appendage by CEP89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). We also tested whether the three proteins affect localization of other distal appendage proteins and found that the localization of other distal appendage proteins were unchanged in cells deficient in CEP89, NCS1, or CEP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>) (see also Figure 2A–L of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). Similar to the centriolar localization of CEP89, which was significantly reduced in <italic>CEP83</italic> or <italic>SCLT1</italic> knockouts, NCS1 localization was also greatly diminished in these knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that CEP83-SCLT1 module serves as a structural component of the distal appendage (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> for the detail). In contrast, the feedback complex CEP164-TTBK2 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> for the detail) was required for proper centriolar localization of NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>) but not for CEP89 (Figure 2F of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). Given that CEP89 is a substrate of TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernatik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lo et al., 2019</xref>), this might suggest that phosphorylation of TTBK2 could affect the interaction between CEP89 and NCS1. It is also possible that NCS1 may be a phosphorylation target of TTBK2. These questions warrant future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NCS1 is important for efficient preciliary vesicle recruitment at the distal appendage</title><p>We next sought to understand the role of NCS1 at the distal appendage and performed kinetic analysis of ciliation in control (sgGFP) and knockouts of <italic>CEP89</italic>, <italic>NCS1</italic>, or <italic>CEP15</italic> in RPE cells, in which serum starvation induces cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Control RPE cells form cilia over 24 hr after serum starvation, and almost of all cells completed cilium formation between 24 and 48 hr. <italic>CEP89</italic> and <italic>NCS1</italic> knockouts displayed a notable delay in initiating ciliation (see 12 hr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but gradually catch up on ciliogenesis and exhibited only mild ciliary formation defects at later time points (see 48 hr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

This kinetic defect is strongly consistent with the knockouts of several other distal appendage proteins, namely ANKRD26 and FBF1 (Figure 5A, B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>).

In an accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>), we showed that CEP89 participates in cilium formation by regulating preciliary vesicle recruitment without affecting IFT88::CEP19 recruitment, important steps that require distal appendage proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dateyama et al., 2019</xref>) (see Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). We tested if NCS1 has similar roles to its binding partner, CEP89. Indeed, <italic>NCS1</italic> knockouts exhibited moderate preciliary vesicle recruitment defect, similar to <italic>CEP89</italic> knockouts, when assessed using RAB34 as the vesicle marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy analysis confirmed the vesicle recruitment defect in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). The presence of fused vesicles, albeit much lower percentage than control cells, in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>) suggests that NCS1 is important for recruitment but not fusion of the vesicle. Removal of CP110, which is believed to act as a cap of axonemal microtubule, was partially, but measurably affected in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), consistent with the fact that CP110 removal is in part downstream of the vesicle recruitment (Figure 4D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). Neither IFT88 nor CEP19 recruitment to the centriole was affected in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). These results suggest that NCS1 plays an important role in cilium formation by regulating preciliary vesicle recruitment, but not other known processes of cilium formation, consistent with the role of CEP89 in preciliary vesicle recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Yet unknown distal appendage proteins may compensate the lack of NCS1 in preciliary vesicle recruitment</title><p>As we showed in an accompanying paper, the distal appendage is indispensable for the recruitment of the preciliary vesicle to the mother centriole. Virtually no RAB34-positive ciliary vesicle was observed at mother centriole in cells deficient in CEP164, CEP83, or TTBK2, which are critical for structural integrity of the distal appendage (Figure 5C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). This phenotype is much stronger than what we observed in <italic>CEP89</italic> or <italic>NCS1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that some other distal appendage proteins may compensate the lack of NCS1 for the preciliary vesicle recruitment. To address this question, we created cells lacking both NCS1 and each of the other distal appendage proteins (FBF1, CEP89, ANKRD26, KIZ, LRRC45) as well as the distal appendage associated protein, INPP5E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We omitted the integral components of the distal appendage proteins (CEP164, TTBK2, CEP83, SCLT1) from the analysis, as the knockouts of these proteins showed very strong preciliary vesicle recruitment defects on their own, therefore making it difficult to test if the NCS1 depletion shows additive effects. Cilium formation assay revealed that depletion of NCS1 decreased the percentage of ciliated cells in each single knockout cells, except <italic>CEP89</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). This suggests that CEP89, but no other distal appendage protein regulates the same ciliary formation pathway as NCS1. Similarly, depletion of NCS1 decreased the RAB34-positive centriole in each of the single distal appendage knockout cells, except <italic>CEP89</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results suggest that yet unknown distal appendage proteins would be required to compensate for the preciliary vesicle recruitment defect of <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells. Another possibility is that one or more integral components (CEP164, TTBK2, SCLT1, and CEP83) may be directly involved in preciliary vesicle recruitment.

We tested this hypothesis by creating a myristoylation defective mutant (NCS1-G2A). We tested whether the mutant indeed lost the ability to bind membrane using differential centrifugation following nitrogen cavitation. We first determined which fraction is the most optimal to assess membrane association in our experimental setting. While the microsomal fraction prepared from the pellet following ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> is often used to analyze membrane fraction of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Graham, 2015</xref>), the plasma membrane marker, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), was enriched mostly in the pellet following centrifugation at 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> in our experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; see Methods for further explanation of the technical design). In addition, NCS1-G2A was fractionated in the 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> pellet to similar extent as wild-type NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating that centrifugation at 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> may also pellet some soluble proteins, even though cytoplasmic protein RabGDI remained in the 100,000 × <italic>g</italic> supernatant. Thus, we decided to use 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> pellet to assess membrane fraction in our experiment. In control cells (sgSafe), both NCS1 and CEP89 were found in both soluble fraction (15,000 × <italic>g</italic> supernatant) and membrane fraction (15,000 × <italic>g</italic> pellet) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, NCS1-G2A was only found in the soluble fraction (15,000 × <italic>g</italic> supernatant) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), suggesting that myristoylation is required for membrane localization of NCS1. Interestingly, CEP89 was only found in the soluble fraction (15,000 × <italic>g</italic> supernatant) in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells expressing either empty vector or NCS1-G2A, but not NCS1-WT. This suggests that membrane localization of CEP89 requires NCS1 with an intact myristoylation motif. When expressed at similar level to endogenous NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), both wild-type and the myristoylation defective (G2A) NCS1 localizes to the mother centriole to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). However, the myristoylation defective mutant almost completely failed to rescue ciliation and preciliary vesicle recruitment defect of <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). These data suggest that NCS1 recruits preciliary vesicle to the distal appendage via its myristoylation motif. Structural modeling of the NCS1–CEP89 complex reveals a distinct functional organization of NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The three intact Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF hands and the Gly2 myristoylation site cluster on one face of NCS1, while the CEP89-binding pocket occupies the opposite face. This arrangement suggests that NCS1 can simultaneously engage in membrane association and calcium sensing while interacting with CEP89. This architecture provides a molecular basis for understanding how the myristoylation-dependent membrane association of NCS1 can facilitate the recruitment of preciliary vesicles at the distal appendage, as supported by our biochemical and cellular analyses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>NCS1 captures the preciliary vesicle via its myristoylation motif.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot (IB) analysis of expression of NCS1, CEP89, EGFR, and RabGDI.

Several other NCS family proteins, including Recoverin and Hippocalcin, show a calcium-myristoyl switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Callaghan et al., 2003</xref>). In this mechanism, the sequestered myristoylation motif is exposed to allow the protein to bind membrane upon calcium binding. It has been proposed that NCS1 may employ a similar molecular switch. While the structure of fission yeast Ncs1, solved by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed the calcium-myristoyl switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2011</xref>), several lines of evidence suggest the absence of that type of switch in budding yeast and mammalian NCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ames et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O’Callaghan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemire et al., 2016</xref>). Since a myristoylation defective mutant of NCS1 failed to form cilia efficiently without affecting its centrosomal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>), we tested if there is a calcium-myristoylation switch by making various EF-hand mutations, where each or combination of the three active EF-hand motif was disabled by mutating invariant glutamate at -z position to glutamine (E84Q for the first, E120Q for the second, and E168Q for the third active EF-hand mutation). We expressed wild-type or EF-hand mutants of untagged NCS1 in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells and detected the expression and the localization of each mutant using α-NCS1 antibody. The wild-type and the mutants of NCS1 were functionally tested via ciliation assay rather than the preciliary vesicle recruitment assay, because the ciliation assay is much less variable than the vesicle recruitment assay. The E84Q mutant as well as any double and triple EF-hand mutants were highly destabilized (see input in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the centriolar NCS1 signal intensity of the mutants was reduced in parallel to their diminished expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that the first EF hand is indispensable for stability of NCS1. E120Q mutant had similar expression level, but its centrosomal signal was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), consistent with its diminished interaction with CEP89 (see IP: GFP in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a protein that recruits NCS1 to the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). This suggests that the second EF hand is involved in keeping its structure to interact with CEP89. E168Q had a negligible effect in stability and localization of NCS1. The ciliation assay revealed that none of single EF-hand mutants showed significant cilium formation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) despite the partial reduction of centriolar signal intensity for E84Q and E120Q. The double or triple mutants almost completely failed to rescue ciliation defect of <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), reflecting their very low expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results suggest that calcium binding is primarily required for the structure and stability of NCS1 and NCS1 does not clearly exhibit a calcium-myristoylation switch. The structural role of calcium on NCS1 is largely consistent with NCS1’s high binding affinity to calcium (−90 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravind et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>NCS1 is recruited to the centriole in a microtubule-independent manner where it captures preciliary vesicles</title><p>We next sought to understand where NCS1 captures preciliary vesicle. One possibility is that NCS1 captures the vesicle in the cytoplasm and then traffics it to the centriole by dynein-dependent transport via microtubules. Another possibility is that NCS1 traffics to the centriole first and then captures preciliary vesicles. To distinguish these two possibilities, we treated RPE cells with nocodazole to destabilize microtubules, as microtubules were previously shown to be indispensable for preciliary vesicle recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2018</xref>), destabilization of microtubule by nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>) immediately inhibited preciliary vesicle recruitment and subsequent cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>), suggesting that preciliary vesicles are trafficked to the mother centriole via microtubules. In contrast, centriolar NCS1 signal was gradually increased upon serum starvation even in the presence of nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that NCS1 accumulates at the distal appendage by microtubule-independent mechanisms, possibly by diffusion, similar to the previously proposed diffusion-to-capture model of IFT trafficking to the ciliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hibbard et al., 2021</xref>). Because NCS1 is an N-terminally myristoylated protein, we also considered whether NCS1 might be trafficked to the distal appendage through UNC119, a chaperone that binds to N-myristoylated ciliary proteins like NPHP3 and cystin and traffics them to the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). We conclude that NCS1 is unlikely to use the UNC119 pathway, as we did not observe UNC119A/UNC119B in our AP/MS analysis of CEP89 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), nor in purifications of UNC119A/UNC119B proteins themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). In a complementary approach to the microtubule destabilization, we tested if NCS1 localizes to the distal appendage even if the preciliary vesicle recruitment is inhibited by RAB34 depletion (see Figure 4B, C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). We confirmed that centriolar NCS1 was comparable between control (sgSafe) and <italic>RAB34</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that NCS1 is recruited to the centriole independently from the ciliary vesicle. These results suggest that NCS1 moves to the distal appendage possibly by diffusion or an alternative trafficking mechanism and there it captures the preciliary vesicle that is trafficked to the centriole by microtubule-dependent trafficking.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Preciliary vesicle, but not NCS1 and CEP89, is recruited to the centriole via microtubules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon showing the method used to test the requirement of microtubules in preciliary vesicle recruitment and NCS1 localization.

Since we discovered that NCS1 localizes to the centriole, a major microtubule organizing center in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bornens, 2012</xref>), we tested the expression and the localization of NCS1 in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. We first tested the expression of NCS1 in various murine tissues and confirmed that NCS1 is expressed in a wide range of tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The low expression level of NCS1 in liver, skeletal muscle, and fat might reflect that most of the cells (hepatocyte, myocyte, and adipocytes, respectively) in those tissues do not retain cilia, or because of the difference in ratio between intra- and extracellular proteins. When we performed immunofluorescence (IF) assay, NCS1 localized to both cytoplasm and the ciliary base (a dot next to ciliary markers, ARL13B or AC3) in isolated hippocampal neuron (top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) as well as cells in hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Both cytoplasmic and the centriole signal was specific for NCS1 as we detected no signal in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (bottom panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). NCS1 also localized to the ciliary base in virtually all the non-neuronal ciliated cells that we tested, including kidney epithelia, pancreatic islet cells, airway epithelia, ependymal cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Only ciliated cells where we failed to detect NCS1 at the ciliary base were photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We next sought to determine whether NCS1 is involved in cilium formation in those cells, as we saw in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). In MEFs, cilium formation is modestly perturbed in Ncs1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), consistent with the kinetic cilium formation defect in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Decrease in ciliary ARL13B signal was also detected in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), similar to <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). In contrast, we did not detect a measurable cilium formation defect in hippocampal neurons that lack Ncs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), whereas the signal of ciliary membrane protein, type III adenylyl cyclase (ADCY3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berbari et al., 2007</xref>), was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

Since NCS1 is now shown to localize to the distal appendage in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and regulate efficient cilium formation at least in some cell types, we sought to test if <italic>Ncs1</italic> knockout mice show phenotypes related to ciliopathies, pleiotropic disorders caused by functional and structural dysfunction of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). A series of previous genetic studies in mice showed that the loss of ciliary function results in a variety of disorders ranging from developmental defects, including neural tube defect, skeletal anomalies as well as left–right patterning defects, to obesity, retinal degeneration, cystic kidney diseases, liver fibrosis, and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Norris and Grimes, 2012</xref>). The phenotypes found in ciliopathy mouse models greatly vary depending on the timing of gene deletion and which ciliopathy gene is mutated in the model, likely reflecting the differences in the severity of the defects in cilium formation and function, as well as the cell types that the gene mutations affect. We assessed whether the previously generated <italic>Ncs1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hermainski, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ng et al., 2016</xref>) exhibit ciliopathy phenotypes.

In the follow-up study in 1968, Sorokin observed smaller vesicles that may be attached to a single blade of the distal appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sorokin, 1968</xref>). These small vesicles were named as the distal appendage vesicles by Westlake group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). We believe these distal appendage vesicles share substantial overlap with the RAB34 vesicles defined here; however, the shape of RAB34-positive vesicles appear to be highly variable even before the cilium formation was induced by serum starvation (Figure 3—figure supplement 3G–J of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>), where the membrane fusion factors, EHD1 and PACSIN2, were not recruited (Figure 3C, D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). This may suggest that RAB34-positive vesicles at the mother centriole may fuse to form vesicles with a variety of sizes or different sized vesicles are recruited to the distal appendages. Thus, the RAB34-positive vesicles described in this study may be different from what were proposed as the distal appendage vesicles. The sum of these studies emphasizes that we need to accumulate more knowledge to accurately define these vesicles.</p><p>The study from Westlake group also suggested that the distal appendage vesicles may be derived from RAB11-positive preciliary vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), which are critical for bringing RAB8 to the ciliary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Westlake et al., 2011</xref>). However, RAB8 is only recruited at the later stage of the cilium biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2015</xref>), and there is no direct evidence showing that RAB11-positive vesicles are captured by the distal appendages. Nevertheless, precursor vesicles, termed as &quot;preciliary vesicles&quot;, are budded from membranous organelles, then trafficked to the centriole, and finally captured by distal appendage proteins to become the distal appendage vesicles.</p><p>Since the distal appendage proteins that have been discovered so far CEP83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), CEP164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Graser et al., 2007</xref>), TTBK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Čajánek and Nigg, 2014</xref>), SCLT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), FBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>), CEP89 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sillibourne et al., 2011</xref>), ANKRD26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bowler et al., 2019</xref>), LRRC45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kurtulmus et al., 2018</xref>) lack apparent lipid-binding motifs, how exactly the preciliary vesicle is captured by the distal appendage is poorly understood. In an accompanying paper, we screened all the previously and newly discovered distal appendage proteins and found that CEP89 is important for preciliary vesicle recruitment but not for other processes of cilium formation, such as IFT and CEP19 recruitment (see Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>). Since CEP89 also lacks any identifiable lipid-binding domain, we hypothesized that an interactor of CEP89 would be directly involved in the preciliary vesicle recruitment. In this paper, we discovered NCS1 as a stoichiometric interactor of CEP89. We further show that NCS1 captures the preciliary vesicle via its myristoylation motif.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How NCS1 captures preciliary vesicles only at distal appendages?</title><p>To make cilium formation efficient and error-free, we assume that the cells would have mechanisms where NCS1 only captures the preciliary vesicle at the distal appendage but not at other locations within cells (e.g., cytoplasm). In addition to its centriolar localization, NCS1 localizes throughout cytoplasm, of which signal is completely lost in <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This implies that NCS1 may sequester its myristoylation motif to remain in the cytoplasm and may expose the membrane association motif to capture the preciliary vesicle only at the distal appendage. One very intriguing possibility is that NCS1 may extend its myristoyl group in response to increases in local calcium concentration (calcium-myristoyl switch), as shown for other NCS family proteins, such as Recoverin and Hippocalcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ames et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Callaghan et al., 2003</xref>). The local calcium concentration may be higher at the centriole because of the high calcium concentration in the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Delling et al., 2013</xref>). We addressed this question by making a series of EF-hand mutants of NCS1, where the amino acids at the -z position required for calcium binding were mutated. Our data emphasize the importance of calcium in the stability of NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As long as the expression level of NCS1 is maintained, the mutation did not strongly affect either centriolar localization or cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). These data suggest that calcium may be required for the structural integrity of NCS1 but may not regulate protrusion of myristoyl moiety, which is required for efficient preciliary vesicle recruitment and subsequent cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Our data align with the previous reports that suggest the absence of calcium-myristoyl switch in NCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ames et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O’Callaghan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lemire et al., 2016</xref>). The second possibility is that NCS1 exposes its myristoyl group only when the protein binds to another protein at the distal appendage. Given that CEP89 recruits NCS1 to the distal appendage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), we wondered if NCS1 associates with membranes only when the protein binds to CEP89. However, a fractionation experiment showed that NCS1 purifies with the membrane fraction even in the absence of CEP89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating the absence of CEP89-myristoyl switch. The third possibility is that NCS1 continuously expose its myristoylation motif but remains in cytoplasm because of a weak membrane association. This hypothesis is in agreement with the low affinity of myristoylated peptides for lipid with the dissociation constant of 100 µM, which is barely sufficient to keep its membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Peitzsch and McLaughlin, 1993</xref>). Myristoylated proteins typically require additional mechanisms to bind membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wright et al., 2010</xref>): (1) another acyl chain (e.g., palmitoylation), (2) a cluster of basic amino acids that help association with negatively charged head group of the membrane, and (3) an interacting partner that has affinity for membrane. Since NCS1 does not appear to have another acyl chain, membrane binding of NCS1 is likely enhanced by either basic amino acids or another distal appendage protein that is in close proximity to NCS1 keeps the protein associated with membrane. Interestingly, a recent paper showed that lysine residues at positions 3, 7, and 9 may be also involved in membrane binding of NCS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baksheeva et al., 2020</xref>). In terms of the binding partner induced membrane association, this process is likely regulated by yet unknown distal appendage protein(s) and not by CEP89 as membrane association of NCS1 does not require CEP89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This is also supported by the NCS1-CEP89 structural model, which places CEP89 opposite to the myristoylated glycine and the three calcium-binding sites of NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The rise in the local concentration of NCS1 as well as membrane vesicle at the centriole may also help NCS1’s membrane association at that location. The weak association between myristoylated NCS1 and membrane could also explain why cells can capture preciliary vesicles, albeit less efficiently, even in the absence of NCS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). We currently do not have an obvious candidate for a distal appendage protein that may compensate the lack of NCS1, as the depletion of NCS1 in any of the knockouts of the known distal appendage proteins did not further inhibit the preciliary vesicle recruitment and cilium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). Future studies will focus on identifying additional protein(s) that recruit the preciliary vesicle to the centriole.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How the preciliary vesicle is transported to the distal appendage</title><p>Our model suggests that the preciliary vesicle is recruited to the distal appendage in a microtubule-dependent manner, whereas NCS1 can reach to the mother centriole without intact microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). How is the preciliary vesicle recruited to the distal appendage? Classically, subdistal appendages were considered as the site where the microtubule anchoring occurs, as the electron micrograph showed that microtubule are in contact with the head of the subdistal appendage (see Figure 12 of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vorobjev and Chentsov Yu, 1982</xref>). The subdistal appendage localization of Ninein, which was shown to be indispensable for microtubule anchoring at the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>), further supports that subdistal appendages are the contact site of the microtubule. Therefore, one can hypothesize that the preciliary vesicle is transported first to the subdistal appendage and then subsequently moves to the distal appendage by an unknown mechanism. Interestingly, CEP89 and its interactors, NCS1 and CEP15, each localize to positions near the subdistal appendage in addition to their distal appendage localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chong et al., 2020</xref>). NCS1 may bind to the preciliary vesicle at the subdistal appendage and then move to the distal appendage to anchor the vesicle and promote cilium formation. Possibly this process is rapid, so that any vesicle attached to the subdistal appendage has never been observed in electron micrographs. However, this model conflicts with the observation that subdistal appendages are dispensable for cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, microtubules may populate a structural site around the distal appendages as shown by recent dSTORM imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chong et al., 2020</xref>). γ-Tubulin observed in vicinity of the distal appendage may nucleate those microtubules. If this is the case, the preciliary vesicle may be transported directly to the distal appendage and then be captured by NCS1. To address this question, it would be greatly informative if the entire preciliary vesicle recruitment process could be visualized by super-resolution microscopy in live cells in a future study. Another important question is whether NCS1 specifically recognizes a receptor on the preciliary vesicle or NCS1 randomly captures the membrane of vesicles that arrive at the distal appendage. NCS1 may recognize specific vesicles via the membrane curvature or specific lipid components. Interestingly, a recent study showed that NCS1 preferentially binds to phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baksheeva et al., 2020</xref>). This warrants future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Requirement of NCS1 in cilium formation differs among cell types</title><p>Cilium formation can be classified into two types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sorokin, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>): (1) the intracellular pathway, which is initiated by preciliary vesicle recruitment to the distal appendage, and (2) the extracellular pathway, where the centriole first docks to plasma membrane. While specific cell types have been observed to selectively use one of the two pathways, the distinction between the pathways might not be so definitive. For example, mouse inner medullary collecting duct cells (mIMCD3), typically classified as using the extracellular pathway, can use the intracellular pathway in less confluent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, the requirement for RAB34,the centriole-associated vesicle marker, in ciliogenesis is more pronounced in the cells that use the intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ganga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oguchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stuck et al., 2021</xref>), indicating that preciliary vesicle recruitment is an indispensable step for that pathway. Our data showed that cilium formation is modestly affected by NCS1 depletion in the cell types that are known to use intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>), such as RPE and MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A and 7E</xref>). In contrast, we did not see apparent cilia formation defects in primary neurons isolated from E18.5 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). A possible explanation for this is that the neurons use the extracellular pathway, however, the ciliogenesis pathway for neurons is not well characterized. The papers reported the presence of the ciliary pocket, a sign of the intracellular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Molla-Herman et al., 2010</xref>), in electron micrographs of Grueneberg ganglion neurons from young mice (P15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brechbühl et al., 2008</xref>) and neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Breunig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mirzadeh et al., 2008</xref>). Recent volume electron microscopy studies, however, suggested that cortical and hippocampal neurons from adult animals typically do not possess apparent ciliary pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wu et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, the ciliogenesis pathways in neurons may differ depending on subtypes or during development. While we do not know the ciliogenesis pathway that our primary hippocampal neurons used, the lack of cilium formation defect may be because the cells use the extracellular pathway. Future studies will focus on determining the requirement of NCS1 in the extracellular pathway. Another possible explanation for a failure to see cilium formation defects is that it is not easy to assess the kinetics of ciliation in isolated hippocampal neurons because culture conditions are very different from RPE cells. Notably, cilium formation is not induced by serum starvation in isolated hippocampal neurons. In tissues in vivo, it was not easy to assess whether the <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have fewer cilia than the control mice for several reasons. First, cilium structure is greatly affected by sample preparation. For example, we cannot visualize cilia if we do not fix the tissues by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and it is difficult to achieve perfectly efficient perfusion. Second, orientation of cilia is affected by the orientation of how the tissue is sectioned and it is thus difficult to analyze cilia that elongate perpendicularly to the slice. Therefore, we could not test whether NCS1 is required for cilium formation in cells that typically use the extracellular pathway. These questions warrant future studies. Importantly, we did observe a decrease in ciliary localization of several membrane proteins, such as ARL13B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) and ADCY3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells, even when the percentage of ciliated cells was comparable to the control cells. This may suggest that NCS1 might be involved in recruiting membrane signaling proteins to the cilium besides its function in preciliary vesicle recruitment and cilium formation. It would be interesting to test in the future studies if other ciliary membrane proteins are also brought to the cilium via ciliary vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>NCS1</italic> may be a ciliopathy gene</title><p>Given that NCS1 is involved in preciliary vesicle recruitment and subsequent cilium formation, we tested if <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibit ciliopathy phenotypes. Our data showed that <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice display a modest obesity phenotype, but no other apparent ciliopathy-related phenotypes, including retinal degeneration. The absence of retinal degeneration may be explained by the lack of Ncs1 at the ciliary base in photoreceptors. A possible explanation for the lack of other ciliopathy phenotypes is the partial penetrance of these other symptoms. In human, obesity and retinal degeneration is observed in most Bardet–Biedl syndrome patients (−90%), whereas other phenotypes, such as hypogonadism and kidney disease are often absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Forsyth and Gunay-Aygun, 2020</xref>). Mice lacking the distal appendage protein, FBF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) or ANKRD26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bera et al., 2008</xref>), or the distal appendage associate protein CEP19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shalata et al., 2013</xref>), display morbid obesity with few other ciliopathy-related phenotypes (e.g., preweaning lethality and hydrocephalus in <italic>Fbf1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and male infertility in <italic>Cep19</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice). Interestingly, our data reveal that knockouts of each of these genes in RPE1-hTERT cells show a kinetic defect in ciliation, but the cells eventually catch up to complete cilium formation (Figure 5A, B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref> for ANKRD26 and FBF1 Figure 3C of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kanie et al., 2017</xref> for CEP19). This phenotype is almost identical to that observed in <italic>CEP89</italic> or <italic>NCS1</italic> knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This suggests that quantitative defects in cilium formation defect may drive obesity with few other ciliopathy-related defects. Another explanation for the lack of other ciliopathy phenotypes besides obesity is the background of our <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (C57BL/6J). It is well known that depletion of the same gene could cause different severity of the phenotypes in different background of mice. For example, mice lacking Bbip1, a BBSome-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loktev et al., 2008</xref>), in pure C57BL/6J background show complete perinatal lethality, while approximately half of the <italic>Bbip1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in 129/SvJ background can survive into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loktev and Jackson, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, two independent reports showed that <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> exhibit partial (−50%) preweaning lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>) in C57BL/6N mice. The difference in the severity of the phenotypes in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice between previous reports and our results may be explained by the difference between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N. Genetic and phenotypic differences between these two strains were extensively described in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Simon et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, NCS1 may be a ciliopathy gene and obesity caused by NCS1 depletion may be attributable to ciliary defect. This warrants future genetic study. If obesity accompanied with NCS1 depletion is due to a cilia defect, what kind of cilia defect exist in the <italic>Ncs1</italic> defective animals in vivo? A simple defect may be the reduced number of ciliated cells because of the cilium formation defect. While we did not see an apparent decrease in the number of cilia in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in any tissues that we examined (e.g., brain, kidney, pancreatic islets, and airway epithelia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), more accurate characterization is needed to make a conclusion. It is possible that cilium formation is abolished in developmentally and spatially regulated manner, so that the defect may be only apparent in specific cell types and developmental stage. Another possibility that may cause cilia-related obesity phenotype in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is that localization of some of the ciliary membrane proteins may be abolished in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells as shown in the cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Unfortunately, it is not easy to assess the number and morphology of the cilia as well as signal intensity of the ciliary membrane proteins in vivo because of the issues described above. Technical improvement in the future may allow us to more accurately characterize the cilia in vivo and determine whether ciliary defects in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice indeed cause obesity. Alternatively, it would be interesting to see if <italic>Cep89</italic> knockout mice display the similar phenotypes as <italic>Ncs1</italic> knockout mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The connection between NCS1-related neurological disorder and cilia defect</title><p>NCS1 has been shown to participate in memory formation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gomez et al., 2001</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Saab et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Rezende et al., 2014</xref>). While the neurological phenotypes in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are not consistent across studies, possibly because of the differences in mouse background, it seems that many studies agree that the overall phenotypes are mild, and the mice display defects in memory formation, when tested for novel object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Rezende et al., 2014</xref>) or displaced object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). It is intriguing to consider whether the memory formation defect in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is attributable to ciliary defects. Several lines of evidence suggest that loss of cilia in brain results in memory formation defects. If IFT88, an IFT component critical for formation of the cilium, is depleted in telencephalon by Emx1-Cre, the mice display impaired recognition memory assessed through novel object recognition test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berbari et al., 2014</xref>). The depletion of IFT20 in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus using AAV-CAMKII-Cre caused the defect in displaced object recognition test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rhee et al., 2016</xref>). Both mice lacking ADCY3 or SSTR3, ciliary membrane proteins that are prominent in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>), exhibit defect in novel object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Einstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). The similarity between cilia-defective mice and <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice may suggest that the memory formation defect in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>-deficient mice may be due to ciliary dysfunction. It would be interesting to test whether SSTR3 agonist, which induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Einstein et al., 2010</xref>) likely via binding to the ciliary G-protein-coupled receptor, SSTR3, can induce LTP in <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. It would be also interesting to see if Cep89 depletion in mice causes similar memory formation defect, since <italic>NCS1</italic> knockouts and <italic>CEP89</italic> knockouts showed almost identical cilium formation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

After the buffer was replaced with Optima water, the bands were cut into eight pieces, followed by washing twice with 500 µl of 50% acetonitrile in Optima water. The gel slices were then reduced and alkylated followed by destaining and in-gel digestion using 125 ng Trypsin/LysC (V5072, Promega) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>) with the addition of Protease Max (V2071, Promega) to increase digestion efficiency. Tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel bands and dried in a speed vac. Prior to LC–MS, each sample was reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, and water. NanoAcquity (Waters) LC instrument was set at a flow rate of either 300 or 450 nl/min where mobile phase A was 0.2% formic acid in water and mobile phase B was 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile. The analytical column was in-house pulled and packed using C18 Reprosil Pur 2.4 µM (Dr. Maisch) where the I.D. was 100 µM and the column length was 20–25 cm. Peptide pools were directly injected onto the analytical column in which linear gradients (4–40% B) were of either 80 or 120 min eluting peptides into the mass spectrometer. Either the Orbitrap Elite or Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometers were used, where a top 15 or ‘fastest’ MS/MS data acquisition was used, respectively. MS/MS was acquired using CID with a collisional energy of 32–35. In a typical analysis, RAW files were processed using Byonic (Protein Metrics) using 12 ppm mass accuracy limits for precursors and 0.4 Da mass accuracy limits for MS/MS spectra. MS/MS data were compared to an NCBI GenBank FASTA database containing all human proteomic isoforms with the exception of the tandem affinity bait construct sequence and common contaminant proteins. Spectral counts were assumed to have undergone fully specific proteolysis and allowing up to two missed cleavages per peptide.

The minced tissue is lysed in tissue lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, and 1% NP-40 (11332473001, Roche Applied Science)) for 15 min.

The lysate was mixed to prepare a sample containing 4 mg/ml lysate, 1× LDS buffer, and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol. 50 µg (for NCS1 blot) or 12 µg (for other proteins) were loaded onto NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gels.

In most cases, cell lines were thawed from liquid nitrogen at different dates and immunostaining was performed at different dates among the replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification of fluorescent intensity and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Fluorescent intensity measurement</title><p>The fluorescent intensity was measured with 16-bit TIFF multi-color stack images acquired at 63× magnification (NA1.4) by using ImageJ software. To measure the fluorescent intensity of centrosomal proteins, channels containing CEP170 and the protein of interest (POI) were individually extracted into separate images. A rolling ball background subtraction with a rolling ball radius of 5 pixels was implemented for both CEP170 and the POI to perform local background subtraction. The mask for both CEP170 and the POI was created by setting the lower threshold to the minimum level that covers only centrosome. Each mask was then combined by converting the two masks to a stack followed by z-projection and then dilating the mask until the two masks are merged. After eroding the dilated masks several times, the fluorescent intensity of the POI was measured via ‘analyze particles’ command with optimal size and circularity. The size and circularity are optimized for individual POI to detect most of the centrosome in the image without capturing non-centrosomal structure. Outliers (likely non-centrosomal structure) were then excluded from the data using the ROUT method with a false discovery rate of 1% using GraphPad Prism 9 software. Fluorescent intensity of ciliary proteins was measured similar to centrosomal proteins but with several modifications. Mask was created for ciliary proteins by setting the lower threshold to the minimum level that covers only cilia. The size and circularity are optimized for individual POI to detect only cilia without capturing non-ciliary structure. Macros used for the intensity measurement are available from ‘Source Data 2—Macro for measuring fluorescent intensity of centrosomal proteins’ and ‘Source Data 3—Macro for measuring fluorescent intensity of ciliary proteins’ in an accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kanie et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the difference in the signal intensity is statistically different between control and test samples, the intensity measured through the described method was compared between control and test samples using nested one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test or nested t-test if there are more than two replicates. In case, there are less than three replicates, the statistical test was not performed in a single experiment, as the signal intensity is affected slightly by staining procedure and statistical significance is affected largely by the number of cells examined. For example, we saw statistical significance in the signal intensity with the same samples that are stained independently if we analyze large number of the cells (more than 100 cells). Instead, we confirmed the same tendency in the change of fluorescent intensity in the test samples across two replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-2"><title>Statistical analysis for ciliation, preciliary vesicle recruitment, and CP110 removal assay</title><p>For ciliation, preciliary vesicle recruitment, and CP110 removal assay, the number of ciliated cells from the indicated number of replicates was compared between control (sgGFP or sgSafe) and the test samples using Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test.

fundamental implications for understanding the early steps of ciliary assembly, furthering also a broader understanding of NCS1. Prior to this work, studies of NCS1 were focused on its roles in neurotransmission, but now must be considered in a larger context. The investigators used a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies to arrive at compelling conclusions.

As you can see from the reviews detailed below, the work was well received.

We wrote “A series of previous genetic studies in mice showed that the loss of ciliary function results in a variety of disorders ranging from developmental defects, including neural tube defect, skeletal anomalies as well as left-right patterning defects, to obesity, retinal degeneration, cystic kidney diseases, liver fibrosis, and male infertility {Norris, 2012 #166}. The phenotypes found in ciliopathy mouse models greatly vary depending on the timing of gene deletion and which ciliopathy gene is mutated in the model, likely reflecting the differences in the severity of the defects in cilium formation and function, as well as the cell types that the gene mutations affect.”</p><p>We also compared the phenotypes of <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with those of the mice deficient in distal appendage proteins and discussed this in the “Discussion”. We wrote “Mice lacking the distal appendage protein, FBF1 (Zhang et al., 2021) or ANKRD26 (Acs et al., 2015) (Bera et al., 2008), or the distal appendage associated protein CEP19 (Shalata et al., 2013), display morbid obesity with few other ciliopathy-related phenotypes (e.g., preweaning lethality and hydrocephalus in Fbf1<sup>-/-</sup> and male infertility in Cep19<sup>-/-</sup> mice). Interestingly, our data reveal that knockouts of each of these genes in RPE1-hTERT cells show a kinetic defect in ciliation, but that the cells eventually catch up to complete cilium formation (Figure 5A and B in (Tomoharu Kanie et al., 2023) for ANKRD26 and FBF1) (Figure 3C of (T. Kanie et al., 2017) for CEP19). This phenotype is almost identical to that observed in CEP89 or NCS1 knockout cells (Figure 3A). This suggests that quantitative defects in cilium formation defect may drive obesity with few other ciliopathy-related defects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points</p><p>Why don't the numbers add up in Figure 3D? 22/41 and 16/41</p></disp-quote><p>41 cells analyzed for the cells expressing sgGFP include three ciliated cells. 22 of the centrioles did not have vesicle, 16 for the centrioles had vesicles, and 3 of the centrioles had primary cilia as shown in Figure 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the evidence that Rab34 is not the NCS1-redundant factor that is sought in Figure 4?</p></disp-quote><p>positive ciliary vesicle to the mother centrioles. Because RAB34 knockout cells show severe ciliation defects, stronger than NCS1 knockouts, we assumed additional factors cooperate with NCS1 for RAB34 recruitment. We cannot exclude the possibility that RAB34 may have multiple functions including a NCS1-redundant function. But we are fairly sure that additional distal appendage proteins remain to be found for this function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The tissue staining in Figure 7 is not convincing.

We agree that the term ‘ciliary vesicle’ that we used is confusing, and changed the word to preciliary vesicle, distal appendage vesicle, and centriole-associated vesicle in the text. We also clarified our definition in the discussion.</p><p>In terms of our statement “'first known mechanism for how the distal appendages recruit the ciliary vesicles”, some of the membrane-associated proteins that were shown to localize to ciliary vesicle/preciliary vesicle/distal appendage vesicle (e.g., RAB8) may be functionally linked to distal appendage proteins [PMID: 29244804][PMID: 23253480], but none of them were shown to localize to the distal appendages. So, we believe it would not be an overstatement to say that NCS1 is the first distal appendage protein that directly associates with the ciliary vesicle/distal appendage vesicle/preciliary vesicle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The mouse knockout studies are more preliminary in nature given additional experimental options that need to be explored to fully conclude the essential nature of NCS1. One suggestion would be to combine Figures 7 and 8 to focus on the key findings from the mouse studies while placing some data in supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree that significant amount of work is needed to understand physiological importance of NCS1 in ciliary function in vivo. However, we think it would be valuable for cilia/NCS1 community to show that Ncs1 localizes to the ciliary base in various tissues (Figure 7A-D), may affect ciliary formation and function (Figure 7E-H), and Ncs1 knockout mice may exhibit ciliopathy related phenotypes (Figure 8), especially given that Ncs1 has been characterized mainly in neurotransmission, neurite growth, and regulation of membrane trafficking in neurons. Future studies will determine whether the neurological phenotypes in the absence of Ncs1 is attributable to ciliary dysfunction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The requirement for TTBK2 in NCS1 distal appendage localization is interesting. Can the authors rule out that TTBK2 phosphorylation of NCS1 is not important for distal appendage localization?</p></disp-quote><p>It is certainly interesting that TTBK2 affects localization of NCS1 without affecting CEP89 localization. We currently do not know whether NCS1 can be phosphorylated by TTBK2. TTBK2 may affect localization of NCS1 through phosphorylation of other distal appendage proteins, such as CEP89 and CEP83, both of which were shown to be phosphorylated by TTBK2. This warrants future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Were double knockouts of C3ORF14 and NCS1 considered to see if there is more than an additive effect on ciliogenesis disruption and possible compensatory effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test if C3ORF14 compensates the lack of NCS1, because CEP89 knockout cells showed very similar cilium formation defect to NCS1 knockout cells, while the centriolar localization of both NCS1 and C3ORF14 was almost completely lost in CEP89 knockout cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Investigating NCS1 depletion/knockout in cells thought to use the extracellular pathway such as IMCD3 cells would be interesting to determine if this can explain differences in ciliogenesis effects observed in mice/neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree that it is important to test the role of NCS1 in cilium formation in mIMCD3 cells, which was shown to use extracellular pathway for their cilia formation. This warrants future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Did the authors check to see if cilia length was affected in NCS1 knockouts? Related in Figure 7—figure supplement 2 B ependymal cilia seem shorter or affected in NCS-/- cells, and were not commented on in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s advice we checked cilia length in CEP89, NCS1, and C3ORF14 knockout cells, and found no significant difference between control and these knockout cells (see new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the cilia length in ependymal cells shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2B looked different between <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We believe this difference likely comes from the difference in orientation of the tissue sections. In the Figure 7—figure supplement 2B, the brain slice of the <italic>Ncs1</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice was perpendicular to the ventricular surface, whereas the ependymal cells in Ncs1-/- mice were cut diagonally. The purpose of the figure was to show the ciliary base localization of Ncs1, and we did not pay much attention to the orientation of the ependymal cilia. We agree that this figure is confusing, and decided to replace the images (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>To understand whether Ncs1 affects the cilia length in ependymal cells, substantial number of images are required to accurately measure cilia length in tissue sections, as the measurement can be affected by the orientation of the sections. We currently do not have enough images to perform this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is the image of CEP83 and NCS1 in Figure 2G representative, of some obvious overlap of signals and others that do not overlap? A top view image for CEP89 and NCS1 localization in Figure 2G would be helpful to show this colocalization relationship better.</p></disp-quote><p>The position of each signal is affected by several factors, including the orientation of the centriole and how the primary/secondary antibodies attach to the target. NCS1 signal seems to be partially overlapped at the right side of the centriole in Figure 2G, but the peak signal of NCS1 was 50 nm away from that of CEP89 when we analyzed the picture using “profile plot” in the Image J. The difference in the distance of the peak signal between CEP89 and NCS1 was 90 nm at the left side of the centriole, confirming that NCS1 is located slightly above CEP89 at both side of the centriole. The same issue can be observed in Figure 2H, where RAB34 and NCS1 signal partially overlaps at the left side of the centriole with minimal signal overlap at the right side of the centriole. This level of asymmetry is difficult to avoid since the perfectly oriented centrioles are rarely found in the microscope slides. Therefore, we analyzed a lot of centrioles both from top and side view and compared with different markers to conclude the position shown in the cartoons of Figure 2D-I.</p></body></sub-article></article>
