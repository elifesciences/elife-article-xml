We previously discovered that grooming of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> antennae is elicited by an antennal mechanosensory chordotonal organ, the Johnston’s organ (JO) (Hampel et al., 2015). Here, we describe anatomically and physiologically distinct JO mechanosensory neuron subpopulations that each elicit antennal grooming. We show that the subpopulations project to different, discrete zones in the brain and differ in their responses to mechanical stimulation of the antennae. Although activation of each subpopulation elicits antennal grooming, distinct subpopulations also elicit the additional behaviors of wing flapping or backward locomotion. Our results provide a comprehensive description of the diversity of mechanosensory neurons in the JO, and reveal that distinct JO subpopulations can elicit both common and distinct behavioral responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>grooming</kwd><kwd>Johnston's organ</kwd><kwd>chordotonal organ</kwd><kwd>connectomics</kwd><kwd>topographic map</kwd><kwd>mechanosensory neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-12-69</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seeds</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006545</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MD007600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seeds</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hampel</surname><given-names>Stefanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Seeds</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008902</institution-id><institution>Puerto Rico Science, Technology and Research Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-00195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seeds</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HRD-1736019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seeds</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anatomically and physiologically distinct subpopulations of mechanosensory neurons on the fruit fly antennae elicit both common and distinct behavioral responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals can detect complex mechanical forces in their environments through diverse mechanosensory neuron types that produce different sensations and influence appropriate behavioral responses. These neurons display diverse tuning to mechanical stimuli and differ widely in their peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>). One defining feature of mechanosensory neurons is that their axonal projections from the body periphery terminate in an orderly topographical arrangement in discrete zones of the CNS. Different types of topographical organization are described across the diversity of mechanosensory neuron types based on features such as their responses to particular frequencies of sound (tonotopy) or their locations across the body (somatotopy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erzurumlu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Muniak et al., 2015</xref>). Although topographical organization is thought to provide a means by which sensory neurons connect with the appropriate neural circuits in the CNS that facilitate relevant behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thivierge and Marcus, 2007</xref>), it remains unclear how sensory topography interfaces with the CNS behavioral circuitry. Critical for addressing this question is to define the anatomical and physiological diversity of the mechanosensory neurons that make up this topography, and link them to the diverse behaviors that they influence.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Johnston’s organ (JO), a chordotonal organ in the antennae, is an excellent system in which to study how mechanosensory topography influences behavior. The JO detects diverse types of mechanical forces that move the antennae, including sound, wind, gravity, wing beats, and tactile displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). The ability of the JO to respond to these different stimuli is conferred by about 480 mechanosensory neurons called JONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Subpopulations of JONs are selectively excited by different vibrational frequencies or by sustained displacements of the antennae and send their projections into discrete zones in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). In accordance with their diverse physiological tuning properties, the JONs are implicated in controlling diverse behaviors including courtship, locomotion, gravitaxis, wind-guided orientation, escape, flight, and grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lehnert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mamiya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tootoonian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). However, efforts to define how the different JONs interface with downstream neural circuitry to influence these behaviors have been hampered by the incomplete description of the morphologically heterogeneous JON types within each subpopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of behaviors that are influenced by different JON subpopulations remains incomplete.</p><p>We previously discovered that activation of different JON subpopulations elicits antennal grooming behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>), which involves the grasping and brushing of the antennae by the front legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Böröczky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson, 1996</xref>). However, we did not determine the extent to which these subpopulations were anatomically and physiologically distinct from each other, or whether behaviors other than grooming could be elicited by activating these JONs. In work presented here, we first define the JON morphological diversity by reconstructing major portions of each subpopulation from a complete serial-section electron microscopy (EM) volume of the adult fruit fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). We next produce transgenic driver lines that selectively target expression in each subpopulation. These lines enable us to visualize the distribution of the different subpopulations in the antennae and determine that they respond differently to mechanical stimuli. Optogenetic activation experiments confirm our previous finding that each JON subpopulation can elicit grooming of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). However, we report here that one subpopulation of JONs also elicits wing flapping movements while another subpopulation elicits the avoidance response of backward locomotion. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive description of the topography of the JO, and reveal that different JON subpopulations whose projections occupy different points in topographical space can elicit common and distinct behavioral responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EM-based reconstruction of different JON subpopulations</title><p>We first sought to define the morphological diversity of the neurons within each JON subpopulation. JONs project from the antennae through the antennal nerve into a region of the ventral brain called the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The projections of different subpopulations form discrete zones in the AMMC (zones A-F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). JONs that respond exclusively to antennal vibrations project laterally into zones A and B (called JO-A and -B neurons), whereas JONs that are tuned to antennal vibrations and/or sustained displacements project medially into zones C-E (JO-C, -D, and -E neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). We previously discovered the aJO subpopulation of JONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>), which we now rename as 'JO-F' neurons based on their projections to 'zone F' that we newly designate here. JO-F neurons enter the brain through the AMMC like other JONs, but then project ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, blue JONs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). While the majority of JONs project to a single zone, additional JONs have been described that have branches projecting to multiple zones (called JO-mz neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Because our previous work implicated JO-C, -E, and -F neurons in antennal grooming behavior, we reconstructed these subpopulations within a serial-section EM volume of the entire fruit fly brain to define their morphological diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EM-based reconstruction of JONs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) JON projections from the second antennal segment (a2) into the AMMC brain region (brain neuropile shown in gray).

A confocal z-stack of a driver line (R27H08-GAL4) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in these JON subpopulations was registered into the EM volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). We then examined the JON axon bundle where the antennal nerve enters the brain and found that the GFP had highlighted the medial region of the bundle where the JO-C, -E, and -F neurons were previously described to reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Lateral to this region were the previously reconstructed JO-A and -B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). We reconstructed 147 JONs within the GFP-highlighted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). 104 were completely reconstructed, including all of their pre- and post-synaptic sites. The remaining 43 JONs were reconstructed using an autosegmentation algorithm that identified the main branches, but not finer branches or synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). These latter JONs were useful for examining gross morphology, but not for determining connectivity with other neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reconstructed JONs form a topographical map</title><p>JON topography can be defined based on the segregated organization of the different zones in the AMMC and the stereotyped projections of the JONs to discrete subareas in each zone. We therefore compared previous light-microscopy-based descriptions of these two features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>) with our EM-reconstructed JONs to categorize these neurons as projecting to specific zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>). This not only confirmed that we had reconstructed JO-C, -E, and -F neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E,F</xref>), but revealed that we had also reconstructed JO-D neurons, as well as JO-mz neurons that project to multiple zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,G</xref>). Thus, the projections of the different reconstructed JON subpopulations form a topographical map that resembles the one obtained from light-level anatomical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The topographical organization described above was based on the projections of the JONs. We next addressed the extent to which this organization was reflected at the synaptic level. Previous immunohistochemical studies indicated that JON presynaptic sites are broadly distributed in the posterior regions of each zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). We found that the synapses of the 104 completely reconstructed JONs were also distributed throughout the posterior regions of their respective zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–M</xref>). Because these synapses included both pre- and post-synaptic sites, we compared their relative distributions in each zone. Examination of the total distribution of synapses did not reveal any clear difference, as the subareas of each zone had both pre- and post-synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). Taken together, our results show that different JONs project in a segregated manner and form discrete zones and subareas that contain both pre- and post-synaptic sites. Thus, JONs in these subareas can interface with downstream neurons, but they are likely also subject to regulation by other neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Contributions of morphologically distinct JON types to the JO topographical map</title><p>The EM reconstructions enabled us to next systematically identify the morphologically distinct JON types within each subpopulation, and then define how these types contribute to the topographical organization of each zone. We visually inspected the reconstructed JO-C, -D, -E, and -F neurons and found that they could be categorized into different types based on morphological similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). However, the reconstructed JO-mz neurons showed no such similarity and could not be categorized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). As an independent categorization method, we used the NBLAST clustering algorithm that uses spatial location and neuronal morphology to calculate similarity between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement with our manual annotations, the algorithm clustered most of the same JONs that we had assigned as specific types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>). In a few cases, we found disagreement between the NBLAST clustering and our manual annotations.

The subareas formed by the reconstructed JONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left) were compared with those observed in the confocal light-microscopy images of each driver line expressing mCD8::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, middle and right). Both lines express in JONs projecting to the subareas CL, EDP, EVP, EDM, EDC, and EVM. Because each subarea is formed by specific JON types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we could deduce that both lines express in JO-CL, -EDC, -EDM, -EDP, -EVM, and -EVP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Importantly, neither line expresses in JO-F neurons as there are no ventral-projecting JONs in their patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We concluded that the JO-C/E-1 and −2 driver lines express specifically in JO-C and -E neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>The JO-F-1 and −2 driver lines express in JONs projecting to each zone F subarea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Based on the EM-reconstructed JON types that form each subarea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we predicted that both lines would express in JO-FVA, -FDL, -FVL, -FDA, and -FDP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). However, it was unclear if the lines also expressed in JO-E neurons because of the possibility that these JONs were obscured in confocal images by the JO-FDA and -FDP neurons. Therefore, we used the multicolor flipout (MCFO) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nern et al., 2015</xref>) to stochastically label individual JONs within each pattern, and thereby identified the JO-FDA, -FDP, -FDL, -FVL, and -FVA neurons, with the majority of them being JO-FDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). A portion of the labeled JONs projected to zone E and had a posterior projection, leading us to propose they are JO-EVP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). However, the lines only weakly labeled the EVP subarea as compared with the JO-F subareas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), suggesting that a relatively small number of JO-EVP neurons are labeled. We concluded that JO-F-1 and −2 express mostly in JO-F neurons, but also in JO-EVP neurons. Of note, JO-F-1 and −2 appear to express in the same JON types as our previously reported JO-F driver line named aJO-spGAL4-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To visualize the extent to which the JO-C/E and -F driver lines express in distinct JON subpopulations, we computationally aligned confocal stacks of their expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>, left panels). This shows how the different driver lines express in JON subpopulations that project into distinct zones. Further, the morphology of the aligned projections was very similar to the EM-reconstructed JO-C/E and -F neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>, right panels). This provides further support that the different lines selectively target the JO-C/E or -F neurons.</p><p>We next compared the distributions of the JONs that are labeled by the different driver lines in the JO chordotonal organ. The JON cell bodies are organized into a bottomless bowl-shaped array in the second antennal segment that can be visualized by labeling the JON nuclei using an antibody against the ELAV protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Expression of GFP under control of JO-C/E-1 and −2 labeled JON cell bodies in a ring around the JO bowl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). In contrast to the previously published JO-C/E drivers that showed expression around the entire ring of the JO bowl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>), JO-C/E-1 and −2 showed only sparse expression around the anterior dorsal (A-D) portion of the bowl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C’,D’</xref>). JO-F-1 and −2 showed expression in two clusters in the dorsal and ventral regions of the JO bowl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), in agreement with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). The dorsal expression was in the anterior and posterior regions of the bowl (A-D and P-D), while the ventral expression was largely restricted to the posterior (P-V) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E’,F’</xref>). In contrast to what we previously reported, JO-F-1 and −2 expression was not restricted to the dorsal and ventral clusters, but was also in more intermediate JONs in the posterior part of the bowl. This prompted us to reexamine JO-F driver lines from our previous work for evidence that they also expressed in these intermediate JONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, these lines show relatively faint GFP signal in intermediate JONs in the posterior bowl (not shown). This suggests that the distribution of JONs targeted by the different JO-F driver lines is more continuous, rather than restricted to clusters. A comparison of the distributions of JONs that are targeted by the JO-C/E and -F driver lines revealed that they occupy common (P-D and P-V) and distinct (A-D [JO-F] and A-V [JO-C/E]) regions of the JO bowl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’–F’</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>JO chordotonal organ distribution of JONs that are targeted by JO-C/E and F driver lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anterior view of the antennal region of the head with the JON nuclei labeled with an anti-ELAV antibody in the second antennal segment (labeled a2, third segment is labeled a3).

Furthermore, we could not identify a vibration frequency that could evoke a response in these JONs, including low (40 Hz, N = 2 flies), middle (200 Hz, N = 10 flies), and high frequency vibrations (400 and 800 Hz, N = 2 flies) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2A–D</xref>, 200 Hz test shown). We confirmed that the JONs were competent to respond to stimuli by applying KCl at the end of each experiment and observing an increased GCaMP6f signal (not shown). Thus, it remains to be determined what stimulus excites these JONs (see Discussion). However, our results indicate that JO-C/E and -F neurons do not show similar responses to mechanical stimuli in immobilized flies.

Five-second optogenetic stimulation of the JO-C/E neurons elicited grooming that lasted throughout the duration of the stimulus. In contrast, the JO-F neurons elicited shorter duration grooming that terminated prior to stimulus cessation. We considered the trivial possibility that these distinct durations of grooming were caused by differences in the number of activated JONs that were targeted in each line. However, the average number of labeled JONs did not differ markedly between the JO-C/E and -F driver lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–F</xref>).

The wings would extend to approximately 45–90-degree angles from the body axis while flapping.

A recent study used a serial-section EM volume of the adult fruit fly brain to reconstruct a major portion of the JO-A and -B neurons, demonstrating the utility of this approach for defining JON diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). In work presented here, we used this same EM volume to reconstruct the JO-C, -D, -E, -F, and -mz neurons. It remains unclear what proportion of the JO-D, -F, and -mz neurons we have reconstructed. However, it was previously estimated that there are about 200 JO-C and -E neurons total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that we reconstructed 36% of the JO-C and -E neurons (71 reconstructed out of 200).</p><p>Two lines of evidence suggested that the EM-reconstructed JONs represent the major diversity of the JO-C, -D, -E, and -F neurons. First, when the reconstructed JONs were viewed <italic>in toto,</italic> we could observe each previously described subarea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). This suggested that we had not missed JONs that are major contributors to these subareas. Second, the JONs could be categorized based on their morphological similarities to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). The fact that we reconstructed multiple morphologically similar JONs suggests that we captured the diversity of each subpopulation. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that reconstruction of more JONs would uncover additional diversity, our reconstructions provide the most comprehensive description of the JO-C, -D, -E, -F, and -mz neurons to date. In combination with the previously reconstructed JO-A and -B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), we now provide a near complete description of the diversity of JONs that make up each subpopulation in the JO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This will provide a valuable resource for studies seeking to understand the neural circuit basis of the JO chordotonal organ’s functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic connectivity among the JONs</title><p>This study begins to address the connectivity of the JONs with the finding that they are synaptically connected with each other. This is not a new observation, as previous work showed that the JONs have axo-axonal electrical and chemical synaptic connections with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sivan-Loukianova and Eberl, 2005</xref>). However, we find that this connectivity is largely restricted to JONs belonging to the same subpopulation, including the JO-C, -D, -E, and -F neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Preferential connectivity among JONs within a particular subpopulation has also been shown for the JO-A and -B neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).

Why do these different JON subpopulations each elicit grooming? Given the evidence that the subpopulations are tuned to different mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>), one possible explanation is that the JONs detect different stimuli to which the fly would appropriately respond with antennal grooming. In support of this hypothesis, different stimuli have been shown to elicit antennal grooming, including debris on the body surface (e.g. dust) and mechanical displacements of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phillis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, neuronal silencing experiments have linked the JO-C/E neurons to the grooming response to dust and the JO-F neurons to the grooming response to antennal displacement: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2020</xref> recently reported that dust-elicited grooming could be disrupted by expression of tetanus toxin using a driver line that appears to target the JO-C/E neurons, while we previously found that expression of tetanus toxin in JO-F neurons (using aJO-spGAL4-1) disrupted the grooming response to displacements of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). These studies suggest that the JON subpopulations detect these different mechanical stimuli and initiate the grooming response.</p><p>Although there is currently no physiologically based corroboration that JO-C/E neurons are tuned to respond to dust on the antennae or that JO-F neurons are tuned to antennal displacements, our present study shows that the JO-C/E and -F neurons indeed respond differently to distinct stimulations of the antennae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). It has been shown that the JO-C/E neurons respond to sustained pushes or pulls of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>), and we confirmed that result here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). However, it remains to be demonstrated whether dust can sufficiently displace the antennae to excite the JO-C/E neurons. Based on our previous behavioral experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>), we expected that sustained antennal displacements would evoke responses in the JO-F (formerly aJO) neurons. Therefore, it is puzzling that the JO-F neurons did not respond to antennal displacements here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). One possible limitation to the experimental approach taken in this study is that we tested the JON responses to different stimuli using an immobilized fly preparation. It is possible that a response to one of the tested stimuli could only be observed when the flies are freely behaving. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>, the necessity of the JO-F neurons for the grooming response to displacements of the antennae was demonstrated using a behavioral assay whereby flies were tethered in a behavioral rig in which they were able to walk freely on a ball. There is precedent for the JONs responding differently to stimuli depending on behavioral state, as the JO-C/E neurons respond to sustained pushes and pulls of the antennae in immobilized flies, while those neurons respond to high frequency wings beats only while flies are flying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>). Therefore, responses of the JO-F neurons to antennal displacements might be observed using an experimental preparation that enables flies to move freely while being imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Neural circuit basis of JON-induced antennal grooming</title><p>How do distinct subpopulations of JONs induce antennal grooming? We previously found that the JONs elicit grooming by activating a neural circuit that elicits or 'commands' grooming of the antennae and comprises three different morphologically distinct interneuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). Two types are located where the JON projections terminate in the ventral brain and were named antennal grooming brain interneurons 1 and 2 (aBN1 and aBN2). The third type includes a cluster of descending neurons (aDNs) that have their dendrites in the ventral brain and axonal projections in the ventral nerve cord. The aDNs are the proposed outputs of the antennal grooming command circuit because they project to the region of the ventral nerve cord where the circuitry for generating antennal grooming leg movement patterns is presumed to be located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berkowitz and Laurent, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burrows, 1996</xref>). The JO-C, -E, and -F neurons are in close proximity to these different interneuron types, and at least one subpopulation is functionally connected with the command circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that different JON subpopulations converge onto the command circuit to control grooming behavior. The EM reconstructions established in this work provide the foundation for a future study that will address the connectivity of the JONs with the command circuit that controls antenna-directed leg movements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>JON involvement in multiple distinct behaviors</title><p>Our study advances our understanding of the breadth of behaviors that are influenced by the JONs. The JO-C/E neurons were previously implicated in such behaviors as wind-induced suppression of locomotion, wind-guided orientation, gravitaxis, flight, and antennal grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). Our finding that optogenetic activation of the JO-C/E neurons results in wing flapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C,D</xref>) is intriguing, given that these neurons were previously shown to detect wing beats and then modulate wing movements during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>). Here we provided evidence that the JO-C/E neurons can also elicit wing movements. Prior to our study, the only behavior that had been ascribed to the JO-F neurons was antennal grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). We found that optogenetic activation of the JO-F neurons also elicits backward locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C,E</xref>). This demonstrates that, like the JO-C/E neurons, the JO-F neurons can also influence multiple distinct behaviors. Further, our results provide the first evidence that implicates locomotor avoidance as a behavior that is stimulated by the JO. Different stimuli that can move the antennae, such as unexpected mechanical displacements or static electricity have been previously shown to cause aversive locomotor responses in cockroaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Newland et al., 2008</xref>). In stick insects, a backward locomotor response is elicited by mechanical stimulations of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham and Epstein, 1985</xref>), however, the mechanoreceptor(s) that mediate this response are unknown. Our results may suggest JO-F neurons as a link between mechanical stimulation of the antennae and backward locomotor avoidance.</p><p>Our work here reveals that the JO-C/E and -F neurons influence common and distinct behaviors, with antennal grooming as the common behavior and wing flapping and backward locomotion as the distinct behaviors. This raises the question of how these different subpopulations interface with downstream neural circuitry to control these distinct behaviors. To explain this, we hypothesize a neural circuit organization wherein the JON subpopulations have converging inputs onto the antennal grooming command circuit (discussed above) and diverging inputs onto putative circuits that control either wing flapping or backward locomotion. In the case of backward locomotion, two interneuron types (MAN and MDN) were previously identified that elicit this behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>). MDN was also found to be necessary for a vision-based backward locomotor response, revealing that these neurons can respond to sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the JO-F neurons could potentially elicit an avoidance response of backward locomotion through functional connections with MAN/MDN-like neurons. The JO-C/E neurons are proposed to impinge on the wing motor system through descending circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>), however the neurons in this pathway remain to be identified.</p><p>The fact that we identified multiple different JON types within each subpopulation raises the question of which types within a subpopulation (e.g. JO-EDC or -EVP neurons) control distinct behaviors. One possibility is that each type within a particular subpopulation influences a particular behavior (e.g. grooming or flight circuitry). The alternative is that all JON types within a subpopulation influence multiple distinct behaviors. Thus, the extent to which particular JON types connect with multiple different behavioral circuits or are dedicated to specific circuits remains an outstanding question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>A resource for understanding how mechanosensory topography interfaces with neural circuits to influence behavior</title><p>The JO is a chordotonal organ in the antennae, but there are chordotonal organs in other body parts of insects and crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Field and Matheson, 1998</xref>). As stretch receptors, they can detect movements of particular appendages for diverse purposes, such as proprioception and sound detection. These mechanosensory structures are studied to address fundamental questions about how stimuli are processed and influence appropriate behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016</xref>). There are commonalities among chordotonal organs, as exemplified by recent studies of the fruit fly JO and leg femoral chordotonal organ (FeCO). First, subpopulations of mechanosensory neurons within these chordotonal organs are tuned to specific stimuli, such as vibrations and sustained displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). Second, these mechanosensory neurons are morphologically diverse and have topographically organized projections into the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mamiya et al., 2018</xref>). Third, the subpopulations can differentially interface with downstream circuitry to influence distinct behaviors or movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>). Fourth, similar features of mechanosensory stimuli can be represented in neurons downstream of the JO and FeCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). These commonalities suggest that results obtained through studies of different chordotonal organs could be mutually informative. However, there is a dearth of information about how chordotonal mechanosensory neurons interface with downstream circuitry at the synaptic level. Our work, along with two recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maniates-Selvin et al., 2020</xref>), reveals the near complete topography of mechanosensory neurons that make up the JO and the FeCO. This provides a foundation for the rapid identification of neural circuitry that is post-synaptic to two different chordotonal organs. Ultimately, the anticipated synaptically-resolved view of the interface of the JO and FeCO with downstream circuitry will serve as a valuable resource for addressing fundamental questions about the functional significance of mechanosensory topography.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

All reconstructions were done by an experienced tracer who used two different approaches. The first approach was based on manual annotation and provides complete reconstruction of the neurites and pre- and post-synaptic sites of each neuron. The browser-based software CATMAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://catmaid.org">http://catmaid.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>) was used to manually navigate through the volume image stacks and manually place nodes that marked the neurites and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). For synapse annotations, we followed the criteria used by the FAFB connectomics community. Briefly, synapses had to show at least three out of the four following features: (1) an active zone with presynaptic vesicles, (2) a clear presynaptic density (such as a ribbon or T-bar), (3) a synaptic cleft, and (4) a post-synaptic density. For further tracing guidelines see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>. Manual tracing had the disadvantage of being labor intensive, which limited the number of neurons that could be reconstructed. Therefore, we employed the second approach of using an automated segmentation algorithm that uses flood-filling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The algorithm would occasionally create false splits. Therefore, the tracer resolved these false splits by manually assembling the fragments as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marin et al., 2020</xref>). This approach enabled us to semi-automatically annotate the major branches of each neuron, but not the fine branches and synaptic sites.</p><p>To locate the JON subpopulations in the EM volume, we first registered a light-microscopy confocal z-stack of these neurons into the volume. The z-stack was of a transgenic driver line (R27H08-GAL4) that expresses in the JO-C, -E, and -F neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). R27H08-GAL4 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_49441">BDSC_49441</ext-link>) was crossed to <italic>10XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP</italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_32185">BDSC_32185</ext-link>) to label these JONs with GFP. The brains were dissected, stained, and imaged by confocal microscopy as described below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The resulting image stack was registered into the EM volume using the software ELM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bogovic et al., 2016</xref>) to highlight the JON axons where the antennal nerve enters the brain as a neuron bundle. The medial region of the bundle, where JO-C and -E neurons were previously described to project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>), was highlighted by GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next reconstructed 147 JONs within the GFP-highlighted region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, colored dots). Neuron reconstructions were performed until we had identified JO-C, -D, -E, and -F neurons, and could not uncover new morphologically distinct JONs with further reconstructions (see below for JON anatomical analysis methods). 70 JONs were manually reconstructed to completion, including all of their pre- and post-synaptic sites. We then reconstructed 77 additional JONs by assembling fragments created by the automated segmentation algorithm. 34 of these JONs were proofread using previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>), and traced to completion. Thus, out of the 147 reconstructed JONs, 104 (71%) were completely reconstructed with their entire morphology and all pre- and post-synaptic sites. At least 63% of the reconstructed JONs for each subpopulation were fully reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>, neurons marked with asterisks).

Assessment of the morphology of the reconstructed JONs was done using CATMAID. Annotations were done by comparing the morphology and projections of the reconstructed JONs with published light- microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). We categorized the reconstructed JONs into 17 different types (140 JONs), and a group of 7 JO-mz neurons innervating multiple zones. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for detailed information on each JON type, including their FAFB skeleton ID numbers, raw and smooth cable length, number of nodes, and number of pre- and post-synaptic sites. Our rational for naming each type is provided below.</p><p>Nine of the reconstructed JONs were JO-C neurons whose projections form three different subareas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Two were previously named zone C medial (CM) and lateral (CL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). The third was a previously undescribed subarea located anterior of CM and CL (named C anterior (CA)). By examining the projections of individual reconstructed JO-C neurons, we found that each subarea is mainly formed by one of three JO-C neuron types. Two of these types project exclusively to a single subarea to form either CL or CA. However, the third type whose projections form CM has a smaller branch that projects to CL. Based on these observations, we named the three JO-C neuron types according to the subarea that receives their largest branch (named JO-CM, -CL, and -CA neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>Nine of the reconstructed JONs project to zone D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The proximal region of zone D contains protrusions that extend towards either zones A or B, and were previously named AA and BI/BO, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Two different JO-D neuron types were previously described and named JO-D posterior (JO-DP) and JO-D anterior (JO-DA) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The JO-DA neurons have branches that extend to both AA and BI/BO, and then a projection that extends towards, but does not reach the post-eriormost subarea of zone D (DP). The JO-DP neurons tend to have fewer second-order branches than JO-DA neurons, and extend a projection to DP.</p><p>62 of the reconstructed JONs project to zone E. This zone has five previously described subareas that we identified from the reconstructed JONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). The subareas are formed when JO-E neurons enter the brain and then split into two adjacent bundles called E dorsomedial (EDM) and E ventromedial (EVM). EDM curves medially and approaches the midline to form the E dorsal in the commissure (EDC) subarea. JONs that form EDC were named JO-EDC neurons, whereas most of the other JONs terminate earlier in the EDM bundle and were named JO-EDM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Another JON type in EDM forms a posterior protrusion called the dorsoposterior (EDP) subarea (named JO-EDP neurons). Some EDP neurons had projections that extended into the EDC subarea. JONs within the other major bundle, EVM, were divided into three types and named JO-EVM, -EVP, and -EVL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). JO-EVM neurons remain in the EVM bundle. JO-EVP neurons form a protrusion from EVM that projects to the posterior brain called the E ventroposterior (EVP) subarea. JO-EVL neurons form a newly described subarea called E ventrolateral (EVL) that projects laterally from EVM, towards zone C. Some of the reconstructed JONs were not morphologically similar to the other JO-E neurons. The branches of these JONs tiled the ventralmost region of zone E (EV) and were therefore named zone E ventral (JO-EV) neurons.</p><p>60 of the reconstructed JONs project to zone F and form five subareas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The first three are formed by the proximal neurites of JO-F neurons that branch to different parts in the AMMC. We named these subareas zone F dorsoanterior (FDA), dorsoposterior (FDP), and dorsolateral (FDL). FDA is formed by JO-F neurons that extend a branch that runs adjacent to the JO-EVM neurons. Lateral and slightly ventral to FDA is the relatively small anterior protruding FDL subarea. Some JO-F neurons form the FDP subarea by extending a posterior branch that projects adjacent to the JO-EVP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). The distal neurites of JO-F neurons project ventrally in two bundles that form the ventroanterior (FVA) and ventroposterior (FVP) subareas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Five JO-F neuron types form the different zone F subareas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). The first type that we named JO-FVA neurons contain few or no second-order branches and project through the AMMC and then ventrally, where most terminate their projections in the FVA subarea. The second type that we named JO-FDA neurons project to FDA in the AMMC, and then ventrally to FVA and/or FVP. The third type that we named JO-FDP neurons project to FDA and FDP and then ventrally to the FVP subarea. The last two types that were named JO-FDL and -FVL neurons both project to the FDL subarea. These types differ in that the JO-FDL neurons terminate dorsally in the FDL subarea, whereas the JO-FVL neurons also have a ventral projection.</p><p>In contrast to the JONs that project to specific zones, we reconstructed seven JO-mz neurons that have branches projecting to multiple zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These JONs have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Six out of seven reconstructed JO-mz neurons have branches that follow the posterior projections of the JO-FDP neurons, while extending projections to other zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). We could not classify the JO-mz neurons into subtypes because they showed no clear morphological similarity.</p><p>We performed an NBLAST all-to-all comparison of the 147 reconstructed JONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). We first pruned the primary axonal branch of each JON from its start point in the antennal nerve to its first branch point. Next, twigs shorter than 1 μm were pruned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>, pruned neurons shown in black in the first panel). The pruning enabled us to cluster the synapse rich parts of the JONs while adjusting for any differences in neuron morphology between the manual reconstruction and automated segmentation methods. At a cut height of h = 1.4, NBLAST clustered the JONs into 15 groups that were mostly consistent with the JON types that we had identified by manual annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>).</p><p>NBLAST clustered many of the same JONs that we had manually assigned as specific types, such as JO-EVL or -EVP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>, groups 3 and 14, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> shows the JON types and their NBLAST group number). NBLAST also revealed that manually assigned JON types could be further subdivided. For example, the algorithm divided JO-EVM neurons into two clusters that occupied distinct regions in the EVM subarea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>, groups 5 and 6). In this study, we opted to keep the JO-EVM neurons as a single type as defined by our manual annotations, and based on the previously described EVM subarea boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>). JO-mz neurons were not all clustered together, consistent with our annotation of these neurons as projecting to different zones. In some cases, NBLAST clustered JONs that we had assigned as distinct from each other. For example, some JO-FVA and -FDA neurons were clustered into the same group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A,B</xref>, groups 9 and 10). These differences likely arose based on relatively small branches from the main projections of these JONs that were differentially emphasized by our manual annotations versus the NBLAST algorithm. That is, the NBLAST algorithm did not appear to emphasize JO-FDA neuron branches that formed the FDA subarea. Because the JO-FVA neurons did not project to that subarea, we opted to retain the categorization of these neuron types that was based on our manual annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Identification of driver lines that express in JON subpopulations that elicit antennal grooming</title><p>We used a spGAL4 screening approach to produce driver lines that expressed in JO-C, -E, and -F neurons. The spGAL4 system enables independent expression of the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) and activation domain (AD). These domains can be reconstituted into a transcriptionally active protein when they are expressed in the overlapping cells of two different patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>).

We tested three flies for each combination, a number that we previously found could identify lines with expression in neurons whose activation elicit grooming. We then stained and imaged the CsChrimson-mVenus expression patterns of the brains and ventral nervous systems of AD/DBD combinations that elicited grooming (immunohistochemistry and imaging methods described below). Four different DBD/AD combinations were identified that expressed in either zone C/E- or F-projecting JONs. The four AD ‘hits’ were VT005525-AD (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_72267">BDSC_72267</ext-link>), R39H04-AD (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_75734">BDSC_75734</ext-link>), R25F11-AD (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_70623">BDSC_70623</ext-link>), and VT050231-AD (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_71886">BDSC_71886</ext-link>).</p><p>We produced lines that contained both the AD and DBD in the same fly.

Therefore, at least 10 experimental and 10 control flies were tested (95% power to detect a 1.48 effect size at a 0.05 significance level).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack

Here the authors painstakingly define the morphological subtypes of antennal Johnston's Organ mechanoreceptive neurons (JONs -particularly C, E and F populations that elicit antennal grooming). They then develop driver lines to study the different populations with optogenetics and Ca-imaging. They reconfirm the activation of the subpopulations to mechanical stimuli and show that optogenetic activation of C/E and F populations elicit grooming but also other behaviors – wing flapping and avoidance for C/E and F populations respectively. The data at this point is consistent and gives a complete description with novel interesting functional findings. The experiments are carefully done and nicely illustrated with Figures and Figure Supplements. The work clearly advances our knowledge of this sensory organ in flies and pushes us forward to a better understanding of how topography of sensory projections and their sub-modalities influence behavior and potentially connectivity.</p><p>The authors then describe their synaptic connectivity (EM reconstruction) with identified interneurons that were previously determined to be involved in eliciting antennal grooming and assess functional connectivity using optogenetic activation and Ca-imaging between the JONs and the identified downstream interneurons and among the interneurons. Here the story is less complete and there are inconsistencies between the numbers of synapses and functionally determine strength of interaction.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The discrepancy between the EM connectivity and the functional connectivity is substantial. The response of aBN1 to JO-F activation is very small compared to activation of JO-C/E activation but connectivity is more numerous, and JO-FDP and JO-FDA show high numbers of synapses even if across all JO-F neurons there is low average connectivity. The JO-C/E neurons give a strong functional response in aBN1, despite not that many synapses, and then indirectly to aBN2s. The arguments made (subsection “Different JON subpopulations have converging inputs onto the antennal command circuit”) are not convincing. Moreover, connections and functional connectivity with critical DNs are not explored, leaving a rather enigmatic story. This whole section should be removed from the manuscript with focus on the data of Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 and their supplements. In future the interneurons data can be made into a more complete and more consistent advance.

This required us to change different parts of the manuscript text (e.g. Title and Abstract). The main goal of these changes was to shift the emphasis of the manuscript from understanding how the Johnston’s organ neurons (JONs) interface with the antennal grooming command circuit, to defining the anatomical, physiological, and behavioral diversity of the different JON subpopulations that elicit grooming. Most of the changes are described below in relation to other reviewer comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The long descriptive subsection “The topographical organization of different JON subpopulations” should be substantially shortened.

After a prolonged description of &quot;manual annotation&quot; and NBLAST clustering of JON types, the conclusion (subsection “NBLAST clustering of the reconstructed JONs”) is that &quot;different JON subpopulations….project to distinct zones and subareas&quot; without telling us which description will be used in those few cases in which the two techniques disagree.</p></disp-quote><p>Below we respond to revision requests 2 and 3 together.</p><p>A primary reason why we expect that this manuscript will be cited is for its systematic description of a major portion of the JONs. Therefore, in our original draft we included a detailed description of the anatomy of the JONs and our logic for categorizing and naming each JON type. We also described grey areas that we encountered when naming the different JONs, such as the discrepancies between our manual assignments of the JON types and the NBLAST clustering. However, based on the reviewers’ request that we shorten our descriptions in the Results section, we see that this level detail detracted from the more generally interesting conclusions of the manuscript. We were also asked to be more definitive in our naming of the different JON types.</p><p>In order to balance the need for brevity with our expectation that the details will be important for the active community of researchers who study the JO, we have moved the above-mentioned text to a new subsection “Anatomical analysis and assignment of JON types”. This text from the previous version of the manuscript includes both the anatomical and NBLAST descriptions (subsection “Driver lines that express in JO-C, -E, and -F neurons” and subsection “JO-C/E and -F neurons respond differently to mechanical stimulation of the antennae”). We also added text to this section that briefly explains our rational for naming each JON type in light of disagreement between our manual assignments and the NBLAST results. These changes enable the more definitive and simplified description of the JON types that we now present in the Results section (described below).</p><p>The Anatomical description of the EM-reconstructed JONs in the Results is now substantially shorter and presented in a more definitive way that avoids lengthy discussion of the above-mentioned grey areas. This description is in the section entitled: “Contributions of morphologically distinct JON types to the JO topographical map.” The reviewers asked if the JON anatomy could be summarized as a table rather than described at length in the text. Inspired by this suggestion, we created a Figure that summarizes the different JON types, and creates a visual representation of the text that the reviewers requested that we remove (see new Figure 2). Figure 2A shows the morphology of each JON type, while Figure 2B indicates the zone and subarea projections of each type. We also made the NBLAST results a Figure supplement instead of a main Figure (former Figure 2 is now Figure 2—figure supplement 6). We realized that the NBLAST results were better included in the manuscript as supporting data, rather than as a main figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also address the discrepancy (which appears to be a disagreement between the authors) about how many JO-C/E neurons they think there are.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we discussed a discrepancy in the literature about the estimated numbers of neurons in each JON subpopulation. That is, Kamikouchi et al., 2006 provided estimates of the numbers of JO-C, -D, -E, and -mz neurons based on a stochastic labeling study. From this data we estimated to have reconstructed 29% of the JO-C neurons (9 out of an estimated 31 neurons), 69% of the JO-D neurons (9 out of 13), and 87% of the JO-E neurons (62 out of 71). However, counts of JONs targeted by a transgenic driver line that expressed specifically in the JO-C and -E neurons revealed that there were twice the number of JO-C/E neurons than were estimated from the stochastic labeling study (~200 versus 102 JO-C/E neurons, also published in Kamikouchi et al., 2006). Because this driver line definitively labels ~200 JO-C/E neurons, we the authors agreed that it provides the best estimate of the number of JO-C/E neurons. Therefore, the stochastic labeling study provided a low estimate of the numbers of JO-C/E neurons. This may also suggest that the estimates of the other subpopulations (i.e. JO-D and -mz neurons) are low, and therefore the calculated percentages of reconstructed JONs for these subpopulations are overestimates. In the original manuscript, we mentioned this discrepancy in order to provide the reader with an estimate range of the numbers of JONs that we had reconstructed for each subpopulation. Based on the reviewers’ comments, we see that this caused confusion and was counterproductive.</p><p>A simplified estimate of the numbers of reconstructed JONs is now included in a new Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Given that the JO-C/E driver line mentioned above definitively labels ~200 neurons, we now use this number to estimate that we have reconstructed 36% of the JO-C/E neurons (71 reconstructed out of 200). Because the above-mentioned discrepancy casts doubt on the estimated numbers of JO-D and -mz neurons, the revised manuscript no longer uses this data to estimate the proportion of these JONs that were reconstructed.</p><p>We note that the manuscript still provides other lines of evidence to suggest that the EM-reconstructed JONs represent the major diversity of the JON subpopulations. That is, we observe all of the previously described zones and subareas with our reconstructed JONs, and that we reconstructed multiple JONs for each type. Given that reviewer #1 requested a clearer distinction between the Results section and Discussion section in the revised manuscript (see below), all of this text has been moved to the subsection “EM-based definition of the morphologically diverse JON subpopulations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The JO-F neurons are not responsive to the antennal movements tested. Are these mechanoreceptors or given they are so good at evoking avoidance, are they nocioceptors?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a possible and interesting hypothesis, however most of our current evidence still points to a role for the JO-F neurons as being involved in detecting displacements of the antennae. We have expanded on this hypothesis in subsection “Physiologically distinct JON subpopulations elicit grooming” and subsection “JON involvement in multiple distinct behaviors”. In the first, we describe the behavioral evidence demonstrating that the JO-F neurons are necessary for detecting displacements of the antennae, and then we suggest why the present study did not show that these JONs are physiologically tuned to such displacements. In the second of these, we describe experiments from other insects showing that displacements of the antennae can induce avoidance responses such as backward locomotion. We hope that these sections provide a clearer description of our current hypotheses about the physiological tuning of the JO-F neurons and their roles in inducing different behavioral responses, such as grooming and backward locomotor avoidance.</p><p>This reviewer comment also made us realize that our use of the term avoidance may be an over interpretation and possibly misleading, as we have not demonstrated that the backward locomotion is actually an avoidance response. Therefore, we have changed our wording that describes this to simply reflect what we observe with activation of the JO-F neurons, which is backward locomotion. We have change text in the Results section, Figure 6 and its legend, and Video 3 and Video 4 legends to reflect this change.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a revision of a previously submitted manuscript describing EM reconstruction of JON subtypes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna and the identification of additional split Gal4 lines that label subsets of these.

These parts of the text could be better harmonized.</p></disp-quote><p>The two paragraphs mentioned by the reviewer have been reduced by 19% to bring their total word count from 433 to 351. We removed two sentences from the first of the two paragraphs. The first sentence reads: “In contrast, we could not identify the CM, CA, EVL, or EV subareas in the expression patterns of either line, suggesting that JO-C/E-1 and -2 do not express in JO-CM, -CA, -EVL, and -EV neurons.” This could be inferred from Figure 3. We also removed a sentence that reads: “We sought to verify the different JON types in each driver expression pattern using a method to stochastically label individual JONs (Nern et al., 2015), but we were unable to label individual JONs for JO-C/E-1 or -2 using this method.” This sentence was not critical for the paragraph, and is also described in subsection “Immunohistochemical analysis of the driver line expression patterns in the CNS and antennae”. In the second paragraph, we removed the list of subareas that are targeted by JONs in the JO-F-1 and -2 expression patterns. The removed text reads: “including FDA, FDP, FDL, FVA, and FVP”. The authors believe that all of the remaining text is important for the description of the driver lines, and/or is necessary for understanding the later sections of the manuscript.</p><p>In the previous version of the manuscript, we did not address that there were differences between the JONs targeted by the JO-C/E-1 and -2 driver lines in their responses to pushes on the antennae. This was partially because the JONs targeted by the JO-C/E-1 and -2 driver lines both showed significant responses to pushes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). However, as the reviewer rightfully indicates, the JO-C/E-1 response was not as strong as the one observed when we imaged the JONs that are targeted by the JO-C/E-2 driver line. The reviewer suggested that we link the description of Figure 3 with the experimental results shown in Figure 5, to presumably link our description of the expression pattern of JO-C/E-1 and -2 with their observed response difference. We suspect that the observed response difference is due to a difference in the relative ratios of JO-C and -E neurons in each pattern, given that the JO-C neurons are implicated in responding antennal pulls and the JO-E neurons respond to pushes. However, we were unable to explain this result based on our assessment of the driver line expression patterns, as we cannot determine the relative numbers of JO-C and -E neurons that are targeted by each line. Further, it is unknown whether all JO-E neuron types respond to pushes, or whether only specific JO-E neuron types respond. Therefore, the differences between the lines could be due to the relative ratios of JO-E neuron types that are labeled by each driver line. As a result, we have not been able to identify a clear-cut reason that for the differences observed in our imaging experiments.</p><p>We have addressed the reviewer comment by inserting two sentences in subsection “JO-C/E and -F neurons respond differently to mechanical stimulation of the antennae”. These sentences read: “Notably, the fluorescence increase of the JO-C/E-1-labeled neurons in response to antennal pushes was lower than that of the JO-C/E-2-labeled neurons. Although both driver lines express in the same neuron types (Figure 3G), these different responses may indicate that the lines express in different ratios of JO-C and -E neuron types that are known to differentially respond to antennal pushes (JO-C neurons) or pulls (JO-E neurons) (Kamikouchi et al., 2009; Patella and Wilson, 2018; Yorozu et al., 2009).” We think that this change better links the data shown in Figure 3 with the Figure 5 experimental result.</p><p>In the course of addressing this reviewer suggestion and reviewing the data related to Figure 5, we noticed two errors in Figure 5—figure supplement 2D. First, the Y-axis was labelled as “∆F/F 0.1”, where it should have been labeled “∆F/F”. Second, asterisks indicating p &lt; 0.001 significance (**) were mistakenly placed in the graph for the 200 Hz stimulus, where no significant response (n.s.) should have been indicated. We have made the appropriate changes in the revised figure supplement. We apologize for these errors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
