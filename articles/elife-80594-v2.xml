medial lobe and those from later-born α'β' and αβ classes form both medial and vertical lobes. The larva, however, hatches with only γ neurons and forms a vertical lobe 'facsimile' using larval-specific axon branches from its γ neurons. MB input (MBINs) and output (MBONs) neurons divide the Kenyon neuron lobes into discrete computational compartments. The larva has 10 such compartments while the adult has 16. We determined the fates of 28 of the 32 MBONs and MBINs that define the 10 larval compartments. Seven compartments are subsequently incorporated into the adult MB; four of their MBINs die, while 12 MBINs/MBONs remodel to function in adult compartments. The remaining three compartments are larval specific. At metamorphosis their MBIN/MBONs trans-differentiate, leaving the MB for other adult brain circuits. The adult vertical lobes are made <italic>de novo</italic> using MBONs/MBINs recruited from pools of adult-specific neurons. The combination of cell death, compartment shifting, trans-differentiation, and recruitment of new neurons result in no larval MBIN-MBON connections being maintained through metamorphosis. At this simple level, then, we find no anatomical substrate for a memory trace persisting from larva to adult. The adult phenotype of the trans-differentiating neurons represents their evolutionarily ancestral phenotype while their larval phenotype is a derived adaptation for the larval stage. These cells arise primarily within lineages that also produce permanent MBINs and MBONs, suggesting that larval specifying factors may allow information related to birth-order or sibling identity to be interpreted in a modified manner in the larva to allow these neurons to acquire larval phenotypic modifications. The loss of such factors at metamorphosis then allows these neurons to revert to their ancestral functions in the adult.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metamorphosis</kwd><kwd>mushroom body</kwd><kwd>trans-differentiation</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Tzumin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mushroom body neuropils of the larval brain have regions that share neurons and functions with the adult and larval-specific regions built with 'doomed' neurons or cells that trans-differentiate for temporary larval function before assuming their adult phenotypes at metamorphosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Direct developing insects like crickets and grasshoppers produce a species-typical body form during embryogenesis and hatch as a miniature version of the adult but lack wings and genitalia. Holometabolous insects, which have complete metamorphosis, have modified their embryogenesis to produce a simplified larval body instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the larval body, embryonic fields, which had been fully utilized to generate their adult-like structures, are only partially patterned, with the patterned portion making the larval structure and the remainder preserved through larval growth to become imaginal discs or primordia. The imaginal primordia, along with some larval cells, combine to construct the species-typical body form at metamorphosis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the effects of direct development versus metamorphosis on neurogenesis and the establishment of neuronal phenotypes.</title><p>In a direct developing insect like a cricket, embryogenesis produces a hatchling with a miniature cricket body plan. Its neuroblasts (NBs) generate their entire lineages during embryogenesis so that at hatching the CNS has its full complement of neurons and they already possess their mature phenotypes. In the metamorphic development of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, by contrast, a shortened embryonic phase redirects development to produce a simplified, larval body plan. Their neuroblasts produce only their early-born neuron types and neuronal phenotypes are modified for larval morphology and behavior. During larval growth, the arrested NBs reactivate to produce the rest of their neuronal lineages, but their young neurons arrest development soon after their birth. The species-typical body plan of the fly finally arises at metamorphosis and, in the CNS, remodeling larval neurons and maturing postembryonic-born neurons combine to make the mature nervous system of the fly.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80594-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Direct development also results in a hatchling possessing an essentially mature, but miniature brain, which is used for both the nymphal and adult stages (reviews by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kutsch and Heckmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Truman, 2005</xref>). The evolution of the larva, though, altered brain development to make a modified, simpler brain appropriate for the sensory and motor demands of the larva. This larval brain, though, is not discarded at the end of larval growth and a new one made from scratch. Most larval neurons persist and some, like the interneurons mediating backwards locomotion, have similar functions in both larva and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee and Doe, 2021</xref>), but, as we show in this paper, the maintenance of neuronal function from larva to adult is not always the case. At metamorphosis, recycled larval cells are combined with adult-specific neurons to make the nervous system of the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Truman, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Although the focus on nervous system metamorphosis is usually on the postembryonic transformation of the larval brain into that of the adult, complementary changes had to have occurred during embryogenesis to generate the modified larval brain. One key embryonic change involved neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The central brain and ventral nerve cord (VNC) of insects arise from a fixed number of neuronal stem cells (neuroblasts [NBs]), with about 100 per brain hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Urbach and Technau, 2003</xref>) and about 30 per segmental hemineuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>). Each NB makes a characteristic set of neurons in a defined temporal order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyares and Lee, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). The sets of NBs in the brain and VNC, though, are highly conserved and were established well before the evolution of the larva and complete metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Truman and Ball, 1998</xref>). Moreover, these conserved sets of NBs produce the neurons for both the larval and adult CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Prokop and Technau, 1991</xref>). The duration of embryonic neurogenesis, however, differs in the two groups. Insects with direct development, like grasshoppers, produce all the neurons of the central brain and VNC during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shepherd and Bate, 1990</xref>) and the hatchling possesses all the neurons of the adult (except for expansion of the Kenyon cell population, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malaterre et al., 2002</xref>). In insects with complete metamorphosis, by contrast, selection for the rapid formation of a larval stage required a premature arrest of neurogenesis, resulting in many fewer neurons for the larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Truman, 2005</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, for example, most brain and thoracic NBs produce only 10–15% of their respective progeny by hatching and the remainder are made during a second neurogenic period late in larval growth. Since essentially all their neurons are born during embryogenesis, the hatchlings of direct developing insects have brain circuits that include neurons generated during early, intermediate, and late phases of their neuroblasts’ lineages. The larvae of metamorphic insects, by contrast, not only have fewer neurons to make their brain, but these neurons include only those with early-born fates.</p><p>A second key change involves the phenotypes of the neurons that are made during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The neurons of direct developing insects acquire their mature phenotype by the time of hatching and their anatomy and connections change very little through nymphal growth and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kutsch and Heckmann, 1995</xref>). By contrast, in holometabolous insects, the form and function of many larval neurons are radically different from their adult form and function (e.g<italic>.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Truman and Reiss, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levine and Truman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). At metamorphosis, they lose their larval specializations and finally acquire their mature, adult phenotypes.</p><p>The analysis of development and metamorphosis of complex neuropils can provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of the larva and its subsequent metamorphosis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farnworth et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, we have focused on the larval and adult circuitry of the mushroom bodies (MBs). In both stages, the MBs associate odors with either rewards or punishments and adjust the animal’s future behavior accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thum and Gerber, 2019</xref>). The circuitry of the MB is known at the EM level for both the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The core of the MB is a set of hundreds (larva) to thousands (adult) of small neurons called Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Their dendrites project into calyx neuropil, which receives primarily olfactory input via antennal lobe projection neurons, and into accessory calyx neuropils that receive visual and thermal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). The bundled axons of the Kenyon cells extend down the peduncle and into the vertical and medial lobes. The mature, adult MB has three major classes of Kenyon cells: the γ neurons made during embryogenesis and early larval life, the α'β' cells generated late in larval life, and the αβneurons born through early and mid-metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). There is considerable complexity within each of these major Kenyon cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>), but overall, their axons form three medial lobes (γ, β', β) and two vertical lobes (α, α') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Unlike the adult, the MB of the larva contains only modified γ Kenyon cells whose axons form a vertical and a medial lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The organization and development of the larval and adult mushroom bodies (MBs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The larval MB has a core of γ Kenyon neurons whose dendrites project to the calyx (CA) neuropil and whose axons extend through the peduncle and bifurcate into a vertical and medial lobe. Projections from three clusters of aminergic neurons, the PAL, PPL1, and PAM clusters divide the axon array into 10 computational compartments: IP and LP: intermediate and lower peduncle; LA: lateral appendix; UVL, IVL, LVL: upper, intermediate, and lower vertical lobe; SHA: shaft; UT, IT, LT: upper, intermediate, and lower toe. PPL1 input largely indicates punishment, PAM input indicates reward, and PAL is unknown. The diagrams below highlight in gray (left) the compartments that lose contact with γ neuron axons during pruning and (right) the compartments that are not incorporated into the adult MB. (<bold>B</bold>) The adult MB has 16 compartments. It contains regrown γ neurons (gray) that lack the larval-specific vertical branch along with late developing α′β′ (green) and αβ (orange) Kenyon cells. These together form the medial (β′,β) and vertical (α′, α) lobe systems of the adult. Compartment designations are numbered and based on the Kenyon cell axons that they contain.

In both larvae and adults, these neurons divide the lobes into non-overlapping compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) that have a common microcircuit motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Each compartment is defined by the axonal tuft of an aminergic input cell that synapses onto Kenyon cell axons and onto a dedicated MBON(s). The Kenyon cell axons synapse onto each other and the MBONs but also feed back onto the MBINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The majority of the MBINs are dopaminergic neurons (DANs) but a few are octopaminergic neurons (OANs). Most DANs come from two clusters, the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster, which primarily encodes reward, and the protocerebral posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) cluster, which mainly encodes punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>). Depending on their compartment, the MBONs are cholinergic, GABAergic, or glutaminergic. Interestingly, stimulation of the MBONs from PPL1-supplied compartments generally evokes approach behavior while stimulation of those from PAM supplied compartments evokes avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, pairing punishment with a particular odor reduces the drive on MBONs that promote attraction. Behavior is therefore guided by a balance of avoidance versus attractive influences and the inhibition of neurons mediating one behavior then favors the opposite behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thum and Gerber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>). The functions of some compartments, though, are complex because of extensive interconnections amongst MBONs and feedback from MBONs back to various MBINs (e.g<italic>.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While serving similar functions of mediating associative learning, the larval and adult MB differ in a couple of ways. The larval MB has 10 compartments plus the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>), while the adult has 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The larval structure lacks the α'β' and αβ neurons that form the adult system’s vertical lobes. The larval γ neurons, though, have larval-specific vertical axon branches that form the core of a larval vertical lobe. We have focused on the MBINs and MBONs that establish the 10 larval compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>). We have determined the metamorphic fates of about 80% of these neurons. Depending on the fate of their compartment, some larval neurons remain with the MB, others reprogram to join other adult circuits, and still others die. The persistence of MBON to MBIN connections would have been the simplest way that a larval memory trace could be carried through metamorphosis. However, we find that the diverse fates of the larval MB neurons plus the addition of new, adult-specific MBINs and MBONs to the compartments result in no MBIN-MBON pairings that survive from larva to adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metamorphic fates of the larval MBINs and MBONs</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong et al., 1998</xref> used a set of enhancer-trap lines to follow subsets of extrinsic and intrinsic MB neurons through metamorphosis and showed that some of the medial lobe neurons functioned in both the larval and adult structures. Our use of a large collection of split-GAL4 lines that express in specific larval MBINs and MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>) and a conditional flip-switch strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 2015</xref>) have allowed us to establish the metamorphic fates of most of the MBONs and MBINs. We focused on the larval unicompartmental neurons that possess the well-defined dendritic or axonal 'tufts' that define compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>), and we could determine the fates of 28 of the 32 classes of such cells. We have classified the persisting neurons as 'remodeling' if they continue as part of the MB circuitry after metamorphosis or as 'trans-differentiating' (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Veverytsa and Allan, 2013</xref>) if they retract from the MB system and function in other circuits of the adult brain. These two designations, however, likely are the two extremes along a continuum of change.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> summarize the fates of the larval MBINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>). We lacked suitable lines for the two octopaminergic neurons that innervate the calyx compartment (OAN-a1 and -a2). However, these cells have a very similar anatomy to the two adult OA-VUM2a neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 2009</xref>), leading us to conclude that they are the same neurons. We experimentally established the fates of 13 of the remaining 14 larval MBINs. These cells either trans-differentiate, remodel, or degenerate. Trans-differentiation was the fate of one MBIN innervating the LA compartment and all those innervating the vertical lobe compartments, UVL and IVL, and the intermediate peduncle (IP) compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The most extreme change was evident for MBINs-b1 and -b2; they withdraw from the larval intermediate peduncle and become sexually dimorphic neurons that innervate the adult optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We named their adult form PAL-OL because they are found in the protocerebral anterior lateral (PAL) cluster of adult aminergic neurons described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>. The three vertical lobe MBINs (OAN-e1, MBIN-e2, and DAN-f1) are members of the PPL1 group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>). We lacked a line to determine the fate of MBIN-e2, but OAN-e1 reorganizes to innervate the neuropil shell surrounding the MB lobes (as PPL1-SMP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and DAN-f1 forms bilateral arbors in the adult superior medial protocerebrum as PPL1-bi-SMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The other trans-differentiating MBIN is MBIN-l1 that provides input from the larval lateral accessory lobe to the LA compartment of the MB; its adult form as LAL&gt;bi-CRP redirects its lateral accessory lobe input to the crepine neuropil in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The metamorphic fates of the larval mushroom body input neurons (MBINs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The fates of the larval MBINs that innervate the calyx and the 10 compartments of the larval MB.

They undergo moderate remodeling and continue innervating compartments at the base of the mature MB peduncle and lobes (the PED, γ1, γ2, and α'1 compartments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The octopaminergic MBIN, OAN-g1, exclusively targets the LVL compartment in the larva, but in its adult form, named OA-VPM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 2009</xref>), it extends extensive arbors into the fan-shaped body and the medial and lateral superior protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) with some arbor extending into adult γ1 compartment.

We categorized the two calyx neurons, MBON-a1 and -a2, as remodeling because they also innervate the mature MB. This is clearly the case for MBON-a2 since its larval and adult morphologies (as MBON 22) are extremely similar. MBON-a1, by contrast, completely withdraws from the calyx and directs its adult growth into the adult γ4 and γ5 compartments as MBON 29. Three larval MBONs from the lobe system show similar dramatic morphological changes but also remain within the MB circuit. MBON-c1 retracts from the larval lower peduncle compartment and grows into the adult calyx (as MBE-calyx). MBON-e2 and MBON-f2 retract from the vertical lobes and regrow into medial lobe compartments, becoming the adult MBON 03 and MBON 30, respectively. The MBONs innervating the larval medial lobe compartments (SHA, UT, IT, and LT) are more conservative in their changes; they persist as medial lobe MBONs and supply topologically similar compartments in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; MBON-h1 to -k1).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The metamorphic fates of the larval mushroom body output neurons (MBONs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The fates of the larval MBONs that innervate the calyx and the 10 compartments of the larval MB.

In contrast, the dendritic arbor of MBON-a2 only partially regresses. It organizes into a dendritic growth cone by 16 hr APF, which then reinvades the calyx. Its adult form, MBON-20 (MBON-calyx; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>), is very similar to its larval form.</p><p>The most stable extrinsic neuron is DAN-d1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

A more extreme remodeling is evident in the larval MBON-d1, which becomes the adult cell MBON 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Its larval dendritic tuft retracts and reorganizes into a growth cone by about 18 hr APF.

This split-GAL4 line lost its GFP expression after 24 hr, but the extensive invasion of the calyx neuropil by this time indicates that the calyx is its adult target.

The latter form, with its single medially directed axon, is the same as seen in the γ neurons of nymphs and adults of the more basal, direct-developing insects, such as the cricket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malaterre et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the adult version of <italic>Drosophila</italic> γ neurons is like that of a direct developing ancestor, while its larval form is derived to accommodate the lack of αβ class neurons in the larva. Is this a general rule for cells that have different larval and adult phenotypes? Do the adult phenotypes approximate the ancestral phenotype while the larval phenotypes are derived? It is difficult to directly deal with these designations for the trans-differentiating MBONs and MBINs because we do not know the corresponding neurons in direct developing species. We can, however, make this comparison for some VNC neurons such as the thoracic midline spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These neurons are found in a large cluster in each thoracic hemineuropil, and each cluster is the progeny of a single, identified neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shepherd and Laurent, 1992</xref>). Each cluster includes two sets of GABAergic neurons that are based on the asymmetrical division of the ganglion mother cells. The 'A' group (hemilineage) remains ipsilateral, while the 'B' hemilineage projects to the contralateral leg neuropil where, as the midline spiking interneurons, they shape the response of leg motoneurons to input from leg mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Siegler and Burrows, 1984</xref>).

adult MBINs have already been determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). About 150 PAM neurons divided into at least 15 different types are found in the adult MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>).

For the PPL1 cluster MBINs, the number is about the same in the larva and the adult, but the cell population partially changes. We find that three of the larval PPL1 MBINs retract from the MB and join other circuits in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2016</xref> found that three adult-specific neurons are added from the postembryonic DL2 lineage.</p><p>We determined the origins of nine of the thirteen remaining types of adult MBONs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) using the twin-spot MARCM technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, MBONs 12 (γ2α'1), 13 (α'2), and 14 (α3) are born in succession during the early postembryonic phase of the FLAa2 lineage. The remaining vertical lobe MBONs arise in the DL1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The DL1 neuroblast has a type II pattern of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Each division produces an intermediate precursor cell, which, in turn, produces a small series of ganglion mother cells. Each of the latter divides to make two daughter neurons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> for at least six of these GMCs, one daughter becomes a vertical lobe MBON while the other becomes a central complex neuron that innervates the fan-shaped body.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Some neurons like the GABAergic APL have a unique and characteristic morphology that allows them to be readily identified in both larval and adult stages and the same name has been used for both stages.

Where useful in the ‘Discussion,’ we will combine their larval and adult names. For example, since larval MBON-d1 becomes adult MBON 11, it will be referred to as MBON-d1/MBON 11.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Metamorphosis of mushroom body compartments</title><p>The evolution of a metamorphic life history in insects required two changes: first, the modification of embryogenesis to produce a larval body; and second, metamorphosis itself –the transformation of that larval body into the insect’s mature form.

As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, three compartments are specialized for the larval stage and not carried into the adult. For the two distal vertical lobe compartments, UVL and IVL, their γ axon core degenerates and two of their MBONs (MBON-e2 and MBON-f2) switch to adult medial lobe compartments while their remaining MBONs and MBINs shift to adult circuits outside of the MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The larval vertical lobe is then replaced with new, adult vertical lobes formed from α' and α axon cores and postembryonic-born MBINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). There is, however, no cellular continuity between the larval vertical lobe and mature vertical lobes of the adult MB. We think of the larval structure as a vertical lobe ‘facsimile’; a larval innovation to deal with the lack of the Kenyon cells and extrinsic neurons that typically make the vertical lobes.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Stability and changes in mushroom body (MB) compartments during metamorphosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Developmental fates of the larval compartments through metamorphosis.

The larval LP compartment with some of its MBINs becomes incorporated into the adult PED compartment, but the larval IP compartment is lost and not replaced. Its two MBINs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) and at least two of its three MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) leave the larval MB and become parts of adult non-MB circuits. The IP compartment is unusual because of its isolation from the other MB microcircuits. The latter are highly interconnected by one- or two-step connections from the MBONs of one compartment to the MBIN of others. The IP MBINs, however, receive no MBON feedback from the other compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, the IP MBONs provide the least amount of crosstalk to the other larval compartments. Its isolation suggests that the IP is involved in a type of learning distinct from that handled by the rest of the larval MB. This may involve temperature-based learning since the greatest input from the small number of thermosensory Kenyon cells is onto MBON-b3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). Since we found no corresponding compartment in the adult MB, the type of learning that IP mediates may be restricted to the larva.</p><p>The remaining seven larval compartments are incorporated into adult MB compartments, especially those containing γ neuron axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Their larval MBINs and MBONs typically also function in the mature MB, although the four PAM MBINs that project to the distal-most larval compartments (SHA, UT, IT, and LT) die at the end of the larval stage. The larval MBONs from these distal compartments, though, survive and innervate compartments at similar positions along the adult medial lobes, although some shift their dendrites from γ into β or β' compartments. For example, the larval SHA compartment corresponds to the adult γ3 compartment; of its two MBON-h’s, one (MBON 08) innervates the adult γ3 compartment while the other (MBON 09) has dendrites in β'1 as well as γ3. The MBONs of the larval distal ‘toes’ (the UT, IT, and LT compartments) distribute their dendrites amongst the adult distal medial lobe compartments (γ4, γ5, β2, and β'2). The basal larval compartments, LP, LA, and LVL, correspond to adult compartments PED, γ1, and γ2, respectively. Most of their MBINs and MBONs stay within this set of compartments but there is some shuffling amongst them. The general pattern is that larval MBINs and MBONs that supply the seven larval compartments that are incorporated into the adult MB continue to function in the adult MB, while those that innervate the three larval-specific compartments retract from the MB and join non-MB circuits of the adult brain.</p><p>From the perspective of the mature, adult MB, 10 of its 16 compartments have axon cores from the postembryonic born α'β' or αβ Kenyon cells. The α and α' compartments are supplied almost exclusively by postembryonic-born MBINs and MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). By contrast, the β and β' compartments show a mixed picture: their input is provided exclusively by postembryonic-born PAM neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), while their known outputs are through embryonic-born neurons from the larval MB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transmitter stability and shifts in compartments through metamorphosis</title><p>The input and output transmitters associated with MB compartments of the larval and adult systems are similar but not identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). For the MBINs, the calyx receives octopaminergic input from the same neurons in the two stages. The adult calyx also receives a sparse serotonin input from a remodeled CSD neuron that projects from the contralateral antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). The compartments of the larval lobe system are primarily supplied by dopaminergic neurons, but the UVL and LVL compartments also have octopaminergic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>). The octopamine input to the lobes is reduced in the adult MB, though, because OAN-e1/PPL1-SMP retracts completely from the larval UVL compartment and innervates the superior medial protocerebrum in the adult, and OAN-g1/OA-VPM3 reduces its MB input to a sparse innervation of the adult γ1 compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The PPL1 and PAM clusters provide the major dopamine input to the lobes. The number of PPL1 neurons is about the same in the larval and adult stages, but we find that those innervating vertical lobe compartments differ in the two stages. In contrast, the PAM cluster innervation of the medial lobes is dramatically increased as the four neurons in the larva are replaced by about 150 neurons in the adult. Appetitive conditioning in the adult is complex with different medial lobe compartments receiving PAM input from different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>) and providing reward information based on diverse factors such as sugar sweetness, nutritional value, and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Also, reproduction-related learning is also mediated through sets of PAM neurons (e.g<italic>.,</italic> the PAM 01 ( = γ5) neurons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Even with only four PAM neurons, though, the larva shows selectivity in its reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thum and Gerber, 2019</xref>). For example, inhibition of DAN-h1 interferes with the positive association and odor with a fructose reward, but not with either amino acid or low salt rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An adult-specific, modulatory input to the MB circuitry is provided by the paired, larval-born DPM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayseless et al., 2018</xref>) that innervate all the compartments of the adult peduncle and lobes (but not the calyx). DPM neurons release serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) and peptides produced from the <italic>amnesiac</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waddell et al., 2000</xref>). These neurons are required for a delayed memory trace that appears in the MB about 30 min after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2005</xref>), and they participate in two forms of intermediate term memory, anesthesia-sensitive memory via the <italic>amnesiac</italic> gene, and anesthesia-resistant memory via serotonin and the <italic>radish</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Anesthesia-resistant memory involving the <italic>radish</italic> gene also occurs in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Widmann et al., 2016</xref>). As the DPM neurons are postembryonic, it is unknown whether larvae use another modulatory neuron for anesthesia-resistant memory.</p><p>On the MBON side, the output from the calyx in both larva and adult is cholinergic. In the larval stage, both MBON-a1 and -a2 receive similar input from Kenyon cells and from OAN-a1 and -a2; MBON-a1 also excites MBON-a2 via axo-axonic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). MBON-a2/MBON 22 persists as the major cholinergic output from the adult calyx, while MBON-a1/MBON 29 shifts from the calyx to adult medial lobe compartments. MBON-c1/MBEN-CA is added to the adult calyx, but since we do not know its mature anatomy, we cannot speculate on its function.</p><p>For the vertical lobe system, the output transmitters from the distal compartments of the adult medial and vertical lobes largely conform to those from the corresponding regions of the larval medial and vertical lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The adult α' and α (except α1) compartments have cholinergic output. The larval UVL compartment similarly has cholinergic output, but the transmitters of the MBONs from the IVL compartment are unknown.</p><p>The conservation of glutaminergic output of the distal medial lobe compartments between larva (UT, IT, and LT) and adult (γ4, γ5, β2, and β'2) comes from the same neurons being used in the two stages. The adult also has glutaminergic output from the α1 compartment provided by the two MBON 07s. These feedback on the α1 PAM neurons, thereby making a recurrent loop that is essential for appetitive long-term memory formation in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>). We could not determine the developmental origin of MBON 07. In the larva, though, MBON-e2/MBON 03 provides an analogous glutaminergic output from the vertical lobes. It also feeds back onto its input neuron (OAN-e1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>), perhaps providing an analogous circuit to support long-term memory formation in the larva.</p><p>The compartments at the bases of the lobes and peduncle show some scrambling of neurotransmitter output through metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The output from the larval LP compartment is cholinergic while the corresponding adult PED compartment has GABAergic output. The opposite shift is seen in the LVL ( = γ2) compartment, which has GABAergic output in the larva but cholinergic output in the adult. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, MBON-c1/MBEN-CA provides the cholinergic output from the larval LP compartment, but at metamorphosis it retracts from this compartment and dendrites from MBON-d1/MBON 11 invade the peduncle to provide the adult GABAergic output. The other compartmental shift in transmitter involves the larval LVL compartment; MBON-g1 and -g2 provide GABAergic output from this compartment, but at metamorphosis, they trans-differentiate to become central complex neurons. They are replaced by postembryonic-born MBON 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), which then provides cholinergic output for the adult γ2 and α'1 compartments. Thus, the compartmental shifts in output transmitters that occur at metamorphosis do not involve individual MBONs changing their transmitter. Rather, MBON recruitment, MBON loss, and MBONs shifting compartments combine to provide differences in transmitter landscapes in the two stages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Circuit-level implications of changes through metamorphosis</title><p>The examples of DAN-d1/PPL1 03 and DAN-c1/PPL1 01 depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref> show that shifting partners through metamorphosis can dramatically alter a neuron’s function. In the larva, pairing of DAN-d1 stimulation with an odor induces short-term aversive conditioning, whereas a similar pairing with DAN-c1 does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiglein et al., 2021</xref>). Their functions change in the adult, though, where DAN-c1/PPL1 01 becomes sufficient to induce short-term aversive conditioning to a paired odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das et al., 2014</xref>), while DAN-d1/PPL1 03 becomes involved in higher levels of memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). The metamorphic changes in the functioning of these two MBINs comes from changing their MBON partners. In its larval form, DAN-d1/PPL1 03 works through MBON-d1/MBON 11 in establishing short-term aversive conditioning. This MBON functions similarly in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>), but its adult input is provided by DAN-c1/PPL1 01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) rather than DAN-d1/PPL1 03. DAN-d1/PPL1 03, in turn, instructs a new partner, MBON 12, a cholinergic, postembryonic-born neuron that provides feed-back excitation to DAN-d1/PPL1 03 and feeds across to a set of medial lobe MBONs whose activity promotes avoidance behavior, while their suppression promotes approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). These interactions provide a pathway in the adult to mediate memory re-consolidation and extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCurdy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The adult form of DAN-c1/PPL1 01 has the added complexity that the type of learning it supports reverses depending on the time of its activity relative to the paired odor stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König et al., 2018</xref>). Its activation after presentation of the odor reinforces avoidance of the odor, but if the odor is presented after DAN-c1/PPL1 01 terminates its activity. The fly then shows a ‘relief’ response and the odor becomes attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">König et al., 2018</xref>). It does not have such a function in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>). In the larva, a similar time-dependent switch from appetitive to aversive learning is mediated through DAN-f1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiglein et al., 2021</xref>), a neuron that becomes incorporated into non-MB circuits in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Hence, the persisting MB neurons rearrange their connections at metamorphosis as some neurons are lost from the MB via trans-differentiation (e.g., MBON-c1) and other, adult-specific neurons are added (e.g., MBON 12). Such changes likely reflect ad hoc solutions that enable the construction of a larval circuit without needed late-born cell types by using other early-born neurons that display temporary phenotypes to make up for the missing cells. At metamorphosis, when the appropriate cell types are finally available, the temporary MB neurons trans-differentiate to evolutionarily ancestral phenotypes and the remaining neurons rewire into the adult circuit.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> summarizes the connections between uni-compartmental MBINs and MBONs that are found in the larva (blue), the adult (red), or both (yellow). Stable MBIN-MBON pairing persists through metamorphosis only in the calyx neuropil, which contains the Kenyon cell dendrites. By contrast, the combination of compartment shuffling, trans-differentiation and neuronal death in the lobe compartments results in a lack of uni-compartmental MBIN to MBON pairings persisting from larva to adult.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Fate of circuit connections in the mushroom body (MB) through metamorphosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Matrix showing the overlap of mushroom body input neuron (MBIN) axon terminals with mushroom body output neuron (MBON) dendrites in the same compartment.

For MBON-to-MBON interactions, larval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>) connectivity data are available for seven of the MBONs that function in both circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). There are 42 possible pair-wise connections amongst these cells. These MBONs are more highly interconnected in their adult configuration compared to their larval one: their adult configuration shows 13 connections (31% of possible connections), while their larval configuration has only 7 (17%). Importantly, only three of these connections (7%) are present in both larva and adult. This percentage is similar to the 5% predicted if the two stages were wired up independently at their respective frequencies. This low level of shared connections suggests that in both their larval and the adult configurations, the MBONs interconnect in a way that is best adapted to the respective life stage.</p><p>Experiments on aversive conditioning of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae suggested that the memory from larval training can persist through metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tully et al., 1994</xref>). We find that within the MB lobe system, none of the MBIN-MBON pairings persist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and persisting MBON-to-MBON connections are rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). At this level, our anatomical findings do not identify any simple circuit elements that would support the persistence of an associative memory trace from larva to adult. Thus, a surviving memory trace would need to involve more complex anatomical pathways, such as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>. However, this cannot be addressed in this study.</p><p>Our failure to find anatomical support in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for persistence of a memory trace from larva to adult should not be generalized to other insects with a larval stage. There is evidence that associative learning in moth caterpillars and beetle grubs can carry through to the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackiston et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackiston et al., 2008</xref>). Larvae of butterflies and beetles have an extended embryonic development compared to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and they hatch with a more complex larval nervous system. Consequently, more of the neuron types needed to make their MB are available to these embryos, likely making these insects less dependent on appropriating other neurons to temporarily function in the larval MB. A higher number of MB neurons persisting from the larva to adult increases the likelihood that a memory trace could persist from one stage to the other.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Metamorphic changes of the larval neurons</title><p>Although there are examples of neurons that change their neuropeptides during postembryonic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Veverytsa and Allan, 2012</xref>), our study did not find any neuron that changed its small molecule transmitter. The neurons did, though, show a great range of morphological changes. At one end of the spectrum were neurons like DAN-d1/PPL1 03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and MBON-j1/MBON 02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), whose larval and adult forms are very similar. At the other end of the spectrum are MBIN-b/PAL-OL and MBON-g/LALs-NO<sub>2</sub>i.b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which trans-differentiate into adult neurons that bear no similarity to their larval forms.</p><p>Neurons possessing the same form in both the larval and adult stages are like those of direct developing insects because they undergo their full developmental trajectory during embryogenesis and achieve their mature form at hatching. Other larval neurons have a morphology that appears to be based on pausing their developmental trajectory at an intermediate step and using this intermediate form as the basis for their larval morphology. The larval octopaminergic cells, OAN-a1 and -a2, fit this pattern. Their larval neurons stop at the MB calyx but in their adult form (OA-VUMa2), they extend beyond the calyx to form major arbors in the lateral horn neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 2009</xref>). A similar strategy occurs for thalamic neurons in the developing mammalian visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanold et al., 2003</xref>). These early-born neurons arrive at the cortical subplate prior to the birth of their granule cell targets in the visual cortex. They assume an intermediate phenotype, synapsing with the subplate neurons, but after the granule cells are born, they lose these temporary connections and grow into the cortex to find their final targets.</p><p>For other neurons, however, their larval form cannot be explained as a simple arrest along an ancestral developmental trajectory. The vertical axon branch of larval γ Kenyon cells is not seen as an intermediate stage in the development of γ neurons of direct developing insects such as crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malaterre et al., 2002</xref>). The larval form of these neurons requires a developmental deviation that adds new features to adapt the neurons’ morphology to the larval stage. The extreme version of adding larval-specific novelty is the radical change in cellular phenotype seen in trans-differentiating neurons like MBON-g and MBIN-b.</p><p>Cells that undergo trans-differentiation, like MBON-g/LALs-NO<sub>2</sub>i.b, show extensive pruning at the start of metamorphosis. Some neurons that have essentially the same morphology in larva and adult, like MBON-j1/MBON 04 and APL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), also show extreme pruning. But others, like DAN-c1/PPL 01 or DAN-d1/PPL1 03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), show only moderate arbor loss. This variation reflects the fact that while pruning is due to a cell autonomous developmental program triggered by the steroid ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schubiger et al., 1998</xref>), its trajectory may be guided in some cells by local interactions with pre- or postsynaptic targets. The importance of local interactions was experimentally examined for the pruning of APL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayseless et al., 2018</xref>). Blocking ecdysone action in APL inhibits its pruning response. The selective inhibition of ecdysone action in γ Kenyon cells, the main synaptic partners of APL, similarly inhibits γ cell pruning but also that of the untreated APL. Thus, while steroid signaling is needed to activate the neuron’s pruning program, the extent of neurite loss may depend on changes in synaptic partners. Similarly, for the MBINs, the larval LP and LA compartments retain γ neuron axons during pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watts et al., 2003</xref>), and we see that their MBINs (DAN-c1 and DAN-d1) maintain most of their axonal tufts through the pruning period. By contrast, neurons of distal medial lobe compartments, which lose their γ neuron axons, prune extensively even though they grow back to a similar adult morphology (e.g<italic>.,</italic> MBON j1/MBON 02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Relationship of lineage to metamorphic fates of MB neurons</title><p>The MBINs and MBONs of the adult CNS are produced by 10–15% of the ~100 NBs that construct each brain hemisphere. Most of the neuron types that serve as temporary larval MB neurons are recruited from these same lineages. Although larval NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sprecher et al., 2007</xref>) and adult lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) have been mapped and described, the two maps have not been reconciled. Indeed, in most cases, we do not know exactly which embryonic brain NB produces which postembryonic lineage. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> presents the major embryonic and postembryonic lineages that produce MBINs and MBONs. The Kenyon cells are produced by the four MBps that begin dividing at mid-embryogenesis and only finish just before the emergence of the adult. Their earliest embryonic cells differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kunz et al., 2012</xref>), but the four NBs produce identical lineages after they begin Kenyon cell production. All the other neuroblasts make a small number of neurons embryonically, but then arrest and subsequently resume cycling late in the first larval instar. Their small size during the dormant period makes them difficult to track through this transition.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>The lineage relationships of the major neuron types of the larval and adult mushroom bodies (MBs).</title><p>The four Kenyon cell neuroblasts (MBp) divide continuously from mid-embryogenesis until just before adult emergence. Three classes of Kenyon cells (different colors) are made in succession. The remaining neuroblasts have discrete embryonic and postembryonic phases of neurogenesis; neurons made during the first phase make the larval CNS. At metamorphosis, they are combined with neurons from the postembryonic phase to make the adult CNS. Origins and fates of MB neurons: (red) neurons that function in both the larval and adult MB; (blue) neurons that function in the larval MB but switch to non-MB circuits in the adult; (purple) postembryonic-born cells that function only in the adult MB: (white) neurons that function outside of the MBs. The name of the larval neuroblast and its embryonic lineage is paired with the most likely postembryonic lineage. Most postembryonic lineages are type I, in which progeny arise pairwise fashion from division of successive ganglion mother cells (shown as paired lines of cells). DL1 and DL2 show a type II pattern of division that increases the number of neurons produced because each neuroblast division produces an intermediate precursor cell that then divides to produce a small number of ganglion mother cells (shown as more disorganized clusters). See text for details.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80594-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Most MBINs come from the PPL1 and the PAM clusters. We find that the generation of the adult PPL1 is split, with some members born in the embryo and initially functioning as larval MBINs, while others are born after neurogenesis resumes in the larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The embryonic neuroblast that makes these neurons is CPd2 or 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>), and it appears to arrest in the midst of producing the PPL1 MBINs, a conclusion based on the observation that MBIN-c1 is born so late in embryogenesis that it is not yet incorporated into the MB circuitry at hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). The neuroblast is called DL2 when it reactivates in the larva and shows a type II pattern of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). The first neurons that DL2 produces after it resumes dividing are the remaining PPL1 MBINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2016</xref>). The adult PPL1 neurons, therefore, appear to arise as a set of neurons that straddle the temporary arrest of the DL2 neuroblast. Those born in the embryo then function as MBINs in both the larva and the adult, while those born in the larva delay their maturation into MBINs until metamorphosis. Based on their clustering with the ‘permanent MBINs,’ the embryonic-born PPL1 neurons that serve as temporary larval MBINs (OAN-e1, MBIN-e2, and DAN-f1) arise in the same lineage but must be produced earlier in embryogenesis.</p><p>The adult PAM neurons are all born during the postembryonic period and are produced by two closely related lineages, CREa1A and CREa2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). The first few postembryonic neurons born in both lineages are not PAM neurons. However, both neuroblasts soon switch into a repetitive mode, in which the ‘Notch-ON’ daughter (see below) of each GMC becomes a PAM neuron, a pattern repeated through the next ~75 GMCs. The generation of this large neuronal class at the end of their lineages is consistent with the general pattern that neurons within a hemilineage become more similar as a neuroblast progresses deeper into its lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Embryonic DAL CM1 and 2 are likely the embryonic version of CREa1A and 2A. One or the other makes four PAM neurons for use in the larva, but these subsequently die at metamorphosis. These temporary PAM neurons also seem to be born at the end of the embryonic neurogenic phase, because like MBIN-c1 described above, one of them, DAN-h1, is not yet incorporated in the MB circuitry at hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, after the CREa2A neuroblast resumes dividing in the larva, its first Notch-ON daughter degenerates right after its birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). We suggest that towards the end of its embryonic phase, the CREa2A neuroblast produces a set of GMCs, whose Notch-OFF daughter is required but whose Notch-ON daughter is ‘unneeded’ and fated to die. This pattern is carried through into the start of the postembryonic phase, as evident by the first postembryonic, Notch-ON daughter dying immediately after its birth. The Notch-ON daughters produced during embryogenesis, though, defer their deaths until metamorphosis and serve as temporary PAM neurons for the larva.</p><p>Members of various groups of MBONs are also related by lineage and by transmitter type. The adult has eight types of cholinergic MBONs that provide output from the α and α' compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). Three come from the FLAa2 neuroblast and are produced at the beginning of its postembryonic phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The remainder are produced within the postembryonic period by the DL1 neuroblast, another neuroblast that shows a type II pattern of division. Its divisions result in a series of GMCs that each divide to produce a cholinergic MBON and central complex neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Neither DL1 nor FLAa2 appear to contribute embryonic-born cells to the larval vertical lobe. We do not know the transmitters of the two IVL MBONs, but MBON-e1, from the UVL compartment, is cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). Curiously, it comes from the CPd2/3 group, a group that includes the PPL1 MBINs.</p><p>Besides the multicompartmental neuron, APL, the adult has four types of GABAergic MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). The β'1 compartment is innervated by eight MBON 10-type neurons. We do not know their origin although the large number of neurons in this group suggests that they are born during the postembryonic period. The remaining three types of GABAergic MBONs are embryonic-born and wholly or partially associated with γ compartments in both the larva and the adult. MBON-d1 comes from the DAL CM-1/2 group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saumweber et al., 2018</xref>), the same group responsible for the PAM neurons. Of special interest, though, are MBONs 08 and 09 from the DAL-V2/3 group. These neurons have overlapping compartmental functions in the adult, but are identical in the larva, showing essentially the same synaptic connectivity within the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>). This lineage produces four, rather than two, GABAergic MBONs in the larva, but the additional two larval cells (MBON-g1 and -g2) trans-differentiate into adult central complex neurons. The BLVa3/4 group that produces APL also produces two larval-specific GABAergic neurons, MBON-b1 and -b2, that become lateral horn neurons in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of transmitter expression in larval and adult forms of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and mushroom body input neurons (MBINs).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Neuron: larva/adult</th><th align="left" valign="top">Larval transmitter</th><th align="left" valign="top">Adult transmitter</th><th align="left" valign="top">Larval ref</th><th align="left" valign="top">Adult ref</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>MBINs</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">OAN-a1,a2/OA-VUM2a</td><td align="left" valign="top">Octopamine</td><td align="left" valign="top">Octopamine</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Selcho et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 2009</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">MBIN-b1,b2/PAL-OL</td><td align="left" valign="top">TH-positive</td><td align="left" valign="top">TH-positive</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eichler et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">DAN-c1/PPL1 01</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dopamine</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dopamine</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selcho et al., 2009</xref>;

These six types provide sufficient glutamatergic MBONs to cover larval medial lobe function, with an additional type leftover, MBON-e2/MBON 03, which is shifted to the larval vertical lobe. It provides glutamatergic output from the larval vertical lobe, perhaps analogous to that provided by MBON 07 from the adult α1 compartment.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, neuronal identity is established within a lineage by relative birth order of the GMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miyares and Lee, 2019</xref>) and by symmetry-breaking to establish different fates of the two daughters of the GMC division. Relative birth order is encoded at the start of neurogenesis by the sequential expression of a series of transcription factors, <italic>Hunchback → kruppel → pdm → castor,</italic> in the neuroblast as it divides. The transcription factor expressed at the time of division is passed into the GMC and then into her two daughter cells, thereby providing a record of relative birth order. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, an embryonic neuroblast typically reaches <italic>castor</italic> expression by the time of its arrest late in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>) and it typically resumes expressing <italic>castor</italic> when it reactivates in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). The phenotypes of the two siblings arising from the GMC division are established through Notch signaling, which results in a Notch-ON (‘A’) fate and a Notch-OFF (‘B’) fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skeath and Doe, 1998</xref>). Successive cells sharing that same Notch state typically have similar properties, resulting in the neuroblast producing two hemilineages (A and B) of neurons of related form and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Truman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). The information on relative birth order and hemilineage status then acts through a set of terminal selector genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>) to produce a characteristic neuronal phenotype. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B and C</xref> speculates on how these two mechanisms might be exploited to alter a neuron’s phenotype for specialized use in the larva.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>The origin of spatial-temporal information used to determine neuronal phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The early neuronal phenotypes within a lineage are determined by birth order of the ganglion mother cells (GMC). Birth order is encoded by a temporal program of transcription factor expression in the parent neuroblast (NB) as it divides. Transcription factor expression at the time of division is inherited by the GMC and its daughter neurons. Differences between the daughters is established by Notch (N) signaling with one sibling expressing the Notch-on (‘A’) fate and the other the Notch-off (‘B’) fate. This information, along with lineage identity factors, acts through a battery of terminal selector genes to establish neuronal phenotypes. (<bold>B</bold>) A hypothetical scheme to explain the metamorphic pattern of mushroom body input neuron (MBIN) recruitment and loss in the PPL1 cluster of dopamine neurons. It proposes that the Castor (cas) expressing neurons that are born in the DL1 lineage just before and after the embryonic neurogenic arrest are fated to become MBINs. The earlier born Pdm expressing neurons are also dopaminergic but their adult function is outside of the MB. Larval specification factors, though, modify how they interact with the terminal selector genes thereby transforming them into MBINs while the larval stage is maintained. (<bold>C</bold>) A hypothetical scheme using neurons of the DAL-V2/3 lineage to illustrate how sibling fates might be temporarily altered to recruit larval MBONs. In this scheme, two successive GMCs divide to produce one daughter that is an MBON and one that innervates the central complex, a dichotomy established by Notch signaling. With the evolution of the larva, Notch signaling is suppressed in the daughters during embryogenesis, allowing both to assume a similar fate – that of a larval MBON. With the reestablishment of normal Notch signaling at metamorphosis, the transformed daughter loses her MBON features and becomes a central complex neuron.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80594-fig12-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Information on birth order may underlie the changes seen in the PPL1 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). As described above, production of the set of neurons that become adult PPL1 MBINs spans the period of neuroblast arrest. We speculate that this block of neurons expresses <italic>cas</italic>. In this scenario, their earlier born siblings that serve as temporary larval MBINs would likely express the previous gene in the series of temporal transcription factors, <italic>pdm</italic>. At metamorphosis the Pdm+ neurons remain aminergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>) but shift to targets outside of the core MB circuitry. The speculative scheme depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref> proposes that in the adult, Cas and Pdm work via overlapping sets of terminal selector genes: both establish a dopaminergic phenotype, but only Cas activates genes targeting the neuron to the MB. The intercalation of the larval stage, though, would involve an additional ‘larval specification factor,’ whose presence alters the actions of Cas and Pdm on the terminal selector genes. In the presence of this hypothetical factor, Pdm also supports targeting to the MB, thereby transforming the Pdm+ group into MBINs, which innervate the larval vertical lobe. The subsequent loss of the larval specification factor at metamorphosis results in the Pdm+ neurons’ withdrawal from the MB and their redirection to non-MB targets.</p><p>Another way of recruiting neurons to the larval MB could involve modification of Notch signaling during a GMC division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). Our data on the DL1 lineage show six examples of GMCs whose division results in one daughter being an MBON and the other being a central complex cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We do not know the actual relationship of MBON-g/LAL.s-NO<sub>2</sub>i.b to MBON-h/MBON 09 within DAL-v2/3 lineage, but we propose a relationship like that seen in the DL1 lineage, with one daughter becoming an MBON (08 or 09) and the other a central complex neuron (LAL.s-NO<sub>2</sub>i.b). In this scenario, the four neurons come from two successive, embryonic-born GMCs. In the larva, however, both siblings become MBONs. This larval similarity could arise from altering embryonic Notch signaling. Typically, the ‘Notch-ON’ phenotype of the A sibling is established through the Notch target <italic>Hey</italic> (Hairy/enhancer-of-split like with a Y), a bHLH-O transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, in the Kenyon cell lineages, <italic>Hey</italic> expression is independent of <italic>Notch</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>) making both siblings ‘Notch-ON’ and identical. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref> suggests that a similar change in Notch state may have occurred for relevant GMCs of the DAL-v2/3 lineage, thereby allowing both siblings to express the MBON fate in the larva. The reestablishment of the normal Notch relationship at metamorphosis might then cause the MBON-gs to lose their MBON characteristic and to acquire their appropriate phenotypes as central complex neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The generation of the larval mushroom body</title><p>The neuronal identity in the insect CNS is generated according to a spatial and temporal pattern that is highly conserved through evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>). The earliest born neurons are often diverse sets of projection neurons that are the basis for the stereotyped tracts and commissures that characterize insect neuropils. Local interneurons are born later in lineages, and these become more similar as the lineage progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). The evolution of the holometabolous larva involved a shortening of embryonic development, producing a simplified larval body form that could successfully compete for ephemeral food sources. This shortening of insect embryogenesis, though, had a profound impact on their neuroblast-based mode of neurogenesis, resulting in a neurogenic arrest before lineages were complete. Hence, not only do larvae hatch with fewer neurons than found in the mature nervous system, but they should have only the types of neurons characteristic of the early portion of each lineage. Such a truncation may produce mismatches between the neuron types that are needed and those that have been made, i.e.<italic>,</italic> required late-born cell types may be missing and the larva may have early-born cell types that it does not need! Our analysis of the developmental relationship of the larval to the adult MB provides insight into how these mismatches are resolved.</p><p>The relationships of Kenyon cell classes to the MB vertical and medial lobes are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farris and Sinakevitch, 2003</xref>). The γ Kenyon cells are born first, and their axons form a medial lobe. They are followed by branched, αβ-type neurons, whose vertical axon branch forms a vertical (α) lobe and whose medial, β branch joins the γ cell axons in the medial lobe. In direct developing insects like crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malaterre et al., 2002</xref>), both γ and αβ-type Kenyon cells arise during embryogenesis to form the MB of the hatchling cricket, but the hatchling <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only the early-born γ neurons in its MB. In the absence of late-born αβ-type neurons, the γ neurons are modified with a larval-specific vertical axon branch that provides the basis for the larval vertical lobe. We find that the MBINs and MBONs that provide the input-output circuitry for the larval lobes are neurons that either function in the MB circuit in both larva and adult or function as MB neurons only temporarily in the larva. For the latter cells, we have concluded that their larval phenotype is a transient adaptation for the larval stage and their adult phenotype is more like that seen in their direct-developing ancestors. The deviation of a neuron’s larval phenotype from its adult phenotype therefore represents an adaptation to accommodate the lack of needed, late-born neurons.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> summarizes how the derived phenotypes of the larval MB neurons relate to their mature phenotypes in the adult brain. Previous studies on the abdominal nervous system showed that many larval neurons come from a pool of neurons that die during embryogenesis in direct developing insects, but their death is delayed in metamorphic insects to allow these neurons to function in the larval CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Truman, 2005</xref>). In the MB circuit, we found that the only neurons that were recruited from this pool of ‘doomed’ neurons were the four larval PAM neurons. The death, though, is perplexing because they are a neuron type needed by the adult, as shown by the addition of ~150 postembryonic born PAM neurons to the adult brain. We think that the death of the larval PAM neurons may be related to mechanisms that allow a particular neuron class to be expanded within its lineage. Two clusters of dopamine neurons homologous to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PAM clusters are already enlarged in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wendt and Homberg, 1992</xref>), so this expansion likely occurred before the evolution of complete metamorphosis. Possibly, very ancient insects made only a few PAM-like neurons, and these appeared early in their lineage at an appropriate timing for innervating the early-born γ neurons. If different neuron types maintain their relative order of production within this lineage, then a major expansion of an early-born PAM class would greatly delay the production of later neuron types. A modification that resulted in a PAM phenotype reappearing at the end of the lineage, however, would provide a late-born PAM class that could increase in number without interfering with the appearance of the earlier neurons. Developmental complications of integrating two sets of PAM cells (a small early set and an expanded late set) may have favored the late-born neurons, and thereby necessitated programmed cell death to remove the early-born PAM cells. This scenario brings up the intriguing possibility that after being consigned to the graveyard of unneeded embryonic cells for millions of years, the evolution of the larval stage provided a reason for these neurons to be ‘resurrected’ as temporary early-born PAM cells for use in the larval CNS.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Summary of the relationship of the function of embryonic-born adult neurons to their temporary functions in the larval mushroom body (MB).</title><p>Neurons that function in the MB of both larva and adults typically have similar positions in both structures, although some of the adult medial lobe mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) shift to the larval vertical lobes.

The MBINs and most of the MBONs whose terminal role continues in the MB have similar positions in both the larval and the adult MB. For a few MBONs, though, their larval MB function differs markedly from their adult MB function. The embryonic born, glutaminergic MBONs provide informative examples. The increased number of medial lobe compartments in the adult are innervated by more glutaminergic MBONs than are the smaller number of larval medial lobe compartments. We find that the full set of adult glutaminergic MBONs are made during embryogenesis, however. Most take up similar positions in the larval medial lobe while the ‘extra’ cells are modified to function in the larval vertical lobe. In this way, they temporarily substitute for the late-born cells that normally supply vertical lobe compartments. Many of the neurons that supply the larval-specific compartments of the intermediate peduncle and vertical lobes are neurons fated for non-MB circuits, and modified in the larval for only temporary use in the MB. Many are fated for adult-specific neuropils, such as the central complex or the optic lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). These temporary, larval MB neurons appear most frequently in lineages that also make permanent MBONs or MBINs. These cells already have the appropriate lineage information to produce the desired phenotypes; they only need to alter the phenotypic read-out of their temporal information and/or Notch state.</p><p>We suggest that a hypothetical ‘larval specifying factor(s)’ is involved in altering the interpretation of the temporal and spatial factors that establish neuronal phenotypes. The expression of such a factor would maintain the larval state but its disappearance at metamorphosis would mean that the larval phenotype could no longer be maintained, and the neurons could change to a mature phenotype appropriate to their temporal and spatial instructions. Indeed, recent studies show that the BTB/POZ transcription factor, Mamo, appears at metamorphosis and is need for the partially dedifferentiated larval neurons to acquire their adult state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2022</xref>). While the existence of a larval specification factor is hypothetical in this context, three transcription factors, <italic>chinmo</italic>, <italic>broad</italic>, and <italic>E93,</italic> act as master genes to specify the different life stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Truman and Riddiford, 2022</xref>). Also, in some insects, the larval stage is actively maintained by the sesquiterpene hormone, juvenile hormone, acting through its major target, the Krüppel-homolog 1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>). These genes may provide an entry into discovering how the development of terminal fates can be temporarily diverted to produce a novel, larval identity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were raised on standard corn meal molasses at either 25°C or room temperature.

spilt lines was maintained through metamorphosis using the flip-switch method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 2015</xref>. Using a similar strategy of the gene-switch method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roman et al., 2001</xref>), flippase was fused to the ligand-binding domain of the human progesterone receptor, rendering it dependent on progesterone or a progesterone mimic to move into the nucleus. Stable split lines were crossed to <italic>pJFRC48-13XLexAop2-IVS-myrtdTomato in su(Hw)attP8; Actin5Cp4.6&gt;dsFRT&gt;LexAp65 in su(Hw)attP5; pJFRC108-20XUAS-IVS-hPRFlp-p10 in VK00005/TM6</italic>.</p><p>We used the progesterone mimic mifepristone (RU486, Sigma-Aldrich; #M8046) to cause translocation of the flippase to the nucleus where it could then flip-out the STOP cassette in the Actin-LexAp65 transgene. We used surface application of RU486 to food vials. Parents were allowed to lay eggs in a food vial for a few days, then transferred to a fresh vial. Approximately 4 days after transfer, 60 μl of an ~10 mM RU486 stock solution (10 mg RU486 dissolved in 2 ml 95% ethanol) was applied to the surface of the food. At 24 hr after treatment, any larvae that had wandered and/or pupariated were discarded to ensure that test animals had fed on RU486 for at least 24 hr. At 48 hr after treatment, the subsequent wandering larvae and pupae (which had all fed on RU486 for 24–48 hr during the L3 stage) were collected and transferred to an untreated food vial. These animals were then dissected in Schneider’s S2 culture medium as adults. This treatment results in constitutive LexA expression in any cells that express GAL4 during the L3 stage, but, because the RU486 persists at least partway through metamorphosis, neurons that start expressing in early to mid-metamorphosis also show up.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Lineage-targeted twin-spot MARCM</title><p>Specific neuronal lineages were targeted using lineage-restricted drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awasaki et al., 2014</xref>) to label sister clones with twin-spot MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). The Vnd-GAL4 driver permits targeting 18 fly central brain lineages, including the FLAa2 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>); and stg14-GAL4 driver covers eight type II neuronal lineages, including the DL1 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Twin-spot clones were induced at specific times after larval hatching and examined at the adult stage by immunostaining and confocal imagining, following published work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Preparation and examination of tissues</title><p>Tissues were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.8) and fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde overnight at 4°C. Fixed tissues were rinsed in PBS-TX (PBS with 1% Triton X-100, Sigma), then incubated overnight at 4°C in a cocktail of 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:1000 rabbit anti-GFP (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:40 rat anti-N-Cadherin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and 1:40 mouse anti-Neuroglian or a 1:200 dilution of mouse anti-FasII (both Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). For visualization of tdTomato, a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-DsRed (ClonTech) was substituted for the anti-GFP and the anti-Neuroglian was omitted. After repeated rinses with PBS-TX, tissues stained for GFP were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:500 Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse, and Alexa Fluor 649-conjugated donkey anti-rat (all from Invitrogen). For visualization of RFP, staining was with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 649-conjugated donkey anti-rat. After exposure to secondaries, tissues were then washed in PBS-TX, mounted onto poly-lysine-coated coverslips, dehydrated through an ethanol series, cleared in xylenes, and mounted in DPX mountant (Sigma-Aldrich).

and complex processes in nature. The discrepancy in form and function between larvae, pupa, and adult insects is breathtaking, begging the question of how these forms and functions can so seamlessly follow each other. For the highest-order brain center of the insects, the mushroom body, the authors provide a masterpiece analysis of this process at the cellular level. Given the breadth and depth of the data that the authors present, the current study will serve as a reference for the field of developmental neuroscience for many years to come; indeed, the study data are eagerly awaited in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80594.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03gf8rp76</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Deryckere</surname><given-names>Astrid</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj8s172</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.09.495452">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.09.495452v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Astrid Deryckere (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see from the individual reviews, this work is greatly appreciated as a tour de force and will be of lasting value to science and the community. Therefore, some more effort in communicating these important results to both novices and experts will be invaluable. Some key points, primarily from reviewer 3 are summarised below but please do also carefully read each of the individual reviews.</p><p>1) One major concern is that although the hypothesis that the larval brain is derived seems very plausible, it is confusing to read for example in the abstract that the larval brain is the <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s second brain, while during the development of the animal, this is the first structure to be seen. This can be explained more clearly. As stated by one reviewer &quot;&quot;to start the abstract and the introduction with the evolutionary ancient scenario of development in hemimetabolous insects, NOT with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> individual-development scenario. This is because a process is best explained from the start, ie from the hemimetabolous beginnings. It is then much easier to grasp that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval stage is a pretty forced 'detour' from the ancient trajectory.&quot;</p><p>2) In a similar way, the results of this paper do not explain how the larval brain has evolved, but instead shed new perspectives on the process of metamorphosis. Therefore, the manuscript would benefit from a change of title and re-writing.</p><p>3) The discussion specifically is very long and covers a lot of topics, not all central to the data presented in the paper. Please consider substantial shortening (potentially other parts can be used in a future review). Additionally, the section 'Relationship of cell fate to mushroom body compartments' is more appropriate in the results and might make the results easier to interpret.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the abstract and introduction, I think a better job could be done to explain to general readers that the evolutionary and the individual trajectory in a sense are opposite. That is, the evolutionary trajectory is, in a sense, from an adult towards a larval brain, while the individual trajectory is from a larval to an adult brain. Most general readers, I think, would naively think both these trajectories are from larval ('worm-like') to adult, and I think it would be important to get this misunderstanding out of the way as early in the manuscript as possible.</p><p>I think the authors should try to knit in the MBINs into the scenario they present in the abstract, not only the MBONs.</p><p>It would seem better to me to start the abstract and the introduction with the evolutionary ancient scenario of development in hemimetabolous insects, NOT with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> individual-development scenario. This is because a process is best explained from the start, ie from the hemimetabolous beginnings. It is then much easier to grasp that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval stage is a pretty forced 'detour' from the ancient trajectory.</p><p>The figures are way too small, I think.</p><p>For the larval compartments, the authors use the established plain names and their abbreviations, e.g. shaft of medial lobe/ SHA, which is fine. Now, for the MBINs and MBONs names are established that read like eg DAN-h1, with the compartment indicated by the lower case letter, in this example h would stand for the SHA compartment. Again, this is fine.</p><p>However, in eg Figure 2B, C, and related figures, the sub-figures are labelled alphabetically (Figure 2B-a-b-c-d…), showing eg DAN-f1 in (d). I found this confusing. Maybe one could instead use Figure 2B-1-2-3-4…?</p><p>90: Also mention non-olfactory input (and introduce PNs as cell class).</p><p>97: Maybe better to mention already here up to which point do the KC axons prune back?</p><p>108: &quot;the&quot; input cells may not be properly understood by novices unless PNs and MBINs are clearly defined/ discriminated in the text.</p><p>110: Some MBINs are neither DANs nor OANs, right? Better define/ mention?</p><p>117: Maybe expressly say 10 compartments PLUS THE CALYX, as for novices it might not be clear that (and why) the calyx is not counted in.</p><p>135: Instead of &quot;most&quot; better give a percentage?</p><p>137: The authors nicely introduce the pairs of MBINs-MBONs… the most obvious question here is: for those MBINs and MBONs that do persist, do they stay together? As far as I understand the paper (p14, figure 10A, B), development seems to 'deliberately' make sure that they do not (excepting the calyx). This would be good to say here already (and maybe in the abstract). Given the rich functional data on the adult PPL1-01/MBON-11 pair, this may serve as an illustrative example. (To me, an important take-home message was that of all larval MBINs and MBONs, only the four medial lobe DANs die, while all others either remodel within the mushroom body or trans-differentiate into neurons with connections only outside the mushroom body. As a result, none of the larval MBIN-MBON pairs stays together (excepting the calyx))</p><p>Table 1 and Figure 2Ci: The established name is MBIN-c1, not DAN-c2, I think. Is there evidence that MBIN-c1 is dopaminergic? If so, how does this affect the assignment of the two adult PPL1-01s?</p><p>Table 1: Does &quot;undetermined&quot; and &quot;unknown&quot; mean the same? Better to use one expression only or define the difference.</p><p>141: How many are thus not-considered?</p><p>151: Easier to read if the sequence in the text matches the sequence in figure (from top to bottom).</p><p>Figure 4: Maybe the (A-I´) labels can go, and one could better put the larval names of the neurons to the left, and the adult names to the right.

Please consider substantial shortening (potentially other parts can be used in a future review). Additionally, the section 'Relationship of cell fate to mushroom body compartments' is more appropriate in the results and might make the results easier to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>The Discussion has been completely rewritten in line with the suggestions from the reviewers. Figures 8A, 9, 10C-F, and 11 of the old version have been removed. The discussion of neuronal remodeling strategies (Figure 8A) has been streamlined and instead of using four examples of changes of circuit function going from larva to adult (Figure 10C-F), we have reduced the discussion to only one example (New Figure 9C) which illustrates the complexities seen during metamorphosis. A proper comparison of the roles of these neurons in the larva and adult would be worth a paper in itself.</p><p>The line of the new Discussion is as follows: “Metamorphosis of mushroom body compartments”:</p><p>Figure 9A makes the point that 7 of the 10 larval compartments are incorporated into the adult MB (in that many of the same neurons function in both), while three larval compartments are not carried over into the adult. One has no adult counterpart while two are replaced with an adult-specific version (the adult vertical lobes)</p><p>“Transmitter stability and shifts through metamorphosis”: Figure 9B compares the transmitter output from the various adult compartments. Overall, there is a strong correspondence between the larva and adult systems but with a notable mismatch at the base of the lobes. As illustrated in Figure 9C is due to MBONs switching compartments rather than individual MBONs switching their transmitters.</p><p>“Circuit Level implications of changes through metamorphosis”: This section examines the circuit ramifications of compartment switching by MBONs/MBINs as well as trans-differentiation and addition of new neurons. Figure 10 confirms that changes in MBIN-MBON pairings occurs across the metamorphosing MB. At this level, there are no persisting connections that might support a memory trace through metamorphosis.</p><p>“Metamorphic changes of larval neurons” : Compared to the original version, this is a streamlined version of the range of changes that we see in neurons through metamorphosis, going from minor remodeling to trans-differentiation. It no longer has part of a figure associated with it (removal of old Figure 8A). One important point that we make is that one cannot use solely the extent of larva pruning to determine if a neuron is undergoing simple remodeling or is undergoing trans-differentiation.</p><p>“Relationship of lineage to metamorphic fates of MB neurons”: An important finding of the paper is the importance of trans-differentiation in recruiting neurons for the larval MB. The obvious question is how does this recruitment come about? Our finding that most recruits come from lineages that make permanent MBINs/MBONs is crucial because it allows us to focus on mechanisms that are known to control cellular phenotypes within a given lineage. The scenarios that we present in Figure 12B and C are admittedly speculative, but they are rooted in well understood mechanisms.</p><p>“The generation of the larval mushroom body”: This last section uses the lineage perspective explore some of the challenges that had to be overcome to evolve a larval mushroom body. Within the Holometabola, there has been selection to make a larva as rapidly as possible so that they can exploit temporary food sources (rotting fruit, dung, carcasses, etc.) before they are gone. Rapid embryogenesis, though, results in an early truncation of neurogenesis and relatively few neurons to make a larval brain. Based on the highly conserved mechanisms that determine neuronal phenotypes in insects, this truncation should result in the larva lacking some cell types that it needs to make a MB while having other cell types that it does not need. We find that trans-differentiation provides a mechanism to temporarily convert the latter into the former. We think that this is an important evolutionary insight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the abstract and introduction, I think a better job could be done to explain to general readers that the evolutionary and the individual trajectory in a sense are opposite. That is, the evolutionary trajectory is, in a sense, from an adult towards a larval brain, while the individual trajectory is from a larval to an adult brain. Most general readers, I think, would naively think both these trajectories are from larval ('worm-like') to adult, and I think it would be important to get this misunderstanding out of the way as early in the manuscript as possible.</p><p>I think the authors should try to knit in the MBINs into the scenario they present in the abstract, not only the MBONs.</p><p>It would seem better to me to start the abstract and the introduction with the evolutionary ancient scenario of development in hemimetabolous insects, NOT with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> individual-development scenario. This is because a process is best explained from the start, ie from the hemimetabolous beginnings. It is then much easier to grasp that the Drosophila larval stage is a pretty forced 'detour' from the ancient trajectory.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done in the revised introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figures are way too small, I think.</p></disp-quote><p>We have enlarged many of the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the larval compartments, the authors use the established plain names and their abbreviations, e.g. shaft of medial lobe/ SHA, which is fine. Now, for the MBINs and MBONs names are established that read like eg DAN-h1, with the compartment indicated by the lower case letter, in this example h would stand for the SHA compartment. Again, this is fine.</p><p>However, in eg Figure 2B, C, and related figures, the sub-figures are labelled alphabetically (Figure 2B-a-b-c-d…), showing eg DAN-f1 in (d). I found this confusing. Maybe one could instead use Figure 2B-1-2-3-4…?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the unnecessary complexity from the numbering of the subfigures in Figures2 and 3. We thought it would make it easier to go from the summary (part B) to the images (part C). In the revised figures (now Figures3 and 4). We no longer use subfigure lettering – e.g. Figure 2Ba, and the larval neurons are indicated by their name in the summary (part A) and the images (part B). To allow us to make the images larger, we have not shown the larval anatomy for the four neurons that die, or the four neurons whose fates are unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>90: Also mention non-olfactory input (and introduce PNs as cell class).</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>97: Maybe better to mention already here up to which point do the KC axons prune back?</p></disp-quote><p>The compartments that lose γ axons during pruning are now indicated in Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>108: &quot;the&quot; input cells may not be properly understood by novices unless PNs and MBINs are clearly defined/ discriminated in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>This should now be clear from the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>110: Some MBINs are neither DANs nor OANs, right?

As far as I understand the paper (p14, figure 10A, B), development seems to 'deliberately' make sure that they do not (excepting the calyx). This would be good to say here already (and maybe in the abstract). Given the rich functional data on the adult PPL1-01/MBON-11 pair, this may serve as an illustrative example. (To me, an important take-home message was that of all larval MBINs and MBONs, only the four medial lobe DANs die, while all others either remodel within the mushroom body or trans-differentiate into neurons with connections only outside the mushroom body. As a result, none of the larval MBIN-MBON pairs stays together (excepting the calyx))</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested the PPL1 01/MBON-11pair is part of the specific illustration provided in Figure 9C.
