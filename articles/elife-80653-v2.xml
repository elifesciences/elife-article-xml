Changes in nuclear morphology are associated with disease, including cancer, as well as with premature and normal aging. Despite the very fundamental nature of nuclear morphology, the cellular factors that determine nuclear shape and size are not well understood. To identify regulators of nuclear architecture in a systematic and unbiased fashion, we performed a high-throughput imaging-based siRNA screen targeting 867 nuclear proteins including chromatin-associated proteins, epigenetic regulators, and nuclear envelope components. Using multiple morphometric parameters, and eliminating cell cycle effectors, we identified a set of novel determinants of nuclear size and shape. Interestingly, most identified factors altered nuclear morphology without affecting the levels of lamin proteins, which are known prominent regulators of nuclear shape. In contrast, a major group of nuclear shape regulators were modifiers of repressive heterochromatin. Biochemical and molecular analysis uncovered a direct physical interaction of histone H3 with lamin A mediated via combinatorial histone modifications. Furthermore, disease-causing lamin A mutations that result in disruption of nuclear shape inhibited lamin A-histone H3 interactions. Oncogenic histone H3.3 mutants defective for H3K27 methylation resulted in nuclear morphology abnormalities. Altogether, our results represent a systematic exploration of cellular factors involved in determining nuclear morphology and they identify the interaction of lamin A with histone H3 as an important contributor to nuclear morphology in human cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>lamins</kwd><kwd>histones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 1-ZIA-BC010309-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Misteli</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 1-ZIC-BC011567-08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pegoraro</surname><given-names>Gianluca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R35GM134885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH P20GM103432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hatch project #1012152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>Daniel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromatin modifiers shape nuclear morphology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In physiological conditions, organelles have predictable morphologies in a cell-type and tissue-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, abnormal and heterogenous organelle morphology is a prominent hallmark of many types of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bexiga and Simpson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galloway and Yoon, 2013</xref>). In particular, changes in nuclear size and shape are frequently associated with cancer and aging, and evaluation of aberrant nuclear morphology is routinely used in histology-based diagnostics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantwell and Dey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pathak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zink et al., 2004</xref>). The comprehensive identification and characterization of cellular factors that determine and maintain nuclear morphology is important to elucidate the basic molecular mechanisms that determine overall nuclear architecture and to understand how abnormal nuclear morphology contributes to disease.</p><p>Nuclear morphology is highly plastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoskins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Versaevel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Changes to nuclear shape and size occur during developmental processes such as cellular division, differentiation, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skinner and Johnson, 2017</xref>). For example, in early <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> development, embryonic nuclei appear spherical and small while at later stages they assume a more elongated shape with an increase in overall nuclear size. Mutant studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> identified kugelkern (kuk), a lamin-like nuclear protein, as one factor required for these nuclear morphology changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandt et al., 2006</xref>). In line with these nuclear shape changes during development, in adult tissues even within the same organism, different cell types often display distinct nuclear shapes and sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). The cellular factors that determine cell-type and tissue-specific nuclear morphology are only partially understood.</p><p>One mechanism implicated in nuclear size control is transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy and Heald, 2012</xref>). The NPC acts as gateway between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm and both negative and positive regulators of nuclear transport have been shown to control the size of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jevtić et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy and Heald, 2012</xref>). In particular, the levels of the nuclear transport factors importin alpha and NTF2 regulate nuclear size in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>), and inhibition of nuclear exportin XPO1 with leptomycin B has been shown to increase nuclear size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila,</italic> which is a unicellular eukaryote that maintains a macronucleus (MAC) and a micronucleus (MIC), expresses four Nup98 homologs which maintain MAC- and MIC-specific localization. Domain swapping experiments between MAC- and MIC-specific Nup98 proteins resulted in changes in nuclear size indicating that NPC composition can regulate nuclear size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iwamoto et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, the nuclear pore protein ELYS affects nuclear size in human epithelial cells by controlling NPC density and nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jevtić et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Obvious candidates that determine nuclear morphology are nuclear lamins and other proteins associated with the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deolal and Mishra, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pathak et al., 2021</xref>). The nuclear lamina is a proteinaceous network of multiple intermediate filament lamin proteins localized at the nuclear periphery between the nucleoplasm and the nuclear envelope. The human genome encodes three lamin genes: <italic>LMNA</italic>, <italic>LMNB1</italic>, and <italic>LMNB2</italic>, of which <italic>LMNA</italic> produces two protein isoforms, lamin A and lamin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Leeuw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karoutas and Akhtar, 2021</xref>). Loss of or mutations in lamina proteins result in dysmorphic nuclei, increased DNA damage, and chromatin organization abnormalities and numerous human diseases, referred to as laminopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marcelot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shin and Worman, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong and Stewart, 2020</xref>), which include striated muscle diseases, lipodystrophies, neurological syndromes, and premature aging disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karoutas and Akhtar, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Méndez-López and Worman, 2012</xref>). One dramatic laminopathy is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), an exceedingly rare, premature aging disease which results in shortened lifespan, loss of subcutaneous fat, and cardiac abnormalities, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>). HGPS is caused by a silent point mutation in <italic>LMNA,</italic> that leads to aberrant splicing and to the production of a mutant version of lamin A, referred to as progerin, which carries an internal 50 amino acid deletion at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>). Progerin expression in HGPS cells acts in a dominant-negative fashion and results in misshapen nuclei, loss of heterochromatin, and increased endogenous DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, progerin has also been implicated in normal human aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the lamin proteins, chromatin has also been implicated in nuclear morphology. Early observations showed that in <italic>T. thermophila</italic>, a specific nuclear histone linker protein is required for the reduced nuclear size in micronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 1995</xref>). In addition, epigenetic readers and modifiers affect nuclear size. For example, overexpression of the histone H3 acetyltransferase BRD4 increases nuclear size in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devaiah et al., 2016</xref>). In MCF10A breast epithelial cells, a number of epigenetic and chromatin factors, including several core histones, have been shown to affect nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tamashunas et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, recent observations suggest that the interaction of chromatin with lamins contributes to determining nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karoutas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stephens et al., 2019a</xref>). Single cell micromanipulation revealed two independent responses to mechanical forces, nuclei responded to small manipulations through chromatin and larger manipulations through lamin A/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stephens et al., 2017</xref>). Further studies of the role of chromatin in regulating nuclear morphology found chromatin to regulate nuclear dynamics and rigidity. In particular, manipulating the relative levels of euchromatin and heterochromatin altered nuclear architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stephens et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stephens et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, in cells with perturbed chromatin or lamins, increased heterochromatin suppressed nuclear blebbing and maintained nuclear rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stephens et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stephens et al., 2019b</xref>). Close interplay between lamins and chromatin is also illustrated by the observation that loss of the lysine acetyltransferase MOF or its associated NSL-complex members KANSL2 or KANSL3 leads to altered mechanical properties of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karoutas et al., 2019</xref>). While this effect appears to be due to reduced lamin acetylation, the observed changes in nuclear morphology are accompanied by alterations of the epigenetic chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karoutas et al., 2019</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that nuclear size and shape are not determined by a single factor but rather are the result of an intricate interplay of architectural nuclear proteins with chromatin.</p><p>Nuclear morphology changes are routinely observed in pre-neoplastic and malignant cancer tissues. For example, tumor cells commonly display nuclear morphology abnormalities compared to nuclei in surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chow et al., 2012</xref>). Anecdotal observations have identified multiple factors implicated in nuclear morphology and misregulation, and some of these factors have been linked to oncogenesis. For instance, mutations or alterations in expression of components of the LINC complex (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton), such as SYNE1 and SYNE2, which localize to the nuclear envelope and connect to the nuclear lamina, result in misshapen nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lüke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Alterations to SYNE1 and SYNE2 have been observed in colorectal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yu et al., 2015</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2014</xref>), breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zuo et al., 2011</xref>), glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Masica and Karchin, 2011</xref>), and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doherty et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, misexpression or mislocalization of nuclear lamins has been documented in both cancerous cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broers et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moss et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, lamin A/C is overexpressed in colorectal cancers, where it correlates with poor prognosis, and overexpressing GFP-lamin A in colorectal cancer cells increases cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Willis et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, reduced lamin A/C expression is documented in carcinomas of the esophagus, as well as in breast, cervical, and ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prokocimer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite the fundamental nature of nuclear morphology and its link to disease, our knowledge of nuclear components and mechanisms that regulate nuclear size and shape is very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantwell and Dey, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have used an imaging-based high-throughput RNAi screen to systematically identify epigenetic- and nuclear envelope-associated factors that affect nuclear morphology in multiple cell lines. We find known and novel determinants of cell type-specific and general nuclear morphology and uncover a novel mechanism of lamin-chromatin interactions mediated via histone H3 and its epigenetic modifications as a critical modulator of nuclear morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An imaging-based screen to identify determinants of nuclear size and shape</title><p>We developed an imaging-based RNAi screen to identify and characterize novel cellular factors that regulate nuclear morphology, particularly nuclear shape and size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We focused on nuclear proteins that may affect nuclear morphology via interactions that take place either at the nuclear membrane or within the nucleus. To this end, we screened karyotypically normal hTERT-immortalized dermal fibroblasts against two siRNA oligos libraries targeting 346 proteins that localize to the nuclear membrane and 521 proteins involved in epigenetic and chromatin regulation, respectively (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). For each gene targeted in the library, immortalized fibroblasts were reverse transfected in 384-well format with three unique siRNAs in three separate wells. Seventy-two hr after siRNA reverse transfection, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immuno-stained with antibodies against lamin A/C and lamin B1, and with DAPI to visualize DNA and to assess changes to nuclear morphology (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Images were acquired on a high-throughput spinning disk confocal microscope and nuclear morphology was quantified using an automated image analysis pipeline (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To assess multiple aspects of nuclear morphology, nuclear length, width, area, and circularity were measured simultaneously for all samples, treated as independent parameters, and used for hit identification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). The screen was performed in biological duplicates and results were strongly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A non-targeting siRNAs was used as a negative control, and a mix of siRNA oligos with a lethal phenotype was used as a positive technical control to measure transfection efficiency (see Materials and Methods). In addition, an siRNA targeting <italic>LMNA</italic> was used as a positive control based on the previously demonstrated role <italic>LMNA</italic> plays in maintaining nuclear shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lammerding et al., 2004</xref>) and as a control for fluorescence intensity levels of immuno-stained lamin A/C. Single cell measurements were averaged on a per well basis. Mean per well values were normalized on a per plate basis using the B-score formula. B-score values were then standardized across a single replicate as robust Z-scores. Z-scores from the two replicates were averaged to obtain a mean Z-score per siRNA oligo. Z-scores measure the number of standard deviations a sample was away from the mean of all the samples in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Genes were defined as hits if their median Z-score (two out of three siRNA oligos targeting the same gene) was ±1.5 (see Materials and Methods for details). To eliminate false-positive hits due to cell death, altered cell cycle behavior, or indirect proliferation effects, we excluded any hits with a cell number Z-score of less than –2. As expected, excluded hits included spindle assembly checkpoint components <italic>MAD2L1</italic>, <italic>BUB1</italic>, and cell cycle-related kinases <italic>AURKA</italic> and <italic>AURKB,</italic> among others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A high-throughput image-based screen for nuclear size and shape determinants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the nuclear morphology screen to identify genes required for proper nuclear shape and size.

Cells were imaged using high-throughput microscopy and an image analysis pipeline was developed to segment individual nuclei, measure nuclear morphology, and lamin A/C and lamin B1 intensity.

We generated GST fusions proteins of various fragments of lamin A or C, purified them, and incubated them with histones derived from calf thymus to test for direct binding to histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). We find that GST-lamin A containing the entire Ig-fold and C-terminus (aa 389–646) binds directly to histone H3, but not to the other core histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). GST-lamin A lacking the C-terminal 80aa (aa 389–566) or the C-terminal region of GST-lamin C (aa 389–572) did not bind to histone H3, suggesting that the unique portion of lamin A present in the C-terminus tail is required for the histone H3 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, while the lamin A tail was required for H3 binding, this region (aa 565–646) was not sufficient for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), possibly due to its disordered nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qin et al., 2011</xref>). We conclude that lamin A can directly interact with core histone H3 via its C-terminal tail along with a portion of the homologous region present in both lamin A and lamin C.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>In vitro binding of lamin A to histone H3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram of constructs used in binding assays.

The addition of DTT increased lamin A-H3 interactions suggesting lamin A binds to histone H3 as a monomer and dimerization limits its binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, since both lamin A and lamin C can form dimers, bind to DNA, are co-expressed in vivo, and lamin C does not bind histone H3, we asked whether lamin C binding to lamin A can inhibit histone H3 binding via dimer formation. Co-incubation of the C-termini of GST-lamin A (aa 389–646) and GST-lamin C (aa 389–572) in a histone pulldown assay reduced lamin A-histone H3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The addition of DTT reversed inhibition, suggesting lamin C inhibits lamin A through dimerization at cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The array consists of 384 unique histone peptides spotted onto a slide representing peptides of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 with multiple common modifications including serine/threonine phosphorylation, lysine acetylation, and methylation among others (see Materials and Methods). Binding assays using recombinant lamin A (aa 506–646) added to the array confirmed interaction of lamin A with histone H3, and also revealed preferential binding to several histone modifications, including combinations of modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3E</xref>). In fact, the peptides that showed the strongest lamin A signal contained a combination of modifications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3E</xref>).

Mutations to histone H3.3 were first found in pediatric high-grade glioma and later in chondrosarcomas and giant cell tumors of the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weinberg et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, mutations to histone H3.3 have been associated with congenital disorders such as craniofacial and brain abnormalities, and developmental delay among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bryant et al., 2020</xref>).

We thus asked whether disease-relevant H3 mutants are sufficient to induce nuclear morphology defects. Histone H3.1 variants carrying dominant mutations K9M, or K27M or H3.3 mutants at K9M, K27M, or K36M were stably expressed in hTERT-immortalized fibroblast cells and nuclear morphology assessed. Expression of mutant histones in individual cells slightly increased expression of total histones but expression was not cytotoxic and did not affect proliferation as no changes to overall cell number were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Expression of histone H3.1 mutations had little effect on nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Expression of H3.3 mutants K9M, K27M, or K36M decreased circularity of the nucleus and reduced nuclear size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>).

In line with these earlier findings, we identified multiple components of the NPC such as <italic>NUP205, NUP62, NUPL1,</italic> and <italic>NUP85</italic> as well as a number of nuclear membrane proteins such as <italic>SYNE1</italic>, <italic>CHMP6, TMEM19,</italic> and <italic>GOSR2</italic> which validate our screening method. Our results are also in line with previous screening studies using the elliptic Fourier coefficient as a distinct parameter to quantitatively identify misshapen nuclei in MCF10A breast epithelial cells which targeted 608 epigenetic gene products and found 33 determinants of nuclear shape, including a number of epigenetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tamashunas et al., 2020</xref>).

Our analysis extends those studies by identifying several epigenetic factors, particularly histone modifiers and readers, as determinants of nuclear morphology. Furthermore, our experimental design assessed nuclear size in addition to nuclear shape in multiple cell types. Remarkably, we find distinct sets of size and shape determinants in individual cells lines. Lack of overlap between nuclear size and shape hits even among the same cell type underscores the complexity of nuclear morphology regulation and the need for large-scale screens using multiple measurement parameters in parallel to identify regulators of nuclear morphology.</p><p>Comparing the size and shape determinants in immortalized human fibroblasts and breast epithelial cells showed remarkably little overlap in determinants of nuclear morphology. The cell-type differences may be due to a number of reasons. One possibility is that different cell types use distinct networks and pathways to regulate nuclear morphology. Given that nuclear morphology does not seem to be controlled by a single dedicated pathway, but rather appears to be the result of multiple mechanisms, this scenario seems unlikely. Alternatively, it is possible that there are innate cellular features among cell lines that affect nuclear morphology. For example, differences in the rate of cell division, the amount of cell adhesion, nuclear import/export rates, or differing amounts of chromatin or lamin stability may affect nuclear morphology. Previously we found that knockdown of the nuclear pore component ELYS resulted in a aberrant nucleus phenotype in breast epithelial cells, and that comparison of nuclear size in ELYS knockdown cells among four different cell types found varying degrees of nuclear size reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jevtić et al., 2019</xref>). In the light of our finding of a prominent role of chromatin and epigenetic factors in determining nuclear morphology, an attractive possibility is that the differences in cellular factors that contribute to nuclear morphology in different cell types reflect cell type-specific epigenetic landscapes in which chromatin modulates nuclear morphology. More systematic analysis of a more diverse set of cell types in future studies should begin to address this question. While biologically distinct mechanisms likely regulate nuclear morphology and the nucleus-cell ratio, our screen focused on nuclear morphology given the technical challenges of accurately measuring the volumes of adherent cells. Other organisms such as fission yeast may be more amenable to screens for regulators of the nucleus-cell ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cantwell and Nurse, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kume et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Lamins have been widely implicated in maintenance of nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lammerding et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matias et al., 2022</xref>). Reassuringly, and as expected, <italic>LMNA</italic> was the second strongest hit in our screens. However, many effectors of size and shape identified here exerted their effect without affecting lamin A/C levels. Instead, the nuclear shape screen identified a group of chromatin modifiers. This is in line with previous work pointing to a combined contribution of lamins and chromatin, and their interplay, to nuclear morphology and biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stephens et al., 2017</xref>). A prominent role of chromatin in nuclear morphology is suggested by the observation that nuclear blebbing can be promoted or inhibited by treating cells with drugs that increase euchromatin or heterochromatin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stephens et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, alterations to euchromatin and heterochromatin rescue nuclear morphology defects in disease model cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stephens et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the lysine acetyltransferase HAT1 which acts on newly incorporated histone H4 increased nuclear size, nuclear blebbing, and micronuclei and loss of HAT1 acetylation disrupts chromatin regions associated with the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Popova et al., 2021</xref>). Along the same lines, acetylation of lamin A via the acetyltransferase MOF leads to changes in nuclear morphology and epigenetic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karoutas et al., 2019</xref>). These observations, combined with our findings, highlight a prominent role for histone modifications in regulation of nuclear size and shape. Our finding of a direct effect of histone modification mutants of H3.3 on nuclear morphology supports this scenario.</p><p>Although it is well established that chromatin is closely juxtaposed with the nuclear lamina and genome regions which associate with the lamina can be mapped as lamin-associated domains, the precise nature of chromatin-lamin interactions is largely unknown. We find that lamin A, but not lamin C, directly interacts with histone H3. This finding adds to the prior identification of a C-terminal region, present on both lamin A and lamin C, that can bind to DNA, and linker DNA assembled onto nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stierlé et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, progerin mutations reduced lamin-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruston et al., 2010</xref>). Our studies identify a novel lamin A-histone H3 interaction independent of DNA binding. We map two distinct regions located within the C-terminal unstructured tail and within the globular domain which are required for lamin A-H3 interactions, and we suggest that these interactions occur in the context of lamin A monomers. The binding of lamin A to histones seems to be facilitated by histone modifications, because we find enhanced binding of lamin A to dual (Rme2/Kme1-me2) modifications which are associated with transcriptionally repressive marks on heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di Lorenzo and Bedford, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang and Reinberg, 2001</xref>). These findings point to a mechanism by which chromatin-lamin A interactions via modified histone H3 tails contribute significantly to nuclear morphology. While our results provide information on the in vitro binding of lamin A and histones, the role and regulatory mechanisms of lamin A in binding to either DNA or histones in vivo, and its subsequent recruitment to chromatin in the complex in vivo nuclear environment, remain to be explored. The precise nature of this interaction and what the downstream effect of this lamin A-histone H3 interaction is will require further studies.</p><p>Changes to nuclear shape and size have been documented in many types of cancer and nuclear morphology changes are often correlative with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pienta and Coffey, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wolberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zink et al., 2004</xref>). In line with a role of disease-associated histone epigenetic modifiers in contributing to nuclear dysmorphia and disease, we find that expression of K9 and K27 methylation mutants of histone H3.3, in which K27 mutants are also oncogenic, shows changes to nuclear morphology. This finding is relevant since histone H3.3K27M mutations were identified in a subset of pediatric patients with glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khuong-Quang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>) and H3.3K36M mutations were documented in chondrosarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behjati et al., 2013</xref>), which are also characterized by extensive nuclear aberrations. Although we do not know whether oncohistones exert their effects via lamin A and/or changes in nuclear size and shape, these findings are in line with our observation of direct physical interaction of lamins with histones.</p><p>Taken together, the use of imaging-based screening reported here significantly expands the list of cellular factors that contribute to nuclear morphology. Our findings of an enrichment of chromatin factors and the fact that the vast majority of nuclear size and shape effectors exerts their function without alteration of lamin protein levels highlight the important role chromatin plays in determining nuclear shape and size.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human cell culture</title><p>Previously described karyotypically normal hTERT-immortalized dermal fibroblasts cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2011</xref>) were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in minimum essential medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.

Cells were reverse transfected with siRNA oligos targeting specific genes at a 20 nM final concentration in 40 μL of complete media and were grown for 72 hr at 37°C. The screen used custom siRNA libraries (siRNA Silencer Select, Thermo Fisher) targeting proteins that localize to the nuclear membrane (346 genes) or proteins involved in epigenetic and chromatin regulation (521 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Each gene was targeted with three different siRNAs placed in individual wells, for a total of 2601 siRNA experiments per screen. A non-targeting, scrambled siRNA (Thermo Fisher, #4390847) was used as a negative control and the AllStars Hs Cell Death Control siRNA (QIAGEN) was used as a control to score transfection efficiency and for assay optimization. An siRNA targeting lamin A/C (Thermo Fisher, #8390824) was used as a positive biological control to score nuclear shape changes. After siRNA treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times for 5 min in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, washed three times for 5 min in PBS, and blocked in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% BSA for 30 min. For detection and measurement of nuclear morphology, cells were immuno-stained with primary antibodies against lamin A/C (Santa Cruz, sc-376248, mouse, 1:1000) and lamin B1 (Santa Cruz, sc-6217, goat, 1:500) in PBST with 1% BSA for 4 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Cells were then washed three times for 5 min with PBST and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with secondary antibodies diluted in 1% BSA in PBST containing DAPI (5 ng/μL), before washing three times for 5 min in PBST. The screen was performed in two biological replicates on different days.</p><p>Immuno-stained plates were imaged using an Opera QEHS (PerkinElmer) dual spinning disk high-throughput confocal microscope using a 40× water immersion lens (NA 0.9). The high-throughput microscope acquired images using two CCD cameras (1.3 Megapixels) with pixel binning set at 2×2 (pixel size: 323 nm). The DAPI channel utilized the 405 nm laser for excitation and the 450/50 nm bandpass filter for acquisition, lamin B1 expression was imaged using the 488 nm laser for excitation and a 520/35 nm bandpass filter for acquisition, and lamin A/C expression was imaged using the 561 nm laser for excitation and the 600/40 nm bandpass filter for acquisition. DAPI, lamin B1, and lamin A/C images were acquired at a single focal plane. Thirty randomly selected fields of view were imaged per well, and typically &gt;250 cells per well were analyzed.</p><p>Quantification of nuclear size and shape were performed using a customized software pipeline. Images generated were analyzed using the Columbus 2.6 high content imaging analysis software (PerkinElmer). An analysis pipeline was generated where nuclei were segmented using the DAPI staining image. Partial nuclei located at the edge of the image were excluded from subsequent steps of the analysis. To identify nuclear geometric changes, nuclear area, width, length, and circumference were measured as well as mean fluorescence intensity of lamin A/C and lamin B1. Single cell measurements were computed into mean per well values. To identify nuclear shape hits, circularity values (circularity = 4πArea/perimeter<sup>2</sup>) were calculated on a mean per well basis. To identify nuclear size hits, nuclear area was calculated on a mean per well basis. RStudio software, R, and the cellHTS2 R package (v 2.36.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutros et al., 2006</xref>) used the B-score method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brideau et al., 2003</xref>) to normalize mean per well values on a per plate basis using the median of all the library wells on the plate. B-score values for all the samples in a single biological replicate were then normalized across a single replicated to generate Z-scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) for each well/siRNA oligo.</p><p>The Z-score value for each sample (well) was calculated as the robust Z-score = (B-score value – median of the B-score for all samples)/(median absolute deviation of the B-scores for the samples). The Z-score indicates how many units of variance, either above or below, a sample is from the median of all measurements for the samples. For an individual sample, the further the Z-score is from 0, the larger the degree in which the sample is from the median of all samples. A diagram explaining the Z-score calculations used to measure nuclear size and shape is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. The screen was performed twice on different days, and Z-scores from each biological replicate were averaged to generate a final mean Z-score for each siRNA oligo in the library. Positive hit genes were identified by Z-scores ±1.5 in at least two of the three unique siRNAs targeting each gene. Hits that fit these criteria but that displayed a significant effect (Z-score equal or less than –2) on cell number were eliminated from analysis and were confirmed to include several known regulators of the cell cycle, proliferation, and mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Recombinant protein expression and purification</title><p>Fragments of human lamin A, lamin C, and progerin were cloned into the pGEX4T1 vector to generate N-terminally tagged GST fusion proteins.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dennis Discher (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Transparency and interpretability of how the screen was performed and the use of Z-scores: The authors must provide a clear explanation of the z-score and how it is produced from the raw data to represent nuclear roundness/shape and size in the manuscript. In particular, there was concern that the measure might not address whether there are relatively few nuclei with very perturbed structures or instead a rather smaller deviation across all or most cells in a given condition – more clarity on this should be included in the revision. The authors are also encouraged to provide values or examples along the z-score axis to allow the reader to see how the direct measurements (area and perimeter) translate into the reported z-scores. Addressing these points is essential for readers to put this study in the context of others that report data as a deviation from circularity from 1 to 0, as well as allowing the reader to compare data in Figures1-3 and Figure 6. Last, the authors need to more clearly justify and communicate that they have removed hits with z-scores below -2, including stating that the focus of the work is on what amounts to genes with more subtle effects on nuclear size and shape. Given the stated criteria, it is also important for the authors to address how they have concluded that the included screen hits do not impact the cell cycle and cell viability.</p><p>2 Statistics and robustness: The authors need to provide more detail on how they have justified that two replicates are sufficient for the reported data. For example, are they leveraging that they have employed 3 unique siRNAs? It would also build confidence if a subset of hits discussed in detail were tested for the knock-down efficiency and its relationship to nuclear appearance.</p><p>3. Interpretation of the screen &quot;hits&quot;: As the screen was already biased towards nuclear envelope and chromatin factors, an unbiased approach to further interpret the hits would strengthen the overall message – for example, an approach that can identify factors that interact with one another, indicating a role for a complex, etc. – many such tools are readily available. At a minimum, the authors should provide greater context, particularly for the hits that they decide to elaborate on.</p><p>4. The need to temper claims about distinct sensitivities of cell types to perturbations that alter nuclear appearance or to provide additional experimental support: The conclusions made from the comparison of the hits from the two independent screens without further testing were found to be inadequately supported. The authors must test a subset of the hits from one cell line in the other (and vice versa) in order to demonstrate that there are indeed cell type specific perturbations. The authors should also compare their list to other published works.</p><p>5. Interpretation of the biochemistry: There were several questions about the interpretation of the GST-lamin A biochemistry that need to be addressed. First, it is well established that GST imposes dimerization on proteins expressed as GST fusions independent of cysteines – the findings need to be reconsidered in this light, particularly as it relates to the combined lamin A/lamin C experiments. Second, even in the case that disulfide bonds between cysteines are occurring, there needs to be further consideration of whether this is possibly relevant in vivo (in the reducing environment of the nucleus) and/or requires further characterization, specifically evidence that it is indeed disulfide bonds between the lamin A and not the GST. Third, additional quantitative context for the binding of lamin A to the modified histone tails is needed (are the interactions saturable, what is the realm of the Kd) – as only relative values are provided in Figure 5, the reader currently lacks a framework for knowing what the order of magnitude is for these interactions.</p><p>6. Need for more depth in the analysis of histone H3.3 variant effects (Figure 6): As these mutants are expressed over WT histones the authors should address how expression level impacts the measured effects on nuclear appearance. What might the ratio of H3.3-V5 to H3.3 be in these experiments (this should be addressable due to the increases size of the V5 on a small histone). In single cells based on the immunostaining, the authors can also address whether there are trends according to the expression level. In this analysis, please also clarify if &quot;shape&quot; is independent of a change in area. There is also a need for statistical analysis. Last, please provide further evidence that the H3 effects manifest through lamins – (also relates to former figures) through localization, relationships to genomic data, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In the introduction of evidence tying nuclear size to nuclear transport additional studies should be referenced in particular the effects of disrupting nuclear export with the small molecule leptomycin B (validated, in fact, by its target XPO1 in the size screen).</p><p>2. Please clarify if the lamin A fragment includes the C-terminus after processing or not.</p><p>3. The introduction to experiments included in Figure 5 needs to state what form of lamin is being interrogated.</p><p>4. The authors must cite explicit examples with references when suggesting that the presence of hits including nucleoporins and nuclear membrane proteins &quot;validates their screening method&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work is a fantastic advance in the field that provides many novel and deeply interesting findings. However, the paper's large and meaningful amount of data that is completely confused using Z scores (not raw data) and how to deal with variation (no error bars). These two major criticisms of the paper should be addressed before the paper is published.</p><p>1. There needs to be a clear explanation of the z-score and how it is produced from data for nuclear roundness/shape and size. Overall, the paper would benefit greatly from graphing roundness and size data next to z score to allow the reader to see how the direct measurements (area and perimeter) translate into z score, the measure of change from the mean.</p><p>a. The major problem with this paper lies in how the bulk data is scored and displayed. Z score is not explained anywhere causing major confusion for the reader.</p><p>b. The core measurement of this paper is area 4 π divided by perimeter squared which is not shown in the paper in any capacity relative to the Z store. It would be gratefully helpful to provide at least one if not a few examples of the type of average or distribution of roundness scores relative to the output Z score. This is important as many previous papers in this field report shape measurements at 1 being a perfect circle and abnormal nuclear morphology measure along this scale from 1 to 0. While abnormal shapes are shown – there connection to the reported Z score and roundness value underlying it is hidden. Same is true for size where exact numbers would be useful to the reader.</p><p>i. Please show some amount of raw comparative roundness and size measurements.</p><p>ii. Why not show the &gt; 250 nuclear measurements for scrambled, LMNA, and a few choice hits across the scale of z score?</p><p>c. While the first half of the paper reports Z scores (Figure 1-3), later in the paper roundness scores are reported for Figure 6. This is confusing for the reader as measurement of change in nuclear shape and size changes in the paper. This example highlights the importance of being able to bridge the use of these two values, why they are used at different times, and overall understanding. The later histogram like distributions of roundness have no clear statistical measure from the figure.</p><p>d. THE SPECIFIC question centers around how much the roundness value differs between hits and how much roundness and size vary within one hit. In diagnostic tests of human diseases abnormal nuclear morphology percentages can change by very little between non-aggressive and very aggressive illnesses.</p><p>i. How much does Z score capture this vs ignore a sub population of abnormally shaped nuclei?</p><p>e. It is appreciated that raw data were made available through GitHub. However, the problem with many raw data sets is that it is hard to find the numbers that matter in a meaningful way.</p><p>2. The manuscript should clearly state why two replicates underscore the majority of the data and that the data graphs provide no error bars.</p><p>a. The manuscript should justify why two replicates are sufficient for most of the reported data. If you can do two replicates why not have done three to provide the agreed upon triplicate measurement.</p><p>i. The fact that 3 unique siRNAs are used for each KD is not discussed. Does this provide multiple replicates for the paper that are not discussed?</p><p>b. For z scores, the paper clearly reports two replicates but how are those two replicates are used in the data. The variation from one experiment to the other is not clearly provided. Furthermore, with no triplicate measure should a small population of hits be verified in a more detailed manner like is common in many gene screens? Again, showing just the roundness or size measure would be highly informative.</p><p>c. For binding values, there are also no error bars. How is the reader supposed to interpret the data with no idea of variance?</p><p>d. Figure 6 C and D is written in a cryptic manner. Does the manuscript mean to say that compared to wild-type H3.3 all mutant forms (list them) show statistically significant changes in shape C and size D? or are there differences between different mutants? It is unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The screening of Figures1-3 is fine, but I found it important that they restricted analyses &quot;To eliminate hits due to cell death or altered cell-cycle behavior, we excluded any hits with a cell number z-score of less than -2.&quot; Some mention of this in the abstract seems important. For example: 'The most dramatic effects were found for cell cycle and death regulators, but we chose to focus on regulators of more subtle effects.' In this regard, the authors need to take great care that the targets identified have zero impact on cell cycle and death.</p><p>2. The authors add &quot;reducing agent DTT to inhibit dimerization&quot; of GST-lamin A, but they need to tell us the specific Cys-Cys crossbridges that cause dimerization because GST also has Cys and could be contributing to non-physiological oligomers.</p><p>3. In analyzing laminA-histone interactions, the authors write &quot;For example, GST-laminA bound ~ 5-fold more efficiently to histone H3R8me2s/K9me2 than histone H3K9me2.&quot; The word &quot;efficiently&quot; does not seem a standard descriptor for binding, compared to terms like affinity, specificity, saturation, etc. The authors should strive to show at least one of the 'stronger' interactions is saturable and has a reasonable Kd as a basis for specificity.</p><p>4. The histone-H3 mutation effects on nuclear morphology in Figure 6 are important, but some key details and insights are needed. These seem to be Lenti's that transduced a fraction of the fibroblast cultures, giving levels that are zero, low, or very high in each culture, but does that variation have any effect? Histone levels do relate to cell cycle (e.g. PMID: 35760914), and so are high expressers at later stages of cell cycle (e.g. higher DNA staining) and would that be sensible for how the construct is regulated in its expression? Does the 'shape' parameter neglect differences in 'area'. Are the histone intensities uniform, and what happens to LaminA levels or localization?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80653.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

We calculated separate Z-scores for either shape or size for each well in the screen using the geometrical measurements as described in the Materials and methods and Results.</p><p>More specifically, to obtain a roundness/shape parameter, the circularity of each imaged nucleus was measured using the 4pArea/perimeter<sup>2</sup> formula. To obtain a size parameter for the nucleus the area of each imaged nucleus was first measured. Raw per nucleus values for all measured parameters were then averaged on a per well (oligo siRNA) basis. Mean per well values were then normalized on a per plate basis. Z-scores for two biological replicates were averaged, thus providing one Z-score values per oligo siRNA. Finally, since each gene is targeted by multiple siRNA oligos in the library, we picked the median of the Z-scores for siRNA oligos against a gene (equivalent to the oligo with 2<sup>nd</sup> out of 3 strongest biological effect in the assay). This is the Z-score value reported in the manuscript to score hits in the primary screen, and it measures the relative strength of the nuclear morphology change between the knock-out of a particular gene and the median of the population (e.g. Z-score = 0). This approach is standard in the analysis of RNAi screens (see PMID: 16869968). The analysis workflow detailed above is now presented in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2, Figure 1A and is described in detail on p. 7, 8, 9, and 22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, there was concern that the measure might not address whether there are relatively few nuclei with very perturbed structures or instead a rather smaller deviation across all or most cells in a given condition – more clarity on this should be included in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>As most of our studies rely on single cell analysis, we very much appreciate this point. To further analyze the data from the initial screen, we now provide, as requested, a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 5. Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 which contains single cell data for nuclear shape values of several hits and controls in histogram format and compare distributions to control cells. We find that the Z-score values on a per well/siRNA/gene basis are not driven by alterations in small subpopulations of cells, but rather reflect changes to nuclear morphology present in most cells in the population as indicated by the shift of the entire distribution. We now mention these data on p. 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are also encouraged to provide values or examples along the z-score axis to allow the reader to see how the direct measurements (area and perimeter) translate into the reported z-scores. Addressing these points is essential for readers to put this study in the context of others that report data as a deviation from circularity from 1 to 0, as well as allowing the reader to compare data in Figures1-3 and Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, Z-score values and raw circularity values have now been added to figures 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 —figure supplement 4 was added to give a sense of the relationship of phenotypic measurements of area, perimeter, and circularity in comparison to Z-scores generated from the screen. In addition, a new Supplementary File 1D with the Z-score next to the raw mean per well circularity score is now included for comparison and mentioned on page 7. The reason for the use of well/siRNA/gene Z-scores in Figure 1 and 2 is because these figures represent screening data, whereas Figure 6 represents single knockdown experiments to which Z-scores cannot be applied since Z-scores compare a sample to all other samples within a screening dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last, the authors need to more clearly justify and communicate that they have removed hits with z-scores below -2, including stating that the focus of the work is on what amounts to genes with more subtle effects on nuclear size and shape. Given the stated criteria, it is also important for the authors to address how they have concluded that the included screen hits do not impact the cell cycle and cell viability.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is very important and we now mention this caveat in the abstract as suggested by the referee. We found that some hits in our initial shape screen were known regulators of the cell cycle and of mitosis such as <italic>AURKB, MAD2L1</italic> and <italic>CDC2</italic> and displayed a low cell count per well compared to control cells. To eliminate potential false positives, we considered the resulting nuclear morphology changes as secondary effects due to cellular stress, abnormal cell division, siRNA toxicity, and potential lethality as they were often accompanied by significant reduction of cell number. Therefore, we removed nuclear shape and size hits from further analysis if their cell number per well Z-score was below -2. Nuclear shape hits with Z-score below -1.5, described in Figure 1, and no significant changes in cell number, were included in our hit list. We now describe in more detail these criteria and our strategy to reduce false positives and artifacts in the Materials and methods on p. 22 and in the Results sections on p.8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 Statistics and robustness: The authors need to provide more detail on how they have justified that two replicates are sufficient for the reported data. For example, are they leveraging that they have employed 3 unique siRNAs? It would also build confidence if a subset of hits discussed in detail were tested for the knock-down efficiency and its relationship to nuclear appearance.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added a more detailed description of statistical methods and robustness on p. 21 and 22. As the referee points out, we use three separate siRNAs for each target gene and hits are defined by an effect of at least 2 of the 3 siRNAs, reducing the likelihood of off target effects. It is a standard practice in the field to perform large scale screens such as the ones reported here in duplicate, especially when multiple siRNAs are used in an unpooled fashion as done here (PMID: 19644458). A comparison of the two replicates of the screen indicated strong correlation very good correspondence between hit lists (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1) and positive hits from the primary screen were validated in secondary screens which are now shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 6. Furthermore, the generated datasets are data-rich and based on several hundred images and involve analysis of typically 500-1000 cells per sample, generating highly robust datasets. To further address this point, we have now included, as requested, Supplementary Files 3A, 3B, and 3C, which detail the results of a validation screen using siRNAs with differing target sequences and generated using different chemistry. We find good correspondence between primary hits and our validation screen. Additionally, as requested, we now build confidence in our hit identification by inclusion of new data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2, where we repeated knockdown experiments and used antibody staining and automated imaging-based quantification of fluorescence intensity to demonstrate high knock-down efficiency of several hits. We find knockdown efficiency to be extremely robust with typical reduction levels of 60-90% using 8 different antibodies (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Interpretation of the screen &quot;hits&quot;: As the screen was already biased towards nuclear envelope and chromatin factors, an unbiased approach to further interpret the hits would strengthen the overall message – for example, an approach that can identify factors that interact with one another, indicating a role for a complex, etc. – many such tools are readily available. At a minimum, the authors should provide greater context, particularly for the hits that they decide to elaborate on.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now performed pathway analysis using STRING to assess functional protein networks and added these findings to Figure 3 —figure supplement 4 and 5. We find highly connected regions in the network corresponding to condensin and histone modifiers in fibroblast hits altering nuclear shape. In contrast, MCF10AT hits showed increased connectivity with nucleoporin proteins. Fibroblast hits displaying an increase in nuclear size identified multiple nucleoporins and MCF10AT hit analysis identified components of DNA replication. We have also expanded our description of some of the hits, especially the ones we elaborate on in the study. We describe these results on p. 11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The need to temper claims about distinct sensitivities of cell types to perturbations that alter nuclear appearance or to provide additional experimental support: The conclusions made from the comparison of the hits from the two independent screens without further testing were found to be inadequately supported. The authors must test a subset of the hits from one cell line in the other (and vice versa) in order to demonstrate that there are indeed cell type specific perturbations. The authors should also compare their list to other published works.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now performed side by side experiments in different cell lines to directly compare a subset of nuclear morphology hits in parallel and present the data in Supplemental Figure 3 —figure supplement 1. We find a number of hits that display strong nuclear shape abnormalities in either fibroblasts or MCF10AT cells, but not both with the exception of LMNA, which confirms our screen data. In addition, we compared the hits from our screen with previously published results finding other factors which regulate nuclear morphology to further strengthen our findings. We mention these results on p. 10-11. Despite these results, which confirm our initial claim of cell type differences, we have now toned down these conclusions considering that we have only analyzed two cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Interpretation of the biochemistry: There were several questions about the interpretation of the GST-lamin A biochemistry that need to be addressed. First, it is well established that GST imposes dimerization on proteins expressed as GST fusions independent of cysteines – the findings need to be reconsidered in this light, particularly as it relates to the combined lamin A/lamin C experiments. Second, even in the case that disulfide bonds between cysteines are occurring, there needs to be further consideration of whether this is possibly relevant in vivo (in the reducing environment of the nucleus) and/or requires further characterization, specifically evidence that it is indeed disulfide bonds between the lamin A and not the GST. Third, additional quantitative context for the binding of lamin A to the modified histone tails is needed (are the interactions saturable, what is the realm of the Kd) – as only relative values are provided in Figure 5, the reader currently lacks a framework for knowing what the order of magnitude is for these interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now directly addressed the possibility that GST imposes dimerization regardless of the presence of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues in lamin A. To do so, we mutated GST-lamin A cysteine residues to alanine and repeated the histone binding experiments. If the observed binding were artifactually due to GST-mediated dimerization, we should not expect an effect of the cystine mutants on histone binding. We find, however, that the C522A mutation in lamin A results in increased binding of H3 in the presence of lamin C, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to GST dimerization. We include these data in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 and discuss the results on p. 13.</p><p>We entirely agree with the referee that it is exceptionally challenging to determine the in-vivo relevance of disulfide bonds, not knowing the precise environment of the nucleus. Furthermore, since we were unable to obtain or generate dually-methylated H3-tail peptides, we are not in a position to perform quantitative binding assays between lamin A and the dual-methylation histone H3 tail. Given these concerns, we have now toned down this point on p.14 and discuss the limitations of these findings on p. 19.</p><p>As requested, we now include quantitative data in a new Supplementary File 3E for the binding of lamin A to the modified peptides in Figure 5. Note that this assay is not sufficiently quantitative to generate Kds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Need for more depth in the analysis of histone H3.3 variant effects (Figure 6): As these mutants are expressed over WT histones the authors should address how expression level impacts the measured effects on nuclear appearance. What might the ratio of H3.3-V5 to H3.3 be in these experiments (this should be addressable due to the increases size of the V5 on a small histone). In single cells based on the immunostaining, the authors can also address whether there are trends according to the expression level. In this analysis, please also clarify if &quot;shape&quot; is independent of a change in area. There is also a need for statistical analysis. Last, please provide further evidence that the H3 effects manifest through lamins – (also relates to former figures) through localization, relationships to genomic data, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have now measured H3.3 mutant levels relative to the total H3.3 levels in the population by immunostaining and single cell analysis. We present these data in Figure 6 —figure supplement 3. By single cell imaging, we find that the mutant levels only slightly increase total H3.3 (Figure 6 —figure supplement 3). We also quantitated, as requested, H3.3-V5 wild-type and mutant levels and compared these parameters to lamin A/C levels and to nuclear shape at the single cell level. We find a slight increase in lamin A/C expression upon expression of both WT and H3.3 mutants and we find no strong correlation between the level of H3.3 mutant expression and effect on shape and size. These data are now described in the text on p. 15 and are included in Figure 6 —figure supplement 3 and 4. We now also indicate that in these experiments shape is independent of change in area and we include statistical analysis of results as requested in Figure 6 —figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In the introduction of evidence tying nuclear size to nuclear transport additional studies should be referenced in particular the effects of disrupting nuclear export with the small molecule leptomycin B (validated, in fact, by its target XPO1 in the size screen).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have included numerous references and discuss on p. 4 the evidence tying nuclear size to nuclear import and export.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, the paper's large and meaningful amount of data that is completely confused using Z scores (not raw data) and how to deal with variation (no error bars). These two major criticisms of the paper should be addressed before the paper is published.</p><p>1. There needs to be a clear explanation of the z-score and how it is produced from data for nuclear roundness/shape and size. Overall, the paper would benefit greatly from graphing roundness and size data next to z score to allow the reader to see how the direct measurements (area and perimeter) translate into z score, the measure of change from the mean.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now explain in a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 in detail how Z-scores were derived from the raw data. In addition, we further describe and clarify statistical methods in the Materials and methods p.22 and in Results section on p.8 and 9. We have now also added Z-scores directly to Figures 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 —figure supplement 4 was added to give a sense of the relationship of phenotypic measurements of area, perimeter, and circularity in comparison to Z-scores generated from the screen. In addition, a new Supplementary Supplementary File 1D with the Z-score next to the raw mean per well circularity score is now included for comparison and mentioned on page 7.</p><p>We now explicitly explain that the Z-score is a standard statistical measure used in screening datasets and describes how different an individual sample in the screen is relative to the mean of all samples in the screen PMID: 16869968.

We calculated separate Z-scores for either shape or size for each well in the screen using the geometrical measurements as described in the Materials and methods and Results.</p><p>More specifically, to obtain a roundness/shape parameter, the circularity of each imaged nucleus was measured using the 4pArea/perimeter<sup>2</sup> formula. To obtain a size parameter for the nucleus the area of each imaged nucleus was first measured. Raw per nucleus values for all measured parameters were then averaged on a per well (oligo siRNA) basis. Mean per well values were then normalized on a per plate basis. Z-scores for two biological replicates were averaged, thus providing one Z-score values per oligo siRNA. Finally, since each gene is targeted by multiple siRNA oligos in the library, we picked the median of the Z-scores for siRNA oligos against a gene (equivalent to the oligo with 2<sup>nd</sup> out of 3 strongest biological effect in the assay). This is the Z-score value reported in the manuscript to score hits in the primary screen, and it measures the relative strength of the nuclear morphology change between the knock-out of a particular gene and the median of the population (e.g. Z-score = 0). This approach is standard in the analysis of RNAi screens (see PMID: 16869968). The analysis workflow detailed above is now presented in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2, Figure 1A and is described in detail on p. 22, and 7, 8 and 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. The major problem with this paper lies in how the bulk data is scored and displayed. Z score is not explained anywhere causing major confusion for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We now describe in a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 how the Z-score was generated and have expanded our explanation of the Z-score on pages 7, 8, 9 and 22. Please also see our response to the point above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The core measurement of this paper is area 4 π divided by perimeter squared which is not shown in the paper in any capacity relative to the Z store. It would be gratefully helpful to provide at least one if not a few examples of the type of average or distribution of roundness scores relative to the output Z score. This is important as many previous papers in this field report shape measurements at 1 being a perfect circle and abnormal nuclear morphology measure along this scale from 1 to 0. While abnormal shapes are shown – there connection to the reported Z score and roundness value underlying it is hidden. Same is true for size where exact numbers would be useful to the reader.</p><p>i. Please show some amount of raw comparative roundness and size measurements.</p><p>ii. Why not show the &gt; 250 nuclear measurements for scrambled, LMNA, and a few choice hits across the scale of z score?</p></disp-quote><p>We now expanded our description of how measurements for nuclear size and shape were made and how Z-scores were derived from the primary measurements. These methods are described in the new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 and on p. 22.</p><p>To further analyze the data from the initial screen, we now provide, as requested, in a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 single cell data for nuclear shape hits and controls in histogram format and compare distributions to control cells.

While the first half of the paper reports Z scores (Figure 1-3), later in the paper roundness scores are reported for Figure 6. This is confusing for the reader as measurement of change in nuclear shape and size changes in the paper. This example highlights the importance of being able to bridge the use of these two values, why they are used at different times, and overall understanding. The later histogram like distributions of roundness have no clear statistical measure from the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. As mentioned above, robust Z-scores based on the median of the population of samples are used in analysis of screening data to score treatments/perturbations from large libraries, where most siRNA oligos in the library are expected to have negligible or no biological effect (Figure 1-3). This approach cannot be used in datasets generated by individual or small numbers of experimental conditions that are preselected for biological activity (such as in Figure 6). For clarity, we have added a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 explaining how Z-scores are derived from morphological measurements and we are providing a histogram representation of the roundness distribution in Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 and a new Supplementary File 1D with the Z-score next to the mean per well score was created for comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. THE SPECIFIC question centers around how much the roundness value differs between hits and how much roundness and size vary within one hit. In diagnostic tests of human diseases abnormal nuclear morphology percentages can change by very little between non-aggressive and very aggressive illnesses.</p><p>i. How much does Z score capture this vs ignore a sub population of abnormally shaped nuclei?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these points. To further analyze the data from the initial screen, we now provide, as requested, in a new Figure 1 —figure supplement 5 single cell data for nuclear shape values of several hits and controls in histogram format and compare distributions to control cells.

The manuscript should clearly state why two replicates underscore the majority of the data and that the data graphs provide no error bars.</p><p>a. The manuscript should justify why two replicates are sufficient for most of the reported data.

Our comparison of the first two repeats of the screen indicated very good correspondence between hit lists (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Furthermore, the generated datasets are data-rich and based on several hundred images and analysis of typically 500-1000 cells per sample, generating statistically robust datasets. To further address this point, we have now included in Supplementary File 3A, 3B, and 3C the results of a validation screen using siRNAs with differing target sequences and generated using different chemistry. Additionally, we now build confidence in our hit identification by inclusion of new data in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 and 2, demonstrating knock-down efficiency of several hits. We typically find reduction levels of 60-90%. We find no relationship between extent of knockdown and nuclear appearance (compare Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 and 2). In summary, screening data was generated by performing the experiment in duplicate, and validation experiments were performed in triplicate such as in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i. The fact that 3 unique siRNAs are used for each KD is not discussed. Does this provide multiple replicates for the paper that are not discussed?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have clarified on p. 8 that we indeed targeted each gene with 3 distinct siRNA in an unpooled fashion, thus essentially testing each gene in triplicate and increasing the statistical power of the two replicates of the screen.

For z scores, the paper clearly reports two replicates but how are those two replicates are used in the data. The variation from one experiment to the other is not clearly provided. Furthermore, with no triplicate measure should a small population of hits be verified in a more detailed manner like is common in many gene screens? Again, showing just the roundness or size measure would be highly informative.</p></disp-quote><p>The variation from one experiment to the other is shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1. The Z-scores for each siRNA oligos are calculated as the mean of the two biological replicates. The Z-score on a per gene basis, which is what is reported in this manuscript, is the median of the Z-scores for the 3 oligo siRNA targeting that gene. This Z-score on a per gene basis effectively represents the value of the 2<sup>nd</sup> siRNA with the strongest biological effect and reduces the chances that a positive hit gene is the result of a single siRNA oligo having strong, but off-targeteffects. To address variation from one dataset to another we have added error bars in several figures (Figures 1, 2, and 5) as well as Supplementary figures. We have now also added a validation screen (Supplementary File 3A, 3B, and 3C) which shows good concordance of Z-score in primary and validation screens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

The screening of Figures1-3 is fine, but I found it important that they restricted analyses &quot;To eliminate hits due to cell death or altered cell-cycle behavior, we excluded any hits with a cell number z-score of less than -2.&quot; Some mention of this in the abstract seems important. For example: 'The most dramatic effects were found for cell cycle and death regulators, but we chose to focus on regulators of more subtle effects.' In this regard, the authors need to take great care that the targets identified have zero impact on cell cycle and death.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is very important and we now mention this caveat in the abstract as suggested by the referee.

The authors add &quot;reducing agent DTT to inhibit dimerization&quot; of GST-lamin A, but they need to tell us the specific Cys-Cys crossbridges that cause dimerization because GST also has Cys and could be contributing to non-physiological oligomers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now directly addressed the possibility that GST imposes dimerization regardless of the presence of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues.

We find, however, that the C522A mutation in lamin A results in increased binding of H3 in the presence of lamin C, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to GST dimerization.

In analyzing laminA-histone interactions, the authors write &quot;For example, GST-laminA bound ~ 5-fold more efficiently to histone H3R8me2s/K9me2 than histone H3K9me2.&quot; The word &quot;efficiently&quot; does not seem a standard descriptor for binding, compared to terms like affinity, specificity, saturation, etc. The authors should strive to show at least one of the 'stronger' interactions is saturable and has a reasonable Kd as a basis for specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Unfortunately, to our knowledge there is no current ChIP-seq human genome map of di-methyl modifications on histone tails. In addit­­­ion, we were unable to generate or procure the individual dually methylated peptides and methyl-methyl H3 antibodies are not available and we are thus not able to perform quantitative binding assays. However, to begin to address this issue, we now provide in a new Supplementary File 3E quantitative data of binding intensities. Note that this assay is not sufficiently quantitative to generate Kds. Given these limitations, we have now toned the claims regarding the methyl-binding sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The histone-H3 mutation effects on nuclear morphology in Figure 6 are important, but some key details and insights are needed. These seem to be Lenti's that transduced a fraction of the fibroblast cultures, giving levels that are zero, low, or very high in each culture, but does that variation have any effect? Histone levels do relate to cell cycle (e.g. PMID: 35760914), and so are high expressers at later stages of cell cycle (e.g. higher DNA staining) and would that be sensible for how the construct is regulated in its expression? Does the 'shape' parameter neglect differences in 'area'. Are the histone intensities uniform, and what happens to LaminA levels or localization?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these points. We generally do not see cell cycle effects in these cells. However, to address some of these issues, we have now measured H3.3 mutant levels relative to the total H3.3 levels in the population by immunostaining and single cell analysis. By single cell imaging, we find that the mutant levels represent a wide range although total H3.3 levels remain relatively consistent. We also quantitated as requested H3.3-V5 wild-type and mutant levels and compared these parameters to lamin A/C levels and to nuclear shape at the single cell level. While we find a slight increase in lamin A/C expression upon expression of both WT and H3.3 mutants, we see no significant effect on lamin A localization. We also see no strong correlation between the level of H3.3 mutant expression and effect on shape and size. These data are now described in the text on p. 14 and p. 15 and are included in Figure 6 —figure supplement 3 and 4. We now also indicate that in these experiments shape is independent of change in area and we include statistical analysis of results as requested in Figure 6 —figure supplement 5.</p></body></sub-article></article>
