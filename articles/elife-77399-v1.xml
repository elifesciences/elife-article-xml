To examine this, we used wearable microphones and autonomic sensors to collect multimodal naturalistic datasets from 12-month-olds and their caregivers. We observed that, across the day, clusters of vocalisations occur during elevated infant and caregiver arousal. This relationship is stronger in infants than caregivers: caregivers vocalizations show greater decoupling with their own states of arousal, and their vocal production is more influenced by the infant's arousal than their own. Different types of vocalisation elicit different patterns of change across the dyad. Cries occur following reduced infant arousal stability and lead to increased child-caregiver arousal coupling, and decreased infant arousal. Speech-like vocalisations also occur at elevated arousal, but lead to longer-lasting increases in arousal, and elicit more parental verbal responses. Our results suggest that: 12-month-old infants' vocalisations are strongly contingent on their arousal state (for both cries and speech-like vocalisations), whereas adults' vocalisations are more flexibly tied to their own arousal; that cries and speech-like vocalisations alter the intra-dyadic dynamics of arousal in different ways, which may be an important factor driving speech development; and that this selection mechanism which drives vocal development is anchored in our stress physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000269</institution-id><institution>Economic and Social Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES/N017560/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wass</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JDIL 845859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goupil</surname><given-names>Louise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ONACSA 853251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wass</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of East London (Approval number: EXP 1617 04).

Researchers who wish to access the raw data should email the lead author s.v.wass@uel.ac.uk. Permission to access the raw data will be granted as long as the applicant can guarantee that certain privacy guidelines (e.g. storing the data only on secure, encrypted servers, and a guarantee not to share it with anyone else) can be provided. In order to allow access to the raw data the name of the applicant will also need to be added to our current ethics approval from the University of East London. This is expected to be routine, as long as the applicant is able to provide these guarantees. De-identified versions of the data - i.e. the processed Autonomic Nervous System data, and the raw coding showing the timings of when vocalisations were recorded, is available here: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.612jm6473. The code used to conduct the analyses is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7409281.
