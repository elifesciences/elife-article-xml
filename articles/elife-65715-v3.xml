characterized by focal increases in disorganized bone remodeling. This study aims to characterize PDB-associated changes in DNA methylation profiles in patients’ blood. Meta-analysis of data from the discovery and cross-validation set, each comprising 116 PDB cases and 130 controls, revealed significant differences in DNA methylation at 14 CpG sites, 4 CpG islands, and 6 gene-body regions. These loci, including two characterized as functional through expression quantitative trait-methylation analysis, were associated with functions related to osteoclast differentiation, mechanical loading, immune function, and viral infection. A multivariate classifier based on discovery samples was found to discriminate PDB cases and controls from the cross-validation with a sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.81, and an area under curve of 92.8%. In conclusion, this study has shown for the first time that epigenetic factors contribute to the pathogenesis of PDB and may offer diagnostic markers for prediction of the disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our skeleton stays healthy through an endless regeneration process, with specialized cells constantly absorbing and creating new bone tissue. Illnesses emerge when this breaking down and rebuilding cycle becomes imbalanced. For instance, in Paget’s disease of bone (PDB for short) the skeleton becomes misshapen and fragile, with complications including pain, fractures, neurological problems, hearing loss and even cancer. For most patients however, symptoms are only present at an advanced stage, when irreversible damage to the skeleton has already occurred.</p><p>Certain inherited genetic changes play a role in the development of PDB, but lifestyle and environmental factors are also thought to contribute. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that diet, pollution and infection may influence how genes involved in bone metabolism are activated. In this process, the environment may trigger chemical marks to be added onto DNA sequences, which ultimately switches specific genes on and off.</p><p>To investigate whether the pattern of chemical marks in individuals with PDB may be characteristic, Diboun et al. scanned the genetic information of over 200 PDB patients, and compared it to healthy counterparts. Combining genomic analysis and machine learning revealed several chemical signatures that were remarkably different in the DNA of PDB individuals. These signatures affected sites close to genes involved in bone development, as well as response to mechanical loading and infection. This provides strong evidence that PDB could be, in part, triggered by the environment, as the placement of these marks is highly influenced by external factors.</p><p>This research sheds light onto the underlying changes that trigger PDB. Future experiments should explore whether it may be possible to use these genetic changes to identify patients before the onset of irreversible and debilitating damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>paget's disease</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013 (311723-GENEPAD)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albagha</surname><given-names>Omar ME</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Horizon 2020 (787270-Paget-Advance)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralston</surname><given-names>Stuart H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paget's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albagha</surname><given-names>Omar ME</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PDB-associated differences in DNA methylation are reproducible and reflect key environmental modulators of bone homeostasis including viral processes, vitamin D metabolism, as well as mechanical sheer load.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Paget’s disease of bone (PDB) is characterized by increased but disorganized bone remodeling, which causes affected bones to enlarge, become weak, and deform. The axial skeleton is predominantly involved and commonly affected sites include the skull, spine, and pelvis. Paget’s disease is clinically silent until it has reached an advanced stage at which point irreversible damage to the skeleton has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan and Ralston, 2014</xref>). Bisphosphonates are an effective treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ralston et al., 2019</xref>) and can often improve bone pain but have a limited impact on other clinical outcomes in patients with advanced disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langston et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reid et al., 2011</xref>). On a cellular level, PDB is characterized by increased osteoclast activity and biopsies from affected bone lesions exhibit increase in the number and size of osteoclasts.</p><p>Genetic factors play an important role in classical PDB and in monogenic PDB-like syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gennari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ralston and Albagha, 2014</xref>). Mutations in <italic>SQSTM1</italic> are the most common cause of PDB, but other susceptibility genes and loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vallet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albagha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albagha et al., 2010</xref>). These include genes that play an important role in osteoclast differentiation such as <italic>CSF1</italic>, <italic>TNFRSF11A</italic>, and <italic>DCSTAMP</italic>. Additionally, an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) in <italic>OPTN</italic> is associated with increased susceptibility to PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obaid et al., 2015</xref>). Functional analysis using mouse models showed that OPTN is a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation and mice with loss of <italic>OPTN</italic> function develop PDB-like bone lesions with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Obaid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wong et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Environmental factors also play a role, as evidenced by the fact that the disease is focal in nature and its incidence and severity has diminished in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corral-Gudino et al., 2013</xref>). Several environmental triggers have been suggested including persistent viral infection, repetitive mechanical loading of the skeleton, low dietary calcium intake, environment pollutants, and vitamin D deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ralston and Albagha, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The possible role of persistent viral infection with measles and distemper has been studied experimentally. For example, expression of the measles virus nucleocapsid protein in osteoclasts was found to trigger PDB-like phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurihara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurihara et al., 2006</xref>). However, clinical studies that have sought to detect evidence of viral proteins and nucleic acids in humans with PDB have yielded conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ralston et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental and lifestyle factors can influence gene expression and clinical phenotype in various diseases through epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in DNA methylation. To gain insights into the role of epigenetic DNA methylation in PDB, we have conducted genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in a cohort of 253 PDB patients and 280 controls and evaluated the predictive role of epigenetic markers in differentiating patients with PDB from controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characteristics of study cohort</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows descriptive statistics for the study cohort.

Many were located within or near genes with functional relevance to the pathogenesis of PDB including bone-related functions, such as osteoclast differentiation, or functions related to environmental triggers associated with PDB such as viral infection and mechanical loading. TNK1 is a tyrosine kinase that has a pivotal role in innate immune responses by regulating the Interferon-stimulated genes downstream of the JAK-STAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ooi et al., 2014</xref>). It has previously been associated with frontotemporal dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gijselinck et al., 2015</xref>), which can co-exist with Paget’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watts et al., 2004</xref>). MOSC2 is a member of the membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase family that regulates endosome trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Less is known about the specific functions of transcription factors NKX6-2 and LBX1 in bone metabolism, but mutations in the latter are associated with Scoliosis. HS6ST3 plays a key role in the synthesis of heparan sulfate that potentiates key growth factors including the bone morphogenic protein BMP and Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuo et al., 2010</xref>). PENK encodes for proenkephalin, the precursor of a range of effector molecules including pain-associated pentapeptide opioids as well as modulators of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seitz et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, PENK knockout mice have abnormal bone structure and mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickinson et al., 2016</xref>). MAF was found to promote osteoblast differentiation, and heterozygous deletion of MAF in mice results in age-related bone loss associated with accelerated formation of fatty marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishikawa et al., 2010</xref>). SPATA18 is expressed in a variety of cancers including osteosarcoma, and its transcription is induced by p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornstein et al., 2011</xref>). TAL1 has been found to regulate osteoclast differentiation through suppression of their fusion mediator DCSTAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courtial et al., 2012</xref>).

Expression of ZIC1 in human was found to be increased in loaded compared to unloaded bone, and the increased expression in loaded bone is associated with reduced methylation in several CpGs in ZIC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Varanasi et al., 2010</xref>). NFYB confers chromatin access to other transcriptional regulators and is known to be involved in transition through cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ly et al., 2013</xref>).

Genomic regions have traditionally been evaluated in epigenetics studies based on linear combinations of methylation data from residing sites or through meta-analysis of effects/p-values from an initial site-level differential methylation analysis. The novel approach presented in this study differs from the traditional methods in that enrichment of a region does not stem from frequent occurrences of correlated DMS within the region but rather the accumulation of independent effects from residing sites. In other words, regions with the most, but unique site-level effects are prioritized. By doing so, our approach is advantageous in two ways: First, it allows for sites to be hyper- or hypo-methylated along the same region unlike the linear combination approach where opposing effects could neutralize one another. Second, it draws strength from the collective effects of neighboring sites whilst avoiding the redundancy of information from site-level analysis.</p><p>Four Bonferroni significant DMR were identified in islands, which were located near the following genes: LTB, a cytokine shown to stimulate osteoclast activity; SKIV2L, with an RNA helicase activity, thought to be involved in blocking translation of viral mRNA and has been implicated in regulating host responses to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckard et al., 2014</xref>); EBF3, which is involved in bone development and B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seike et al., 2018</xref>); and CCND1, a Wnt target that was reported to be upregulated in response to mechanical loading of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holguin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, six Bonferroni significant DMR in gene bodies were identified.

The Best subset analysis allowed the identification of a smaller subset of sites trading off the classification accuracy with the number of explanatory sites. The AUC of 82.5%, based on the 95 discriminatory sites from the best subset analysis, is promising, and future experiments are warranted to study its clinical applicability.</p><p>In terms of disease pathology, the DNA methylation data reflected many environmental triggers thought to be involved in PDB. Some of the genes amongst the DMS and the 95 <italic>Best</italic> subset were associated with immune antiviral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This is of interest since a previous study in the PRISM cohort showed that levels of antibodies to Mumps virus were significantly higher in PDB cases compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Visconti et al., 2017</xref>). Although we and others have failed to detect evidence of ongoing virus infection in PDB, the above data is consistent with the hypothesis that host immune responses to infection may be altered in PDB.</p><p>Differential methylation of ZIC1 and CCND1 indicates possible differences between cases and controls in these genes, which are involved in mechanotransduction, a process that has been implicated in localization of bone lesions in PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gasper, 1979</xref>). Our study also highlighted genes that regulate the cell cycle, vesicular transport, and cytoskeletal reorganization as being potentially involved in PDB. Other genes were identified that play a role in immune cell function, and these were strongly represented in the best subset of differentially methylated sites. This lends support to the hypothesis that PDB may be a disorder with an osteoimmunological basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Numan et al., 2015</xref>) and should prompt further work to investigate host–environment interactions including studies of the microbiome in this complex but fascinating disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohlsson and Sjögren, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Apart from providing new insights into the potential links between genes and environment in regulating susceptibility to PDB, this study has revealed the potential role of methylation signals as a biomarker for disease susceptibility. Potent bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid can return the abnormalities of bone remodeling to normal in a large proportion of patients with PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reid et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, PDB often remains clinically silent until it has reached an advanced stage by which point irreversible skeletal damage may already have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gennari et al., 2019</xref>). This study raises the possibility that epigenetic markers, possibly when combined with genetic profiling, would be worth exploring as means of assessing the risk of developing PDB in people with a family history of the disorder so that early intervention can be considered where clinically appropriate.</p><p>One limitation of the study is the fact that the identified methylation changes were not shown to occur in the osteoclasts, which are the cells of main interest in PDB pathogenesis. This is primarily justified by the difficulty to collect bone tissue from PDB patients in a similarly sized cohort. Nevertheless, on comparison of our Bonferroni significant DMS and DMR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>), with a published list of highly concordant CpG sites between blood and femur bone tissue collected during hip replacement surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebrahimi et al., 2021</xref>), we noted considerable overlap. We found that CpGs annotated to 8 of the 14 genes from our DMS analysis were among the highly correlated sites between blood and bone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). For DMRs, of the 10 genes reported in our study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), 6 had at least one CpG with high correlation between blood and bone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). However, showing an epigenetic signature to PDB in the blood adds to the increasing evidence in the literature pointing to the possibility of pathogenic immune processes lying at the heart of PDB. More importantly, a predictive epigenetic signature in a readily accessible tissue such as the blood has clinical implication, also considering the silent nature of PDB and the possibility of avoiding much of the adverse symptoms of the disease with early diagnosis. Moreover, one needs to consider that blood also contains progenitors of bone cells and that white blood cells share a similar ancestry with osteoclasts.</p><p>Although the split-sample approach was meant to allow for validation of the results for increased statistical rigor, our cross-validation dataset is not totally independent from its discovery counterpart in that similar sources of noise and counfounding effects are present in both. However, the total cohort was obtained from a large number of centers across the UK representing most major cities, which adds to the validity of our overall results. Another limiting aspect of our study was drawing functional relevance of our DMS and DMR by reference to tissue specific eQTMs from the BIOS QTL database, which were originally derived from blood. Therefore, the effects of the differential methylation from our candidates DMS and DMR on gene expression under PDB remain to be investigated. Finally, it is possible that the observed methylation changes reported in this study exist as a consequence of the disease; therefore, further prospective studies assessing their true potential as predictor biomarkers are warranted. Such studies could revolve around recruiting individuals with a genetic predisposition and/or family history of PDB for which the level of methylation of our 95 best subset sites can be routinely assessed. Such epigenetic measurements can then be linked to future disease onset if any, in the presence of appropriate controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip</td><td valign="top">Illumina, USA</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">DNA Methylation array</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RnBeads</td><td valign="top">R</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Version 1.10.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SIMCA</td><td valign="top">Umetrics, Sweden</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Version 15</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">IPA</td><td valign="top">Qiagen, Germany</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GGM</td><td valign="top">R</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Version 2.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">topGO</td><td valign="top">R</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Version 2.4</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study subjects</title><p>The DNA samples were derived from UK-based PDB patients and controls who took part in the PRISM trial (Paget’s Disease: Randomized Trial of Intensive versus Symptomatic Management) (ISRCTN12989577) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2017</xref>).

CpG islands were delineated in the illumina array manifest file as well as RnBeads annotation libraries. Gene bodies and promoters were manually assigned.

A p-value for the effect of the region given n sites was calculated accordingly. The analysis effectively tests for the significance of improvement in the model fit with the addition of the methylation data from the region of interest. The generalized linear model outlined above was run initially on the discovery set. The model was then repeated on the cross-validation set on regions that were significant in the discovery set at FDR &lt; 0.05. A similar approach was used to derive the Bonferroni significant regions. In other words, the Bonferroni adjustment of regions in the cross-validation was based on the subset of regions found Bonferroni significant in the discovery set. Visualization of the effect of individual sites from selected DMR was conducted using R package coMET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Consolidating the DMS and DMR</title><p>In the generalized linear model for region effect outlined in model formulae [2], the beta values from the individual sites are indicative of the sites’ level of association with the phenotype. This is effectively similar to the general linear model used for site-level analysis but with the important discrepancy that each site is being assessed while accounting for possible contributions of neighboring sites to the global effect of the region. We therefore extracted all the beta values form the full model in [2] from all the DMR. We then applied FDR-based multiple testing correction on the p-values corresponding to these beta values from fitting the model in [2] for each selected DMR separately. Sites with FDR &lt; 0.05 were pooled with the DMRs to create a unified list of significantly methylated sites or <italic>Pooled sites</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Discriminant analysis</title><p>Discriminant analysis was performed to assess the ability of the <italic>Pooled sites</italic> to tell apart cases from controls.

We trained an orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boccard and Rutledge, 2013</xref>), implemented in the software SIMCA ver. 15 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014688">SCR_014688</ext-link>, Umetrics, Sweden), on the discovery data from <italic>Pooled</italic> and <italic>Best subset</italic> sites separately. Each model was then tested on the cross-validation set, and its performance was further assessed based on the value from receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

The ggm partial correlations, based on the pooled sites, were used for drawing associations between GO biological process terms found enriched in the same set as follows: First, the extensive GO functional annotations enriched amongst the genes associated with the <italic>Pooled sites</italic> were manually reduced to a manageable, yet representative, set of keywords: For instance, GO categories ‘regulation of proliferation’, ‘positive regulation of proliferation’, and ‘negative regulation of proliferation’ were all reduced to ‘proliferation’. The Fisher’s exact test statistics was then used to assess whether the <italic>Pooled sites</italic> associated with a given keyword were correlated (based on the ggms) with their counterparts from another functional keyword more often than can be accounted for by chance alone. More specifically, for any two GO terms, we considered the significantly differentially methylated sites from genes associated with either terms. We then tested for enrichments of pairs of sites with significant ggms out of all possible pairs of sites across the two terms. Likewise, Fisher’s test p-values&lt;0.05 after FDR multiple testing correction were used to create pairs of functionally related keywords.

DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells are identified in this study that are able to differentiate PDB cases from controls with a high level of accuracy. These candidate methylation sites and regions are associated with osteological and immunologic processes, suggesting functional relevance and may be of future clinical use.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Epigenetic analysis of Paget's disease of bone identifies differentially methylated loci that predict disease status&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As the authors point out in their discussion the genes identified in cells in the blood. The authors are correct that cells of the osteoclast lineage are in the blood; however, their study would be strengthened if their results could be verified in osteoclasts where possible. The reviewers all recognize bone samples are extremely challenging to obtain. Ebrahimi et al. (PMID: 32692944) provides a nice summary of correlation between methylation levels in blood and bone. The authors should consider looking whether their methylation candidates are correlated with methylation patterns in bone to augment their functional validation methods.</p><p>2. Given that the PDB cases were slightly older than controls in the discovery set, is this a concern for conclusions of this paper, given that incidence increases with age. Please comment on this issues. The cases and controls appear to be matched given that controls are spouses. This suggests 1:1 matching. Have the authors considered conditional models or other modeling approaches that more appropriately account for matching?</p><p>3. Regarding &quot;The number of patients with SQSTM1 mutations&quot; (p. 5): this supposedly refers to the cases (it's unclear whether the controls were tested for SQSTM1?)</p><p>4. Does OPTN have an eQTM in its vicinity?</p><p>5. Genomic/test statistic inflation is known to be a potential issue in EWAS. We encourage the authors to provide their q-q plots as a supplement to their analysis.</p><p>6. The authors used annotation information to define their regions. This approach depends on mapping information that is dynamic and somewhat subjective. Have the authors considered a more agnostic, data driven approach to identifying DMRs? Comb-p and other DMR approaches allow for identification of DMRs based on spatial correlation.</p><p>7. More information is needed about the model selection for the DMR analysis. Why chose a generalized binomial model? What link function did you use? Given case-control study design, readers are going to expect a logistic regression (logit link function). I encourage authors to provide brief rationale for choosing this model over more familiar options.</p><p>8. Probes are expected to be correlated within a DMR. I expect multi-collinearity to be an issue when modelling groups of correlated probes together as was done in the DMR analysis. Would authors be better suited modelling methylation on the outcome side of the model, fitting a linear mixed model? This model choice would fit better with the single probe analytic strategy.</p><p>9. Did the authors use the same Bonferroni adjusted p value in the discovery and validation sets? Was it based on the total number of probes tested in the discovery set or based on the number of probes carried forward for testing in the validation set? Both are reasonable approaches. However, additional clarification is needed.</p><p>10. The authors report using 10 components from the SVA model in their analysis. Can authors provide justification for 10 components, which seems high compared to similar studies.</p><p>11. The split sample cross validation approach was appreciated for its ability to maximize experimental rigor. However, this approach is distinct from a true external replication. Given that the 'training' and the 'test' sets come from the same overall population, we expect the 'replication' results to be optimistic relative to results from a true, external replication population. Given the absence of a suitable external replication population due the unique nature of the disease, this limitation is acceptable. Please discuss the potential limitations of this approach in the Discussion section. It is encouraged that the authors to refer to the 'replication' set as a 'cross-validation' set to more appropriately convey their experimental approach to the broader scientific community.</p><p>12. It is unclear how the partial correlations, using ggm, were used in the analysis. Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65715.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Ebrahimi et al. (EPIGENETICS; 2021, 16(1): 92–105) investigated correlation in methylation profiles between blood and bone tissue in 12 subjects using Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Bone samples were taken from the exposed proximal femur after removal of the femoral head from osteoarthritis patients. After quality control, Ebrahimi et al. focused the correlation analysis on 64,349 probes that fit their analysis criteria (to define the most highly correlated positions), of which 30,607 sites showed significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) high correlation (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.74) between bone and blood. Additional filter was applied to these sites to include those with at least 80% similar methylation profile between bone and blood (n = 28,549) which were reported as supplementary table in their paper.</p><p>We assessed if CpG sites annotated to genes identified from our DMS and DMR analyses (Table 2 and 3) showed high correlation between bone and blood as reported by Ebrahimi et al. Results showed that CpGs annotated to 8 out of the 14 genes from our DMS analysis were among the highly correlated sites between blood and bone (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.74; FDR &lt;0.05; Supplementary File 6). For DMRs, out of the 10 genes reported in our study (Table 3), 6 had at least one CpG with high correlation between blood and bone (Supplementary File 6). It is important to note that, in the study by Ebrahimi et al., only 64,349 CpG sites were tested for correlation, owing to the stringent criteria adopted by the authors to identify the list of highly concordant sites. Therefore, our DMS/DMR sites that did not feature in the list are not necessarily uncorrelated. Unfortunately, these sites cannot be investigated further since Ebrahimi et al. did not make their entire dataset available in public domain.</p><p>To address this point, A table has been added to the manuscript (Supplementary File 6) listing the sites with high correlation and the text has been modified to include and discuss these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Please comment on this issues. The cases and controls appear to be matched given that controls are spouses. This suggests 1:1 matching. Have the authors considered conditional models or other modeling approaches that more appropriately account for matching?</p></disp-quote><p>The age factor was incorporated in the regression model in all analyses as indicated in the methods section. Additionally, the slight difference in age was only observed in the discovery set. There was no difference in age in the replication set (now termed cross-validation set in the revised manuscript). Given that we have adjusted for age in all analyses and that the reported loci were replicated in the cross-validation set, we don’t believe that our results are affected by the slight bias in age between the two groups in the discovery set. As for capturing the spouse information into an appropriate statistical model, spouses were only available for half of the PDB patients, therefore, a matched association analysis could only be fit on fewer subjects which could have compromised the power of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding &quot;The number of patients with SQSTM1 mutations&quot; (p. 5): this supposedly refers to the cases (it's unclear whether the controls were tested for SQSTM1?)</p></disp-quote><p>Controls were tested and they were all negative for SQSTM1 mutations as indicated in Table 1 which shows the number as “0”. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Does OPTN have an eQTM in its vicinity?</p></disp-quote><p>OPTN did not feature amongst our list of significant DMS and DMR and there is no eQTM for OPTN in the BIOS QTL database. This suggests that the previously reported association between OPTN and PDB is mostly driven by genetic regulatory mechanisms as opposed to epigenetic regulation. In fact, the top associated SNP (rs1561570) from GWAS studies of PDB (Albagha et al., Nat Genet 2010) has been shown to significantly influence OPTN gene expression (eQTL) in osteoclast precursors as shown by Obaid et al. (Obaid et al., Cell Rep 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Genomic/test statistic inflation is known to be a potential issue in EWAS. We encourage the authors to provide their q-q plots as a supplement to their analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the q-q plot to the manuscript as supplementary Figure 2-supplementary figure1. The genomic inflation factor for discovery set was 1.23 which is within the range reported by EWAS studies. For replication, we only analysed sites achieving FDR &lt; 0.05 from discovery set. Guintivano et al. (EPIGENETICS 2020, 15(11):1163–1166) assessed genomic inflation in 16 published EWAS studies, of which 8 were EWAS for age and 8 were case-control studies for various conditions. Guintivano et al. found that the median inflation reported in case-control studies was 1.53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors used annotation information to define their regions. This approach depends on mapping information that is dynamic and somewhat subjective. Have the authors considered a more agnostic, data driven approach to identifying DMRs? Comb-p and other DMR approaches allow for identification of DMRs based on spatial correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. The Comb-P approach relies on correlation in p-values and applies a correction on these p-values to correct for multiple testing from neighbouring sites. This approach relies on summary statistics only (p-value) and cannot distinguish between sites with a redundant effect from those with an independent effect when it comes to explaining the phenotype. Also, Comb-P doesn’t take into account the location of CpG in relation to functional parts of genes (i.e. promoters, gene body, etc.) which is known to influence how methylation affect gene expression. The approach we used to define the DMR is widely used, and we believe that it is more powerful when individual-level data are available as it takes into account the above-mentioned factors. Lent et al. (BMC Genetics 2018, 19(Suppl 1):84, 28-31) compared various methods used to define DMR and found that Comb-P, DMRcate, and GlobalP detected similar DMRs. It would be useful to compare our approach to other methods, but we think this would be the focus of future methodology paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. More information is needed about the model selection for the DMR analysis. Why chose a generalized binomial model? What link function did you use? Given case-control study design, readers are going to expect a logistic regression (logit link function). I encourage authors to provide brief rationale for choosing this model over more familiar options.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our description of DMR analysis was not clear enough. The generalized linear model function for the binomial family in R is based on the logit link function and is therefore equivalent to the logistic regression. This has been clarified further in the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Probes are expected to be correlated within a DMR. I expect multi-collinearity to be an issue when modelling groups of correlated probes together as was done in the DMR analysis. Would authors be better suited modelling methylation on the outcome side of the model, fitting a linear mixed model? This model choice would fit better with the single probe analytic strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that Multi-collinearity of probes within a DMR could occur and could cause the estimates of the model’s coefficients to be unreliable. However, our method was implemented in R in a way that it excludes regions with potential errors or warnings when fitting the model to make sure our estimates are correct. In general, this issue was limited and the proportions of regions that dropped out of the analysis was, on average, 5%. We thank the reviewer for suggesting new venues to be explored when modelling the region methylation effects, which are less susceptible to model fitting issues including multi-collinearity. We affirm the validity of their proposed approach. We are eager to explore these ideas to expand on the current methodology for region-level methylation analysis in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Did the authors use the same Bonferroni adjusted p value in the discovery and validation sets? Was it based on the total number of probes tested in the discovery set or based on the number of probes carried forward for testing in the validation set? Both are reasonable approaches. However, additional clarification is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>For the site-level analysis, the Bonferroni adjustment was applied on the meta-analysis of the discovery and replication set, they were thus based on the entire set of probes (0.05/429,156 = 1.17 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) and this has been made clearer in the revised manuscript. As for the region level analysis, since the analysis does not lend itself to meta-analysis (for being based on a Chi-square distributed statistic), the Bonferroni adjustment of regions in the replication was based on the subset of regions found Bonferroni significant in the discovery. These additional details have now been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors report using 10 components from the SVA model in their analysis. Can authors provide justification for 10 components, which seems high compared to similar studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to include 10 SVA components as a trade-off between correcting for as many unknown sources of variations as possible whilst avoiding issues of model overfitting. Using lower number of SVA resulted in higher genomic inflation. A previously reported EWAS study (Andrews et al., 2018, Molecular Autism 9, 40) applied a similar approach and used 19 SVA to achieve similar trade-off. However, their sample size (n=968) was larger than our study allowing the use of larger number of SVA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The split sample cross validation approach was appreciated for its ability to maximize experimental rigor. However, this approach is distinct from a true external replication. Given that the 'training' and the 'test' sets come from the same overall population, we expect the 'replication' results to be optimistic relative to results from a true, external replication population. Given the absence of a suitable external replication population due the unique nature of the disease, this limitation is acceptable. Please discuss the potential limitations of this approach in the Discussion section. It is encouraged that the authors to refer to the 'replication' set as a 'cross-validation' set to more appropriately convey their experimental approach to the broader scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>We have referred to the replication set as “cross-validation” as suggested by the reviewer. However, the study subjects were recruited from over 27 medical centres across the United Kingdom (UK) representing most major cities. We have also added text to discuss this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. It is unclear how the partial correlations, using ggm, were used in the analysis. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The ggm partial correlations, based on the pooled sites, were used purely for drawing associations between GO biological process terms found enriched in the same set. We have incorporated this sentence in the method section on page 15 together with more details about how partial correlations between sites were used to infer relationships between associated GO terms. In particular, we added the sentence ‘for any two GO terms, we consider the significantly differentially methylated sites from genes associated with either terms. We then test for enrichments of pairs of sites with significant ggms out of all possible pairs of sites across the two terms’ to the same section in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
