similarities to endogenous hormones. EDCs have been shown to induce disruptions in normal epigenetic programming (epimutations) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that predispose disease states. Most interestingly, the prevalence of epimutations following exposure to many EDCs persists over multiple generations. Many studies have described direct and prolonged effects of EDC exposure in animal models, but many questions remain about molecular mechanisms by which EDC-induced epimutations are introduced or subsequently propagated, whether there are cell type-specific susceptibilities to the same EDC, and whether this correlates with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors. We exposed cultured pluripotent (iPS), somatic (Sertoli and granulosa), and primordial germ cell-like (PGCLC) cells to BPS and found that differential incidences of BPS-induced epimutations and DEGs correlated with differential expression of relevant hormone receptors inducing epimutations near relevant hormone response elements in somatic and pluripotent, but not germ cell types. Most interestingly, we found that when iPS cells were exposed to BPS and then induced to differentiate into PGCLCs, the prevalence of epimutations and DEGs was largely retained, however, &gt;90% of the specific epimutations and DEGs were replaced by novel epimutations and DEGs. These results suggest a unique mechanism by which an EDC-induced epimutated state may be propagated transgenerationally.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocrine disrupting chemicals</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>transgenerational epigenetic inheritance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50 HD98593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCarrey</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DA054179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCarrey</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nancy Hurd Smith Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCarrey</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012394</institution-id><institution>The Robert J.

As the number of potential chemicals that could exert these effects has grown, so too has the interest in this area to the point that this is now a major topic of active research. The dangers of many endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) studied to date have largely been investigated utilizing animal models. A primary example is the multi-phased Toxicant Exposures and Responses by Genomic and Epigenomic Regulators of Transcription (TaRGET) program established to determine the contribution of environmental exposures to disease pathogenesis as a function of epigenome perturbation in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). While the use of animal models has been quite informative for determining the various systemic or organ/tissue-specific disease-related effects associated with exposure to different EDCs, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain poorly understood. Thus, questions persist regarding (i) the mechanisms by which exposure of cells to EDCs results in the initial formation of epimutations defined here as any change in epigenomic programming, (ii) potential cell-type specific differential susceptibility to epimutagenesis induced by different EDCs, (iii) the potential involvement of relevant hormone receptors and/or genomic hormone response elements in EDC-induced disruption of the epigenome, and (iv) the ability of an EDC-induced epimutated state to persist inter- or transgenerationally despite generational epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz-Castillo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Questions about molecular mechanisms responsible for EDC-exposure based disruption of normal epigenetic programming have been difficult to interpret in whole animal models due, in part, to the inherent complexity of the intact animal including potential interactions among multiple different organs, tissues, and cell types at the paracrine, metabolic and/or systemic levels. To circumvent this challenge, we opted to expose homogeneous populations of specific cell types in culture to doses of the EDC, Bisphenol S (BPS), that are below the maximum safe limit previously set by the EPA for exposure of humans to the similar estrogen mimetic, Bisphenol A (BPA). In this way, we hoped to learn more about the manner in which direct exposure to a specific EDC induces epimutations and differential gene expression in different individual cell types including somatic cells, pluripotent cells, and germ cells. This approach was designed to distinguish the direct effects of an EDC exposure in vitro from indirect effects that may accrue as the result of an EDC exposure on one cell type inducing a secondary effect on a neighboring or related cell type in vivo.</p><p>Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated direct susceptibility of cultured cell types to EDC-induced epimutagenesis, however, those studies were focused on immortalized cancer cell lines that do not necessarily model key cell types involved in normal initial incursion or subsequent intragenerational propagation or inter- or transgenerational transmission of environmentally induced epimutations in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karaman and Ozden, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Senyildiz et al., 2017</xref>). We chose to examine direct exposure of three key types of cells relevant to environmental exposures and subsequent propagation and transmission of induced epimutations in vivo â somatic cell types known to be responsive to endocrine signaling (Sertoli cells and granulosa cells), pluripotent cells mimicking the preimplantation embryo (iPSCs), and germline cells (PGCLCs).</p><p>While there have been reports that have clearly indicated the ability of EDCs to disrupt classical endocrine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Henley and Korach, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelce et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Swedenborg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">vom Saal and Hughes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">You et al., 1998</xref>), there exist other reports indicating EDCs can also disrupt non-classical endocrine signaling via nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozgyin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers et al., 2011</xref>), G protein-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thomas and Dong, 2006</xref>), and calcium channel signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenker et al., 2018</xref>). This has further complicated our understanding of the mechanism(s) by which EDC exposure initially induces epimutations, and has particularly confounded insight into the susceptibility of germ cells to EDC-induced epimutagenesis given that germ cells are reported to lack expression of classical endocrine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meccariello et al., 2014</xref>). This is relevant to the effort to understand mechanisms underlying transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of EDC-induced epimutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anway et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guerrero-Bosagna et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nilsson et al., 2008</xref>) which clearly implicates transmission via the germ line.</p><p>The concept of germline transmission of EDC-induced epimutations is further confounded by the known epigenetic reprogramming events that occur in the preimplantation embryo and developing fetal and neonatal germ line. Thus, regardless of how EDC-induced epimutations become initially manifest in the germ line, it is not clear how they subsequently persist and are transmitted inter- or transgenerationally given the large portion of the epigenome that undergoes genome-wide erasure and resetting of epigenetic programming during each generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantone and Fisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Santos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sanz et al., 2010</xref>). In vitro cell culture systems afford the opportunity to focus on individual cell types independently, including somatic cells which are likely initially exposed to most environmental disruptive influences, pluripotent cells which represent the preimplantation embryo in which the first major reprogramming event occurs during normal development, and early germline cells where the second major reprogramming event is initiated in primordial germ cells (PGCs). Importantly, in addition to the potential to study each of these cell types independently, it is possible to induce transitions in cell fate in vitro that model those that occur during normal development, thereby recapitulating normal reprogramming events in a way that can facilitate high resolution studies of the fate of EDC-induced epimutations once they have been induced in any of these cell types.</p><p>Here we describe our study of the relative susceptibility to induction of epimutations by direct exposure of four different cell types maintained in culture â somatic Sertoli and granulosa cells, pluripotent iPSCs, and germline PGCLCs â to BPS, followed by our analysis of the fate of epimutations initially induced in mouse iPSCs that are then induced to transition into PGCLCs. We found that there are cell-type specific differences in susceptibility to epimutagenesis and associated dysregulation of gene expression patterns following exposure of these different cell types to a similar dose of BPS below the maximum safe limit established by the EPA for exposure of human cells to BPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>). We further found that BPS induction of epimutations in both pluripotent and somatic cell types that express relevant estrogen receptors (ERs), as well as in germ cells which do not express ERs, suggests disruption of both canonical and non-canonical endocrine signaling. Most interestingly, we found that when iPSCs exposed to BPS were then induced to undergo a major transition in cell fate and related epigenetic reprogramming to form PGCLCs, a similar prevalence of epimutations and DEGs was retained, but, surprisingly, very few (&lt;10%) specific epimutations or DEGs were conserved during this process. This suggests that the initial EDC exposure induces disruption of the chromatin landscape that subsequent epigenetic reprogramming is unable to fully restore. Thus, reprogramming during a major cell fate transition appears to correct many of the initially induced epimutations, but also appears to induce many de novo epimutations, and this imbalance may persist across multiple generations which may contribute to continued transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of EDC-induced phenotypes during succeeding generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dose-dependent epimutagenesis response to BPS exposure in iPSCs</title><p>To initially assess the extent to which epimutations and dysregulated gene expression can be induced in cells maintained in culture, we exposed mouse iPSCs to three doses of BPS (1, 50, and 100 Î¼M) and measured the impact on the epigenome and transcriptome using the Illumina Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip Array and RNA-seq, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All three doses of BPS induced individual differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) as well as differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) when compared to control mouse iPSCs treated with vehicle (EtOH) only. The extent of this exposure-specific epimutagenesis was correlated with the dose of BPS used. Information regarding the overlap of DMCs/DMRs/DEGs identified for each dose of BPS is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>. We observed BPS-induced DMCs within both promoter and gene body regions of a portion of DEGs (17-38%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Importantly, in many cases, we observed a correlation between differential expression of a gene and the presence of DMCs in the promoter region of that gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). These results provided an initial proof of concept that exposure of cells maintained in vitro to an EDC such as BPS can disrupt the epigenome and transcriptome in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, exposure to 1 ÂµM BPS induced very few DMRs, but did induce widespread DMCs and DEGs. Because 1 Î¼M BPS is below the FDAâs suggested safe environmental level established for exposure of humans or intact animals to BPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>), and was sufficient to induce DMCs and dysregulated gene expression on all chromosomes in our cultured iPSCs, we utilized this dose and focused solely on DMCs when assessing epimutations in all subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dose-dependent impact of epimutagenesis measured in iPSCs exposed to 1, 50, and 100 Î¼M BPS.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ideogram plots displaying chromosomal distribution of genome-wide changes in DNA methylation caused by BPS exposure.

Nevertheless, we did still observe induction of DMCs when PGCLCs were exposed to BPS, demonstrating that expression of relevant canonical hormone receptors is not an absolute requirement for induction of epimutations in response to an EDC. To exclude the possibility that the observed susceptibility in germ cells could be correlated with the presence of other endocrine receptors that could interact with BPS, we performed additional ICC for the presence of AR, PPARÎ³, and RXRÎ± and found they were all absent as well in endogenous PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This result and our observation noted above that somatic and pluripotent cell types showed a higher incidence of epimutations at apparent enhancer regions while germ cells showed a higher epimutation incidence at apparent promoter regions reveal cell-type specific differences in susceptibility to induction of epimutations by exposure to the EDC, BPS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Proximity of BPS-induced epimutations to genomic EREs</title><p>The relatively higher incidence of BPS-induced epimutations in cell types expressing one or both estrogen receptor(s) suggests BPS-induced epimutagenesis may be manifest, at least in part, through canonical endocrine signaling pathways. If this is the case, we might expect to see elevated induction of epimutations in genomic regions enriched for relevant HREs which, for interactions with the estrogen mimetic, BPS, would be EREs. Previous studies have defined a full ERE consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourdeau et al., 2004</xref>), but other reports have indicated that estrogen receptors can often bind to ERE half-sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mason et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Indeed, when we mined publicly available ERÎ± ChIP-seq peaks from the UCSC genome browser database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunham and Kundaje, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sloan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) and performed motif enrichment, we identified two distinct ERE half-sites within regions enriched for DMCs rather than one full-sized ERE consensus sequence, with the half-sites appearing to be more biologically relevant to interaction with estrogen or its mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We then plotted the frequency of ERE half-sites in genomic regions within 500 bp of BPS-induced epimutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). We found an increase in the frequency of ERE half-sites identified within 500 bp of BPS-induced DMCs genome-wide in all four cell types investigated, but the frequency was notably lower in germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Thus, this higher frequency of ERE half-sites within 500 bp of BPS-induced DMCs was conserved in three of the four cell types â somatic (Sertoli and granulosa) and pluripotent (iPSCs) when we focused solely on apparent enhancer regions, but not in germ cells (PGCLCs) where the majority of DMCs occurred at apparent promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We also mined the UCSC mouse genome sequence for genome-wide prevalence of ERE half-sites and found that while these sites occur in both promoter and enhancer regions, they are nearly fourfold more frequent in enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that BPS-induced epimutations were more prevalent in enhancer regions in somatic and pluripotent cell types that express one or both ERs, than in germ cells that do not express either ER.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Summary of ERE annotations.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">CpG islands</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Repeat regions</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gene bodies</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Promoters</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Enhancers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">25,079</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2,631,743</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2,448,668</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">172,707</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">468,072</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Taken together, these results suggest a relationship between (i) expression of either ERÎ² alone or ERÎ± and ERÎ² together, (ii) elevated susceptibility to BPS-induced epimutagenesis, and (iii) the occurrence of BPS-induced DMCs in genomic regions â particularly enhancers â containing EREs. These observations are consistent with the notion that one mechanism contributing to EDC-based induction of epimutations involves disruption of canonical endocrine signaling pathways. However, the fact that exposure to BPS also induced epimutations in germ cells, even in the absence of expression of estrogen-related receptors, and generated many DMCs in regions not inclusive of EREs, suggests that disruption of canonical endocrine signaling pathways is not the only mechanism by which exposure to an EDC can induce epimutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cell-type specific features of BPS-induced epimutations</title><p>To further interrogate cell-type specific differences in the genesis of epimutations following exposure to BPS, we compared DNA methylation patterns detected in the control (vehicle only) samples to identify naturally occurring, cell-type specific DMCs inherently associated with each different cell fate. Interestingly, of the 297,415 distinct CpGs interrogated by the Illumina Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip Array used for this analysis, &gt;240,000 showed some degree of inherent differential methylation among the four cell types tested, suggesting they are tied to cell-fate specific differential DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We next determined the extent to which DMCs induced specifically by exposure of each cell type to BPS occurred at CpG dinucleotides that were among these naturally occurring cell-type specific DMCs. We found that a large majority of BPS exposure-specific epimutations detected in each cell type occurred at CpGs that also show inherent, cell-type specific variation in DNA methylation (&gt;95% of BPS-induced epimutations in somatic and pluripotent cell types and ~89% in germ cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). As with the overall pattern of BPS-induced epimutations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, BPS-induced epimutations at CpGs showing inherent cell-type specific variation were enriched in apparent enhancer regions that occurred near EREs in somatic and pluripotent cell types, whereas those in germ cells were found predominantly in promoter regions containing significantly fewer EREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and d</xref>).

Thus, this latter group of BPS-induced epimutations appears to represent a small core group that arises following exposure to BPS via a mechanism that does not rely upon disruption of canonical endocrine signaling, and so is common to all cell types, regardless of expression of relevant endocrine receptors or nearby residence of relevant HREs within the genome.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Direct comparison of BPS exposure-specific and cell-type specific features between cell types.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Assessment Venn diagrams indicating DMCs that are due either to BPS exposure (top, smaller ovals) or inherent cell-type specific differences (bottom, larger ovals).

However, involvement of PI3K/AKT pathway signaling has previously been linked to estrogen signaling through non-canonical G-protein coupled receptors such as GPER1, which was sufficient to induce estrogen signaling in ER KO mouse cell lines which lack the capacity for classical ER signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Filardo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Molina et al., 2017</xref>).

Interestingly, we detected no apparent involvement of pathways involving ubiquitin-like proteases, but we did detect differential expression of four of seven genes associated with a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphatase signaling which intersects with the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).

Thus, of the 38,105 DMCs and 1637 DEGs induced by exposure of iPSCs to 1 ÂµM BPS, 36,688 and 1499, respectively, did not persist during differentiation of iPSCs to form PGCLCs, and so were apparently corrected by germline reprogramming. Simultaneously however, 26,752 novel DMCs and 1299 novel DEGs appeared in the derived PGCLCs that were not present in the BPS-exposed iPSCs, so were apparently generated de novo during the germline reprogramming process. These results are consistent with the notion that germline epigenetic reprogramming corrected many of the epimutations that were present in the BPS-exposed pluripotent cells from which they were derived, but that exposure of cells to EDCs may disrupt the underlying chromatin landscape in a way that then interferes with subsequent reprogramming such that in addition to correcting many previously induced epimutations, the germline reprogramming process, acting on a disrupted chromatin landscape, also generates many novel epimutations de novo during the pluripotent to germline transition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While nearly 20 years of research on the effects of exposure of live animals to various EDCs and other environmental disruptive influences has clearly established the potential to perturb the epigenome in ways that can dysregulate normal gene expression patterns and predispose the development of disease states, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena have remained largely undefined. Thus, the manner in which environmental exposures introduce biochemical changes in epigenetic programming, how such disruptions can be propagated within a tissue or throughout the soma of an exposed individual or enter that individualâs germ line, or how these disruptions predispose disease states in that individual, or how a resulting prevalence of epimutations can be transmitted to multiple subsequent generations despite generational epigenetic reprogramming, are all mechanistic questions that have remained unanswered despite more than 5000 publications on this topic since the early 2000s. The vast majority of those publications have described experiments in animal models â typically rodents. While informative, such live animal studies require months to years to complete, are cost-, labor-, and animal-intensive, and have not yielded substantial insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of environmentally induced epimutations.</p><p>In vitro model systems have proven to be very useful tools for deciphering molecular mechanisms related to normal development and homeostasis, or disruptions of those processes predisposing onset of disease. Examples include cell culture systems used to study developmental processes such as X-chromosome inactivation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patrat et al., 2009</xref>) or early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lau et al., 2022</xref>), or to elucidate the cellular and molecular etiology of many different diseases based on the now popular âdisease-in-a-dishâ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davaapil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2023</xref>). While in vitro cell culture systems are, by nature, devoid of a majority of the physiological complexities present within the intact organism in vivo, this provides an actual advantage in that it facilitates deconvolution of those complexities while unequivocally focusing on only certain, specific aspects or cell types. However, this ultimately warrants validation of results discerned from studies of in vitro models to ensure they also reflect functions ongoing in the more complex and heterogeneous environment of the intact animal in vivo.</p><p>We assembled an in vitro system in which we combined the three cell types normally involved in (i) the initial exposure to disruptive environmental effects (somatic cells), (ii) the first phase of generational epigenetic reprogramming in the preimplantation embryo (pluripotent cells), and (iii) the second phase of generational reprogramming in the developing germ line (germ cells). This system allowed us to gain insights into multiple mechanistic aspects of environmentally induced epimutagenesis including the initial induction of epimutations by exposure of cells to the EDC, BPS, cell-type specific differences in susceptibility to BPS-induced epimutagenesis, factors that appear to contribute to that differential susceptibility, and the mechanism by which an epimutated state may persist across multiple generations despite generational reprogramming.</p><p>Here we have shown that exposure of homogeneous populations of cells maintained in culture to an EDC such as BPS can induce epimutagenesis and dysregulation of gene expression, and that this occurs in a partially additive dose-dependent manner, although the quantitative effect appears to plateau at higher doses. This afforded us the opportunity to test the relative effects of direct exposure of different specific cell types to a similar dose of BPS with no confounding effects imposed by interactions with other cell types or systemic effects of the sort that normally occur in the in vivo context. We found that somatic, pluripotent, and germ cell types do indeed show differences in direct susceptibility to induction of epimutations following exposure to BPS, both in terms of the quantity of epimutations induced and qualities of the resulting epimutations such as a predominance of hyper- versus hypomethylation, and the genomic locations where such epimutations tend to occur. Our results suggest that these differences reflect distinctions in the normal status of each cell type at the time of exposure. Thus, somatic, pluripotent, and germ cell types differ in the normal status of genome-wide patterns of accessible versus inaccessible chromatin, global DNA methylation, and expression of relevant endocrine receptors. Interestingly, our data suggest that all of these parameters can influence cell-type specific susceptibility to induction of epimutations by exposure to BPS, and that different combinations of these variables ultimately determine the quantity and quality of epimutations induced by exposure to BPS. We note that while our exposure dose of 1 ÂµM of BPS was below that deemed safe by the EPA for exposure of humans to the similar EDC, BPA, that same dose may exert greater effects when used to expose cells in culture in the absence of any sort of mitigating metabolic effects that may accrue in intact animals or humans. Indeed, the potential to quantify the epimutagenic effects of different doses of an EDC on different cell types as shown in our study could be used in future studies to assess the relative effects of a specific dose of an EDC on a specific cell type when that cell type is exposed either in a homogeneous culture or within an intact animal.</p><p>Endogenous fetal germline cells (e.g. PGCs and prospermatogonia in males) normally display lower levels of global DNA methylation and higher levels of chromatin accessibility than pluripotent or somatic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hajkova, 2011</xref>), yet PGCLCs developed fewer epimutations following exposure to BPS than the other cell types. This appears to be explained by the fact that germline cells do not express either estrogen receptor, whereas pluripotent and somatic cell types express one or both of the two estrogen receptors, apparently rendering them more susceptible to induction of epimutations following exposure to the estrogen mimetic, BPS. This is consistent with the notion that EDCs impose disruptive effects by interfering with canonical endocrine signaling pathways, and that notion is further supported by our observation that, in the cell types that express one or both estrogen receptors, we observed a prevalence of BPS-induced epimutations in genomic regions containing nearby EREs, whereas in PGCLCs, which do not express either estrogen receptor, we did not observe a strong correlation between the locations of BPS-induced epimutations and genomic EREs.</p><p>Nevertheless, we did observe induction of epimutations in PGCLCs exposed to BPS, suggesting that while cell types expressing relevant endocrine receptors may display elevated susceptibility to EDC-induced epimutagenesis presumably based on disruption of canonical endocrine signaling, this is not the only mechanism by which EDCs can induce epimutations. Indeed, our results support the suggestion that there may be at least two types of epimutations induced by exposure to EDCs â one that is independent of canonical endocrine signaling and so occurs in all cell types regardless of expression of relevant endocrine receptors or the genomic location of relevant HREs, and another that does involve disruption of canonical endocrine signaling and so is elevated in cell types expressing relevant endocrine receptors and predisposes the induction of epimutations in genomic regions near relevant HREs. Beyond this, a comparison of the quantities of BPS-induced epimutations in pluripotent and somatic cell types, which both express one or both estrogen receptors, but which differ with respect to elevated genome-wide chromatin accessibility in pluripotent cells compared to much more limited chromatin accessibility in somatic cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cantone and Fisher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Santos et al., 2002</xref>), suggests that chromatin accessibility also contributes to susceptibility to EDC-induced epimutagenesis.</p><p>One of our most intriguing findings was that, in addition to estrogen-receptor expressing somatic and pluripotent cell types developing more epimutations than non-estrogen-receptor expressing germ cells in response to exposure to BPS, the occurrence of epimutations in the former (somatic and pluripotent) cell types was predominantly in enhancer regions whereas that in the latter (germ) cell type was predominantly in gene promoters. As noted above, there was a significant increase in the occurrence of BPS-induced epimutations near EREs in somatic and pluripotent cell types compared to germ cells. A genome-wide analysis confirmed that ERE half-sites occur more frequently in enhancer regions than in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>) supporting our suggestion that the higher prevalence of BPS-induced epimutations we observed in enhancer regions in somatic and pluripotent cell types was due to disruption of canonical hormone signaling.</p><p>Our finding that PGCLCs, which do not express endocrine receptors, still accrued epimutations following exposure to BPS indicates that in addition to inducing epimutations by disrupting canonical endocrine signaling pathways, exposure to EDCs can induce epimutations via mechanisms that do not involve disruption of such pathways. This notion is further supported by the occurrence of BPS-induced epimutations in genomic regions that do not include nearby EREs, even though a prevalence of the epimutations induced in PGCLCs were located in gene promoters. Pathway analysis of the genes in which promoter-region epimutations were induced by exposure of PGCLCs to BPS suggests an apparent endocrine-signaling independent group of genes that can become disrupted by exposure to an EDC via non-canonical signaling which may occur through the PI3K/AKT pathway via G-protein-coupled receptors. While we observed expression of a number of G-protein-coupled receptors known to bind to either 17Î²-estradiol or BPA, further studies will be required to determine if any of these contribute to susceptibility to BPS epimutagenesis.</p><p>As expected, disruption of normal epigenetic programming induced by exposure of cells to BPS also led to dysregulation of gene expression. Thus, RNA-seq analysis detected differentially expressed genes in all cell types exposed to BPS. Surprisingly, the greatest number of DEGs was detected in PGCLCs which was the cell type that developed the lowest overall number of epimutations in response to exposure to BPS. However, PGCLCs showed a higher prevalence of BPS-induced epimutations in gene promoter regions than was observed in any of the other cell types, so it appears that promoter-region epimutations impose the most direct impact on gene expression. As noted above, fetal germ cells normally display the lowest level of global DNA methylation of any cell type at any developmental stage. This is characteristic of the epigenetic ground state that accrues uniquely in developing germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hajkova, 2011</xref>), and is believed to reflect a generally more accessible chromatin state genome-wide in germ cells than in other cell types. Thus, it may be that the epigenetic ground state in developing germ cells renders this cell type uniquely susceptible to epimutagenesis in gene promoter regions, thereby predisposing a high level of dysregulation of gene expression in response to exposure to an EDC.</p><p>Finally, our in vitro system allowed us to follow the fate of BPS-induced epimutations through a major transition in cell fate from pluripotent to germline cells during which a portion of the normal generational germline epigenetic reprogramming process is known to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kurimoto and Saitou, 2018</xref>). Thus, when we induced iPSCs previously exposed to 1 Î¼M BPS to differentiate into PGCLCs, we found that a substantial prevalence of epimutations persisted during this transition. However, very few of the specific DMCs or the associated DEGs detected in the BPS-exposed iPSCs persisted in the subsequently derived PGCLCs. Specifically, only 3.7% of DMCs and 8.4% of DEGs were conserved between the BPS-exposed iPSCs and the subsequently derived PGCLCs. This suggests that exposure of cells to EDCs has the potential to disrupt epigenetic programming in a way that then interferes with subsequent generational reprogramming that normally accompanies either germline to pluripotent or pluripotent to germline transitions in cell fate. Recent in vivo studies have suggested that exposure of gestating female mice to the EDC tributyltin results in disruption not simply of the pattern of epigenetic modifications but also of the underlying chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chamorro-GarcÃ­a et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). In this context, our results are consistent with the suggestion that exposure of cells to EDCs can disrupt the underlying chromatin landscape (e.g. the pattern of A and B chromatin compartments) such that when the ânormalâ reprogramming machinery then acts on this disrupted landscape it corrects many of the originally induced epimutations, but simultaneously induces many novel epimutations de novo. This would predispose ongoing abnormalities in the underlying chromatin landscape that would, in turn, lead to the recurring correction of many existing epimutations in concert with the genesis of many novel epimutations during each subsequent generation.</p><p>We note that, with the exception of our analysis of granulosa cells, all of our studies were carried out in âmaleâ XY-bearing cells. It remains possible that XX-bearing cells might differ from XY-bearing cells in the way(s) in which they respond to exposure to an EDC. However, the similarity we observed between responses of XX granulosa cells and XY Sertoli cells suggest this may not be the case â at least in cell types in which dosage compensation has been established by X-chromosome inactivation.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate the utility of an in vitro cell culture approach for pursuing molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally induced disruption of normal epigenetic programming manifest as the formation of epimutations and dysregulated gene expression. This approach clearly affords unique potential to reveal mechanisms responsible for the initial induction of epimutations in response to direct exposure of cells to disruptive effects such as EDCs, as well as offering potential means to elucidate mechanisms by which environmentally induced epimutations are then propagated within the exposed individual and then to that individualâs descendants. Knowledge of these mechanisms will afford the best opportunity to understand how these defects may, in the future, be better diagnosed, treated, and/or prevented. With the ever-expanding catalog of potentially hazardous man-made compounds permeating our environment, it is increasingly important that we recognize the potential dangers such compounds may impose and maximize our ability to protect ourselves from those dangers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal procedures</title><p>Mice were used as the primary source of cells for the establishment of cultures for the analysis of differential cell-type specific susceptibility to exposure to the EDC BPS at the cellular level.

These shortened fragments of seminiferous tubules were then digested in a mixture of 2.5% trypsin and 6.64 mg/ml DNaseI in DPBS for 25 min at 37 Â°C. After these enzymes were inactivated, the tubule sections were washed multiple times, then treated with a final enzymatic mixture of collagenase IV (0.70 mg/mL) and DNaseI (6.64 mg/mL) for 10 min to permeabilize the thick collagen layer on the exterior of the seminiferous tubules to allow the Sertoli cells to migrate out away from the tubules in culture. After checking the digested tubules under a microscope to confirm the collagen layer had been permeabilized, the digested tubules were spun down to wash away the enzymes, and then resuspended in Sertoli cell media containing retinoic acid from ScienCell (4521) (ScienCell Research Laboratories, CA USA). The digested tubules were plated into six culture flasks in order to have three replicates of both control and treated cells for each exposure experiment. To remove contaminating germ cells from this primary culture, the cells were treated with hypotonic shock treatment on the morning of the second day of culture, and the enriched Sertoli cells were washed and allowed to recover with fresh media for at least two hours. The enriched primary cultures of Sertoli cells were then ready to be used for chemical exposure experiments. The estimated purity of the culture was &gt;80% based on ICC staining for the Sertoli cell markers SOX9 and WT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

To isolate preantral primary follicles we dissected ovaries from ~5 female littermate mice at P20 and then enzymatically digested the ovary using collagenase IV (560 U/pair of ovaries) for 25 min at 37 Â°C with constant agitation. This digestion was stopped by addition of buffer with 0.5% BSA and the mixture was spun down at 60 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min to pellet the cells. The cells were resuspended in PBS with 0.5% BSA and transferred to a sterile petri dish under a stereomicroscope. Primary follicles were individually picked from the solution using a glass needle with suction control and moved into a clean droplet of PBS containing 0.5% BSA. Selected primary follicles were then spun down at 1000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. After spinning, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were finger-vortexed to resuspend the pellet. The follicles were then digested to single cell suspension by addition of pre-warmed (37 Â°C) 0.25% trypsin and incubated for 5 min with regular pipetting followed by pelleting again at 1000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The trypsin-containing supernatant was removed, and the granulosa cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS and plated into ix culture flasks in order to have three replicates of both control and treated cells for each exposure experiment. The oocytes were non-adherent and were washed away on day 2 when changing the media. The estimated purity of the culture was &gt;90% based on ICC staining for the granulosa cell marker FSHR and INHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Briefly, iPSCs maintained in N2B27 supplemented with 2i and LIF under feeder-free conditions were differentiated to EpiLCs for two days by the addition of activin A and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to the N2B27 media. After 2 days, the EpiLC intermediate cells were passaged to low adherence round bottom plates for 4 days in GK15 media containing bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4), stem cell factor (SCF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and LIF to induce the differentiation of a subset of cells (2â3%) in the resulting aggregate to become PGCLCs. 6 batches each being made up of six plates were required in order to obtain sufficient cell numbers for three replicates of both control and treated conditions. During this 4-day period, cell aggregates were ready for EDC exposure (see below). Following EDC exposure, cell aggregates were removed from the low adherence round bottom plates within each batch, dissociated into a single cell suspension, and PGCLCs were fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) on a BD FACSAria II in the UTSA Cell Analysis Core to recover cells that were double-positive for FUT4 and ITGB3.

Pluripotent (iPS) and somatic (Sertoli and granulosa) cells were grown on 13 mm Thermanox plastic coverslips (174950) prior to fixation, permeabilization, and immunolabeling (Nalge Nunc International, NY USA). Non-adherent germ (PGC and PGCLC) cells were spun down onto poly-L-lysine coated slides (63410â01) at 400 RPM for one minute using a Thermo Shandon CytoSpin III Cytocentrifuge from Rakin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA USA &amp; Rakin Biomedical Corporation, MI USA). Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and then washed three times for five minutes each with ICC buffer (PBS containing 0.01% Triton X-100 detergent) to permeabilize the cell and nuclear membranes prior to blocking with 5% goat serum which was added to the ICC buffer and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Following blocking, primary antibodies, in ICC buffer, were added to the slides and left to incubate overnight at 4 Â°C. The following day, slides were washed three times with ICC buffer, and fluorescent secondary antibodies in ICC buffer were then added to the slides and left to incubate in the dark for 1 hr. After secondary antibody incubation, cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI at a 1:1000 dilution in ICC buffer for 7 min, followed by three final washes with ICC buffer for 5 min. Coverslips then were transferred to microscope slides and mounted with 5â10 Î¼L of VECTASHEILD Antifade Mounting Medium (H-1000) and sealed with clear nail polish before being imaged on a Zeiss AXIO Imager.M1 Fluorescence Microscope (Vector Laboratories Inc, CA, USA and Zeiss Group, Oberkochen DE).

Thus for this study, we established our initial testing range of 1 Î¼M, 50 Î¼M, and 100 Î¼M of BPS based on the limit established for BPA at â¤ 4.44 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ribeiro et al., 2019</xref>) selecting 1 dose below the established safe limit and two doses that exceed that limit. For all cell types except PGCLCs, BPS was dissolved in absolute ethanol and added to media gassed with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, and balanced N<sub>2</sub> and then injected into three replicate sealed T-25 cell culture flasks and left to incubate for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). The media was gassed to ensure enrichment to 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, which is normally regulated by the cell incubator, limiting the potential for the pH to change in the media during this exposure period due to the absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by incubating cells. The concentration of either BPS dissolved in ethanol for treatment groups or ethanol vehicle alone for control groups made up 0.02% of the total media volume. Following 24 hr of exposure, media containing BPS was removed and cells were washed and allowed to recover in fresh untreated media (without BPS or EtOH) for 24 hr prior to harvesting. PGCLCs were not suitable for this exposure paradigm as EpiLCs undergo differentiation to PGCLCs in cell aggregates formed in low-adherence round-bottom 96-well plates and cannot be maintained in T-25 sealed flasks. Therefore, diluted BPS was added to PGCLC media and added to cells in three replicate batches of round-bottom 96-well plates to incubate for 24 hr prior to a shortened wash and âchaseâ period of 8 hr prior to cell sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Methylation beadchip analysis</title><p>A total of 1 Î¼g of extracted genomic DNA from each of three replicate exposure experiments for each cell type was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (D5001) and modified according to the manufacturerâs recommendations (Zymo Research, CA USA and Illumina, CA USA). These samples were run on the Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip Array following the Illumina Infinium HD Methylation protocol. This beadchip array includes 297,415 cytosine positions within the mouse genome (CpG sites, non-CpG sites, and random SNPs). The methylation score for each CpG is represented as a Î²-value which is a ratio of the fluorescence intensity ranging between 0 (unmethylated) and 1 (methylated).

They used isolated somatic cells from mice (Sertoli, granulosa), pluripotent cells to model preimplantation embryos (iPSCs) and cells to model the germline (PGCLCs). This enabled them to model sequential steps in germline development, and when/how epimutations occur. The major findings were that BPS induced unique epimutations in each cell type, albeit with qualitative and quantitative cell-specific differences; that these epimutations are prevalent in regions associated with estrogen-response elements (EREs); and that epimutations induced in iPSCs are corrected as they differentiate into PGCLCs, concomitant with the emergence of de novo epimutations.

They find a relationship between the presence of estrogen receptor gene expression and the number of DNA methylation and gene expression changes. Notably, PGCLCs do not express estrogen receptors and although they do have fewer changes, changes are nevertheless detected, suggesting a nonconical pathway for BPS-induced perturbations. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the occurrence of BPS-induced epimutations near EREs in somatic and pluripotent cell types compared to germ cells.

Please put them in order.</p></disp-quote><p>All the sections from the previous Supplementary files have been divided into individual Supplementary files so that each can be referenced without confusion from the text. All of the references in the body of the text and the author responses have been updated to reflect this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The question of sample sizes was partially addressed, with authors stating that cell culture work in iPSCs and PGCLCs was done in replicates of 3. Sertoli and granulosa cells were generated from pooled preps - how many individuals, were they littermates?</p></disp-quote><p>Sertoli and granulosa primary cultures were generated from littermates and each prep used 5 animals (males for Sertoli cells and females for granulosa cells). These changes have been added to the body of the text on pages 39 and 40.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Authors need to discuss the limitations of doing work in triplicates. Their PCA (Supplement Figure 9) reveals that in several cases samples from the same treatment were not discriminated by PC1 and/or PC2. This is especially true in e and f, the variance of which was explained by PC1 for cell type, but for which treatments showed poor discrimination by PC2. Some discussion of the limitations of sample size should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional text has been added to what is now Supplementary file 15 to acknowledge this limitation imposed by the limited number of replicates (three) and the ability to resolve the differences in treatments by PCA in subplots e and f. However, we also note that the differences were sufficient to identify significant DMCs/DMRs/DEGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviwer 2 also noted a potential weakness that âexposures are more complicated in a whole organism than in an isolated cell line.â</p></disp-quote><p>We note that in our revised manuscript we included wording noting that despite the advantages of using an in vitro approach to deduce underlying molecular mechanisms, results of such in vitro studies âultimately warrant validation of results discerned from studies of in vitro models to ensure they also reflect functions ongoing in the more complex and heterogeneous environment of the intact animal in vivo.â Thus we have endeavored to acknowledge the reviewerâs point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Critiques/Comments:</p><p>(1) A problem with in vitro work is that homogeneous cell lines/cultures are, by nature, absent from the rest of the microenvironment. The authors need to discuss this.</p></disp-quote><p>[Addressed on pages: 24-25] â We have added two sentences to the second paragraph of the Discussion section in which we now acknowledge this concern, but also point out that in vitro models of this sort also provide an experimental advantage in that they facilitate a deconvolution of the extensive complexity resident within the intact animal. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that this deconvolution requires ultimate validation of findings obtained within an in vitro model system to ensure they accurately recapitulate functions that occur in the intact animal in vivo.</p><p>In response to Reviewer 2âs stated weakness of our study that âThe weakness includes the fact that exposures are more complicated in a whole organism than in an isolated cell line,â please note that this added text includes the statement that despite the advantages of using an in vitro approach to deduce underlying molecular mechanisms, results of such in vitro studies âultimately warrant validation of results discerned from studies of in vitro models to ensure they also reflect functions ongoing in the more complex and heterogeneous environment of the intact animal in vivo.â Thus we have endeavored to acknowledge the reviewerâs point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What are n's/replicates for each study? Were the same or different samples used to generate the data for RNA sequencing, methylation beadchip analysis, and EM-seq? This clarification is important because if the same cultures were used, this would allow comparisons and correlations within samples.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 39-45 and in new Supplementary file 15 â Additional text has been added in the Methods section to indicate that all samples involving cell culture models which include iPSCs and PGCLCs came from a single XY iPS cell line aliquoted into replicates and all primary cultures which included Sertoli and granulosa cells were generated from pooled tissue preps from mice and then aliquoted into replicates. Finally, all experiments in the study were performed on three replicates. Because this experimental design did indeed allow for comparisons among samples, we have added a new Supplementary file 15</p><p>which displays PCA plots showing clustering among control and treatment datasets, respectively, as well as distinctions between each cluster representing each experimental condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 1, it is interesting that the 50 uM BPS dose mainly resulted in hypermethylation whereas 100 uM appears to be mainly hypomethylation. (This is based on the subjective appearance of graphs). The authors should discuss and/or present these data more quantitatively. For example, what percentage of changes were hypo/hypermethylation for each treatment? How many DMRs did each dose induce? For the RNA-seq results, again, what were the number of up/down-regulated genes for each dose?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 6-7 and in new Supplementary files 1-3 â The experiment shown in Figure 1 was designed to (1) serve as proof of principle that cells maintained in culture could be susceptible to EDC-induced epimutagenesis at all, (2) determine if any response observed would be dose-dependent, and (3) identify a minimally effective dose of BPS to be used for the remaining experiments in this study (which we identified as 1 Î¼M). We agree that it is interesting that the 50 ÂµM dose of BPS induced predominantly hypermethylation changes whereas the 1 ÂµM and 100 ÂµM doses induced predominantly hypomethylation changes, but are not in a position to offer a mechanistic explanation for this outcome at this time. As the results shown satisfied our primary objectives of demonstrating that exposure of cells in culture to BPS could indeed induce DNA methylation epimutations, that this occurs in a dose-dependent manner, and that a dose of as low as 1 ÂµM of BPS was sufficient to induce epimutagenesis, the data obtained satisfied all of the initial objectives of this experiment. That said, in response to the reviewerâs request we have now added text on pages 6-7 alluding to new Supplementary files 1-3 indicating the total number of DMCs and DMRs, as well as the number of DEGs, detected in response to exposure to each dose of BPS shown in Figure 1, as well as stratifying those results to indicate the numbers of hyper- and hypomethylation epimutations and up- and down-regulated DEGs induced in response to each dose of BPS. While, as noted above, investigating the mechanistic basis for the difference in responses induced by the 50 ÂµM versus 1 and 100 ÂµM doses of BPS was beyond the scope of the study presented in this manuscript, we do find this result reminiscent of the âU-shapedâ response curves often observed in toxicology studies. Importantly, this result does demonstrate the elevated resolution and specificity of analysis facilitated by our in vitro cell culture model system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Also in Figure 1, were there DMRs or genes in common across the doses? How did DMRs relate to gene expression results? This would be informative in verifying or refuting expectations that greater methylation is often associated with decreased gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 6-7 and new Supplementary files 1-6 â In general, we observed a coincidence between changes in DNA methylation and changes in gene expression (Supplementary files 1-3). Pertaining directly to the reviewerâs question about the extent to which we observed common DMRs and DEGs across all doses, while we only found 3 overlapping DMRs conserved across all doses tested, we did find an average of 51.25% overlap in DMCs and an average of 80.45% overlap in DEGs across iPSCs exposed to the different doses of BPS shown in Figure 1. In addition, within each dose of BPS tested in iPSCs, we also found that there was an overlap between DMCs and the promoters or gene bodies of many DEGs (Supplementary file 5). Specifically within gene promoters, we observed a correlation between hypermethylated DMCs and decreased gene expression and hypomethylated DMCs and increased gene expression, respectively (Supplementary file 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 2, was there an overlap in the hypo- and/or hyper-methylated DMCs? Please also add more description of the data in 2b to the legend including what the dot sizes/colors mean, etc. Some readers (including me) may not be familiar with this type of data presentation. Some of this comes up in Figure 4, so perhaps allude to this earlier on, or show these data earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 8-9 and new Supplementary file 4 â We observed an average of 11.05% overlapping DMCs between different pairs of cell types, we did not observe any DMCs that were shared among all four cell types. Indeed, this limited overlap of DMCs among different cell types exposed to BPS was the primary motivation for the analysis described in Figure 2. Thus, instead of focusing solely on direct overlap between specific DMCs, we instead examined similarities among the different cell types tested in the occurrence of epimutations within different annotated genomic regions. To better describe this, we have now added additional text to page 9. We have also added more detail to the legend for Figure 2 on page 8 to more clearly explain the significance of the dot sizes and colors, explaining that the dot sizes are indicative of the relative number of differentially methylated probes that were detected within each specific annotated genomic region, and that the dot colors are indicative of the calculated enrichment score reflecting the relative abundance of epimutations occurring within a specific annotated genomic region. The relative score is calculated by iterating down the list of DMCs and increasing a running-sum statistic when encountering a DMC within the specific annotated genomic region of interest and decreasing the sum when the epimutation is not in that annotated region. The magnitude of the increment depends upon the relative occurrence of DMCs within a specific annotated genomic region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) iPSCs were derived from male mice MEFs, and subsequently used to differentiate into PGCLCs. The only cell type from an XX female is the granulosa cells. This might be important, and should be mentioned and its potential significance discussed (briefly).</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page: 29 â We have added a new paragraph just before the final paragraph of the Discussion section in which we acknowledge that most of the cell types analyzed during our study were XY-bearing âmaleâ cells and that the manner in which XX-bearing âfemaleâ cells might respond to similar exposures could differ from the responses we observed in XY cells. However, we also noted that our assessment of XX-bearing granulosa cells yielded results very similar to those seen in XY Sertoli cells suggesting that, at least for differentiated somatic cell types, there does not appear to be a significant sex-specific difference in response to exposure to a similar dose of the same EDC. That said, we also acknowledged that in cell types in which dosage compensation based on X-chromosome inactivation is not in place, differences between XY- and XX-bearing cells could accrue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) EREs are only one type of hormone response element. The authors make the point that other mechanisms of BPS action are independent of canonical endocrine signaling. Would authors please briefly speculate on the possibility that other endocrine pathways including those utilizing AREs or other HREs may play a role? In other words, it may not be endocrine signaling independent. The statement that the differences between PGCLCs and other cells are largely due to the absence of ERs is overly simplistic.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page: 11 and in a new Supplementary file 8 â Previous reports have indicated that BPS does not have the capacity to bind with the androgen receptor (Pelch <italic>et al</italic>., 2019; Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2024). However there have been reports indicating that BPS can interact with other endocrine receptors including PPARÎ³ and RXRÎ±, which play a role in lipid accumulation and the potential to be linked to obesity phenotypes (Gao et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2018). To address the reviewerâs comment we assessed the expression of a panel of hormone receptors including PPARÎ³, RXRÎ±, and AR in each of the cell types examined in our study and these results are now shown in a new Supplementary file 8. We show that in addition to not expressing either estrogen receptor (ERa or ERb), germ cells also do not express any of the other endocrine receptors we tested including AR, PPARÎ³, and RXRÎ±. Thus we now note that these results support our suggestion that the induction of epimutations we observed in germ cells in response to exposure to BPS appears to reflect disruption of non-canonical endocrine signaling. We also note that non-canonical endocrine signaling is well established (Brenker et al., 2018; Ozgyin et al., 2015; Song et al., 2011; Thomas and Dong, 2006). Thus we feel the suggestion that the effects of BPS exposure could conceivably reflect either disruption of canonical or non-canonical signaling in any cell type is well justified and that our data suggests that both of these effects appear to have accrued in the cells examined in our study as suggested in the text of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Interpretation of data from the GO analysis is similarly overly simplistic. The pathways identified and discussed (e.g. PI3K/AKT and ubiquitin-like protease pathways) are involved in numerous functions, both endocrine and non-endocrine. Also, are the data shown in Figure 6a from all 4 cell types? I am confused by the heatmap in 6c, which genes were significantly affected by treatment in which cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 19-21 â Per the reviewerâs request, we have added text to indicate that Figure 6a is indeed data from all four cell types examined. We have also modified the text to further clarify that Figure 6c displays the expression of other G-coupled protein receptors which are expressed at similar, if not higher, levels than either ER in all cell types examined, and that these have been shown to have the potential to bind to either 17Î²-estradiol or BPA in rat models. As alluded to by the reviewer, this is indicative of a wide variety of distinct pathways and/or functions that can potentially be impacted by exposure to an EDC such as BPS. Thus, we have attempted to acknowledge the reviewerâs primary point that BPS may interact with a variety of receptors or other factors involved with a wide variety of different pathways and functions. Importantly, this illustrates the strength of our model system in that it can be used to identify potential impacted target pathways that can then be subsequently pursued further as deemed appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In Figure 7, what were the 138 genes? Any commonalities among them?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page: 22 and in a new Supplementary files 13 and 14 â We have now added a new supplemental Excel file (Supplementary file 13) that lists the 138 overlapping conserved DEGs that did not become reprogrammed/corrected during the transition from iPSCs to PGCLCs. In addition, we have added new text on page 22 and a new Supplementary file 14 which displays KEGG analysis of pathways associated with these 138 retained DEGs. We find that these genes are primarily involved with cell cycle and apoptosis pathways which, interestingly, have the potential to be linked to cancer development which is often linked to disruptions in chromatin architecture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The Introduction is very long. The last paragraph, beginning line 105, is a long summary of results and interpretations that better fit in a Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page: 6 â We have now significantly reduced the length and scope of the final paragraph of the Introduction per the reviewerâs recommendation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Provide some details on husbandry: e.g. were they bred on-site?

They find a relationship between the presence of estrogen receptor gene expression and the number of DNA methylation and gene expression changes. Notably, PGCLCs do not express estrogen receptors and although they do have fewer changes, changes are nevertheless detected, suggesting a nonconical pathway for BPS-induced perturbations. Additionally, there was a significant increase in the occurrence of BPS-induced epimutations near EREs in somatic and pluripotent cell types compared to germ cells. Epimutations in the somatic and pluripotent cell types were predominantly in enhancer regions whereas that in the germ cell type was predominantly in gene promoters.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of the paper include the use of various cell types to address the sensitivity of the lineages to BPS as well as the observed relationship between the presence of estrogen receptors and changes in gene expression and DNA methylation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The weaknesses include the lack of reporting of replicates, superficial bioinformatic analysis, and the fact that exposures are more complicated in a whole organism than in an isolated cell line.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors: please note that you control which revisions to undertake from the public reviews and recommendations for the authors.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Overall, this is an intriguing paper but more transparency in the replicates and methods and a more rigorous bioinformatic treatment of the data are required.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) End of abstract &quot;These results suggest a unique mechanism by which an EDC-induced epimutated state may be propagated transgenerationally following a single exposure to the causative EDC.&quot; This is overly speculative for an abstract. There is only epigenetic inheritance following mitosis or differentiation presented in this study. There is no meiosis and therefore no ability to assess multi- or transgenerational inheritance.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page: 2 â We have modified the text at the end of the abstract to more precisely reflect our intended conclusions based on our data. In our view, the ability of induced epimutations to transcend meiosis per se is not as relevant to the mechanism of transgenerational inheritance as their ability to transcend major waves of epigenetic reprogramming that normally occur during development of the germ line. In this regard the transition from pluripotent iPSCs to germline PGCLCs has been shown to recapitulate at least the first portion of normal germline reprogramming, and now our data provide novel insight into the fate of induced epimutations during this process. Specifically, we show that a prevelance of epimutations was conserved during the iPSC Ã  germ cell transition but that very few (&lt; 5%) of the specific epimutations present in the the BPS-exposed iPSCs were retained when those cells were induced to form PGCLCs. Rather, we observed apparent correction of a large majority of the initially induced epimutations during this transition, but this was accompanied by the apparent de novo generation of novel epimutations in the PGCLCs. We suggest, based on other recent reports in the literature, that this is a result of the BPS exposure inducing changes in the chromatin architecture in the exposed iPSCs such that when the normal germline reprogramming mechanism is imposed on this disrupted chromatin template there is both correction of many existing epimutations and the genesis of many novel epimutations. This observation has the potential to explain the long-standing question of why the prevalence of epimutations persists across multiple generations despite the occurrence of epigenetic reprogramming during each generation. Nevertheless, as noted above, we have modified the text at the end of the abstract to temper this interpretation given that it is still somewhat speculative at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Doses used in the experiments. One needs to be careful when stating that the dose used is &quot;below FDA's suggested safe environmental level established for BPA&quot; because a different bisphenol is being used here (BPA vs BPS) and the safe level is that which the entire organism experiences. It is likely that cell lines experience a higher effective dose.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 3, 5, and 26 â We have now made a point of noting that our reference to an EPA-recommended âsafe doseâ of BPA was for humans and/or intact animals. Changes to this effect have been made in the second and sixth paragraphs of the Introduction section. In addition, we have added text at the end of the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section acknowledging that, as the reviewer suggests, the same dose of an EDC could exert greater effects on cells in a homogeneous culture than on the same cell type within an intact animal given the potential for mitigating metabolic effects in the latter. However, we also note that the ability we demonstrated to quantify the effects of such exposures on the basis of numbers of epimutations (DMCs or DMRs) induced could potentially be used in future studies to study this question by assessing the effects of a specific dose of a specific EDC on a specific cell type when exposed either within a homogeneous culture or within an intact animal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1: In the dose response, what was the overlap in DMCs and DEGs among the 3 doses? Are the responses additive, synergistic, or completely non-overlapping? This is an important point that should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page: 6-7 and in Supplementary files 1-5 â Please see our response to Reviewer 1 critique #4 above where we address similar concerns. While we do find overlap among different cell types with respect to the DMCs, DMRs, and DEGs displayed in Figure 1, we found the effect to be only partially additive as opposed to synergistic in any apparent manner. The fold increase in DMCs, DMRs, and DEGs resulting from exposure to doses of 1 Î¼M or 50 Î¼M ranged from 2.5x to 4.4x, which was well below the 50x increase that would have been expected from a strictly additive effect, and the effect increased even less, if at all, in response to exposure to doses of 50 Î¼M versus 100 Î¼M BPS. Finally, as now noted in the Discussion section on page 25, our conclusion is that these results display a limited dose-dependent effect that was partially additive but also plateaued at the highest doses tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Methods: How many times was each exposure performed on a given cell type? This information should be in the figure legends and methods. In the case of multiple exposures for a given line, do the biological replicates agree?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 39-45 and in new Supplementary file 15 â Please see our response to Reviewer 1 critique #2 where we address similar concerns with newly added text and analysis. We now note repeatedly on pages 39-45 that each analysis was conducted on three replicate samples, and we display the similarity among those replicates graphically in a new Supplementary file 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) DNA methylation analyses. Very little analysis is presented on the BeadChip array other than hypermethylated/hypomethylated and genomic regions of DMCs. What is the range of methylation changes? Does it vary between hypo vs. hyper DMCs? How many array experiments were performed (biological replicates) and what stats were used to determine the DMCs? Are there DMCs in common among the various cell types? As an example, if more meaningful analysis, one can plot the %5mC over a given array for comparisons between control and treated cell types. For more granularity, the %5mC can be presented according to the element type (enhancers vs promoters).</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages: 10 and 39-45 and in new Supplementary files 1-5, 15 â Please see our response to Reviewer 1 critique #2 above where we address similar concerns regarding the number of biological replicates used in this study. DMCs on the Infinium array are identified using mixed linear models. This general supervised learning framework identifies CpG loci at which differential methylation is associated with known control vs. treated co-variates. CpG probes on the array were defined as having differential changes that met both p-value and FDR (â¤ 0.05) significant thresholds between treatment and control samples for each cell type analyzed. The range of medians across all samples was 0.0278 to 0.0059 for hypermethylated beta values and -0.0179 to -0.0033 for hypomethylated beta values. As noted above, we did observe an overlap in DMCs between cell types. Thus, we observed an average of 11.05% overlapping DMCs between two or more cell types but we did not observe any DMCs shared between all four cell types. We have added additional text on page 9 and new Supplementary files 1-5 to now more clearly describe that this limited similarity in direct overlap of DMCs was the underlying motivation for the analysis described in Figure 2. Finally, the enrichment dot plots shown in Figure 2 provide the information the reviewer requested regarding the %5mC observed at different annotated genomic element types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The investigators correlate the number of DMCs in a given cell type with the presence of estrogen receptors. Does the correlation extend to the methylation difference (delta beta) at the statistically different probes?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in a new Supplementary file 7 â We have added a new Supplementary file 7 in which we provide data addressing this question. In brief, we find that the delta betas of probes enriched at enhancer regions and associated with relative proximity to ERE elements in Sertoli cells, granulosa cells, and iPSCs appear very similar to those associated with DMCs not located within these enriched regions. However, when we compared the similarity of the two data sets with goodness of fit tests, we found these relatively small differences were, in fact, statistically significant based on a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. These observed significant differences appear to indicate that there is higher variability among the delta betas associated with hypomethylated, but not hypermethylation changes occurring at DMCs associated with enhancers, potentially suggesting a greater tendency for exposure to BPS to induce hypomethylation rather than hypermethylation changes, at least in these specific regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Methylation changes relative to EREs are presented in multiple figures. Are other sequences enriched in the DMCs?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in a new Supplementary file 11. We profiled the genomic sequence within 500 bp of cell type-specific enriched DMCs that were either associated with enhancer regions in Sertoli, granulosa, or iPS cells or transcription factor binding sites in PGCLCs for the identification of higher abundance motif sequences. We then compared any motifs identified with the JASPAR database to potentially find transcription factors that could be binding to these regions. Interestingly we found that the two most common motifs across all cell types were associated with either the chromatin remodeling transcription factor HMG1A or the pluripotency factor KLF4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Please present a correlation plot between the methylation differences and the adjacent DEGs. Again, the absence of consideration of the absolute changes in methylation and gene expression minimizes the impact of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on pages 6, 7, and 17 and in a new Supplementary file 6 â We analyzed the relationship between DMCs at DEGs promoter regions and the corresponding change in expression of that DEG. Our data support a relationship between up-regulated genes showing decreased methylation in promoter regions and down-regulated genes showing increased methylation at promoter regions, although there were some exceptions to this relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) EM-Seq is mentioned in Figure 7 and in the material and methods. Where is it used in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed on page 22 â We now note in the text on page 22 that EM-seq was used during experiments assessing the propagation of BPS-induced epimutations during the iPSC Ã  EpiLC Ã  PGCLC cell state transitions to gather higher resolution data of changes to DNA methylation differences at the whole-epigenome level.</p><p>References</p><p>Brenker C, Rehfeld A, Schiffer C, Kierzek M, Kaupp UB, SkakkebÃ¦k NE, StrÃ¼nker T. 2018.
