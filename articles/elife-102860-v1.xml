Because continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) captures multidimensional features of glucose regulation beyond average glycemia, we evaluated whether CGM-derived indices better predict coronary plaque vulnerability than conventional measures.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We examined associations between CGM-derived indices and coronary plaque vulnerability assessed by virtual histology–intravascular ultrasound, focusing on the necrotic core (%NC) in humans. We analyzed 14 CGM-derived indices, including average daily risk ratio (ADRR) and autocorrelation-based metrics (AC_Mean and AC_Var), alongside commonly used measures, such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and 120 min plasma glucose during oral glucose tolerance testing (PG120). Factor analysis was used to identify latent components underlying glucose dynamics and to relate these components to %NC. Findings were validated across independent datasets from Japan (n=64), the United States (n=53), and China (n=100).</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>CGM-derived indices, particularly ADRR and AC_Var, demonstrated stronger predictive capability for %NC than FBG, HbA1c, and PG120. Factor analysis identified three independent components of glucose dynamics: mean, variance, and autocorrelation, each showing an independent association with %NC. ADRR reflected both mean and variance components, whereas AC_Var primarily captured the autocorrelation component. In contrast, FBG, HbA1c, and PG120 primarily reflected the mean component alone and were, therefore, insufficient for %NC prediction.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>CGM-derived indices reflecting the three components of glucose dynamics can serve as more effective screening tools for CAD risk assessment, complementing or possibly replacing traditional diabetes diagnostic methods.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI (JP21H04759), CREST, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) (JPMJCR2123), The Uehara Memorial Foundation, and The Takeda Science Foundation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>continuous glucose monitoring</kwd><kwd>coronary plaque</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hhkn466</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP21H04759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuroda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00097mb19</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.52926/jpmjcr2123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuroda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00gc20a07</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuroda</surname><given-names>Shinya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02y123g31</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>Hikaru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mean, variance, and autocorrelation of glucose dynamics are independently associated with coronary plaque vulnerability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects more than 400 million people globally, and coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major driver of morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs among individuals with type 2 DM (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bax et al., 2007</xref>). Various prognostic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiarni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ravaut et al., 2021</xref>) and diagnostic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bax et al., 2007</xref>) for CAD have been developed; however, population-level screening remains imperfect, often being ineffective, costly, or labor-intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bax et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Young et al., 2009</xref>). There is a need for scalable approaches that can identify individuals at the highest risk using easily accessible clinical information.</p><p>Blood glucose levels are among the readily obtained predictors of the complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Psoma et al., 2024</xref>). The disrupted conditions of glucose dynamics seen in impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2DM are partly characterized by high concentrations of blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>). High concentrations of blood glucose levels have been defined as having high hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, and plasma glucose concentration at 120 min during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (PG120) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>). These indices, especially HbA1c, are associated with complications of T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Selvin et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have shown that glucose variability, in addition to absolute glucose concentration, significantly contributes to the prognosis of complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerbaud et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Psoma et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Su et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>) and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2023</xref>). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can estimate short-term glycemic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Service, 2013</xref>) and has been reported to predict T2DM complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Standard deviation (Std) of glucose levels (CGM_Std), mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), mean of daily difference (MODD), and continuous overlapping net glycemic action (CONGA) are established indices of glycemic variability, of which CGM_Std and MAGE are more highly correlated with coronary plaque properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>). Among glucose level-related indices, including HbA1c and FBG, MAGE is an independent determinant of coronary plaque instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Okada et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Other CGM-derived indices, such as average daily risk ratio (ADRR), lability index (LI), J-index, mean absolute glucose (MAG), and glycemic risk assessment in diabetes equation (GRADE) have also been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2011</xref>). We recently showed that AC_Mean and AC_Var, which are calculated from the autocorrelation function of glucose levels measured by CGM, can detect decreased abilities in glucose regulation that cannot be captured by FBG, HbA1c, or the other conventional CGM-derived indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>). The characteristics of glucose dynamics can also be estimated from insulin concentrations. The disposition index (DI), which is the product of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, reflects and predicts glycemic disability beyond FBG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Utzschneider et al., 2009</xref>). Several other glucose-related indices and the relationship between the indices have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fabris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keshet et al., 2023</xref>). Despite these advances, a comprehensive understanding of how these various indices can be optimally combined to predict T2DM complications, particularly CAD, remains elusive. Furthermore, the underlying factors that these indices represent and their individual associations with CAD remain to be fully elucidated.</p><p>This study aims to address these knowledge gaps through three objectives: (i) to determine which clinical parameters are effective predictors of coronary plaque vulnerability; (ii) to identify the factors underlying these indices; and (iii) to elucidate how these factors are associated with coronary plaque vulnerability. We investigated the characteristics of 14 CGM-derived indices: 12 relatively well-known CGM-derived indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2011</xref>) and 2 indices (AC_Mean and AC_Var), as well as OGTT-derived indices, and investigated the relationship between these parameters and coronary plaque vulnerability assessed by virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS). We showed that three factors, namely, mean, variance, and autocorrelation, underlie blood glucose level-related indices, and that the three are independently associated with coronary plaque vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mean, standard deviation, and autocorrelation function of glucose levels independently contribute to the prediction of coronary plaque vulnerability</title><p>We previously showed that AC_Var, a measure derived from the autocorrelation function of CGM time series, detects impaired glucose handling that is not reflected by the CGM-derived mean (CGM_Mean) or standard deviation (CGM_Std) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>). Based on the study, we hypothesized that AC_Var could identify individuals with high %NC, a widely used parameter of plaque vulnerability, independently from CGM_Mean and CGM_Std. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a multiple regression analysis with CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var as input variables and %NC as the objective variable using a previously described dataset consisting of 8 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 16 with IGT, and 29 with T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The variance inflation factors (VIFs) for CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var were 1.1, 1.1, and 1.0, respectively, indicating low multicollinearity among these variables. The regression model including CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var to predict %NC achieved an R² of 0.36 and an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 321. Each of these indices showed a statistically significant independent positive correlation with %NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, the model using conventional glycemic markers (FBG, HbA1c, and PG120) yielded an R² of only 0.05 and an AIC of 340 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, the model using the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilson et al., 1998</xref>) showed limited predictive value, with an R² of 0.04 and an AIC of 330 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Collectively, these results indicate that CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var provide complementary and independent information for predicting coronary plaque vulnerability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relations among clinical measures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multiple regression analysis between necrotic core (%NC) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)_Mean, CGM_Std, and autocorrelation (AC)_Var.

We further show that traditional diabetes diagnostics rely on indices, such as FBG, PG120, and HbA1c that primarily reflect only the mean component, and that incorporating all three components significantly improves the prediction of coronary plaque vulnerability. This result is partially consistent with a previous notion that glucose dynamics include two components: amplitude and timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cobelli and Facchinetti, 2018</xref>). Given our previous study demonstrating that AC_Var, an index reflecting autocorrelation, identifies impaired glucose regulation independently of CGM-derived indices representing mean and variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>), CGM-derived indices incorporating all three components may outperform conventional diabetes diagnostics in predicting both glycemic control capacity and coronary plaque vulnerability.</p><p>We also showed that CGM-derived indices, especially ADRR and AC_Var, contribute to the prediction of %NC by using LASSO and PLS. Given that the definition equation for ADRR is affected by both high and low concentrations of blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2011</xref>), it is likely affected by both the mean and variance components. Factor analysis confirmed that ADRR was included in both factor 1 (mean) and factor 2 (variance). Since three factors, mean, variance, and autocorrelation, contribute independently to the prediction of the complication, it would be useful to examine ADRR, which is influenced by both mean and variance, and AC_Var, which is influenced by autocorrelation, in predicting %NC with a minimal number of variables.</p><p>This study also provided evidence that autocorrelation can vary independently from the mean and variance components using simulated data. In addition, simulated glucose dynamics indicated that even individuals with high AC_Var did not necessarily have high maximum and minimum blood glucose levels. This study also indicated that these three components qualitatively corresponded to the four distinct glucose patterns observed after glucose administration, which were identified in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hulman et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the inclusion of autocorrelation in addition to mean and variance may improve the characterization of inter-individual differences in glucose regulation and improve the predictive accuracy of various clinical outcomes.</p><p>Despite increasing evidence linking glycemic variability to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in T2DM complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ceriello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Monnier et al., 2008</xref>), the biological mechanisms underlying the independent predictive value of autocorrelation remain to be elucidated. Our previous work has shown that glucose autocorrelation is influenced by insulin clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>), a process known to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Randrianarisoa et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the molecular pathways linking glucose autocorrelation to cardiovascular disease may share common mechanisms with those linking insulin clearance to cardiovascular disease. Although previous studies have primarily focused on investigating the molecular mechanisms associated with mean glucose levels and glycemic variability, our findings open new avenues for exploring the molecular basis of glucose autocorrelation, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets for preventing diabetic complications.</p><p>The current study had several limitations. Although our LASSO and factor analysis indicated that CGM-derived measures were strong predictors of %NC, this does not mean that other clinical parameters, such as lipids and blood pressure, are irrelevant in T2DM complications. Our study specifically focused on characterizing glucose dynamics, and we analyzed individuals with well-controlled serum cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce confounding effects. While we anticipate that inclusion of a more diverse population would not alter our primary findings regarding glucose dynamics, it is likely that a broader data set would reveal additional predictive contributions from lipid and blood pressure parameters. In our analysis of demographic factors, we found that age and gender had minimal influence on glucose dynamics characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that our findings regarding the relationship between glucose dynamics and coronary risk are robust across different demographic groups within our dataset. Future studies involving larger and more diverse populations would be valuable to comprehensively elucidate the potential influence of age, gender, and other demographic factors on glucose dynamics characteristics and their relationship to cardiovascular risk.</p><p>A previous study identified components of interday variability and hypoglycemia in CGM-derived indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Augstein et al., 2015</xref>) that were not observed in our analysis. This discrepancy may be due to the relatively small number of T2DM individuals in our study. We acknowledge that factor analyses of data from longer measurement periods, including more patients with T1DM and T2DM, could potentially yield different results. However, it is noteworthy that our analysis of longer-term CGM data sets from Japanese and American populations confirmed the existence of the same three factors - mean, variance, and autocorrelation - in glucose dynamics. Moreover, even with the short measurement period, CGM-derived indices reflecting these three factors demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for %NC compared to traditional indices, such as FBG, HbA1c, and PG120, underscoring the potential utility of CGM. Although time in range (TIR) was not included in the main analyses due to the relatively small number of T2DM patients and the predominance of participants with TIR &gt;70%, our results demonstrate that CGM-derived indices outperformed conventional markers, such as FBG, HbA1c, and PG120 in predicting %NC. Furthermore, multiple regression analysis between factor scores and TIR revealed that only factor 1 (mean) and factor 2 (variance) were significantly associated with TIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). This finding confirms the presence of three distinct components in glucose dynamics and highlights the added value of examining AC_Var as an independent glycemic feature beyond conventional CGM-derived measures. Some indices, such as HBGI, showed variation in classification across datasets, with some populations showing higher factor loadings in the ‘mean’ component and others in the ‘variance’ component. This variation occurs because HBGI calculations depend on the number of glucose readings above a threshold. In populations where mean glucose levels are predominantly below this threshold, the HBGI is more sensitive to glucose variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Conversely, in populations with a wider range of mean glucose levels, the HBGI correlates more strongly with mean glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Despite these differences, our validation analyses confirm that CGM-derived indices consistently cluster into three components: mean, variance, and autocorrelation.</p><p>We acknowledge the potential concern of multiple testing in our study. However, even after adjusting for multiple comparisons, the CGM-derived indices retained significant correlations with %NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The consistency of our findings across different analytical approaches (Lasso, PLS, and factor analysis) and different data sets further supports the robustness of our conclusions regarding the characteristics of glucose dynamics. While we used methods that assume linearity, such as LASSO, we also examined nonlinear relationships using Spearman’s correlation for index relationships and factor loadings with %NC and found significant associations. We acknowledge that some significant correlations appear to be relatively small. However, these findings, combined with our predictive models showing improved accuracy using CGM compared to traditional diabetes diagnostic indices, and the theoretical framework showing that conventional markers only consider the ‘mean’ component of glucose dynamics, can demonstrate the clinical significance. Although our analysis included four datasets with a total of 270 individuals, and our sample size of 53 met the required threshold based on power calculations with a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4, we acknowledge that the sample size may still be considered relatively small for a comprehensive assessment of these relationships. To further validate these findings, larger prospective studies with diverse populations are needed. While CGM-derived indices, such as AC_Var and ADRR hold promise for CAD risk assessment, their complexity may present challenges for routine clinical implementation. To improve usability, we have developed a web-based calculator that automates these calculations. However, defining clinically relevant thresholds and reference ranges requires further validation in larger cohorts.</p><p>In conclusion, glucose dynamics have three components: mean, variance, and autocorrelation. These three components are associated with coronary plaque vulnerability. CGM-derived indices reflecting these three components can be valuable predictive tools for T2DM complications, compared to conventional diabetes diagnostic markers reflecting only the mean component. This new predictive model has the potential to improve the diagnosis and management of diabetes worldwide. To facilitate this CGM-derived prediction, we created a web application that performs a multiple regression model with these three components as input variables (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cgmregressionapp2.streamlit.app/">https://cgmregressionapp2.streamlit.app/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SciPy v1.10.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_008058">SCR_008058</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">scikit-learn v1.0.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_002577">SCR_002577</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and population</title><p>This retrospective observational study was approved by the ethics committee of Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine (UMIN000018326; Kobe, Japan), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study included 53 participants who underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with the use of an iPro2 CGM system (Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During PCI, VH-IVUS was carried out to assess the plaque components. All individuals underwent CGM for at least three consecutive days within the seven-day period prior to the PCI procedure.</p><p>Among the 53 participants, eight, 16, and 29 individuals were categorized as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and T2DM, respectively. Of note, with a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4, a sample size of 47 was required to detect a significant difference from zero in the correlation coefficient. T2DM was defined as HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG)  ≥ 126  mg/dL, or 2 hr plasma glucose during a 75 g OGTT (PG120)  ≥ 200  mg/dL. IGT was defined as HbA1c 6.0–6.4%, FPG 110–125  mg/dL, or PG120 140–199  mg/dL. NGT was defined as values below all prediabetes thresholds (HbA1c &lt; 6.0%, FPG  &lt; 110  mg/dL and PG120  &lt; 140  mg/dL).</p><p>Detailed participant characteristics have been reported in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, participants aged 20–80 years with LDL-C levels &lt;120 mg/dL under statin administration or &lt;100 mg/dL under other treatments for dyslipidemia, including lifestyle intervention, were included in this study. Participants with acute coronary syndrome, unsuitable anatomy for VH-IVUS, poor imaging by VH-IVUS, hemodialysis, inflammatory disease, shock, low cardiac output, or concurrent malignant disease were excluded from this study.</p><p>To validate the findings on glucose dynamics, a previously reported data set from Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>) was analyzed. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kobe University Hospital (approval number 1834). Briefly, individuals aged ≥20 years with no previous diagnosis of diabetes were recruited from Kobe University Hospital between January 2016 and March 2018. Exclusion criteria included the use of medications that affect glucose metabolism (e.g. steroids, β-blockers), psychiatric disorders, pregnancy or lactation, and ineligibility as determined by treating physicians. Participants wore a CGM device (iPro; Medtronic, USA). The study included 52 individuals with NGT, nine with IGT, and three with T2DM.</p><p>Further validation of the glucose dynamics findings was performed using a previously reported CGM dataset (Dexcom G4 CGM System; Dexcom, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA) obtained in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall et al., 2018</xref>). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board (IRB 37141). The study included 53 individuals aged 30–70 years with a BMI of 23–40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria included prior diagnosis of diabetes, major organ diseases, uncontrolled hypertension, malignancy, chronic inflammatory conditions, use of any medications known to alter blood glucose or insulin sensitivity, haematocrit &lt;30, creatinine above the normal range, and ALT levels more than twice the upper limit of normal.</p><p>In addition, the present study analyzed a previously reported CGM (FreeStyle Libre H, Abbott Diabetes Care, Witney, UK) dataset from China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). Participants were recruited from the DiaDRIL registry at Shanghai East Hospital (September 2019 to March 2021) and Shanghai Fourth People’s Hospital (June 2021 to November 2021). Inclusion criteria for this dataset were: diagnosis of diabetes according to the 1999 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, age 18 years or older, willingness to provide informed consent, and CGM recording for at least three days. Exclusion criteria included reported alcohol or drug abuse, inability to comply with study protocols, or inability to participate as determined by the investigators. We extracted and analyzed glucose profile characteristics from the first three days of CGM data for each participant. 100 individuals with T2DM were analyzed in this study. Our primary objective was to explore the relationship between the CGM-derived indices and the presence of diabetic macrovascular complications. Of note, as the original reports document, the validation datasets did not specify explicit cutoffs for blood pressure or cholesterol. Consequently, they included participants with suboptimal control of these parameters.</p><p>The data collection protocol for the Chinese dataset was previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, trained research staff used standardized questionnaires to collect demographic and clinical information, including diabetes diagnosis, treatment history, comorbidities, and medication use. CGM records interstitial glucose levels at 15 min intervals for up to 14 days. Laboratory measurements, including metabolic panels, lipid profiles, and renal function tests, were obtained within six months of CGM placement. While previous studies have linked necrotic cores to macrovascular events, we acknowledge the limitations of the cardiovascular outcomes in the Chinese data set. These outcomes were extracted from medical records rather than from standardized diagnostic procedures or imaging studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Calculation of clinical indices</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>CGM-derived indices</title><p>The CGM data collected in this study were obtained at different sampling frequencies in the different data sets. For the two Japanese datasets and the American dataset, glucose measurements were collected at 5 min intervals. In contrast, the Chinese dataset collected glucose measurements at 15 min intervals.</p><p>Fourteen CGM-derived indices were evaluated in this study: twelve well-established CGM-derived indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2011</xref>) and two indices (AC_Mean and AC_Var) that have been reported to capture glucose handling capacity independently of the aforementioned twelve indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>). For the datasets with 5 min sampling intervals (the two Japanese datasets and the American dataset), AC_Mean and AC_Var were calculated as the mean and variance of the autocorrelation functions at lags 1–30 of the glucose levels, respectively. Of note, autocorrelation refers to the relationship between a variable and its past values over time. In the context of glucose dynamics, it reflects how current glucose levels are influenced by past levels, capturing patterns, such as sustained hyperglycemia or recurrent fluctuations. For example, if an individual experiences sustained high glucose levels after a meal, the strong correlation between successive glucose readings indicates high autocorrelation. For the data set with 15 min sampling intervals (the Chinese data set), AC_Mean and AC_Var were calculated as the mean and variance of the autocorrelation functions at lags 1–10 of the glucose levels, respectively. These calculations correspond to a time window of 150 min. CGM_Mean and CGM_Std indicate the mean value and standard deviation of glucose levels measured by CGM, respectively. CONGA, LI, JINDEX, HBGI, GRADE, MODD, MAGE, ADRR, MVALUE, and MAG were calculated using EasyGV software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2011</xref>). The calculating formulae of these indices are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>In the two Japanese datasets and the American dataset, there was a relatively small proportion of T2DM patients and a substantial number of individuals with time in range (TIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battelino et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larkin et al., 2019</xref>) values (glucose levels between 70 and 180 mg/dL) greater than 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sugimoto et al., 2025</xref>). Given this distribution, we decided not to include TIR in our primary analyses. However, given the potential interest of this metric, we provided correlations between TIR and other indices as supplementary information.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>OGTT-derived indices</title><p>Three OGTT-derived indices were calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsuda and DeFronzo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>). The insulinogenic index (I.I.) indicates insulin secretion and is calculated from the ratio of the increment of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) to that of plasma glucose at 30 min after onset of the OGTT. The composite index indicates insulin sensitivity, which can be calculated from fasting plasma glucose, fasting IRI, mean blood glucose levels, and mean serum IRI concentrations during the OGTT. The oral disposition index (Oral DI) was calculated from the product of the composite index and the ratio of the area under the insulin concentration curve from 0 to 120 min to that for plasma glucose from 0 to 120 min, without using the data measured at 90 min, in the OGTT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>VH-IVUS-derived index</title><p>VH-IVUS was carried out using the Eagle Eye Platinum 3.5-Fr 20-MHz catheter (Volcano, Rancho Cordova, CA, USA), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>). The intraclass correlation coefficients for interobserver and intraobserver reliability of external elastic membrane volume were 0.95 and 0.97, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Otowa‐Suematsu et al., 2018</xref>), indicating high reproducibility. The VH-IVUS categorized plaque into four components: fibrous, fibrofatty, necrotic core, and dense calcium. Following the previous study, our investigation focused specifically on the ratio of necrotic core to total plaque volume (%NC), a widely used parameter of plaque vulnerability. For patients with multiple plaques, the mean %NC was calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Prediction models and statistical analyses</title><p>We modelled %NC using multiple linear regression, LASSO regression, and PLS regression. The input variables in these models included the following 26 variables: BMI, SBP, DBP, TGs, LDL-C, HDL-C, FBG, HbA1c, PG120, I.I., composite index, oral DI, CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, CONGA, LI, JINDEX, HBGI, GRADE, MODD, MAGE, ADRR, MVALUE, MAG, AC_Mean, and AC_Var. In conducting these models, z-score normalization on each input variable was performed.</p><p>The predictive performance of multiple linear regression was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), the adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), or AIC. The multicollinearity of the input variables was estimated by VIF. LASSO regression is a kind of linear regression with L1 regularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tibshirani, 1996</xref>). The optimal regularization coefficient, lambda, was based on leave-one-out cross-validation and mean-squared error (MSE). The importance of the input variables in predicting %NC was evaluated by the VIP scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wold et al., 2001</xref>) that were generated from PLS regression. LASSO regression was chosen for its ability to perform feature selection by identifying the most relevant predictors. Unlike Ridge regression, which simply shrinks coefficients toward zero without reaching exactly zero, LASSO produces sparse models, which is consistent with our goal of identifying the most critical features of glucose dynamics associated with coronary plaque vulnerability. In addition, we implemented PLS regression as a complementary approach due to its effectiveness in dealing with multicollinearity, which was particularly relevant given the high correlation among several CGM-derived measures. These models were conducted using scikit-learn v1.0.2, a Python-based toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/</ext-link>).</p><p>Relationships among indices were also evaluated using Spearman’s correlation coefficients (<italic>r</italic>), and the correlation coefficients were reported with 95% CIs through bootstrap resampling.

BIC and MAP methods were used to determine the number of underlying factors. Variables with absolute factor loadings of ≥0.30 were used in interpretation. To improve the interpretation, orthogonal (varimax) rotation was used. To evaluate the applicability of the factor analysis, KMO and Bartlett’s spherical test were performed. To evaluate the internal consistency of each factor, Cronbach’s α and item–total correlations were calculated. The association of the factor scores with %NC was assessed using Spearman’s correlation.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted using a method that combines a Euclidean distance measure and Ward linkage. I.I., composite index, oral DI, and AC_Mean were inverted negatively so that the value of indices increased in individuals with abnormalities.

Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a better ability to predict %NC from 3 selected CGM derived features than 3 selected clinical phenotypes. LASSO regularization and partial least squares (PLS) with VIP scores were used to identify 4 CGM features that most contribute to the precision of %NC. Using factor analysis they identify 3 components that have CGM related features: value (relating to the value of blood glucose), variability (relating to glucose variability), and autocorrelation (composed of the two autocorrelation features). These three groupings appeared in the 3 validation cohorts and when performing hierarchical clustering. To demonstrate how these three features change, a simulation was created to allow the user to examine these features under different conditions.</p><p>Summary of Revision 1.

The revised manuscript now includes explicit pairwise correlations, clarified p- and q-value reporting, and better visualization of key associations between CGM indices and %NC. The justification for LASSO and PLS use is now well explained, and additional details on cohort timing relative to PCI, validation dataset structure, and statistical robustness (e.g., VIP stability with covariates) address prior concerns.

Although the generalizability of the results needs further investigation due to the limited sample size and validation cohort limitations, this study makes several notable contributions: validation of autocorrelation as a new clinical indicator, theoretical support through mathematical modeling, and development of a web application for practical implementation. These contributions are likely to attract broad interest from researchers in both diabetology and cardiology and may suggest the potential for a new approach to glucose monitoring that goes beyond conventional glycemic control indicators in clinical practice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The most notable strength of this study is the identification of three independent elements in glycemic dynamics: value, variability, and autocorrelation. In particular, the metric of autocorrelation, which has not been captured by conventional glycemic control indices, may bring a new perspective for understanding glycemic dynamics. In terms of methodological aspects, the study uses an analytical approach combining various statistical methods such as factor analysis, LASSO, and PLS regression, and enhances the reliability of results through theoretical validation using mathematical models and validation in other cohorts. In addition, the practical aspect of the research results, such as the development of a Web application, is also an important contribution to clinical implementation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer #1 for the positive assessment and for the valuable and constructive comments on our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The most significant weakness of this study is the relatively small sample size of 53 study subjects. This sample size limitation leads to a lack of statistical power, especially in subgroup analyses, and to limitations in the assessment of rare events.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the sample size. We acknowledge that a larger sample size would increase statistical power, especially for subgroup analyses and the assessment of rare events.</p><p>We would like to clarify several points regarding the statistical power and validation of our findings. Our sample size determination followed established methodological frameworks, including the guidelines outlined by Muyembe Asenahabi, Bostely, and Peters Anselemo Ikoha. “Scientific research sample size determination.” (2023). These guidelines balance the risks of inadequate sample size with the challenges of unnecessarily large samples. For our primary analysis examining the correlation between CGM-derived measures and %NC, power calculations (a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4) indicated that a minimum of 47 participants was required. Our sample size of 53 exceeded this threshold and allowed us to detect statistically significant correlations, as described in the Methods section. Moreover, to provide transparency about the precision of our estimates, we have included confidence intervals for all coefficients.</p><p>Furthermore, our sample size aligns with previous studies investigating the associations between glucose profiles and clinical parameters, including Torimoto, Keiichi, et al. “Relationship between fluctuations in glucose levels measured by continuous glucose monitoring and vascular endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus.” Cardiovascular Diabetology 12 (2013): 1-7. (n=57), Hall, Heather, et al. “Glucotypes reveal new patterns of glucose dysregulation.” PLoS biology 16.7 (2018): e2005143. (n=57), and Metwally, Ahmed A., et al. “Prediction of metabolic subphenotypes of type 2 diabetes via continuous glucose monitoring and machine learning.” Nature Biomedical Engineering (2024): 1-18. (n=32).</p><p>Furthermore, the primary objective of our study was not to assess rare events, but rather to demonstrate that glucose dynamics can be decomposed into three main factors - mean, variance and autocorrelation - whereas traditional measures have primarily captured mean and variance without adequately reflecting autocorrelation. We believe that our current sample size effectively addresses this objective.</p><p>Regarding the classification of glucose dynamics components, we have conducted additional validation across diverse populations including 64 Japanese, 53 American, and 100 Chinese individuals. These validation efforts have consistently supported our identification of three independent glucose dynamics components.</p><p>However, we acknowledge the importance of further validation on a larger scale. To address this, we conducted a large follow-up study of over 8,000 individuals (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Stratification of individuals without prior diagnosis of diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring” medRxiv (2025)), which confirmed our main finding that glucose dynamics consist of mean, variance, and autocorrelation. As this large study was beyond the scope of the present manuscript due to differences in primary objectives and analytical approaches, it was not included in this paper; however, it provides further support for the clinical relevance and generalizability of our findings.</p><p>To address the sample size considerations, we have added the following sentences in the Discussion section (lines 409-414):</p><p>Although our analysis included four datasets with a total of 270 individuals, and our sample size of 53 met the required threshold based on power calculations with a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4, we acknowledge that the sample size may still be considered relatively small for a comprehensive assessment of these relationships. To further validate these findings, larger prospective studies with diverse populations are needed.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback and believe that these clarifications improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of validation, several challenges exist, including geographical and ethnic biases in the validation cohorts, lack of long-term follow-up data, and insufficient validation across different clinical settings. In terms of data representativeness, limiting factors include the inclusion of only subjects with well-controlled serum cholesterol and blood pressure and the use of only short-term measurement data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the challenges associated with validation. In terms of geographic and ethnic diversity, our study includes validation datasets from diverse populations, including 64 Japanese, 53 American and 100 Chinese individuals. These datasets include a wide range of metabolic states, from healthy individuals to those with diabetes, ensuring validation across different clinical conditions. In addition, we recognize the limited availability of publicly available datasets with sufficient sample sizes for factor decomposition that include both healthy individuals and those with type 2 diabetes (Zhao, Qinpei, et al. “Chinese diabetes datasets for data-driven machine learning.” Scientific Data 10.1 (2023): 35.). The main publicly available datasets with relevant clinical characteristics have already been analyzed in this study using unbiased approaches.</p><p>However, we fully agree with the reviewer that expanding the geographic and ethnic scope, including long-term follow-up data, and validation in different clinical settings would further strengthen the robustness and generalizability of our findings. To address this, we conducted a large follow-up study of over 8,000 individuals with two years of follow-up (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Stratification of individuals without prior diagnosis of diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring” medRxiv (2025)), which confirmed our main finding that glucose dynamics consist of mean, variance, and autocorrelation. As this large study was beyond the scope of the present manuscript due to differences in primary objectives and analytical approaches, it was not included in this paper; however, it provides further support for the clinical relevance and generalizability of our findings.</p><p>Regarding the validation considerations, we have added the following sentences to the Discussion section (lines 409-414, 354-361):</p><p>Although our analysis included four datasets with a total of 270 individuals, and our sample size of 53 met the required threshold based on power calculations with a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4, we acknowledge that the sample size may still be considered relatively small for a comprehensive assessment of these relationships. To further validate these findings, larger prospective studies with diverse populations are needed.</p><p>Although our LASSO and factor analysis indicated that CGM-derived measures were strong predictors of %NC, this does not mean that other clinical parameters, such as lipids and blood pressure, are irrelevant in T2DM complications. Our study specifically focused on characterizing glucose dynamics, and we analyzed individuals with well-controlled serum cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce confounding effects. While we anticipate that inclusion of a more diverse population would not alter our primary findings regarding glucose dynamics, it is likely that a broader data set would reveal additional predictive contributions from lipid and blood pressure parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of elucidation of physical mechanisms, the study is not sufficient to elucidate the mechanisms linking autocorrelation and clinical outcomes or to verify them at the cellular or molecular level.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point regarding the need for further elucidation of the physical mechanisms linking glucose autocorrelation to clinical outcomes. We fully agree with the reviewer that the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this relationship are not yet fully understood, as noted in our Discussion section.</p><p>However, we would like to emphasize the theoretical basis that supports the clinical relevance of autocorrelation. Our results show that glucose profiles with identical mean and variability can exhibit different autocorrelation patterns, highlighting that conventional measures such as mean or variance alone may not fully capture inter-individual metabolic differences. Incorporating autocorrelation analysis provides a more comprehensive characterization of metabolic states. Consequently, incorporating autocorrelation measures alongside traditional diabetes diagnostic criteria - such as fasting glucose, HbA1c and PG120, which primarily reflect only the “mean” component - can improve predictive accuracy for various clinical outcomes. While further research at the cellular and molecular level is needed to fully validate these findings, it is important to note that the primary goal of this study was to analyze the characteristics of glucose dynamics and gain new insights into metabolism, rather than to perform molecular biology experiments.</p><p>Furthermore, our previous research has shown that glucose autocorrelation reflects changes in insulin clearance (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Improved detection of decreased glucose handling capacities via continuous glucose monitoring-derived indices.” Communications Medicine 5.1 (2025): 103.). The relationship between insulin clearance and cardiovascular disease has been well documented (Randrianarisoa, Elko, et al. “Reduced insulin clearance is linked to subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.” Scientific reports 10.1 (2020): 22453.), and the mechanisms described in this prior work may potentially explain the association between glucose autocorrelation and clinical outcomes observed in the present study.</p><p>Rather than a limitation, we view these currently unexplored associations as an opportunity for further research. The identification of autocorrelation as a key glycemic feature introduces a new dimension to metabolic regulation that could serve as the basis for future investigations exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying these patterns.</p><p>While we agree that further research at the cellular and molecular level is needed to fully validate these findings, we believe that our study provides a theoretical framework to support the clinical utility of autocorrelation analysis in glucose monitoring, and that this could serve as the basis for future investigations exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying these autocorrelation patterns, which adds to the broad interest of this study. Regarding the physical mechanisms linking autocorrelation and clinical outcomes, we have added the following sentences in the Discussion section (lines 331-339, 341-352):</p><p>This study also provided evidence that autocorrelation can vary independently from the mean and variance components using simulated data. In addition, simulated glucose dynamics indicated that even individuals with high AC_Var did not necessarily have high maximum and minimum blood glucose levels. This study also indicated that these three components qualitatively corresponded to the four distinct glucose patterns observed after glucose administration, which were identified in a previous study (Hulman et al., 2018). Thus, the inclusion of autocorrelation in addition to mean and variance may improve the characterization of inter-individual differences in glucose regulation and improve the predictive accuracy of various clinical outcomes.</p><p>Despite increasing evidence linking glycemic variability to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in T2DM complications (Ceriello et al., 2008; Monnier et al., 2008), the biological mechanisms underlying the independent predictive value of autocorrelation remain to be elucidated. Our previous work has shown that glucose autocorrelation is influenced by insulin clearance (Sugimoto et al., 2025), a process known to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk (Randrianarisoa et al., 2020). Therefore, the molecular pathways linking glucose autocorrelation to cardiovascular disease may share common mechanisms with those linking insulin clearance to cardiovascular disease. Although previous studies have primarily focused on investigating the molecular mechanisms associated with mean glucose levels and glycemic variability, our findings open new avenues for exploring the molecular basis of glucose autocorrelation, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets for preventing diabetic complications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for the critical review of the manuscript and the valuable comments.

Regarding the physical mechanisms linking autocorrelation and clinical outcomes, we have added the following sentences in the Discussion section (lines 331-339, 341-352):</p><p>This study also provided evidence that autocorrelation can vary independently from the mean and variance components using simulated data. In addition, simulated glucose dynamics indicated that even individuals with high AC_Var did not necessarily have high maximum and minimum blood glucose levels. This study also indicated that these three components qualitatively corresponded to the four distinct glucose patterns observed after glucose administration, which were identified in a previous study (Hulman et al., 2018). Thus, the inclusion of autocorrelation in addition to mean and variance may improve the characterization of inter-individual differences in glucose regulation and improve the predictive accuracy of various clinical outcomes.</p><p>Despite increasing evidence linking glycemic variability to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in T2DM complications (Ceriello et al., 2008; Monnier et al., 2008), the biological mechanisms underlying the independent predictive value of autocorrelation remain to be elucidated. Our previous work has shown that glucose autocorrelation is influenced by insulin clearance (Sugimoto et al., 2025), a process known to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk (Randrianarisoa et al., 2020). Therefore, the molecular pathways linking glucose autocorrelation to cardiovascular disease may share common mechanisms with those linking insulin clearance to cardiovascular disease. Although previous studies have primarily focused on investigating the molecular mechanisms associated with mean glucose levels and glycemic variability, our findings open new avenues for exploring the molecular basis of glucose autocorrelation, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets for preventing diabetic complications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The relatively small sample size (n=270) limits statistical power, especially when stratified by glucose tolerance levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding sample size and its potential impact on statistical power, especially when stratified by glucose tolerance levels. We fully agree that a larger sample size would increase statistical power, especially for subgroup analyses.</p><p>We would like to clarify several points regarding the statistical power and validation of our findings. Our sample size followed established methodological frameworks, including the guidelines outlined by Muyembe Asenahabi, Bostely, and Peters Anselemo Ikoha. “Scientific research sample size determination.” (2023). These guidelines balance the risks of inadequate sample size with the challenges of unnecessarily large samples. For our primary analysis examining the correlation between CGM-derived measures and %NC, power calculations (a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4) indicated that a minimum of 47 participants was required. Our sample size of 53 exceeded this threshold and allowed us to detect statistically significant correlations, as described in the Methods section. Moreover, to provide transparency about the precision of our estimates, we have included confidence intervals for all coefficients.</p><p>Furthermore, our sample size aligns with previous studies investigating the associations between glucose profiles and clinical parameters, including Torimoto, Keiichi, et al. “Relationship between fluctuations in glucose levels measured by continuous glucose monitoring and vascular endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus.” Cardiovascular Diabetology 12 (2013): 1-7.

To address this, we conducted a large follow-up study of over 8,000 individuals with two years of followup (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Stratification of individuals without prior diagnosis of diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring” medRxiv (2025)), which confirmed our main finding that glucose dynamics consist of mean, variance, and autocorrelation.

To further validate these findings, larger prospective studies with diverse populations are needed.</p><p>Although our LASSO and factor analysis indicated that CGM-derived measures were strong predictors of %NC, this does not mean that other clinical parameters, such as lipids and blood pressure, are irrelevant in T2DM complications. Our study specifically focused on characterizing glucose dynamics, and we analyzed individuals with well-controlled serum cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce confounding effects. While we anticipate that inclusion of a more diverse population would not alter our primary findings regarding glucose dynamics, it is likely that a broader data set would reveal additional predictive contributions from lipid and blood pressure parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) CGM-derived indices like AC_Var and ADRR may be too complex for routine clinical use without simplified models or guidelines.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern about the complexity of CGM-derived indices such as AC_Var and ADRR for routine clinical use. We acknowledge that for these indices to be of practical use, they must be both interpretable and easily accessible to healthcare providers.</p><p>To address this concern, we have developed an easy-to-use web application that automatically calculates these measures, including AC_Var, mean glucose levels, and glucose variability (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cgmregressionapp2.streamlit.app/">https://cgmregressionapp2.streamlit.app/</ext-link>). This tool eliminates the need for manual calculations, making these indices more practical for clinical implementation.</p><p>Regarding interpretability, we acknowledge that establishing specific clinical guidelines would enhance the practical utility of these measures. For example, defining a cut-off value for AC_Var above which the risk of diabetes complications increases significantly would provide clearer clinical guidance. However, given our current sample size limitations and our predefined objective of investigating correlations among indices, we have taken a conservative approach by focusing on the correlation between AC_Var and %NC rather than establishing definitive cutoffs. This approach intentionally avoids problematic statistical practices like phacking. It is not realistic to expect a single study to accomplish everything from proposing a new concept to conducting large-scale clinical trials to establishing clinical guidelines. Establishing clinical guidelines typically requires the accumulation of multiple studies over many years. Recognizing this reality, we have been careful in our manuscript to make modest claims about the discovery of new “correlations” rather than exaggerated claims about immediate routine clinical use.</p><p>To address this limitation, we conducted a large follow-up study of over 8,000 individuals in the next study (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Stratification of individuals without prior diagnosis of diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring” medRxiv (2025)), which proposed clinically relevant cutoffs and reference ranges for AC_Var and other CGM-derived indices.

Given that our study population consisted of individuals with well-controlled total cholesterol and blood pressure levels, a direct comparison with the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease (Wilson, Peter WF, et al. “Prediction of coronary heart disease using risk factor categories.” Circulation 97.18 (1998): 1837-1847.) may introduce inherent bias, as these factors are key components of the score.</p><p>Nevertheless, to further assess the predictive value of the CGM-derived indices, we performed additional analyses using linear regression to predict %NC. Using the Framingham Risk Score, we obtained an R² of 0.04 and an Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of 330.

In contrast, the model using conventional glycemic markers (FBG, HbA1c, and PG120) yielded an R² of only 0.05 and an AIC of 340 (Fig. 1B).

We have carefully considered the reviewer’s comments and have revised our manuscript accordingly. The reviewer’s comments in this letter are in Bold and Italics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a retrospective analysis of 53 individuals over 26 features (12 clinical phenotypes, 12 CGM features, and 2 autocorrelation features) to examine which features were most informative in predicting percent necrotic core (%NC) as a parameter for coronary plaque vulnerability. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a better ability to predict %NC from 3 selected CGM-derived features than 3 selected clinical phenotypes. LASSO regularization and partial least squares (PLS) with VIP scores were used to identify 4 CGM features that most contribute to the precision of %NC. Using factor analysis they identify 3 components that have CGM-related features: value (relating to the value of blood glucose), variability (relating to glucose variability), and autocorrelation (composed of the two autocorrelation features). These three groupings appeared in the 3 validation cohorts and when performing hierarchical clustering. To demonstrate how these three features change, a simulation was created to allow the user to examine these features under different conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate reviewer #3 for the valuable and constructive comments on our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The goal of this study was to identify CGM features that relate to %NC. Through multiple feature selection methods, they arrive at 3 components: value, variability, and autocorrelation. While the feature list is highly correlated, the authors take steps to ensure feature selection is robust. There is a lack of clarity of what each component (value, variability, and autocorrelation) includes as while similar CGM indices fall within each component, there appear to be some indices that appear as relevant to value in one dataset and to variability in the validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the classification of CGMderived measures into the three components: value, variability, and autocorrelation. As the reviewer correctly points out, some measures may load differently between the value and variability components in different datasets. However, we believe that this variability reflects the inherent mathematical properties of these measures rather than a limitation of our study.</p><p>For example, the HBGI clusters differently across datasets due to its dependence on the number of glucose readings above a threshold. In populations where mean glucose levels are predominantly below this threshold, the HBGI is more sensitive to glucose variability (Fig. S3A). Conversely, in populations with a wider range of mean glucose levels, HBGI correlates more strongly with mean glucose levels (Fig. 3A). This context-dependent behaviour is expected given the mathematical properties of these measures and does not indicate an inconsistency in our classification approach.</p><p>Importantly, our main findings remain robust: CGM-derived measures systematically fall into three components-value, variability, and autocorrelation. Traditional CGM-derived measures primarily reflect either value or variability, and this categorization is consistently observed across datasets. While specific indices such as HBGI may shift classification depending on population characteristics, the overall structure of CGM data remains stable.</p><p>To address these considerations, we have added the following text to the Discussion section (lines 388-396):</p><p>Some indices, such as HBGI, showed variation in classification across datasets, with some populations showing higher factor loadings in the “mean” component and others in the “variance” component. This variation occurs because HBGI calculations depend on the number of glucose readings above a threshold. In populations where mean glucose levels are predominantly below this threshold, the HBGI is more sensitive to glucose variability (Fig. S5A). Conversely, in populations with a wider range of mean glucose levels, the HBGI correlates more strongly with mean glucose levels (Fig. 3A). Despite these differences, our validation analyses confirm that CGM-derived indices consistently cluster into three components: mean, variance, and autocorrelation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We are sceptical about statements of significance without documentation of p-values.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding statistical significance and the documentation of p values.</p><p>First, given the multiple comparisons in our study, we used q values rather than p values, as shown in Figure 1D. Q values provide a more rigorous statistical framework for controlling the false discovery rate in multiple testing scenarios, thereby reducing the likelihood of false positives.</p><p>Second, our statistical reporting follows established guidelines, including those of the New England Journal of Medicine (Harrington, David, et al. “New guidelines for statistical reporting in the journal.” New England Journal of Medicine 381.3 (2019): 285-286.), which recommend that “reporting of exploratory end points should be limited to point estimates of effects with 95% confidence intervals” and that “replace p values with estimates of effects or association and 95% confidence intervals”. According to these guidelines, p values should not be reported in this type of study. We determined significance based on whether these 95% confidence intervals excluded zero - a method for determining whether an association is significantly different from zero (Tan, Sze Huey, and Say Beng Tan. &quot;The correct interpretation of confidence intervals.&quot; Proceedings of Singapore Healthcare 19.3 (2010): 276-278.).</p><p>For the sake of transparency, we provide p values for readers who may be interested, although we emphasize that they should not be the basis for interpretation, as discussed in the referenced guidelines. Specifically, in Figure 1A-B, the p values for CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var were 0.02, 0.02, and &lt;0.01, respectively, while those for FBG, HbA1c, and PG120 were 0.83,</p><p>0.91, and 0.25, respectively.

Briefly, trained research staff used standardized questionnaires to collect demographic and clinical information, including diabetes diagnosis, treatment history, comorbidities, and medication use. Physical examinations included anthropometric measurements, and body mass index was calculated using standard protocols. CGM was performed using the FreeStyle Libre H device (Abbott Diabetes Care, UK), which records interstitial glucose levels at 15-minute intervals for up to 14 days. Laboratory measurements, including metabolic panels, lipid profiles, and renal function tests, were obtained within six months of CGM placement.

The research identifies three key factors that independently predict %NC and highlights the potential of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived indices in risk assessment for coronary artery disease (CAD). Using robust statistical methods and validation across diverse populations, the study emphasizes the limitations of conventional diagnostic markers and suggests a novel, CGMbased approach for improved predictive performance While the study demonstrates significant novelty and potential impact, several issues must be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>(1) The study demonstrates originality by introducing autocorrelation as a novel predictive factor in glucose dynamics, a perspective rarely explored in prior research. While the innovation is commendable, the biological mechanisms linking autocorrelation to plaque vulnerability remain speculative. Providing a hypothesis or potential pathways would enhance the scientific impact and practical relevance of this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point about the need for a clearer biological explanation linking glucose autocorrelation to plaque vulnerability. Our previous research has shown that glucose autocorrelation reflects changes in insulin clearance (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Improved detection of decreased glucose handling capacities via continuous glucose monitoring-derived indices.” Communications Medicine 5.1 (2025): 103.). The relationship between insulin clearance and cardiovascular disease has been well documented (Randrianarisoa, Elko, et al. “Reduced insulin clearance is linked to subclinical atherosclerosis in individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus.” Scientific reports 10.1 (2020): 22453.), and the mechanisms described in this prior work may potentially explain the association between glucose autocorrelation and clinical outcomes observed in the present study. We have added the following sentences to the Discussion section (lines 341-352):</p><p>Despite increasing evidence linking glycemic variability to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in T2DM complications (Ceriello et al., 2008; Monnier et al., 2008), the biological mechanisms underlying the independent predictive value of autocorrelation remain to be elucidated. Our previous work has shown that glucose autocorrelation is influenced by insulin clearance (Sugimoto et al., 2025), a process known to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk (Randrianarisoa et al., 2020). Therefore, the molecular pathways linking glucose autocorrelation to cardiovascular disease may share common mechanisms with those linking insulin clearance to cardiovascular disease. Although previous studies have primarily focused on investigating the molecular mechanisms associated with mean glucose levels and glycemic variability, our findings open new avenues for exploring the molecular basis of glucose autocorrelation, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets for preventing diabetic complications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The inclusion of datasets from Japan, America, and China adds a valuable cross-cultural dimension to the study, showcasing its potential applicability across diverse populations.

This limits the statistical power and applicability to diverse populations. A larger, multi-center cohort would strengthen conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding sample size and its potential impact on statistical power, especially when stratified by glucose tolerance levels. We fully agree that a larger sample size would increase statistical power, especially for subgroup analyses.</p><p>We would like to clarify several points regarding the statistical power and validation of our findings. Our study adheres to established methodological frameworks for sample size determination, including the guidelines outlined by Muyembe Asenahabi, Bostely, and Peters Anselemo Ikoha. “Scientific research sample size determination.” (2023). These guidelines balance the risks of inadequate sample size with the challenges of unnecessarily large samples. For our primary analysis examining the correlation between CGM-derived measures and %NC, power calculations with a type I error of 0.05, a power of 0.8, and an expected correlation coefficient of 0.4 indicated that a minimum of 47 participants was required. Our sample size of 53 exceeded this threshold and allowed us to detect statistically significant correlations, as described in the Methods section.</p><p>Furthermore, our sample size aligns with previous studies investigating the associations between glucose profiles and clinical parameters, including Torimoto, Keiichi, et al. “Relationship between fluctuations in glucose levels measured by continuous glucose monitoring and vascular endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes mellitus.” Cardiovascular Diabetology 12 (2013): 1-7.

(n=32). Moreover, to provide transparency about the precision of our estimates, we have included confidence intervals for all coefficients.</p><p>Regarding the classification of glucose dynamics components, we have conducted additional validation across diverse populations including 64 Japanese, 53 American, and 100 Chinese individuals. These validation efforts have consistently supported our identification of three independent glucose dynamics components. Furthermore, the primary objective of our study was not to assess rare events, but rather to demonstrate that glucose dynamics can be decomposed into three main factors - mean, variance and autocorrelation - whereas traditional measures have primarily captured mean and variance without adequately reflecting autocorrelation. We believe that our current sample size effectively addresses this objective.</p><p>However, we acknowledge the importance of further validation on a larger scale. To address this, we conducted a large follow-up study of over 8,000 individuals with two years of followup (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Stratification of individuals without prior diagnosis of diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring” medRxiv (2025)), which confirmed our main finding that glucose dynamics consist of mean, variance, and autocorrelation.

Our study specifically focused on characterizing glucose dynamics, and we analyzed individuals with well-controlled serum cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce confounding effects. While we anticipate that inclusion of a more diverse population would not alter our primary findings regarding glucose dynamics, it is likely that a broader data set would reveal additional predictive contributions from lipid and blood pressure parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The study effectively highlights the potential of CGM-derived indices as a tool for CAD risk assessment, a concept that aligns with contemporary advancements in personalized medicine. Despite its potential, the complexity of CGM-derived indices like AC_Var and ADRR may hinder their routine clinical adoption.

For example, defining a cut-off value for AC_Var above which the risk of diabetes complications increases significantly would provide clearer clinical guidance. However, given our current sample size limitations and our predefined objective of investigating correlations among indices, we have taken a conservative approach by focusing on the correlation between AC_Var and %NC rather than establishing definitive cutoffs. This approach intentionally avoids problematic statistical practices like phacking. It is not realistic to expect a single study to accomplish everything from proposing a new concept to conducting large-scale clinical trials to establishing clinical guidelines. Establishing clinical guidelines typically requires the accumulation of multiple studies over many years.

Furthermore, multiple regression analysis between factor scores and TIR revealed that only factor 1 (mean) and factor 2 (variance) were significantly associated with TIR (Fig. S8C, D). This finding confirms the presence of three distinct components in glucose dynamics and highlights the added value of examining AC_Var as an independent glycemic feature beyond conventional CGM-derived measures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) While the study reflects a commitment to understanding CAD risks in a global context by including datasets from Japan, America, and China, the authors should provide demographic details (e.g., age, gender, socioeconomic status) and discuss how these factors might influence glucose dynamics and coronary plaque vulnerability.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the potential influence of demographic factors on glucose dynamics and coronary plaque vulnerability.

In contrast, our proposed model incorporating the three glycemic parameters - CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var - achieved a significantly improved R² of 0.36 and a lower AIC of 321, indicating superior predictive accuracy.

The mean, variance, and autocorrelation components we identified likely reflect specific underlying physiological mechanisms related to glucose regulation. In our previous research (Sugimoto, Hikaru, et al. “Improved detection of decreased glucose handling capacities via continuous glucose monitoring-derived indices.” Communications Medicine 5.1 (2025): 103.), we explored the relationship between glucose dynamics characteristics and glucose control capabilities using clamp tests and mathematical modelling.

Unlike Ridge regression, which simply shrinks coefficients toward zero without reaching exactly zero, LASSO produces sparse models, which is consistent with our goal of identifying the most critical features of glucose dynamics associated with coronary plaque vulnerability. In addition, we implemented PLS regression as a complementary approach due to its effectiveness in dealing with multicollinearity, which was particularly relevant given the high correlation among several CGM-derived measures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) While figures are well-designed, adding annotations to highlight key findings (e.g., significant contributors in factor analysis) would improve clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to improve the clarity of our figures.

Factor 1 was predominantly influenced by CGM_Mean, with a factor loading of 0.99, indicating that it primarily represents mean glucose levels.

Autocorrelation refers to the relationship between a variable and its past values over time. In the context of glucose dynamics, it reflects how current glucose levels are influenced by past levels, capturing patterns such as sustained hyperglycemia or recurrent fluctuations. For example, if an individual experiences sustained high glucose levels after a meal, the strong correlation between successive glucose readings indicates high autocorrelation. We have included this explanation in the revised manuscript (lines 519-524) to improve clarity for readers unfamiliar with the concept.

To avoid confusion, we have reviewed and standardized the use of terms such as “CGM-derived indices,” and “plaque vulnerability” throughout the manuscript. Additionally, while many of our measures are strictly CGM-derived indices, several “components” in our analysis include fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glucose waveforms during the OGTT.

According to these guidelines, p values should not be reported in this type of study. We determined significance based on whether these 95% confidence intervals excluded zero - a statistical method for determining whether an association is significantly different from zero (Tan, Sze Huey, and Say Beng Tan. “The correct interpretation of confidence intervals.” Proceedings of Singapore Healthcare 19.3 (2010): 276-278.).</p><p>For the sake of transparency, we provide p values for readers who may be interested, although we emphasize that they should not be the basis for interpretation, as discussed in the referenced guidelines. Specifically, in Figure 1A-B, the p values for CGM_Mean, CGM_Std, and AC_Var were 0.02, 0.02, and &lt;0.01, respectively, while those for FBG, HbA1c, and PG120 were 0.83, 0.91, and 0.25, respectively. In Figure 3C, the p values for factors 1–5 were 0.03, 0.03, 0.03, 0.24, and 0.87, respectively, and in Figure S8C, the p values for factors 1–3 were &lt;0.01, &lt;0.01, and 0.20, respectively.

The VIP values for ADRR, MAGE, AC_Var, and LI consistently exceeded one even after these adjustments, suggesting that the primary findings are robust in the presence of these clinical variables.

All the main features for value in Figure 3A are positive. However, MVALUE in S7B is very negative for value whereas the other features highlighted for value are positive. What is driving this difference? Please explain if the direction is important. Line 480 states that variables with factor loadings &gt;= 0.30 were used for interpretation, but it appears in the text (Line 156, Figure 3) that oral DI was used for value, even though it had a -0.61 loading. Figure 3, Figure S7. HBGI falls within two separate components (value and variability). There is not a consistent component grouping. Removal of MAG (Line 185) and only MAG does not seem scientific. Did the removal of other features also result in similar or different Cronbach's ⍺? It is unclear what Figure S8B is plotting. What does each point mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the classification of CGMderived measures into the three components: value, variability, and autocorrelation. As the reviewer correctly points out, some measures may load differently between the value and variability components in different datasets. However, we believe that this variability reflects the inherent mathematical properties of these measures rather than a limitation of our study.</p><p>For example, the HBGI clusters differently across datasets due to its dependence on the number of glucose readings above a threshold. In populations where mean glucose levels are predominantly below this threshold, the HBGI is more sensitive to glucose variability (Fig. S3A). Conversely, in populations with a wider range of mean glucose levels, HBGI correlates more strongly with mean glucose levels (Fig. 3A). This context-dependent behaviour is expected given the mathematical properties of these measures and does not indicate an inconsistency in our classification approach.</p><p>Importantly, our main findings remain robust: CGM-derived measures systematically fall into three components-value, variability, and autocorrelation. Traditional CGM-derived measures primarily reflect either value or variability, and this categorization is consistently observed across datasets. While specific indices such as HBGI may shift classification depending on population characteristics, the overall structure of CGM data remains stable.</p><p>With respect to negative factor loadings, we agree that they may appear confusing at first. However, in the context of exploratory factor analysis, the magnitude, or absolute value, of the loading is most critical for interpretation, rather than its sign. Following established practice, we considered variables with absolute loadings of at least 0.30 to be meaningful contributors to a given component. Accordingly, although the oral DI had a negative loading of –0.61, its absolute magnitude exceeded the threshold of 0.30, so it was considered in our interpretation of the “value” component. Regarding the reviewer’s observation that MVALUE in Figure S7B shows a strongly negative loading while other indices in the same component show positive loadings, we believe this reflects the relative orientation of the factor solution rather than a substantive difference in interpretation. In factor analysis, the direction of factor loadings is arbitrary: multiplying all the loadings for a given factor by –1 would not change the factor’s statistical identity. Therefore, the important factor is not whether a variable loads positively or negatively but rather the strength of its association with the latent component (i.e., the absolute value of the loading).</p><p>The rationale for removing MAG was based on statistical and methodological considerations. As is common practice in reliability analyses, we examined whether Cronbach’s α would improve if we excluded items with low factor loadings or weak item–total correlations. In the present study, we recalculated Cronbach’s α after removing the MAG item because it had a low loading. Its exclusion did not substantially affect the theoretical interpretation of the factor, which we conceptualize as “secretion” (without CGM). MAG’s removal alone is scientifically justified because it was the only item whose exclusion improved Cronbach's α while preserving interpretability. In contrast, removing other items would have undermined the conceptual clarity of the factor or would not have meaningfully improved α. Furthermore, the MAG item has a high factor 2 loading.</p><p>Each point in Figure S8B (old version) corresponds to an individual participant.</p><p>To address these considerations, we have added the following text to the Discussion, Methods, (lines 388-396, 600-601) and Figure S6B (current version) legend:</p><p>Some indices, such as HBGI, showed variation in classification across datasets, with some populations showing higher factor loadings in the “mean” component and others in the “variance” component. This variation occurs because HBGI calculations depend on the number of glucose readings above a threshold. In populations where mean glucose levels are predominantly below this threshold, the HBGI is more sensitive to glucose variability (Fig. S5A). Conversely, in populations with a wider range of mean glucose levels, the HBGI correlates more strongly with mean glucose levels (Fig. 3A).

The primary contribution of our study goes beyond demonstrating correlations between CGM-derived measures and %NC; it highlights three fundamental components of glycemic patterns-mean, variance, and autocorrelation-and their independent relationships with coronary plaque characteristics. The simulations are included to illustrate how glycemic patterns with identical means and variability can have different autocorrelation structures. As reviewer 2 pointed out in minor comment #4, temporal autocorrelation can be difficult to interpret, so these visualizations were intended to provide intuitive examples for readers.</p><p>However, we agree with the reviewer’s concern about the coherence of the manuscript. In response, we have streamlined the simulation section by removing technical simulations that do not directly support our primary conclusions (old version of the manuscript, lines 239-246, 502-526), while retaining only those that enhance understanding of the three glycemic components (Fig. 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure S2.
