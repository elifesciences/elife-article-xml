Previous findings showed that modulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mouse thymic epithelial cells (TECs) disrupts embryonic thymus organogenesis. However, the role of β-catenin in TECs for postnatal T-cell development remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) of β-catenin highly specific in mouse TECs. We found that GOF of β-catenin in TECs results in severe thymic dysplasia and T-cell deficiency beginning from the embryonic period. By contrast, LOF of β-catenin in TECs reduces the number of cortical TECs and thymocytes modestly and only postnatally. These results indicate that fine-tuning of β-catenin expression within a permissive range is required for TECs to generate an optimal microenvironment to support postnatal T-cell development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thymus</kwd><kwd>TEC</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The thymus is an organ where lymphocyte progenitors differentiate into functionally competent T cells through interactions primarily with cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) and medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which construct a three-dimensional epithelial network of the thymus and facilitate the development and selection of developing T cells. To establish a functional thymic microenvironment, the thymus organogenesis is tightly regulated by the interaction of thymic epithelial cells (TECs) with neighboring cells, such as mesenchymal cells and hematopoietic cells, through various molecules including morphogens, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, during the thymus organogenesis that is initiated around embryonic day 11 (E11) in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackburn and Manley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon and Manley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahama et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been implicated in thymus development following the discovery of its core components, T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancing factor (LEF) family transcription factors, in developing thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oosterwegel et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Travis et al., 1991</xref>). Wnt proteins activate the canonical signaling pathway through interaction with their receptors of the Frizzled family and coreceptors of the LRP5/6 family. This interaction leads to the inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex, which is composed of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, casein kinase 1α (CK1α), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) proteins, thereby resulting in the stabilization of cytosolic β-catenin, its translocation to the nucleus, and enhancement of transcription together with the TCF/LEF family transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous systemic and conditional gene manipulation studies in mouse have demonstrated the importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in early thymus development. The systemic deletion of Wnt4, which is abundant in embryonic TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pongracz et al., 2003</xref>), reduces the number of TECs as well as thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinonen et al., 2011</xref>). Keratin 5 (<italic>Krt5</italic>) promoter-driven inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the overexpression of Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf1 (DKK1) or by the deficiency of β-catenin reduces the number of TECs including K5<sup>+</sup>K8<sup>+</sup> immature TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Osada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, a reduction in the number of TECs is observed in perinatal mice in which β-catenin is deleted using Foxn1-Cre, which targets TECs expressing transcription factor Forkhead box N1 (Foxn1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swann et al., 2017</xref>). However, the Foxn1-Cre-mediated β-catenin deletion causes neonatal lethality due to side effects in the skin epidermis, so that the postnatal effects of β-catenin deficiency in TECs remain unknown. On the other hand, overactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the deletion of transmembrane protein Kremen 1, which binds to DKK1 and potentiates Wnt signaling inhibition, results in the increase in the number of K5<sup>+</sup>K8<sup>+</sup> immature TECs and the disorganization of the TEC network by the decrease in the frequency of mature cTECs and mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osada et al., 2006</xref>). Keratin 14 (<italic>Krt14</italic>) promoter-driven loss of APC disorganizes the thymus and reduces its size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuraguchi et al., 2006</xref>). The overexpression of β-catenin using Foxn1-Cre causes a more severe defect in embryonic thymus development, which is accompanied by the failure of separation of the thymic primordium from the parathyroid primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuklys et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swann et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critical for embryonic TEC development. However, the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TECs for thymus development and function during the postnatal period remains unclear because previous studies relied on mutant mice that exhibit perinatal lethality due to severe effects on various cell types including the skin epidermis.</p><p>In this study, we assessed the role of β-catenin in TECs by employing β5t-iCre, which was successfully engineered to target TECs in a highly specific manner without side effects in other cells including the skin epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohigashi et al., 2013</xref>). Thymus-specific proteasome subunit β5t is specifically expressed in cTECs in a Foxn1-dependent manner, and is important for the generation of functionally competent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohigashi et al., 2021</xref>). β5t in postnatal mice is exclusively expressed by cTECs but not mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ripen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uddin et al., 2017</xref>); however, its transcription is also detectable in embryonic TECs that differentiate into cTECs and mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohigashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohigashi et al., 2015</xref>). By taking advantage of the highly specific Cre activity only in TECs and not in skin epidermal cells in β5t-iCre mice, here we engineered gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) of β-catenin specifically in TECs and addressed the contribution of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in TECs, focusing on the effects of thymus function on T-cell development during the postnatal period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GOF of β-catenin in TECs causes thymic dysplasia</title><p>To address the potential function of β-catenin in TECs, we generated mice in which GOF of β-catenin was achieved specifically in TECs by intercrossing β5t-iCre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohigashi et al., 2013</xref>) with <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> exon 3 floxed mice, in which the conditional deletion of exon 3 led to stabilization of β-catenin and constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harada et al., 1999</xref>). Contrary to previous studies demonstrating that the Foxn1-Cre-mediated GOF of β-catenin perturbed the migration of the thymic primordium from the pharyngeal region into the thoracic cavity during the embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuklys et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swann et al., 2017</xref>), the β5t-Cre-mediated GOF of β-catenin (β-cat GOF) showed no disruption of the thoracic migration of the embryonic thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). However, the thymus in these mice showed severe dysplasia by E15.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). The β-cat GOF embryos appeared normal in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and exhibited undisturbed limb development (data not shown), indicating that the thymic dysplasia in β-cat GOF mice occurred independent of systemic retardation in embryogenesis. Fluorescence detection of Cre-mediated recombination by further crossing to R26R-tdTomato reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) revealed that β5t-Cre-mediated tdTomato-expressing cells were specifically detected in the thymus in the thoracic cavity in both control and β-cat GOF mice at E15.5, further confirming that TECs successfully migrated into the thoracic cavity in β-cat GOF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike control mice in which tdTomato-labeled cells distributed uniformly throughout the thymus, tdTomato-labeled cells in β-cat GOF mice densely distributed in concentric mid-inner layers, excluding the central core, in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Morphological alteration of the thymus was apparent in sagittal sections of E15.5 β-cat GOF embryos by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by the detection of keratin 5 (K5) and keratin 8 (K8) expression, in which a multilayered concentric structure of epithelial cells surrounding the central core that mainly consisted of nonepithelial structures sparsely containing erythrocytes was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). β-Catenin was abundant in the concentric layers of the thymus in E15.5 β-cat GOF mice, whereas β5t was undetectable throughout the E15.5 β-cat GOF thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that GOF of β-catenin in TECs diminishes β5t expression in TECs. Intracellular staining of β-catenin in CD45<sup>−</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> TECs isolated from E15.5 thymus revealed that the intracellular level of β-catenin in TECs from β-cat GOF mice was increased by 70% compared with that from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that β5t-Cre-mediated GOF of β-catenin specifically in TECs causes severe thymic dysplasia by E15.5 without affecting thoracic migration of the thymic primordium.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Thymic dysplasia caused by the overexpression of β-catenin in thymic epithelial cells (TECs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Thoracic cavity of control mice and β-cat gain-of-function (GOF) mice at E15.5.

However, the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TECs with regard to postnatal immune system development remains unclear due to the difficulty of performing an in vivo analysis without generating extrathymic side effects. Most typically, the conventional ‘TEC-specific’ Foxn1-Cre-mediated genetic manipulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling molecules causes neonatal lethality of the animals due to side effects in the skin epidermis. In the present study, we employed the recently devised β5t-Cre, which enables highly efficient and specific genetic manipulation in TECs without generating side effects in the skin epidermis or other cells in the body. By analyzing β5t-Cre-mediated deficiency in β-catenin highly specific in TECs, we found that the TEC-specific loss of β-catenin causes postnatal reduction in the number of cTECs, which leads to the reduction in the number of thymocytes. Nonetheless, the TEC-specific loss of β-catenin did not cause an arrest in the development of the thymus, including the corticomedullary architecture, and the subsequent generation of T cells, indicating that the β-catenin in TECs is dispensable for the development of cTECs and mTECs as well as of postnatal T cells. In contrast, our results also showed that β5t-Cre-mediated constitutive activation of β-catenin in TECs causes dysplasia in thymus organogenesis and loss of thymic T-cell development. These results suggest that fine-tuning of β-catenin-mediated signaling activity in TECs is required for optimal development and maintenance of functional thymus. Thus, β-catenin-mediated signaling in TECs needs to be maintained at an intermediate level to prevent thymic dysplasia induced by its excessive signals, whereas no or extremely low β-catenin signals cause hypoplasia of the postnatal thymus. The need for fine-tuning of β-catenin during the development of the central nervous system and other organs, such as bone, heart, intestine, liver, lung, mammary gland, pancreas, reproductive organs, skin, and tooth, was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigoryan et al., 2008</xref>). Our LOF and GOF experiments in TECs established that the thymus is included in tissues that require fine-tuning of β-catenin during the development, and revealed that the fine-tuning of β-catenin in TECs is required for supporting postnatal T-cell development in the thymus.</p><p>Previous conditional gene targeting in TECs was performed using Cre-deleter mouse lines with any one of the promoter sequences for Foxn1, K5, and K14. However, extrathymic side effects were induced in epithelial cells other than TECs in the Cre-deleter mouse lines. For example, Foxn1-Cre-mediated genetic alteration was detectable in the skin in addition to TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuklys et al., 2009</xref>), and mice rendered β-catenin deficient using Foxn1-Cre died within a few days of birth due to defects in skin development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swann et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the β5t-locus knockin Cre-deleter mice used in the present study enabled highly efficient and specific genetic manipulation in TECs without any side effects in other organs including the skin. β5t is abundant in cTECs but not detectable in other cells including mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ripen et al., 2011</xref>). However, all mTECs are derived from bipotent β5t-expressing TEC progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohigashi et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, β5t-iCre enables efficient and conditional genetic manipulation of both cTECs and mTECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohigashi et al., 2015</xref>). A conceptually similar gene targeting strategy has been widely employed to study two major T-cell lineages of CD4 and CD8 T cells, as CD4-Cre is useful to delete floxed sequences in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma and Zhu, 2014</xref>). In agreement with a recent study using the same β5t-iCre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barthlott et al., 2021</xref>), our study demonstrated the highly efficient deletion of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> floxed sequence in both cTECs and mTECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Our β-cat LOF and GOF mice using the TEC-specific β5t-iCre grew postnatally without perinatal lethality or skin defects. Interesting, both of our β-cat LOF and GOF mice exhibited thymic phenotypes different from previously observed phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). The β5t-Cre-mediated GOF of β-catenin caused dysfunction of the embryonic thymus, in line with previous β-cat GOF studies using Foxn1-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuklys et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swann et al., 2017</xref>). However, unlike those previous studies, defective migration of the thymus into the thoracic cavity during the embryogenesis was not observed in our β5t-Cre-mediated β-cat GOF mice. Therefore, our study clarified that the β-cat GOF-mediated thymic dysfunction is not due to impaired migration of the thymic primordium from the pharyngeal region to the chest cavity. Instead, the difference in migration phenotype may be due to the different onset of Cre activity in TECs between different Cre lines. The Foxn1-mediated direct transcriptional regulation of β5t and a slightly later expression of β5t than Foxn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ripen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uddin et al., 2017</xref>) may result in Foxn1-Cre-mediated, but not β5t-Cre-mediated, β-cat GOF interference with thymic migration toward the thoracic cavity.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Phenotypic differences between conditional β-cat loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) mice during the postnatal period.</title><p>GOF of β-catenin using Foxn1-Cre and β5t-iCre causes severe defect in thymic epithelial cell (TEC development and arrest in T-cell development at DN1), whereas Foxn1-Cre-mediated GOF of β-catenin only results in the failure of migration of thymic primordium into the thoracic cavity.

Our results demonstrated that the loss of β-catenin in TECs impacts neither thymic architecture nor the expression of functionally relevant molecules in cTECs and mTECs. Rather, we found that the β5t-Cre-mediated LOF of β-catenin reduces the number of postnatal cTECs. We further found that the number of postnatal thymocytes in the β-cat LOF thymus is reduced by half compared with that in control thymus, although the T-cell development is not disturbed. Thus, our analysis of β5t-Cre-mediated β-cat LOF mice revealed that the β-catenin signaling in TECs is dispensable for TEC development and T-cell development, but is required for the provision of cTECs, which support postnatal T-cell generation.</p><p>Our results indicated that β5t-Cre-mediated β-catenin-deficient mice exhibit postnatal reduction in the number of cTECs but not mTECs and that their expression of <italic>Axin2</italic> is reduced only in cTECs but not in mTECs, implying the differential responsiveness to β-catenin signaling between cTECs and mTECs. The selective effect on cTECs was detectable in mice at 6 mo, in which age-associated thymic involution was apparent. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing analysis confirmed the differential responsiveness between cTECs and mTECs to LOF of β-catenin, as represented by the cTEC-specific elevation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in β-cat LOF mice. The increase in <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> specifically in cTECs may lead to the reduction in the number of cTECs rather than mTECs. It is further interesting to note that the reduced number of cTECs but not mTECs is associated with an equivalent reduction in the number of immature thymocytes in the thymic cortex and the number of mature thymocytes in the thymic medulla, suggesting that the number of mature thymocytes generated in the thymus is correlated with the number of cTECs rather than the number of mTECs.</p><p>Our results showed that GOF of β-catenin in TECs results in the decrease in the expression of TEC-specific molecules and the increase in the expression of terminally differentiated keratinocytes, in agreement with previous results using Foxn1-Cre-mediated β-cat GOF mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuklys et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that TECs retain the potential to transdifferentiate into epidermal keratinocytes in the presence of an excessive amount of β-catenin, as a similar transdifferentiation of epithelial cells upon β-catenin overexpression was reported in other tissues, such as mammary gland and prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyoshi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bierie et al., 2003</xref>). However, our data suggest a slightly different scenario because keratin 1 (<italic>Krt1</italic>) and keratin 10 (<italic>Krt10</italic>) genes, which are expressed during the cornification of terminally differentiated keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Candi et al., 2005</xref>), were not detectable in β5t-Cre-mediated β-cat LOF TECs at E15.5 (data not shown). We suspect that β-cat GOF TECs are not exactly equivalent to the terminally differentiated keratinocytes, although they partially share gene expression profiles. It is noted that the terminally differentiated mTEC subpopulations, including post-Aire mTECs and Hassall’s corpuscles, express involucrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishikawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">White et al., 2010</xref>) and loricrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michel et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is further possible that the alteration of β-catenin-mediated signals in mature mTECs promotes the terminal differentiation of the mTECs or the deviation to give rise to Hassall’s corpuscles.</p><p>Cellular interactions between TECs and neighboring cells, such as mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shinohara and Honjo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenkinson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoi et al., 2007</xref>), endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wertheimer et al., 2018</xref>), and thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holländer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klug et al., 2002</xref>), are important for thymus development.

Future studies of the function of Wnts and Wnt signaling components in TECs and neighboring cells should provide further insight into the mechanism for fine-tuning β-catenin signaling in TECs to

For detection of antibodies, Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies or streptavidin (Invitrogen) were used at 1:500 dilution as necessary. Nuclear counterstaining was performed using TO-PRO3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:1000). Fluorescent images were obtained and analyzed with a TCS SP8 (Leica) confocal laser scanning microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title><p>For flow cytometric analysis of TECs, minced thymuses from fetuses and postnatal mice were digested with 0.5 and 1 unit/ml Liberase TM (Roche) in the presence of 0.01% DNase I (Roche), respectively. Single-cell suspensions were stained for the expression of EpCAM (BioLegend, clone G8.8), CD45 (BioLegend, clone 30-F11), and Ly51 (BioLegend, clone 6C3) and for the reactivity with UEA-1 (Vector Laboratories). For the intracellular staining of β-catenin in TECs, surface-stained cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin, and stained with monoclonal mouse anti-β-catenin against aa. 571–781 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Clone 14, 1:100) or mouse IgG1 isotype control (BD Pharmingnen, clone MOPC-21, 1:200), followed by Alexa Fluor Plus 488-conjugated anti mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen, 1:800).</p><p>For the isolation of TECs, CD45<sup>−</sup> cells were enriched with magnetic-bead-conjugated anti-CD45 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) before multicolor staining for flow cytometric cell sorting.</p><p>For flow cytometric analysis of thymocytes, spleen cells, and lymph node cells, cells were multicolor stained for CD4 (eBioscience, clone RM4-5), CD8α (Invitrogen, clone 53-6.7), CD25 (BioLegend, clone PC61), CD44 (eBioscience, clone IM7), TCRβ (BioLegend, clone H57-597), TCRδ (BioLegend, clone GL3), Vγ5 (BD Pharmingen, clone 536), Vγ4 (BD Pharmingen, clone UC3-10A6), and Vγ1 (BioLegend, clone 2.11).</p><p>For the analysis of DETCs, epidermal cells were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, dorsal skin of 8-week-old mice was placed dermal side down in 0.25% trypsin–EDTA in PBS at 37°C for 1 hr and epidermal sheet was peeled off from dermis. Minced epidermal sheets were mechanically dissociated to make a single-cell suspension in 1xPBS containing 2% FCS. Cells were filtered and cell surface staining was performed using antibodies specific for CD3ε (eBioscience, clone145-2C11) and Vγ5 (BD Pharmingen, clone 536).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis</title><p>Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was reverse transcribed (RT) with PrimeScript Reverse Transcriptase (TaKaRa) to produce first-strand cDNA. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using TB Green Premix Taq II (TaKaRa) and a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Values were calculated by using the comparative <italic>C</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) method and normalized to mouse <italic>Gapdh</italic> expression. Most of the primer sets amplified products across exon/intron boundaries and the PCR products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and melting curves. Sequences are available by request.</p><p>RNA sequencing analysis cDNA was generated from 300 isolated TECs by using a SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara Bio). A sequencing library was prepared by using a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina). The concentration of the libraries was measured by an ABI PRISM 7500 Real-time PCR system in combination with a Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Single-end sequencing of cDNA libraries with the read length of 76 was performed with a NextSeq 550 system (Illumina) using a High Output 75-Cycle Kit (Illumina). Data were analyzed by using CLC Genomics Workbench 12 (Qiagen) with default parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism seven software.

and function. The work presented builds upon previous studies that have shown that alterations of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) impact the normal development and or maintenance of thymic epithelial microenvironment critical for the proper development and selection of functional self-tolerant T cell repertoire. The surprise that a TEC specific loss of function of β-catenin only showed a rather minor phenotype is interesting, as are the findings that gain of function of β-catenin leads to TEC differentiation towards a keratinocyte-like lineage outcome. The author's claims are well supported by the data presented and will be of great interest to scientists and clinicians interested in understanding the signaling pathways important in thymic maintenance, as well as the development of strategies to counteract thymic involution in the aging population and cancer patients.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69088.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Zúñiga-Pflücker</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Research Institute</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zúñiga-Pflücker</surname><given-names>Juan Carlos</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Toronto, Sunnybrook Research Institute</institution><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Pezzano</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>City College of New York</institution></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.05.02.442353">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.02.442353v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Juan Carlos Zúñiga-Pflücker as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Pezzano (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The impact of the work would be improved by the addition of analyses that would point to a more mechanistic understanding as to the observed phenotype. These are highlighted by the characterization of Notch ligand expression in the GoF mouse, and further characterization of the terminally differentiated keratinocytes.</p><p>2) Additional analysis of the LoF mouse, either in aging or following stress/damage induced recovery would add impact to the work. Additional characterization of the cTEC subset in the LoF mice to address whether these cells have a defect in their survival/proliferation/differentiation.</p><p>3) There is a need to improve on the image analyses and cell sorting parameters.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work presented by the authors beautifully illustrate the minor role that WNT signaling plays in fetal and post-natal TEC differentiation and function, which is somewhat different than what would have been expected given previous reports. Nevertheless, the authors' use of the β5t-cre is very elegant and directly addresses the role of β-catenin in TECs. Given the minor phenotype seen in the LoF experiments, it would be important to show whether non-steady state challenges and recovery would be affected in the absence of β-catenin.</p><p>1. To address a potential role for WNT in non-steady situations for TEC differentiation/function and/or recovery, the authors should consider either a radiation, steroid/inflammation, or any other stress to test whether TEC recovery is affected in the LoF mice.</p><p>The results from the GoF studies clearly point to a severe dysfunction of TECs expressing constitutively active β-catenin, highlighted by the loss of FOXN1 expression and appearance of terminally differentiated keratinocytes.</p><p>2. The lack of T cell development could be further established by showing that DLL4 expression is lost in these TECs, thus no induction of T cell development would be expected. This can be easily addressed by RT-PCR or flow cytometry of TECs. Given that Dll4 is a target of FOXN1, much like β5t and CCL25, its expression is likely totally gone, but, nonetheless, it would be good to show it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study is descriptive and needs to address in greater depth the physiological and molecular effects of stabilizing or ablating β-catenin in TECs. The authors need to provide more evidence that stabilization of β-catenin function in TECs results in their terminal differentiation to keratinocytes. The authors need to specifically assess the selective effect of loss of β-catenin function on cTECs versus mTECs. Are cTECs reduced due to loss of survival/proliferation/differentiation? How is their molecular profile affected by the loss of β-catenin? Does the selective reduction of the cTEC compartment affect survival/proliferation/differentiation of the individual DN subsets?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69088.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The impact of the work would be improved by the addition of analyses that would point to a more mechanistic understanding as to the observed phenotype.

We also detected 91 genes that were significantly altered in β-cat LOF mTECs; there were 53 downregulated genes and 38 upregulated genes compared with control mTECs. Thus, only less than 100 genes were significantly altered in cTECs and mTECs due to LOF of β-catenin, in agreement with the finding of no remarkable alteration in the expression of many functionally relevant molecules in cTECs and mTECs by quantitative RT-PCR analysis, as shown in the original manuscript. Nonetheless, we found that a vast majority of the genes that were significantly affected by LOF of β-catenin were different between cTECs and mTECs except <italic>Adh1</italic> and <italic>Pglyrp1</italic>. <italic>Adh1</italic> was upregulated in β-cat LOF cTECs and downregulated in β-cat LOF mTECs, whereas <italic>Pglyrp1</italic> was upregulated by β-cat LOF in both cTECs and mTECs. Notably, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> was elevated specifically in cTECs but not in mTECs in β-cat LOF mice. The expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, which encodes cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21, is linked to β-catenin activity. The upregulation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in β-cat LOF cTECs compared with control cTECs was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. We noticed no remarkable difference in other CDK family genes, including <italic>Cnnb1</italic>, <italic>Cnnb2</italic>, and <italic>Cnnd1</italic>, in cTECs and mTECs from β-cat LOF mice. These results suggest that the upregulation of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> may contribute to the reduction in the number of cTECs by LOF of β-catenin. These new results are shown in new Figure 8 and explained as well as discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(2) We also examined how stress-induced injury would affect the thymus in β-cat LOF mice. To do so, β-cat LOF mice were treated with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, which caused injury in TECs. We found that both control and β-cat LOF mice showed transient thymic involution that was evident from the loss of thymus weight and total thymic cell number four days after the first poly(I:C) administration. Subsequently, however, the involuted thymus recovered to its pretreatment size by day 18 and day 25 in both control and β-cat LOF mice, indicating that the small thymus in postnatal β-cat LOF mice retained the capability to recover from the poly(I:C)-mediated thymic injury. Indeed, the cTECs and mTECs recovered to their numbers before the treatment. Interestingly, we noticed a delay in the recovery of the thymus in β-cat LOF mice compared with that in control mice. The weight and the cell number of the thymus were still significantly lower on day 11 than day 0 in β-cat LOF mice, unlike the recovery to the pretreatment levels on day 11 in control mice. Accordingly, the number of DP thymocytes remained slightly but significantly reduced even on day 25 in β-cat LOF mice. These results indicate that LOF of β-catenin in TECs delays the recovery of the thymus from the poly(I:C)-induced thymic involution, but does not fully abolish the capability of the thymus to recover from the poly(I:C)-induced thymic injury. These new results are shown in new Figure 11 and explained in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(3) Furthermore, we examined the phenotype of the thymus in β-cat LOF mice at 6 months old (6 mo), in which the involution of the thymus was apparent. The weight of the thymus decreased in control mice at 6 mo in comparison with those at 4 weeks old (4 wo) and 8 wo. Similarly, the thymus weight decreased in β-cat LOF mice at 6 mo compared with that at 4 wo. Accordingly, the thymus at 6 mo was still smaller in β-cat LOF mice than control mice. The number of thymocytes was reduced upon the thymic involution in β-cat LOF mice, although the difference in thymocyte number became insignificant between control mice and β-cat LOF mice at 6 mo. The number of cTECs in β-cat LOF mice at 6 wo remained smaller than the control number, whereas the number of mTECs was equivalent to that of control at 6 mo. There were no apparent differences in the corticomedullary architecture of the thymus between control mice and β-cat LOF mice at 6 mo. These results indicate that age-associated thymic involution is detectable in β-cat LOF mice. These new results are shown in new Figure 10 and explained in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to perform additional analyses of the thymus in β-cat LOF mice. The newly obtained results have given us deeper insight into the defects in TECs, particularly in cTECs, in β-cat LOF mice, which have been additionally described in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a need to improve on the image analyses and cell sorting parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added individual single-color immunohistological images in new Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A in the revised manuscript. We have also included flow cytometric cell-sorting gates and post-sorting purities of TECs, cTECs, and mTECs in new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript.
