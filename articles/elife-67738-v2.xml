developmental genes for subsequent lineage-specific activation. Here, we reveal the order of chromatin states in establishing developmental gene poising in preZGA zebrafish embryos. Poising is established at promoters and enhancers that initially contain open/permissive chromatin with ‘Placeholder’ nucleosomes (bearing H2A.Z, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac), and DNA hypomethylation. Silencing is initiated by the recruitment of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), and H2Aub1 deposition by catalytic Rnf2 during preZGA and ZGA stages. During postZGA, H2Aub1 enables Aebp2-containing PRC2 recruitment and H3K27me3 deposition. Notably, preventing H2Aub1 (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and H3K27me3, and elicits transcriptional upregulation of certain developmental genes during ZGA. However, upregulation is independent of H3K27me3 – establishing H2Aub1 as the critical silencing modification at ZGA. Taken together, we reveal the logic and mechanism for establishing poised/silent developmental genes in early vertebrate embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>polycomb</kwd><kwd>ubiquitylation</kwd><kwd>Placeholder</kwd><kwd>zygotic genome activation</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cairns</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cairns</surname><given-names>Bradley R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zebrafish early embryos initially package their developmental genes and enhancers in 'active' chromatin that subsequently receives polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1)-mediated histone H2A ubiquitylation, which confers silencing/poising – prior to Aebp2-PRC2-guided H3K27me3 addition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early vertebrate embryos initiate embryonic/zygotic transcription, termed zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and must distinguish active housekeeping genes from developmental genes, which must be temporarily silenced, but kept available for future activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Potok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>). Developmental gene promoters in early embryos are packaged in ‘active/open’ chromatin – which can involve a combination of histone variants (e.g. H2A.Z), open/accessible chromatin (via ATAC-seq), permissive histone modifications (e.g. H3K4me1/2/3, H3K27ac), and (in vertebrates such as zebrafish) focal DNA hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogdanovic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Potok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>). As H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are very low or absent at ZGA in zebrafish, it remains unknown how developmental gene silencing occurs at ZGA within an apparently permissive chromatin landscape, and how subsequent H3K27me3 is established at developmental genes during postZGA stages.</p><p>We addressed these issues further in zebrafish, which conduct full ZGA at the tenth synchronous cell cycle of cleavage stage (~3.5 hr post fertilization (hpf), ~ 2000 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>). Prior to ZGA (preZGA), zebrafish package the promoters and enhancers of housekeeping genes and many developmental genes with chromatin bearing the histone variant H2afv (a close ortholog of mammalian H2A.Z, hereafter termed H2A.Z(FV)), and the ‘permissive’ modifications H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>); a combination termed ‘Placeholder’ nucleosomes – as they hold the place where poising/silencing is later imposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>). Curiously, at ZGA in zebrafish (and also in mice and humans), silent developmental gene promoters also contain H3K4me3, a mark that normally resides at active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dahl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindeman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

Here, we address the central issues regarding how developmental genes bearing Placeholder nucleosomes and H3K4me3 are transcriptionally silenced during preZGA and ZGA stages in the absence of H3K27me3, and how subsequent H3K27me3 is focally established during postZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H2Aub1 is present in preZGA zebrafish embryo chromatin</title><p>First, we sought a repressive histone modification that might explain how developmental genes are silenced at ZGA.

In counter distinction, loci bearing Placeholder and low-moderate levels of H2Aub1 and low Rnf2 largely constitute housekeeping/metabolic genes, with either broad (cluster 3, e.g. <italic>prdx2</italic>) or narrow (cluster 4, e.g. <italic>gtf3ab</italic>) H3K4me3 and H3K27ac occupancy at postZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2K</xref>). Notably, ‘minor wave’ ZGA genes (genes transcribed at 2.5 hr), including those for pluripotency (e.g. <italic>nanog, pou5f3/oct4</italic>), bear marking similar to housekeeping genes, and the robustly transcribed <italic>mir430</italic> locus appears markedly enriched in H3K27ac at preZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, cluster 5 promoters contain DNAme, and lack Placeholder, H2Aub1, and Rnf2. Thus, over the course of ZGA, loci with Placeholder nucleosomes resolve into two broad classes of loci: developmental genes with high PRC1 and H2Aub1 (clusters 1 and 2), and housekeeping (or ‘minor wave’) genes that lack substantial PRC1 and H2Aub1, but contain high H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at postZGA (clusters 3 and 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J, K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>H3K27me3 establishment occurs during postZGA, and only at locations pre-marked with high Rnf2 and H2Aub1</title><p>We find robust H3K27me3 deposition occurring during postZGA at promoters marked during preZGA with high Rnf2 and H2Aub1, specifically at clusters 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Furthermore, as embryos transition from preZGA to postZGA, H3K27ac diminishes at developmental loci, whereas housekeeping genes (clusters 3 and 4 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) retain strong H3K27ac and become active. During postZGA, developmental genes acquire the combination of low-moderate H3K4me3 and high H3K27me3, termed ‘bivalency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azuara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, promoters that become bivalent postZGA involve those pre-marked with higher relative Rnf2 and H2Aub1, whereas promoters with high H3K27ac, high H3K4me3, and low-absent H3K27me3 postZGA involve those pre-marked with lower relative Rnf2 and H2Aub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2J</xref>). This observation raised the possibility that high H2Aub1 levels may help recruit PRC2 to subsequently deposit H3K27me3 at developmental genes. Notably, analysis of Rnf2, H2Aub1, and H3K27me3 at LINE, LTR, and satellite repeats revealed no ChIP-seq enrichment at these genomic elements during preZGA, ZGA, or postZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-C</xref>), reinforcing that this modification axis is focused on the marking of developmental loci.</p><p>To identify candidate TFs that might bind selectively at the promoters of particular clusters, we analyzed the DNA sequences flanking the transcription start site (TSS) (500 bp) at each cluster using the motif finding program, HOMER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).

Here, the strong enrichment of motifs for homeodomain-containing TFs (and other families) in clusters 1 and 2 provides candidate factors that may help recruit PRC1 to developmental loci. DNA-methylated promoters at ZGA (cluster 5) represent a large and heterogeneous set of genes, which are activated in particular cell types later in development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enhancer poising parallels features and factors at promoters</title><p>Analysis of enhancer regions revealed features that were similar to those at developmental promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Affected genes include those in clustered loci (e.g. <italic>Hox</italic> genes) where the effect was moderate, as well as non-clustered/solo formats where the effect of PRT4165 was more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Having observed precocious developmental gene upregulation in response to PRT4165 treatment during postZGA (4 hpf), we were curious whether their upregulation could also be observed during the preZGA and ZGA stages. To test, we repeated our PRT4165 treatment regimen and isolated embryos at preZGA (2.5 hpf) and ZGA (3.5 hpf) stages, and performed RNAseq (with biological triplicates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Here, analysis of upregulated genes meeting our threshold criteria (fold change ≥1.5; p-value ≤ 0.01) by GO-term analysis uncovered no enrichment of developmental genes upon RNF2 inhibition during preZGA or ZGA. Instead, enriched GO-terms from upregulated transcripts corresponded to genes encoding RNA-binding proteins and ribosomal proteins. Thus, chromatin de-repression (via H2Aub1 removal) does not cause transcriptional activation of large numbers of developmental genes during preZGA or ZGA – not even the developmental genes that are activated postZGA following Rnf2 inhibition. Here, we note that general/housekeeping transcription does not occur until ZGA; only the miRNA-430 locus and a very limited number of genes are transcribed during preZGA. Therefore, H2Aub1 removal does not, by itself, lead to the activation of developmental genes that are normally marked by H2Aub1 during preZGA. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that H2Aub1 represses developmental genes during preZGA and ZGA, independent of H3K27me3, and that the absence of H2Aub1 renders developmental genes susceptible to precocious activation following ZGA, which confers developmental arrest prior to gastrulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our work reveals that developmental gene silencing in early zebrafish embryos is established through sequential recruitment and activity of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes, respectively, to otherwise open/permissive loci bearing Placeholder nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Placeholder nucleosomes containing H3K4me1 and the histone variant H2A.Z(FV) are installed by the chromatin remodeler SRCAP during preZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>), and are focally pruned to small regions by the chaperone Anp32e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Here, our reanalysis of published data confirms that H3K27ac is an additional component of Placeholder nucleosomes during preZGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Functional studies reveal that Placeholder nucleosomes prevent DNAme where they are installed and are utilized to reprogram the DNAme patterns during cleavage stage. Therefore, from a ‘permissive’ Placeholder platform during preZGA, two very different chromatin/transcriptional states are attained at ZGA: active or poised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model for polycomb-mediated establishment of developmental gene silencing during zebrafish embryogenesis.</title><p>Prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), Rnf2-PRC1 is recruited by transcription factors (TFs) to promoters (shown) and enhancers (not shown) of developmental genes bearing Placeholder nucleosomes (H2A.Z(FV), H3K4me1, H3K27ac). Rnf2-PRC1 deposition of H2Aub1 recruits Aebp2-PRC2 to catalyze H3K27me3 addition. H2Aub1 ablation (via Rnf2 inhibition) eliminates Aebp2-PRC2 recruitment and prevents H3K27me3 establishment. Notably, H2Aub1 loss causes precocious transcription of certain developmental genes after ZGA, identifying H2Aub1 as a critical component of silencing at ZGA.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67738-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our work suggests that the initial poised state at developmental genes and enhancers involves the imposition of polycomb-based silencing upon the permissive states established by Placeholder nucleosomes. Specifically, we observe H2Aub1 addition by Rnf2/PRC1 during preZGA and ZGA to confer initial transcriptional silencing at developmental loci – which is subsequently read by the Aebp2/PRC2 complex to add H3K27me3 after ZGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Prior work in ES cells has provided an in vitro parallel in which PRC1 activity (H2Aub1 addition) can occur independently of PRC2-mediated recruitment at certain loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackledge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tamburri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>), which has been termed ‘non-canonical’ order of recruitment, to contrast with prior data showing the reverse/canonical order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>). Furthermore, and consistent with our work, human AEBP2 and JARID2 have recently been shown to directly bind H2Aub1 and stimulate PRC2 activity in the presence of H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kasinath et al., 2021</xref>), and a similar mechanism may be utilized to establish bivalency after ZGA in zebrafish.</p><p>Our work also clarifies and extends prior work in zebrafish which showed that an incross of zebrafish heterozygous for an <italic>rnf2</italic> loss-of-function truncation mutation yielded a pleitropic terminal phenotype at 3 days post fertilization (dpf), coincident with the loss of <italic>rnf2</italic> RNA. Notably, loss of <italic>rnf2</italic> at 3 dpf was associated with partial upregulation of certain developmental genes, but H3K27me3 remained fully present, showing that Rnf2 is not required for H3K27me3 maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chrispijn et al., 2019</xref>). However, progression of <italic>rnf2</italic> mutants to 3 dpf may have relied on maternally inherited WT <italic>rnf2</italic> RNA or protein to provide the initial establishment of gene silencing and H3K27me3, raising the possibility that <italic>rnf2</italic> is actually essential at a much earlier developmental stage. Our use of the Rnf2 inhibitor, PRT4165, during preZGA and ZGA stages reveals the necessity for Rnf2 activity for the establishment of developmental gene silencing, for subsequent H3K27me3 addition, and for progression of zebrafish development beyond the ZGA stage. Importantly, developmental gene upregulation is not attributable to H3K27me3 loss, as maternal zygotic <italic>ezh2</italic> mutant zebrafish embryos do not precociously activate developmental genes during ZGA, and they progress through gastrulation without H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rougeot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">San et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">San et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, although upregulation of developmental genes in the presence of PRT4165 is clear, this involves ~16.6% of the developmental gene repertoire occupied by H2Aub1/Rnf2. Here, we suggest that tissue-specific activators for the majority of developmental genes are not present at ZGA.</p><p>Maternal loading of mRNA and proteins present challenges for functional experiments during early embryonic stages of development. Our use of the Rnf2 inhibitor, PRT4165, enabled us to test whether H2Aub1 impacts gene expression at ZGA, and whether H2Aub1 is required for the recruitment of Aebp2-PRC2 and for the subsequent establishment of H3K27me3 at developmental loci during postZGA. The observable impact of PRT4165 includes the loss of H2Aub1, the loss of Aebp2 recruitment to all loci that formerly bore H2Aub1, and the loss of H3K27me3 deposition at all developmental loci that are normally marked by H3K27me3 during postZGA. Our interpretation of these observations is that they are linked to, and dependent on, Rnf2 inhibition. However, it is important to note that PRT4165 may have off-target effects aside from inhibition of Rnf2 which may contribute to our observations. While we cannot formally account for possible off-target effects of PRT4165, we note that ZGA (which involves the activation of thousands of genes) progresses relatively normally, except for the upregulation of a cohort of developmental genes which were formerly H2Aub1 marked. This provides a measure of confidence that the upregulation of developmental genes is largely a direct consequence of H2Aub1 loss in the early embryo. However, as PRT4165 was the only approach we employed that successfully removed the vast majority of H2Aub1, future studies involving orthogonal approaches to elicit Rnf2 loss in zebrafish will be needed to further validate the consequences of H2Aub1 loss in early zebrafish embryos.</p><p>While our work was in review, work on H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 dynamics in the preimplantation mouse embryo was reported by two separate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mei et al., 2021</xref>). Both studies in mouse demonstrated that H2Aub1 temporally precedes H3K27me3 at developmental genes during early embryonic stages, and both studies also lowered H2Aub1 via one effective approach: either through maternal genetic loss of non-canonical PRC1 subunits (<italic>Pcgf1/6</italic>) or through overexpression of an H2A de-ubiquitinase (PR-DUB). Here, both approaches led to precocious transcription of a moderate subset of developmental genes at or shortly after ZGA. Thus, these sets of results align well with our observations in zebrafish.</p><p>Notably, each method of H2Aub1 perturbation in mice was unique (with attendant advantages and caveats) and conferred different impacts on embryogenesis and establishment of H3K27me3 at developmental loci. In mice, zygotic overexpression of PR-DUB resulted in rapid and significant erasure of H2Aub1, precocious transcription of certain developmental genes, and growth arrest at the four-cell stage. However, reduction of H2Aub1 by zygotic PR-DUB overexpression had minimal impact on H3K27me3, likely due to the fact that H3K27me3 is very low at the four-cell stage. In contrast, Mei et al. disrupted H2Aub1 via maternal genetic ablation (paternal genes remained intact) of two genes, <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic>, which encode subunits of noncanonical PRC1. Here, <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic> mutant oocytes were fertilized with wild-type sperm to produce maternal-null <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic> embryos. In contrast to PR-DUB overexpression, maternal-null <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic> embryos displayed global reductions in both H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 during cleavage stages – a finding that aligns well with our findings. Notably, the reductions of H2Aub1 and H3K27me3 from maternal <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic> loss largely returned to wild-type levels by the morula stage, possibly due to zygotically (and paternally) expressed <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic>. Here, we postulate that the more severe loss of H3K27me3 from <italic>Pcgf1/6</italic> deletion may stem from the temporal difference of disrupting H2Aub1 in the female germline vs. the early mouse embryo, or potentially the developmental stage in which H3K27me3 was assayed ( two cell vs. four cell). A major issue not addressed in these recent papers in mouse is how mechanistically H2Aub1 directs H3K27me3. Notably, our study addresses this mechanism by demonstrating that non-canonical PRC2 complex containing the H2Aub1 ‘reader’ Aebp2 occupies all loci with high H2Aub1 during postZGA, which then receive H3K27me3.</p><p>Interestingly, Chen et al. and Mei et al. utilized hybrid mouse strains to trace parental asymmetries of H3K27me3 and H2Aub1 in the early embryo. Here, both groups uncovered rapid erasure of H2Aub1 from the paternal genome shortly after fertilization which is re-established by the two-cell stage. Our data also demonstrate that the paternal genome is initially devoid of H2Aub1, and rapidly acquires H2Aub1 shortly after fertilization. However, zebrafish sperm are entirely devoid of H2Aub1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas mouse sperm bear H2Aub1 coincident with H3K27me3. Thus, the paternal genome in both mammals and zebrafish attain a transient state lacking H2Aub1 soon after fertilization – but arrive at that state by alternative routes.</p><p>Here, we observe that developmental or housekeeping gene promoters attract either a high- or low-level PRC1 binding, respectively. How ncPRC1 is recruited to CpG islands in ES cells is partially understood, as the ncPRC1 subunit Kdm2b helps recruit ncPRC1 to CpG islands of developmental genes. In this context, Kdm2b binds to hypomethylated CpGs via the CxxC motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). However, ncPRC1 is recruited robustly to only a minority of Kdm2b-bound CpG islands, implying that additional factors are needed to specify recruitment of ncPRC1 to CpG islands of developmental genes. Here, we speculate that particular TFs, such as the candidates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>, are likewise utilized in cooperation with zebrafish Kdm2b to enable strong focal recruitment of Rnf2-PRC1 to Placeholder-occupied developmental loci. In contrast, the candidate TFs at housekeeping genes would recruit MLL complexes to implement H3K4 methylation, and not Rnf2-PRC1. Thus, future work will explore which particular TFs recruit SRCAP (for Placeholder/H2A.Z installation), PRC1 (for H2Aub1 addition at developmental genes), or MLL complexes (for H3K4me3 modification at housekeeping genes) to define which specific genes are subjected to silencing or activation at ZGA.</p><p>One curiosity arising from our work is why zebrafish utilize the non-canonical PRC1 complex, which adds monoubiquitination to H2A/H2A.Z(FV), rather than canonical PRC1 complex, which compacts chromatin for initial developmental gene silencing. Here, we speculate that the rapid (~16 min) cell cycles that characterize the preZGA cleavage state – coupled to the need for continual DNA replication during cleavage stage – are not compatible with the compaction conferred by canonical PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the necessary substrate to recruit canonical PRC1 to chromatin, H3K27me3, is absent in preZGA embryos. Instead, the use of the repression modes conducted by non-canonical PRC1 addition of H2Aub1 – which antagonizes RNA Pol II transcriptional initiation or bursting – may help confer silencing without conferring a compaction that might impede DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobrinić et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stock et al., 2007</xref>). However, once embryos exit cleavage stage, the cell cycle greatly lengthens, and Aebp2-PRC2 complexes add H3K27me3 to loci – which may then enable canonical PRC1 to localize to H3K27me3-marked loci, and conduct compaction. Indeed, prior work has shown that later stages of zebrafish development utilize canonical PRC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rougeot et al., 2019</xref>). Here, future studies may reveal more precisely the logic and timing underlying the transition from non-canonical to canonical utilization of PRC complexes in zebrafish development.</p></sec><sec

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Charles K Kaufman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. This study first reported chromatin landscape changes in early zebrafish embryos at three distinct stages at preZGA, ZGA and postZGA stages, using a series of ChIP-seq experiments. This part of the results is of high quality, rigorously analyzed and clearly presented. The study then moved on and used a single drug to inhibit the enzyme with the hope to reduce ubH2A/Z mark. However, using the drug could lead to pleiotropic effect and cause general or secondary phenotypes. For example, this treatment leads to developmental arrest of embryogenesis at very early stage with low to no H3K27me3 mark, according to other data included in this work. Therefore, based on current results, it is hard to draw the conclusion for the causal connection from inhibiting RNF2 enzymatic function to the lack of ubH2A/Z, and subsequently to the lack of H3K27me3. In addition, due to the close interactions between these two Polycomb complexes (PRC1 and PRC2), the actual order could be reversed. Without a genetic experiment or more specific disruption assay, the conclusions should be carefully revised to be more balanced and reflect the caveats with the current results.</p><p>2. This sequential function of PRC1 and PRC2 has been reported in several other systems, including X inactivation and early embryogenesis in mice. The conceptual advance of this study could be extending this finding to another vertebrate system. However, due to the complications to draw conclusions (see #1 point), the Abstract and Discussion should be revised. Comparisons among these systems and research strategies should be further discussed.</p><p>3. H3K27me3 pattern should also be analyzed before ZGA. The authors detected a low level of H3K27me3 before ZGA using immunostaining. However, previous ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that H3K27me3 are present on promoters before ZGA in zebrafish (e.g. PMID: 22137762).</p><p>4. It is unclear whether Aebp2 is the sole subunit for the recruitment of PRC2 to ubH2A/Z-marked regions. Paralleled analysis of the changes for Aebp2 and H3K27me3 upon RNF2 inhibitor treatment should be performed. And Aebp2-dependent and -independent regions should be separately classified for data analysis.</p><p>5. The role of PRC1 on the temporal regulation of gene expression needs to be better elucidated. The authors only analyzed the RNA-seq results for RNF2 inhibitor treated embryos postZGA. Therefore, it is currently not clear if the role of PRC1 in transcriptional repression is restricted to this stage. RNA-seq analysis of RNF2 inhibitor treated embryos on other stages are also warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some specific points:</p><p>Page 8, line 159-169. I'm confused by the authors' description of the enhancer cluster 5. By visual inspection, this cluster apparently only shared very moderate H3K4me1 and H3K27ac levels. The authors should provide a quantitative analysis similar to Figure 1S2J.</p><p>Figure 1 and 2. In Figure 1A and 2A. WGBS data of the preZGA stage embryo was shown. Yet in Figure 1B and 2B, the WGBS data was designated to postZGA embryo. Please confirm that the labeling is correct.</p><p>Page 10, line 209. Only a representative genomic region is shown in Figure 4S2B. Global analysis of the distribution changes for H3K27me3 needs to be performed in parallel with Aebp2 ChIP-seq analysis in Figure 4C.</p><p>Figure 3 Only colocalization was observed, yet functional links are not established in this study. Therefore, it is justified to claim that Aebp2 mediates H3K27me3 deposition at the current stage. Overall, the contribution of Jarid2 was not examined in the current stage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To push the approach further, and not required for the current study, I wonder if another perturbation to test the model could be to delete key example genomic loci (or, perhaps even better, mutate Figure 1E candidate TF binding sites in the region?) to test for loss of proper Placeholder histone deposition. Or, engineer transgenic fish with developmental enhancer/promoter sequences in an ectopic location (or profile an existing transgenic around the time of ZGA) to show that they can drive establishment of the set of Placeholder chromatin/DNA marks that, in their model, delineate developmental gene loci that are silenced at the ZGA but will later be expressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67738.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The issues raised here include: 1) whether the inhibition of Rnf2 is appropriate functional evidence, and 2) whether we are confident in the order of H2Aub1 (PRC1 action) preceding H3K27me3 (PRC2 action).</p><p>First, regarding our inhibition experiments – our work, like the other two papers published in <italic>Nature Genetics</italic> (Mei et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021), each used one approach to lower H2Aub1. We agree that our approach could have off target effects, and now state that in the Discussion. We note, however, that the other two mouse papers likewise each took one approach to lower H2Aub1: one employed BAP overexpression, which arrested embryos at the 4-cell stage (when H3K27me3 is extremely low) and therefore could not assess whether H3K27me3 was impaired when H2Aub1 was lowered. The second employed maternal, but not paternal, genetic disruption of PRC1, which showed a transient lowering of H2Aub1 and H3K27me3, but restoration by the morula stage. Therefore, each approach has its advantages and limitations, which we now discuss in the revised Discussion. However, together, all three papers provide complementary evidence for the causal relationship.</p><p>We respectfully disagree that current evidence supports the notion that “the actual order (of PRC1/2 complexes) could be reversed”. Our evidence of PRC1/H2Aub1 preceding PRC2/H3K27me3 does not rely solely on the PRT4165 inhibitor experiment – it is fundamentally supported by the temporal relationships of the modifications. In preZGA embryos we clearly detect H2Aub1 by western and IF approaches, and importantly detect robust ChIP specifically at thousands of developmental genes. In contrast, we and almost all other investigators detect no H3K27me3 by Western or IF, nor can we and almost all others detect it at any genes. As detailed in point #3 below – the one paper that has claimed preZGA H3K27me3 (Lindemann et al., 2011) showed low H3K27me3 at only 83 genes during preZGA through ZGA, not at the thousands of developmental genes that bear H2Aub1 during preZGA through ZGA. Thus, the vast majority of the evidence points strongly to H3K27me3 being virtually absent during preZGA, whereas we show the clear presence of H2Aub1, and its residence at large numbers of developmental genes during preZGA.</p><p>We will note here (and briefly in the Discussion) that the lack of H3K27me3 has no measurable effect on the progression of zebrafish embryos through gastrulation, and through 24hpf, at which they display a normal body plan and organogenesis (though fail by 48hrs). This was determined in work published by L. Kamminga and colleagues (Rougeot et al., Development 2019; on which we were co-authors) using maternal zygotic <italic>ezh2</italic> null mutations. Thus, H3K27me3 appears to play only minor roles until late stages of development, where it acts in a canonical manner.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a complementary approach would help to validate our results with the inhibitor, and we expended significant effort on this issue during revision. Regarding alternative inhibitors, PRT4165 is currently the only commercially available inhibitor of Rnf2. In the absence of alternative inhibitors, we attempted genetic approaches, beginning with the expression of a minimal version of the H2A deubiquitinase complex, PR-DUB in early zebrafish embryos. Here, single-cell stage zebrafish embryos were microinjected with mRNA encoding the two essential subunits of PR-DUB, <italic>bap1</italic> and <italic>asxl2</italic>, to disrupt H2A/Zub1. As a negative control we utilized a point mutant of <italic>bap1</italic> that abolishes catalytic activity. Injected embryos were allowed to develop to 4hpf and subsequently subjected to western blot analysis to assay H2Aub1 abundance. Unfortunately, this approach yielded no appreciable change in bulk levels of H2Aub1 compared to control, despite attempting multiple different doses of the <italic>bap1</italic> and <italic>asxl2</italic> mRNAs. Importantly, we validated (by an installed V5 tag) by Western analysis that the proteins were each expressed. Here, we reason that additional factors (beyond the two we expressed) might be needed to create a fully active (or properly targeted) BAP/ASXL2 complex and/or that inhibitors of BAP1 might be present that prevented enzymatic activity. Regardless, the inability to greatly lower H2A/Zub1 precluded further analyses.</p><p>As a tertiary approach to lower H2A/Zub1, we micro-injected single-cell stage zebrafish embryos with a mutant <italic>h2af/z</italic> mRNA encoding and form of H2A.Z that cannot be ubiquitinated. We also injected wild-type <italic>h2af/z</italic> as a negative control. Unfortunately, our Western analyses showed that we were not able to arrive at protein levels derived from the injected species that approached the large stores of WT H2A.Z protein present in the embryo, so competition was not achieved, and H2A/Zub1 was not lowered.</p><p>Taken together, our work parallels the work earlier this year from two groups who each took one effective approach to lower H2AUb1: ours with PRT4165 and theirs with BAP1/ASXL1 overexpression or a PRC1 maternal-specific mutant approach. Each approach has advantages and caveats, and the reviewer rightly points out that our approach can have off target affects. Therefore, we have included this caveat and how it may affect our interpretations accordingly in the revised paper (see Discussion, and also point #2, below). Specifically, in the Discussion of the revised manuscript we state:</p><p>“However, it is important to note that PRT4165 may have off-target effects aside from inhibition of Rnf2 which may contribute to our observations.” (page 16, line #336-337)</p><p>and</p><p>“However, as PRT4165 was the only approach we employed that successfully removed the vast majority of H2Aub1, future studies involving orthogonal approaches to elicit Rnf2 loss in zebrafish will be needed to further validate the consequences of H2Aub1 loss in early zebrafish embryos” (page 16 and line #342-345).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. This sequential function of PRC1 and PRC2 has been reported in several other systems, including X inactivation and early embryogenesis in mice. The conceptual advance of this study could be extending this finding to another vertebrate system. However, due to the complications to draw conclusions (see #1 point), the Abstract and Discussion should be revised. Comparisons among these systems and research strategies should be further discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed precedent for that order in X chromosome inactivation in ES cells, and we have cited that work in the revision. In addition, the work published earlier this year in <italic>Nature Genetics</italic> that determines the order for the X chromosome and developmental genes in mouse embryos is now discussed in the revised version (pages 16-18, lines 346-383, and see below). However, at the time when we submitted our work, the order of polycomb complex action at developmental genes was not known. Our manuscript was submitted and progressed to full review at <italic>eLife</italic> (and was posted on the BioRxiv) prior to the work in mice being published in <italic>Nature Genetics</italic>. Therefore, we hope that the novelty and conceptual advance of the work will be assessed based on our date of submission.</p><p>The recent mouse work (in <italic>Nature Genetics</italic>) on H2AUb inhibition in mice strongly supports our work in zebrafish, and we have now included those papers in the Discussion of our revised paper (pages 16-18, lines 346-383). Indeed, their methods for reducing H2AUb1 in mouse embryos led to upregulation of developmental genes, in keeping with our observations. Regarding novelty, our work goes much further, as only our paper addresses the mechanism by which H2AUb1 is ‘read’ in the early embryo by a non-canonical PRC2 complex (bearing Aebp2) to place H3K27me3 on developmental genes. Therefore, we believe our work has conceptual advances both in the areas of overlap, and also in unique aspects related to PRC2 targeting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. H3K27me3 pattern should also be analyzed before ZGA. The authors detected a low level of H3K27me3 before ZGA using immunostaining. However, previous ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that H3K27me3 are present on promoters before ZGA in zebrafish (e.g. PMID: 22137762).</p></disp-quote><p>The paper referred to (Lindeman et al., 2011; PMID 22137762) is an interesting and influential paper in the field, however some of the interpretations have required revisiting. The Lindeman paper does claim that H3K27me3 can be found on developmental promotes during preZGA. However, the key questions are – how many promoters, what fraction of promoters, and how robust is the marking? The Lindeman paper and follow-up work by us and others (Zhang et al., <italic>Genome Research</italic> 2014; Zhang et al., <italic>Molecular Cell</italic>, 2018), agree that there are &gt;3500 developmental genes marked by H3K27me3 in postZGA. However, the Lindeman data claims that only 201 genes are marked by H3K27me3 in preZGA embryos (DocumentS2, Table S1; Venn Diagrams in Lindeman et al., 2011; PMID 22137762). Also, one expects that if the purpose of that H3K27me3 involves gene poising, it should be stable and last into postZGA – and when one queries their data and asks how many genes bear H3K27me3 from preZGA through postZGA, the number drops to 83 genes. These 83 genes are extremely few compared to the &gt;3,500 genes marked in postZGA embryos by H3K27me3 in the Lindeman data and Zhang data. Also, these 83 H3K27me3 genes show very low median ChIP signal during preZGA (less than 2-fold enrichment) and only show clear (&gt;4-fold enrichment) during postZGA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67738-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Importantly, we emphasize that H3K27me3 ChIP experiments from the Schier lab (Vastenheow et al., <italic>Nature</italic>, 2010), Wei Xie’s lab (Zhang et al., <italic>Molecular Cell</italic>, 2018) and our lab (described as ‘data not shown’ in Murphy et al., <italic>Cell</italic> 2018) did not reveal any peaks for H3K27me3 during preZGA. Furthermore, both our IF data (this work; Figure 1, FigureS1, Panel B) and Zhang et al., 2018 (Supplemental Figure S1A) fail to show H3K27me3 signal preZGA. Taken together, work from several labs supports the view that there is extremely low H3K27me3 in the genome at preZGA, which has resulted either in a lack of ChIP peaks preZGA (Schier, Xie and Cairns labs) or detection of very low H3K27me3 at a very small number of loci (~83-201; Lindeman et al). However, all groups agree that after ZGA, H3K27me3 increases dramatically, enabling clear detection at &gt;3500 genes. Therefore, the much larger questions – addressed in our work – are how &gt;3500 developmental genes are silenced at ZGA (we show it is H2AUb1, not H3K27me3), and how those &gt;3500 obtain high H3K27me3 (we show it is by non-canonical PRC2 binding to H2AUb1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is unclear whether Aebp2 is the sole subunit for the recruitment of PRC2 to ubH2A/Z-marked regions. Paralleled analysis of the changes for Aebp2 and H3K27me3 upon RNF2 inhibitor treatment should be performed. And Aebp2-dependent and -independent regions should be separately classified for data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising these important points, which we have addressed. Previous data including the very nice recent cryo-EM structure of the non-canonical PRC2 complex bound to H2Aub1+ nucleosomes from Eva Nogales’ group (Kasinath et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2021), indicates that Aebp2 is not the sole subunit involved in recruitment of PRC2 to H2A/Zub1. Rather, Aebp2 and Jarid2 subunits of ncPRC2 both contribute to recruitment of PRC2 via direct contacts with H2A/Zub1. However, we note that the PRC2 complex can be isolated from cells or produced in a recombinant form with Aebp2, but lacking Jarid2 (Cao et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2002; Ciferri et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2012) – suggesting that these proteins are not together in all PRC2 complexes, and that Aebp2 assembles well into PRC2 without Jarid2. Accordingly, we have modified the text of our manuscript to clarify that Aebp2 is not the sole PRC2 subunit involved in recruitment to H2A/Zub1+ nucleosomes.</p><p>To investigate the overlap between Aebp2 and Jarid2 concept further, we performed ChIP-seq of Jarid2 in postZGA embryos. We have included our Jarid2 ChIP profiling into our manuscript in Figure 3 —figure supplement 2. Although the ChIP signal and dynamic range were modest, the majority of Jarid2 sites overlap with Aebp2-bound sites, supporting the notion that these two proteins may work together at a portion of PRC2-bound sites. However, given the modest ChIP signal of Jarid2, we do not believe that highly quantitative statements about binding selectivity can be made.</p><p>Next, as requested – we reanalyzed our ChIP-seq data for Aebp2 and H3K27me3 upon Rnf2 inhibition in a paralleled manner. This was an important addition to the paper. This paired Aebp2/H3K27me3 analysis has been incorporated into new Figure 4 and reflected in the text of the manuscript. The clear result is that the same places that lose Aebp2 binding (following the loss of H2AUb1) also lose H3K27me3. We believe this revised way of presenting the data conveys the result much clearer than the previous version of Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The role of PRC1 on the temporal regulation of gene expression needs to be better elucidated. The authors only analyzed the RNA-seq results for RNF2 inhibitor treated embryos postZGA. Therefore, it is currently not clear if the role of PRC1 in transcriptional repression is restricted to this stage. RNA-seq analysis of RNF2 inhibitor treated embryos on other stages are also warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an interesting question, which also addresses whether the removal of H2AUb from developmental genes might enable their activation during preZGA, which would confer to developmental genes the status/privilege of ‘minor wave’ genes. To address this question, we performed RNA-seq at preZGA and ZGA timepoints with embryos treated with the RNF2 inhibitor (PRT4165) or vehicle control (DMSO) and examined whether precocious transcription of developmental genes occurred prior to post ZGA. This work has been incorporated into our revised manuscript in Figure 4 —figure supplement 3. GO-term analysis of genes meeting our threshold criteria (p-value ≤0.01, fold change ≥1.5) uncovered no enrichment of developmental gene activation upon RNF2 inhibition prior to postZGA. Instead, enriched GO-terms of upregulated transcripts correspond to RNA-binding and ribosomal protein genes. Thus, chromatin de-repression (via H2Aub1 removal) does not cause precocious transcriptional activation of developmental genes until postZGA (4hpf).</p><p>Here, we reason that the observed precocious transcription of developmental genes at postZGA in embryos treated with PRT4165 relies on binding of opportunistic transcriptional activators. However, these activators may be temporally constrained during preZGA by: 1) translation of mRNA encoding these factor(s) and/or 2) chromatin remodeling events needed to expose binding sites for opportunistic activators.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some specific points:</p><p>Page 8, line 159-169. I'm confused by the authors' description of the enhancer cluster 5. By visual inspection, this cluster apparently only shared very moderate H3K4me1 and H3K27ac levels. The authors should provide a quantitative analysis similar to Figure 1S2J.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, which also raised a comment from Reviewer #1. There are two points of clarification to make here. First, we now clarify in the manuscript that DNAme patterns are essentially identical/static from 2.5hpf (preZGA) to 4.3hpf (postZGA). On Page 5, line 100 we now state:</p><p>“For our comparisons to DNA methylation (DNAme), we note that DNAme patterns are reprogrammed between fertilization and the preZGA (2.5hpf) timepoint (Potok et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2013), but remain static in zebrafish embryos from 2.5 hpf (preZGA) to 4.3 hpf (postZGA). Therefore, for brevity we chose to display only a single timepoint for DNAme data in subsequent figures, which is representative of all developmental stages examined by the genomics approaches in this work”.</p><p>Second, our reference to H3K27ac being very high refers specifically to enhancer cluster 5 in the postZGA state. Thus, H3K27me3 is very high, and these loci are DNA methylated (DNAme shown for preZGA, but identical/methylated in postZGA).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 and 2. In Figure 1Aand2A. WGBS data of the preZGA stage embryo was shown. Yet in Figure 1B and 2B, the WGBS data was designated to postZGA embryo. Please confirm that the labeling is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. The labeling is correct. As noted above, the DNA methylation state remains constant at enhancers and promoters from preZGA to postZGA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 10, line 209. Only a representative genomic region is shown in Figure 4S2B. Global analysis of the distribution changes for H3K27me3 needs to be performed in parallel with Aebp2 ChIP-seq analysis in Figure 4C.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have addressed: Figure 4 has been largely revised to examine the changes in localization of Aebp2 and H3K27me3 in parallel, as also requested in the list of unified comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 Only colocalization was observed, yet functional links are not established in this study. Therefore, it is justified to claim that Aebp2 mediates H3K27me3 deposition at the current stage. Overall, the contribution of Jarid2 was not examined in the current stage.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, our functional link is that when H2Aub1 is prevented (via PRT4165), Aebp2 fails to occupy all sites that formerly had H2Aub1, and H3K27me3 is not deposited at those same loci – which is now much more clearly displayed through the revised analyses present in Figure 4.</p><p>The reviewer raises an interesting issue in their request to examine Jarid2. Here, although the Jarid2 antibody and resulting ChIP signal was not as robust as with our potent Aebp2 antibody (limiting highly quantitative conclusions) the majority of Jarid2 targets were also Aebp2 targets – consistent with Aebp2 and Jarid2 working together for H2Aub1 recognition (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To push the approach further, and not required for the current study, I wonder if another perturbation to test the model could be to delete key example genomic loci (or, perhaps even better, mutate Figure 1E candidate TF binding sites in the region?) to test for loss of proper Placeholder histone deposition. Or, engineer transgenic fish with developmental enhancer/promoter sequences in an ectopic location (or profile an existing transgenic around the time of ZGA) to show that they can drive establishment of the set of Placeholder chromatin/DNA marks that, in their model, delineate developmental gene loci that are silenced at the ZGA but will later be expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments. In the future we will use Crispr-CAS9 mediated targeting of transcription factors and histone modifications to test these interesting questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
