sensor that serves to initiate antiviral innate immunity by triggering stress granule (SG) formation. However, the regulation of the NF90-SG pathway remains largely unclear. We found that Tim-3, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90 and inhibits NF90-SG-mediated antiviral immunity. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection induces the up-regulation and activation of Tim-3 in macrophages, which in turn recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM47 to the zinc finger domain of NF90 and initiate a proteasome-dependent degradation via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys297. Targeted inactivation of Tim-3 enhances the NF90 downstream SG formation by selectively increasing the phosphorylation of protein kinase R and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α, the expression of SG markers G3BP1 and TIA-1, and protecting mice from VSV challenge. These findings provide insights into the crosstalk between Tim-3 and other receptors in antiviral innate immunity and its related clinical significance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Tim-3</kwd><kwd>virus sensor</kwd><kwd>NF90</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>antiviral innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Gencheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004826</institution-id><institution>Beijing Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7192145</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Gencheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Gencheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tim-3 promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90, a novel virus sensor, and negatively regulates the NF90-SG pathway-mediated antiviral innate immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against viral infection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), are main sensors in defending virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). PRR-mediated downstream signaling pathways initiating an anti-viral innate immune response is the classic anti-virus infection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbalat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McFadden et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, studies have found that nuclear factor 90 (NF90), which is encoded by interleukin enhancer-binding factor-3, is a critical sensor for invading viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shabman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pfeifer et al., 2008</xref>). NF90 is an evolutionarily conserved member of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding protein family and is abundantly expressed in various mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Patiño et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Masuda et al., 2013</xref>). As an important antiviral pathway, NF90 recognizes virus dsRNA and triggers the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are composed of cytoplasmic particles including ribonucleoproteins, RNA-binding proteins, and translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shi et al., 2007</xref>). Unfortunately, a growing number of virus families modulate SG formation and function to maximize replication efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">White and Lloyd, 2012</xref>). Therefore, an understanding of the precise regulation mechanisms of NF90-SG signaling for efficient viral clearance without harmful immunopathology is needed.</p><p>Upon sensing virus, NF90 induces the phosphorylation of dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). Then SGs form following PKR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which induces the expression of G3BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tsai et al., 2017</xref>) (Ras-GAP SH3-binding protein-1) and TIA-1 (T-cell intracellular antigen-1), two key markers in SGs. The activated eIF2α co-operates with other components of SGs to block virus mRNA translation. Despite acting as an important virus sensor and trigger of SG formation, how NF90 is regulated remains largely unknown.</p><p>Tim-3, encoded by the hepatitis A virus cellular receptor two gene (<italic>Havcr2</italic>), is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that was first identified in activated T cells. Later, Tim-3 was also found to be expressed in innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Establishment of Tim-3 as an exhaustion marker in immune cells of both tumors and infectious diseases makes Tim-3 an attractive target for immunotherapy similar to PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2015</xref>), CTLA-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stamper et al., 2001</xref>), and Siglec-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rangachari et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, a report showed that increased Tim-3 expression on immune cells in patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with an exhaustion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diao et al., 2020</xref>). However, Tim-3 does not have an inhibitory motif within its tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van de Weyer et al., 2006</xref>), and the mechanism by which Tim-3 mediates inhibitory signaling remains largely unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2015</xref> showed that CEACAM1 is a heterophilic ligand of Tim-3 and is required for Tim-3 to mediate T cell inhibition and that Bat-3 acts as a safety catch, which blocks Tim-3-mediated inhibitory signals in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rangachari et al., 2012</xref>). Potentiating anti-infection immunity by inducing innate immune responses is a promising area of infection therapy. However, little is known about Tim-3 signaling in innate immune cells.</p><p>Ubiquitination is one of the most versatile posttranslational modifications and is indispensable for antiviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heaton et al., 2016</xref>). Increasing evidences suggest that ubiquitination plays important roles in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation and antiviral innate signaling. Posttranslational modification of many signaling molecules, including TRAF3/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Song et al., 2016a</xref>), IRF3/7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yu and Hayward, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and NLRP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Song et al., 2016b</xref>), involved in TLR, RLR, and NLR pathways by different types of ubiquitination plays key roles in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity. However, whether NF90, a molecule containing a ubiquitin-binding domain (domain associated with zinc fingers, DZF), undergoes ubiquitination remains unclear.</p><p>Here we found that Tim-3 was involved in innate immunity against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by promoting the proteasomal degradation of NF90 via the tripartite motif-containing protein 47 (TRIM47)-mediated conjugation of K48-linked ubiquitin. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time demonstrating ubiquitination as a new posttranslational modification mechanism of NF90. Our findings shed a new light on the Tim-3-mediated immune tolerance during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tim-3 interacts with and inhibits NF90</title><p>To test whether Tim-3 is involved in the innate immunity against viruses, we challenged macrophages with VSV, an RNA virus widely used for investigating anti-viral immunity in both mouse and human models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Shortly after VSV challenge, the expression of Tim-3 was upregulated in macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The phosphorylation of Tim-3, which accounts for the Tim-3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van de Weyer et al., 2006</xref>), was also tested. There was a time-dependent enhancement of Tim-3 phosphorylation in HEK293T cells transfected with Tim-3 and challenged with VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Tim-3 was encoded by <italic>Havcr2</italic>, which was inactivated to generate Tim-3 knockout (Tim-3KO) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To evaluate the role of VSV-activated Tim-3 in host antiviral innate immune response, macrophages from Tim-3KO mice and from wild-type (WT) mice and the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 with a knockdown of Tim-3 (si-Tim-3) were challenged with VSV. Both knockout and knockdown of Tim-3 in macrophages led to a decreased VSV load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).

Among the candidates, NF90, an RNA-binding protein involved in anti-infection and anti-tumor immunity, received the highest score and the highest number of matched peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm the interaction between Tim-3 and NF90, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with NF90 and Tim-3 and immunoprecipitation was conducted targeting either Tim-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) or NF90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); all confirmed the interaction between Tim-3 and NF90. The interaction sites of Tim-3 interacting with NF90 were subsequently examined. The results showed that 4Y/F mutants of Tim-3 (Y265F, Y272F, Y280F, Y281F) weakened the binding of Tim-3 with NF90, while deletion of the intracellular domain of Tim-3 (△IC) resulted in the loss of binding activity of Tim-3 with NF90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). These data showed that Tim-3 interacts with NF90 through its intracellular domain, in which Y265, Y272, Y280, and Y281 play an important role. We finally evaluated the effects of Tim-3 on NF90 expression. In HEK293T cells transfected with Tim-3 or in macrophages from Tim-3 transgenic (Tim-3-TG) mice, the overexpression of Tim-3 decreased the expression of NF90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

However, whether NF90 undergoes proteasomal degradation is totally unknown. To find the mechanisms by which Tim-3 inhibits NF90 expression, we tested whether NF90 undergoes ubiquitination and if so, whether Tim-3 is involved. Macrophages isolated from WT and Tim-3-TG mice were challenged by VSV for 4 hr and the ubiquitination of NF90 was examined. Interestingly, the total ubiquitination and the k48-linked ubiquitination of NF90 were significantly increased in macrophages from Tim-3-TG mice compared to those from WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). When NF90, K48-Ub, or Tim-3 was transfected into HEK293T cells, NF90 underwent K48-linked ubiquitination, which can be enhanced by co-transfected Tim-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The results suggested that Tim-3 may inhibit NF90 by enhancing the K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of NF90. We then explored the domain of NF90 for ubiquitination using constructions encoding the DZF domain, full-length NF90 or NF90 lacking the DZF domain (△DZF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and found that the DZF domain of NF90 was dominantly ubiquitinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, when the plasmid of Tim-3 was co-transfected with different NF90 constructs, the data revealed that Tim-3 specially enhanced the ubiquitination of DZF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The reason why the DZF-only construct is strongly ubiquitinated compared to the full-length construct of NF90 may lie in the conformational hindrance in NF90 at a steady state, which needs to be demonstrated in the future. These results demonstrated that NF90 can be ubiquitinated at the DZF domain, and the process can be enhanced by Tim-3, suggesting that Tim-3 may suppress NF90 by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Tim-3 promotes the ubiquitination of NF90 at the DZF domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tim-3 enhances the ubiquitination of NF90 in macrophages in response to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenges. Peritoneal macrophages in wild-type (WT) and Tim-3-TG mice were infected with VSV for 4 hr and cells were treated with MG132 (20 ug/ml) for 6 hr before harvesting protein lysates, followed by western blot analysis of the total Ub and K48-linked Ub of NF90 immunoprecipitated with antibody to ILF3 (NF90).

The mechanisms by which these receptors are regulated are widely investigated in hopes of developing effective treatments. NF90 was found to play an important role in host innate immunity against various virus infections. However, the regulation of NF90 under physiopathological conditions remains largely unclear. Here we have identified a novel negative regulation mechanism of NF90, which could be employed by VSV to evade the immune attack. The VSV-activated Tim-3 in turn promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of NF90 and subsequently inhibits the formation and antiviral activity of downstream SGs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that NF90 undergoes ubiquitination and also the critical domain (DZF) and critical site (Lys297) of NF90 for Tim-3- and E3 l<bold>i</bold>gase TRIM47-mediated ubiquitination and degradation.</p><p>NF90, like the classical PRRs, is considered a novel virus sensor, exerting an important role in host innate immunity against various viral infections, especially negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). One report showed that NF90 is required for an efficient response against VSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pfeifer et al., 2008</xref>), but the underlying mechanism has not been clarified. Other reports have shown that NF90 interacted with the VP35 protein of Ebola virus (EBOV) and inhibited EBOV infection through impairing the function of the EBOV transcription/replication complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shabman et al., 2011</xref>). Knockdown of NF90 in indicated cells dramatically promotes EBOV and influenza virus replication, while overexpression of NF90 inhibits or impacts replication of these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shabman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). When the signaling cascades were investigated, SGs, not the interferon pathway, served as the downstream signaling cascade of the NF90 antiviral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shabman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pfeifer et al., 2008</xref>). NF90 promotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Meunier et al., 2014</xref>) the assemblage of SG and synergizes with other proteins to exert antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). These reports support our findings that NF90 inhibits VSV replication via SGs and further demonstrate the critical role of the NF90-SG signaling pathway during an antiviral immune response.</p><p>Tim-3 is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that was initially found to be expressed on activated Th1 cells by binding with its ligand Gal-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dardalhon et al., 2010</xref>). Tim-3 induces apoptosis and T cell tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nakayama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sarraj et al., 2014</xref>). Most investigations focus on the roles of Tim-3 in maintaining T cell exhaustion in immune disorders, tumors, or infectious diseases, which means that this checkpoint inhibitor could be abused. Recently, our works and other published data have focused on the roles of Tim-3 in maintaining the homeostasis of innate immune cells and have demonstrated that the dysregulated Tim-3 on innate immune cells also contributes to the immune evasion of many tumors or pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Innate immune cells have now attracted much attention for developing new therapeutic strategies against infectious or tumor diseases, in which innate immune cell-expressed immune checkpoint inhibitors are potential targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han et al., 2013</xref>). Here we have found that Tim-3 suppresses the macrophage-mediated antiviral immune response, suggesting that it is a potent therapeutic target for re-boosting innate immunity against viruses. However, as Tim-3 does not possess an obviously classical Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Inhibition Motif (ITIM)motif compared with other immune-checkpoint receptors, such as PD-1, CTLA-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Stålhammar et al., 2019</xref>), and Siglec-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), the mechanism by which Tim-3 mediates inhibitory signals remains unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huang et al., 2015</xref> showed that Tim-3 induces T cell exhaustion via Human leucocyte antigen B associated transcript (BAT) and using CEACAM1 as a coreceptor, and our findings have shown that Tim-3 promotes tumor-prone macrophage polarization by binding to and suppressing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>) Further, Tim-3 inhibits TLR4-mediated macrophage activation during sepsis by suppressing NF-kB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). How Tim-3 works during anti-viral innate immunity remains unclear. The intracellular tail of Tim-3 contains a highly conserved tyrosine-containing src homology 2 (SH2)-binding motif, and tyrosine residues within this motif can be phosphorylated, which is critical for Tim-3 signaling in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we have identified an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Tim-3 in macrophages following VSV infection. We have also demonstrated that deletion of Tim-3 tail or mutation of the conserved tyrosines, including Tyr265, Tyr272, Tyr280, and Try281, within Tim-3 tail significantly attenuated the interaction between Tim-3 and NF90. These data demonstrated a new mechanism by which Tim-3 transduces inhibitory signal in anti-viral innate immune responses.</p><p>Ubiquitination is one of the most versatile posttranslational modifications for substrates and is indispensable for antiviral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Callis, 2014</xref>). However, whether NF90 undergoes ubiquitination is totally unknown. Structurally, NF90 possesses a DZF in the N-terminal region, which is a symbol of ubiquitination for substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). Here we have verified our hypothesis and demonstrated that NF90 can be ubiquitinated, a process that is enhanced by Tim-3 in macrophages following VSV infection. As speculated, Tim-3 mainly promotes the ubiquitination of the DZF domain of NF90. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that NF90 undergoes ubiquitination. Further, we have also found that Lys297, a highly conserved residue among different isoforms of NF90, plays a critical role in the K-48-linked ubiquitination of NF90.</p><p>When the candidates accounting for NF90 ubiquitination were examined, we focused on TRIM47 as it got the highest scores and the highest number of matched peptides among NF90-interacting proteins, and structurally, TRIM47 contains a RING finger domain in the N-terminus, which may contribute to ubiquitin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ji et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, TRIM family proteins play important roles in many biological processes, such as cell cycle regulation and viral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As discussed above, the conserved tyrosines within the Tim-3 tail could form an SH2 (SRC homology 2)-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rangachari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van de Weyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). We posit that Tim-3 may recruit TRIM47 using its SH2-binding domain as the tyrosines are phosphorylated following VSV infection. A recent report showing that Siglec-G triggers downstream signaling by recruiting SHP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) supports this hypothesis. Here we have demonstrated that TRIM47 dose-dependently promotes the proteasome-dependent degradation of NF90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, no well-defined ligase-dead TRIM47 construct(s) has been reported so far. The mechanisms by which TRIM47 promotes NF90 degradation remain to be determined in the future. Interestingly, our data showed that Tim-3 enhances the expression and ubiquitination of TRIM47. This is also the first report showing the ubiquitination modification of TRIM47. However, the mechanisms of Tim-3-enhanced TRIM47 ubiquitination and whether the enhanced ubiquitination of TRIM47 by Tim-3 accounts for the increased TRIM47 expression remain to be determined.</p><p>In summary, we have verified that Tim-3 is specifically upregulated following VSV infection and inhibits NF90 signaling pathway in macrophages. Intracellularly, Tim-3 promotes TRIM47-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of NF90. In VSV-infected models, Tim-3 signaling inhibits the formation and the activity of the NF90 downstream SGs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the ubiquitination modification of NF90. These findings provide a novel mechanism of Tim-3-mediated infection tolerance, which has implications in antiviral applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The Tim-3-TG mice were produced and fed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>).

Mass spectrometry was used to identify Tim-3-interacting proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>qPCR and RNAi knockdown</title><p>Gene expression was analyzed by three-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qPCR). Total RNA was extracted from mouse macrophages using TRI reagent (Sigma). Following the manufacturer’s instructions, RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20 μl reaction volume (42°C, 30 min; 95°C, 5 min) using a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was then amplified using a SYBR Green I Master mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and a Light Cycler 480 PCR system (Roche). All tests were carried out in duplicate reaction mixtures in 96-well plates. The relative expression of the gene of interest was determined using the 2<sup>–ΔΔCt</sup> method, with 18S ribosomal mRNA (18S) as the internal control. The primers used for qPCR are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>Peritoneal macrophage cells grown on specific confocal dishes were infected with VSV for 6 hr. Thereafter, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1× Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, then incubated in blocking buffer (1× TBST with 3% bovine serum albumin), and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The cells were washed three times with 1× TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 for 2 hr at room temperature (ZSGB-BIO，China) and washed again three times with 1× TBST. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (SouthernBiotech; 0100–20) for 10 min, and then the dishes were visualized with a C1-si confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The overlap coefficient, area/diameter of SG dots, and line intensity were calculated with Image-Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD,).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The significance of difference between groups was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test and two-way analysis of variance test. For the mouse survival study, Kaplan–Meier survival curves were generated and analyzed for statistical significance with GraphPad Prism 6.0. p-values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Prof. Minghong Jiang, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China, for critical reading.

They initially discovered that the checkpoint protein Tim3 was both induced upon viral infection and that loss of Tim3 is protective against the infection. Mechanistically, the authors used biochemical and cell-based approaches to discover that Tim3 binds NF90 and promotes its degradation via ubiquitination mediated by the E3 ligase TRIM47. The authors further assess the functional consequence of Tim3-mediated inhibition of NF90. As NF90 has known roles in stress granule formation, the authors demonstrated that loss of Tim3 expression is associated with increased NF90, which correlated with increased phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a and induction of stress granule markers. To demonstrate biological relevance, the authors reveal that mice lacking Tim3 are more resistant to VSV infection.</p><p>Strengths include diverse experimental approaches, including in vivo work, to identify and characterize the TIM3-TRIM47-NF90 axis. Weaknesses include lack of a few key experiments that will help support what is already a strong study. The impact of the work is fundamental new insight into the pathways regulating an important mechanism of viral control.</p><p>1. What are the effects of Tim3 on VSV titers?

In Figure 3D, why does the full-length protein not appear to be ubiquitinated while the DZF only construct is strongly ubiquitinated?</p><p>3. For the TRIM47 experiments, can the authors generate a ligase-dead TRIM47 to firmly conclude that it is the E3 ligase activity of this protein, and not some other cellular interactor that mediates NF90 degradation. Additionally, can the authors discuss why K63-Ub was examined in the context of TRIM47 as opposed to K48, etc? The details of this specific choice were not clearly outlined in the text.</p><p>4. In both the cell culture models and the in vivo studies, direct visualization of stress granules by immunofluorescence in Tim3+ and Tim- cells/mice would be more compelling that SG RNA marker induction, as it's not clear what threshold of mRNA is needed to actually form the SGs. Since the authors are making the claim that the viral phenotypes are mediated via by Tim3-dependent effects on NF90-induced SG formation, some demonstration of SG formation in the cell/tissue would provide stronger evidence for the mechanism.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors provide data on a cross-talk between the immune checkpoint molecule Tim-3 in macrophages and the viral sensor NF90 in the context of VSV infection. In particular, they demonstrate (by using cell lines and primary cells) that VSV infection leads to increased expression and activation of Tim-3, Tim-3 interacts with NF90 via its cytoplasmic tail and enhances NF90 ubiquitination by recruitment of TRIM47.Subsequently, NF90 is degraded and VSV replication is increased. Thus, Tim-3 can mediate viral escape in VSV infection. With this, the authors provide a novel viral escape mechanism involving the previously described immune checkpoint molecule Tim-3 and NF90 in macrophages. Although the authors thoroughly identified key players within this viral escape pathway future studies are required to comprehensively resolve subsequent steps within this pathway. The manuscript is well written and structured and the data appear reliable.</p><p>Specific suggestions to the authors:</p><p>1. Figure 1: Quantification of the Tim-3 protein expression (either by densitometric WB analysis or flow cytometry) as well as a prolonged time-course analyzing the expression (mRNA and protein) in the same experimental system (RAW264.7 versus primary macrophages) would clarify the kinetics and strength of Tim-3 regulation by VSV. This will add insights into the potential of NF90 regulation by Tim-3 during VSV infection.</p><p>2. Line 138: The described data of NF90 ubiquitination in primary mouse macrophages should be provided and not just stated &quot;data not shown&quot;.</p><p>3. Please indicate the exact number of independent experiments that were performed for each data set.</p><p>4. Line 602: Typo F instead of E.</p><p>5.
