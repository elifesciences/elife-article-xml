regulating protein turnover. They are involved in a wide range of cellular activities and are emerging therapeutic targets for cancer and other diseases. Drugs targeting USP1 and USP30 are in clinical development for cancer and kidney disease respectively. However, the majority of substrates and pathways regulated by DUBs remain unknown, impeding efforts to prioritize specific enzymes for research and drug development. To assemble a knowledgebase of DUB activities, co-dependent genes, and substrates, we combined targeted experiments using CRISPR libraries and inhibitors with systematic mining of functional genomic databases. Analysis of the Dependency Map, Connectivity Map, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and multiple protein-protein interaction databases yielded specific hypotheses about DUB function, a subset of which were confirmed in follow-on experiments. The data in this paper are browsable online in a newly developed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/">DUB Portal</ext-link> and promise to improve understanding of DUBs as a family as well as the activities of incompletely characterized DUBs (e.g. USPL1 and USP32) and those already targeted with investigational cancer therapeutics (e.g. USP14, UCHL5, and USP7).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>deubiquitinating enzyme</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>Cancer Dependency Map</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-CA225088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sorger</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA211681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buhrlage</surname><given-names>Sara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF2010255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gyori</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1745303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doherty</surname><given-names>Laura M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-HL127365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sorger</surname><given-names>Peter K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The integration of experimental and data mining approaches provides novel insights into deubiquitinating enzymes individually and as a gene family.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are a family of ~100 proteases (in humans) that cleave ubiquitin from protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komander et al., 2009</xref>). They are essential components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which regulates protein turn-over in cells by tagging polypeptide substrates with poly-ubiquitin chains. These poly-ubiquitin chains involve linkages between the C terminus of one ubiquitin molecule (of 76 amino acids) and one of seven lysine residues or N-terminal methionine on the next ubiquitin molecule. Lysine 48-linked chains are among the ones recognized by the proteasome, resulting in degradation of the substrate. The primary function of DUBs in this process is to remove ubiquitin molecules from substrates, thereby protecting them from proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nandi et al., 2006</xref>). However, ubiquitination can also regulate protein localization, enzyme activity, and recruitment of binding partners; in many cases, these types of regulation involve monoubiquitin adducts or ubiquitin chains linked to the substrate and each other via a lysine residue other than K48 (e.g. Lysine 63) but these too can be removed by DUBs. Thus, DUBs can regulate multiple cellular processes other than protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A growing body of literature shows that DUBs are dysregulated in many disease settings including cancer, chronic inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Popovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkin and Paulson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi and Grossman, 2010</xref>) and that DUBs may be useful targets for the development of therapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Inhibiting DUBs with small molecules has emerged as a particularly promising means of indirectly targeting proteins that are conventionally considered to be ‘undruggable’, typically due to the absence of a binding pocket into which a small molecule might bind; such proteins include transcription factors and scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, USP7 is a DUB that stabilizes MDM2, the E3 ligase for the tumor suppressor TP53, and inhibiting USP7 has emerged as a strategy for indirectly increasing the levels of TP53, which is among the most highly mutated genes in cancer but has thus far eluded direct targeting by small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, USP28 is a DUB that stabilizes the c-Myc transcription factor, a potent oncogene in a wide variety of human cancers, and inhibiting USP28 is expected to reduce the levels of c-Myc, and downregulate its activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weisberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrigley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). However, effectively exploiting DUB biology to upregulate tumor suppressor proteins such as TP53 and downregulate oncogenes such as c-Myc requires a more complete understanding of DUB specificity, regulation, and knock-down phenotypes.</p><p>Only a few DUB inhibitors have entered clinical testing, and none are as-yet approved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antao et al., 2020</xref>). The current clinical pipeline includes small molecules targeting USP1 (with a phase 1 clinicial trials underway sponsored by KSQ Therapeutics, Inc in advanced solid tumors) and USP30 (with clinical trial plans announced by Mission Therapeutics for kidney disease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">KSQ Therapeutics, Inc, 2022</xref>, Identifier: NCT05240898; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mission Therapeutics, 2022</xref>). While potent and selective inhibitors have been described for a small number of DUBs, including USP7, USP14, and CSN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlierf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>), development of chemical probes for other DUBs has largely yielded relatively non-selective compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ndubaku and Tsui, 2015</xref>). Moreover, many potential DUB substrates reported in the literature have not yet been explored in detail or fully confirmed, and the dependency of DUB-substrate interactions on biological setting (e.g. cell type or state) is largely unexplored. Lastly, out of more than 100 DUBs in the human proteome, only a small subset has been studied from a functional perspective. This lack of information on DUBs as a family makes the task of prioritizing DUBs for development of chemical probes and, ultimately, human therapeutics, more difficult.</p><p>In this paper, we take a combined and relatively unbiased computational and experimental approach to investigating the functions of DUBs, with an emphasis on cancer cell lines in which DUB inhibitors have been most extensively studied. First, we use high-throughput RNA-seq to measure the transcriptome-wide impact of an 81-member DUB CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library and also of seven small molecule DUB inhibitors chosen for high selectivity. As a complementary source of phenotypic and molecular information, we mine several large omics datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), including the Dependency Map (DepMap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>), the Connectivity Map (CMap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>) and a recently published Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) proteomics dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>) as well as multiple protein-protein interaction databases (PPIDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermjakob et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malovannaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stark et al., 2006</xref>).

Each cell line in the DepMap carries a unique barcode to enable parallel analysis, and each gene knockout is assigned a ‘dependency score’ on a per cell-line basis. The dependency score quantifies the rate at which a cell carrying a particular CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA is out-competed (‘drops out’) in a specific cell line; the more negative the dependency score, the stronger the impact on proliferation and thus, the higher the rate of guide disappearance from the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>).

As a first step, we leveraged CMap to identify genes that, when silenced with RNAi, or overexpressed, had similar transcriptional effects as DUB knockouts. This approach is based on the observation that genetic perturbations acting on components of the same or related pathways frequently give rise to significantly similar transcriptomic signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). To generate knockouts, we used a commercially available arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 81 DUBs and 13 additional proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including ubiquitin-like proteins; the library was constructed with four, pooled, guides per target (coverage of DUBs is incomplete in this CRISPR-Cas9 library because it was based on a historical understanding of the DUB family; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Prior to screening, transfection was optimized by assaying the abundance of selected target proteins using western blots (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). mRNA profiling was performed 96 hr after guide RNA transfection using a high-throughput, low-cost RNA-sequencing method (3’ Digital Gene Expression; 3’DGE-seq) in the MDAMB231 breast cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Semrau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soumillon et al., 2014</xref>). Four days after guide RNA transfection, we generated mRNA profiles by 3’DGE-seq and then queried the CMap database.

It has been observed that genes having similar DepMap scores across large panels of cell lines are likely to have related biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>), a property known as co-dependency. More specifically, co-dependent genes are frequently found to lie in the same or parallel pathways (as defined by gene ontology (GO), for example) or to be members of the same protein complex. We identified co-dependent genes for DUBs and then ran GO enrichment analysis on the co-dependent genes to identify pathways in which the DUBs were likely to be active. We also mined data on co-dependent genes from four other datasets. First, we asked whether co-dependent genes had similar transcriptomic signatures in CMap. Second, we used protein-protein interaction databases (PPIDs) such as BioGRID, IntAct, Pathway Commons, and NURSA to ascertain whether co-dependent genes might interact physically with one another. Third, we searched CCLE proteomics data for proteins whose expression levels across ~375 cell lines strongly correlated with the level of each DUB; it has previously been observed that proteins in the same complex are often co-expressed to a significant degree across a cell line panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>). Fourth, we repeated GO-enrichment analysis for protein-interactors identified from PPIDs or for significantly co-expressed proteins from the CCLE proteomics data. All four approaches involve indirect assessment of function or interaction but they are based on different types of data and different ideas about what constitutes a gene-gene ‘interaction’. We reasoned that inferences that were significantly correlated or at least consistent across data sources were more likely to be biologically meaningful. As one means of testing this hypothesis we asked whether results for well-studied DUBs were consistent with prior literature knowledge.</p><p>Experimental support for functional associations obtained from data mining was sought by knocking out the DUB and several co-dependent genes and then assaying phenotypic similarity by mRNA profiling and other means. We also compared CRISPR-Cas9 knockout phenotypes with phenotypes induced by treatment of MDAMB231 or MCF7 cells with one of seven recently developed small molecule DUB inhibitors. We selected these inhibitors based on their reported selectivity for specific DUBs. We then compared drug-induced transcriptomic profiles with those obtained by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene knockout.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The impact of DUB knockouts on the transcriptome</title><p>Genes whose knockout with CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in 20 or more differentially expressed (DE) genes in MDAMB231 cells at a false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of p&lt;0.05 included ten DUBs, one deSUMOylating enzyme (SENP2), and one ubiquitin-like protein (UBL5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). To determine if the CMap database, which was collected primarily using a LUMINEX-based ‘L1000’ method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Subramanian et al., 2017</xref>), could successfully be queried using 3’DGE-Seq signatures, we focused in on three DUBs that have been relatively well studied: CYLD, TNFAIP3, and PSMD14. Using 3’ DGE-Seq data, we found that knockout of PSMD14, a proteosome subunit, strongly perturbed genes involved in the cell cycle (e.g. the <italic>GO cell division</italic> category), as expected for a DUB essential for proteasome function and thus, cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). When CMap was queried using the 3’DGE-seq data, PSMD14 knockout was found to be similar to knockout of multiple other proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In the case of CYLD and TNFAIP3 (also called A20), we found that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout resulted in highly correlated changes in transcription, and GO analysis revealed involvement in NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lork et al., 2017</xref>). Both DUBs are known to deubiquitinate members of the NF-κB signaling cascade, such as TRAF2, which results in inhibition of signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lork et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, we found that 3’DGE-seq data for CYLD and TNFAIP3 knockout were most similar to CMap signatures associated with overexpression of genes that function upstream in the NF-κB pathway, such as the TNF receptor TNFRS1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We interpreted these data on three well-studied DUBs as helping to confirm the validity of our approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Analysis of DUB essentiality using publicly available datasets</title><p>Differences in the expression of DUBs in normal tissues and malignant tumors has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luise et al., 2011</xref>), but the direct impact of DUB deletion on specific types of cells has not yet been systematically explored. We therefore investigated the essentiality of DUBs for cancer cells and embryonic development by leveraging three datasets: the DepMap, the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) dataset, and the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) mouse phenotype dataset. Of 94 DUB knockouts found in DepMap, 23 strongly impacted proliferation (dependency score &lt;–0.5) in at least 200 of the cell lines tested (30%), and an additional 25 impacted proliferation in at least eight cell lines (1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The remainder had little, if any, detectable effect. To identify dependencies associated with tumor type, we compared DepMap data across sets of cell lines that had been divided based on tissue of tumor origin or more specific clinical or genetic subtypes (e.g. Leukemia is a general category, while AML, ALL, and CML are more specific subdivisions). This can provide insight into disease activity. For example, the tumor type in DepMap most sensitive to knockout of the BRAF kinase is melanoma, the disease in which BRAF inhibitors were first approved and are most widely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kakadia et al., 2018</xref>).

STAMBP for example, impacts proliferation of head and neck cancer cell lines more strongly (mean dependency score = –0.73) than all other tumor types in the DepMap (mean dependency score = –0.43; difference in means = 0.30 +/- 0.08, FDR = 0.03), suggesting that STAMBP might best be studied in this context; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> depicts analogous information for other DUBs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>DUB essentiality and codependency relationships in DepMap.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The fraction of cancer cell lines present in the DepMap that are strongly dependent on each DUB (using recommended threshold CERES &lt;–0.5).

Thus, with rare exception, the sensitivity of individual tumor lineages to different DUB knockouts is not explained by protein abundance. Moreover, studying DUBs primarily in over-expressing cell lines is not supported by available data.</p><p>Using mouse data from the IMPC and MGI datasets, we compared data from cell lines in DepMap to knockout phenotypes in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muñoz-Fuentes et al., 2018</xref>). Phenotypes in the IMPC are scored prior to weaning in pups that arise from mating heterozygous animals, with lethality at complete penetrance corresponding to no homozygous pups and lethality with incomplete penetrance corresponding to fewer than 12.5% homozygous pups (the expected value for a gene with no impact on survival is 25%). For DUBs with no data in the IMPC, we leveraged knockout mouse data from the MGI dataset, which compiles mouse phenotypes from multiple sources. Of the 82 DUB knockout mice included in the datasets, 20 DUBs were lethal with complete penetrance, 7 were lethal with incomplete penetrance, 47 had non-lethal phenotypes, and 8 resulted in no detectable phenotype in embryos or pups. Of the 27 DUBs that were essential for embryonic development, 21 were also essential for cancer cell viability in at least 1% of cell lines in the DepMap data. A total of 32 DUB knockouts yielded a detectable lethal or non-lethal phenotype in mice but were essential in fewer than 1% of cancer cell lines. Thus, more DUBs were essential in mice than in cell lines – as might have been expected – and the majority of DUBs are likely to have non-redundant functions in development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analysis of co-dependent genes to infer function</title><p>To investigate genetic interactions between DUBs and other genes, we performed co-dependency analysis using DepMap data. For each of the 65 DUBs that were essential in ≥3 cells lines, we selected the top seven co-dependent genes and used GO enrichment analysis to identify which protein complexes and pathways were involved (hypergeometric test, FDR-adjusted p&lt;0.05, see Materials and methods for more detail). Similar results were obtained when the top 5, 7, or 10 co-dependent genes were analyzed by GO enrichment analysis, but setting the threshold at seven genes yielded the largest number of GO terms for well-characterized DUBs that were consistent with literature knowledge. We therefore used a threshold of seven co-dependent genes for the remainder of our analysis. For 35 of 65 DUBs examined, we could identify at least one significantly enriched GO term for co-dependent genes. To enable easy visualization of these and related data, we summarized them as a series of concentric rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>); the rings display the most significant GO term (ring 1), the gene names and correlation values of the top seven co-dependent genes (rings 4 and 5), as well as the fraction of cell lines that are dependent on each DUB in the DepMap (ring 3). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> provides the same data in tabular form to facilitate computational analysis, and the data are also available on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/">DUB Portal</ext-link> which is automatically updated weekly to capture public database updates.</p><p>For the well-studied DUBs described above, co-dependency analysis returned results consistent with known functions. For example, genes co-dependent with the proteasomal subunit PSMD14 included other members of the proteasome (<italic>GO: endopeptidase complex</italic>), and co-dependent genes for CYLD and TNFAIP3 included members of the NF-κB pathway (<italic>GO: I-κB kinase/NF-κB signaling</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We therefore asked whether CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of co-dependent genes would elicit similar changes in RNA expression as knockout of the DUB itself. Specifically, for the 9 CRISPR-Cas9 DUB knockouts that resulted in DE of 20 or more genes in MDAMB231 cells, we computed the similarity in CMap for (RNAi-based silencing of) co-dependent genes. We found that four DUBs, CYLD, TNFAIP3, PSMD14, and USP8, had at least one co-dependent gene that, when silenced, resulted in a significantly similar transcriptomic profile to that of the expected DUB knockout (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 6 and 7</xref>). An additional two DUBs, USPL1, and PRPF8, were correlated with splicing factors in both DepMap and CMap, although the specific splicing factors were not the same. Further comparison of DepMap and CMap data was limited by the fact that CMap contains only ~3000 knockdowns as compared to ~18,000 knockouts in the DepMap. We nonetheless conclude that co-dependency analysis yields data on genes that likely interact functionally with DUBs, and the DepMap data and RNA-Seq of CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts were largely consistent in assigning an activity to individual DUBs.</p><p>Among the 69 DUBs whose knockout had little or no detectable impact on transcription in MDAMB231 cells (&lt;20 DE genes) in our studies, 55 had little or no impact on proliferation of MDAMB231 cells in DepMap data and 7 were absent from the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In no case did we detect significant differential gene expression in MDAMB231 cells without evidence of dependency in at least 1% of cell lines (i.e. 8 cell lines). In seven cases however, DUB knockout was associated with a high DepMap dependency score but minimal changes in transcription based on CRISPR-Cas9 screens in MDAMB231 cells. We used western blotting (3 DUBs: USP1, USP7, USP10) or mRNA profiling (1 DUB: USP36) to establish that four of seven target genes in question had actually been downregulated by guide RNA transfection. In these cases, differences in the time and format of the measurement, 4 days after guide RNA transfection for mRNA profiling and 21 days for DepMap data, may explain the difference in transcript profiling and DepMap dependency data. In three other cases (BAP1, USP5, USP37), DUB mRNA was not detectably downregulated in our MDAMB231 studies, and we assume that the knockout may have failed for technical reasons. Overall, these results suggest good agreement between mRNA profiling and DepMap data with discordance that affected ~5–10% of DUBs (depending on the criterion used) and was potentially explainable by differences in assay format and experimental error.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Protein interaction and co-expression datasets provide support for co-dependent genes</title><p>To search for evidence of physical interaction between genes scored as similar in function to DUBs based on DepMap and CMap data, we mined protein interaction datasets. First, we compiled the protein-protein interactions for each DUB from four PPIDs: BioGRID, IntAct, Pathway Commons, and NURSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermjakob et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malovannaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>). These datasets involve a range of approaches to scoring interaction including affinity capture MS, affinity capture western blotting, and assembly of reconstituted complexes from purified recombinant subunits in vitro. When we asked whether any proteins that exhibited co-dependent genes with DUBs in DepMap data also exhibit interaction with that DUB in PPID data, we found that 31 DUBs (out of 65 DUBs that were essential in ≥3 cell lines in the DepMap), had at least one co-dependent gene that was also an interactor in PPID data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, ring 4, interactors shown in green). A total of 55 of 65 DUBs were detectable in CCLE proteomics data (the expression levels of the others were presumably too low) and of those, 24 DUBs were significantly co-expressed with one or more co-dependent genes (FDR &lt;0.01 and |z-score|&gt;2). Moreover, DUBs that are well known to function in multi-protein complexes, such as the USP22 subunit of the SAGA complex, were found to interact with, be co-expressed with, and exhibit co-dependency with other members of the complex. In aggregate, 39 DUBs had at least one co-dependent gene (average 1.6 co-dependent genes per DUB) that was also found to be an interaction partner in a PPID and/or significantly co-expressed in the CCLE baseline proteomics data. Based on these two lines of evidence, we conclude that co-dependent genes for 39 DUBs are likely to interact physically and functionally. These findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> rings 4 and 6 and available in tabular form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>. However, some DepMap co-dependent genes were not observed to interact in PPID data, in agreement with the general expectation that proteins functioning in the same pathways might, when perturbed, have a similar effect on cell growth even in the absence of physical interaction.</p><p>We performed GO-enrichment analysis on DUB interactors and significantly co-expressed proteins and compared the resulting set of significantly enriched GO terms to the GO terms enriched in the co-dependent genes in the DepMap. This comparison enabled identification of GO terms that are significantly enriched in multiple datasets, providing corroboration for GO terms enriched in the DepMap co-dependent genes. We identified 35 DUBs whose co-dependent genes in the DepMap were associated with one or more significantly enriched GO terms. For 26 of these DUBs, at least one GO term was also enriched in the co-expressed proteins or PPID interactors for the relevant DUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Overall, protein co-expression validated more GO complexes than GO pathways, consistent with the idea that the proteome is primarily organized by complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, DUBs that have well-characterized functions were often found to be enriched for known interactors or substrates across multiple datasets. For example, the proteasome subunit PSMD14 was enriched for other proteasome subunits and CYLD was enriched for NF-κB signaling in multiple datasets, providing additional confidence in the validity of our approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>From these data, we conclude that DepMap co-dependencies, CMap signatures, CCLE proteomic data, and PPIDs provide complementary and consistent data on the likely functions and physical interactors for the great majority of DUBs.

For example, UCHL5 is known to interact with both the INO80 complex (which is involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA replication, and DNA repair) and with the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). UCHL5 has been pursued as a cancer therapeutic target because of the latter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Arcy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). However, co-dependent gene data from the DepMap show that the effect of UCHL5 knockout is most similar to that of knockout of INO80 subunits (e.g. NFRKB, TFPT, INO80, INO80E, INO80B, r range = 0.29–0.54) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In contrast, no significant correlation was observed with knockouts of proteosome components (e.g. PSMD9, PSMD6, PSMD3, r range = 0.03–0.05). We conclude that UCHL5 is likely to play an essential and non-redundant function not in the proteasome, where it has been most widely studied, but instead in the INO80 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This suggests that the therapeutic context for the use of UCHL5 inhibitors is likely to be different from that of proteasome inhibitors, several of which are approved drugs (e.g. bortezomib; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). More specifically, since the INO80 complex has an essential role in DNA damage repair, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2008</xref>) UCHL5 inhibitors may be most useful in combination with DNA damaging agents.</p><p>USP14 is another highly studied, proteasome-bound DUB considered to be a promising therapeutic target in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tian et al., 2014</xref>) and USP14 has been reported to rescue many proteins from degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We found USP14 to be co-expressed with proteasome subunits in CCLE proteomics data and to interact with the same subunits in PPID data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 6 and 7</xref>); however, USP14 is not strongly co-dependent with subunits of the proteosome (PSMD13, PSMD7, PSMD4, r range = 0.08–0.09). Instead, a DepMap correlation was observed between USP14 and the UBC polyubiquitin gene (<italic>r</italic> = 0.25), which is one of the primary sources of ubiquitin in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This suggests that loss of USP14 has an anti-proliferative phenotype similar to that of ubiquitin loss and that this phenotype is distinct from that of proteasome inhibition. This hypothesis is consistent with reports that USP14 is required to maintain monoubiquitin pools, and that loss of USP14 leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitin, thereby lowering the levels of free ubiquitin available for conjugation onto protein substrates by E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2008</xref>). Also consistent with this model are our data showing that CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of USP14 resulted in significant upregulation of the UBC gene but had little additional impact on gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Finally, when we compared the USP14 knockout phenotype to that elicited by exposure of MDAMB231 cells for 24 hr to the USP14 inhibitor I-335 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>), we observed upregulation of UBC and only one other gene (TKT - transketolase - a thiamine-dependent enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qin et al., 2019</xref>). From these data, we conclude that maintenance of the pool of free ubiquitin, not regulation of the proteasome, is likely to be the key, non-redundant function for USP14.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Discriminating the functions of well-studied DUBs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Changes in gene expression (log2 fold change vs. log 10 adjusted p-value, adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 colored red) in MDAMB231 cells 96 hr following USP14 knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 (left) or 24 hr after treatment with the USP14 inhibitor I-335 at 20 µM (right).

ESCRT complexes recognize ubiquitinated transmembrane receptors and facilitate their transport to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mamińska et al., 2016</xref>). USP8 interacts with and stabilizes both receptors and ESCRT proteins. Although USP8 has been reported to regulate the abundance of many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dufner and Knobeloch, 2019</xref>), attention has focused on its role in stabilizing EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byun et al., 2013</xref>).

We also observed similarity between the mRNA profiles for USP8 knockout and overexpression of NF-κB signaling proteins such as TNFRSF1A and BCL10 (CMap tau scores: 98.7 and 99.6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

We also found that, in DepMap data, USP8 knockout exhibited a higher codependency score (i.e., correlated more strongly) with knockout of ESCRT machinery proteins than with individual growth factor or cytokine receptors, independent of cancer lineage, suggesting that the essential function of USP8 in cancer cells is not mediated by one specific receptor alone – e.g. EGFR – but rather by multiple growth factor and cytokine receptors that undergo similar ESCRT-dependent endosomal sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>USP7 function dependent and independent of functional TP53</title><p>USP7 has been the focus of many small molecule inhibitor campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kategaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamberto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>) and several pharmaceutical companies are developing USP7-based therapeutics, although none have, as yet, advanced to clinical trials. USP7 is reported to regulate chromatin remodeling factors such as polycomb complexes and MDM2, the E3 ligase for the TP53 tumor suppressor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and Sixma, 2017</xref>). We found that MDM2 and other proteins in the TP53 signaling pathway, such as the PPM1D phosphatase, were the strongest co-dependent genes for USP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). This is consistent with recent work showing that the impact of USP7 on proliferation is strongest in TP53 wild type cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>). C16orf72, a protein of unknown function, was another top co-dependent gene for USP7 (DepMap correlation = 0.35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We hypothesized that C16orf72 might be regulated by USP7 and also play a role in the TP53 pathway.</p><p>To investigate this hypothesis, we knocked out USP7 and C16orf72 in MCF7 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 and performed 3’DGE-seq after four days. We found that knockout of either gene resulted in a similar mRNA expression profile: in both cases, TP53 pathway genes were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and e</xref>). Published proteomic experiments by others show that C16orf72 is one of only eight proteins downregulated two hours after treatment of MM.1S cells with the highly selective USP7 inhibitor XL177A, further suggesting that C16orf72 may be regulated by USP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bushman et al., 2021</xref>). Our data are also consistent with the sole publication on C16orf72 in PubMed, which describes C16orf72 as a TP53 regulator involved in telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benslimane et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To test directly how much of the USP7 phenotype is dependent on the presence of TP53, we applied 1 µM XL177A (for 24 hr) to isogenic MCF7 cell lines that were WT for TP53 or that had TP53 stably knocked down using shRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>); we then performed 3’DGE-seq. The MDM2 inhibitor nutlin3a was used as a positive control for TP53 stabilization and activation. MDM2 inhibition with nutlin3a elicited a strong TP53 activation phenotype in parental MCF7 cells (1084 DE genes) but little phenotype in MCF7 TP53 KD cells (only 2 DE genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref><bold>)</bold>. Exposure of parental MCF7 cells to XL177A resulted in 737 DE genes, which strongly correlated with DE genes elicited by MDM2 inhibition with nutlin3a as well as knockout of USP7 in parental MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that TP53 is a primary target of USP7. The presence of 77 DE genes in XL177A-treated MCF7 TP53 KD cells suggests that USP7 may also have a function independent of TP53 or that XL177A has one or more targets other than USP7 (see below). Overall, these studies nominate a new candidate substrate for USP7 (C16orf72), suggest that C16orf72 plays a role in TP53 signaling, and uncover a possible activity of XL177A that is independent of TP53.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Additional DUB regulators of TP53</title><p>When we looked for evidence that less well-studied DUBs affect TP53 in a manner similar to USP7, we found that VCPIP1, UCHL3, USP38 and USP42 all negatively correlate with TP53 in the DepMap while ATXN3 and USP28 positively correlated with TP53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The existence of negative correlation in DepMap data is evidence that two genes act in opposing directions on the same pathway. The strongest positive correlation in the DepMap for VCPIP1 was the E3 ligase HUWE1 (correlation = 0.43), suggesting that VCPIP1 might stabilize HUWE1. HUWE1 targets TP53 for degradation via ubiquitination followed by proteolysis by the proteasome, which may explain the negative correlation of VCPIP1 and TP53 in DepMap data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

CCLE co-expression and PPID protein-protein interaction analyses also support these findings: VCPIP1 and USP42 are both co-dependent and co-expressed with a negative regulator of TP53 (HUWE1 and PPMID respectively). Additionally, USP38 and USP28 both interact with DNA damage response proteins (<italic>GO response to ionizing radiation</italic>, FDR =7.0 × 10<sup>–3</sup> and 3.0 × 10<sup>–3</sup> for USP38 and USP28 respectively), supporting the hypothesis that these DUBs are involved in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

However, it has also been suggested that DUBs might associate directly with E3 ligases and inhibit their auto-ubiquitination activity, thus preventing proteasomal degradation of the E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilkinson, 2009</xref>). In this case, positive correlations in the DepMap between E3 ligases and DUBs are expected. We found that multiple DUBs exhibited strong positive rather than negative correlations with one or more E3 ligases in the DepMap data. We therefore constructed a network of all proteins having ubiquitin transferase activity (including E3 ligases and E2 ubiquitinating proteins) for top co-dependent genes for each DUB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This network was found to include many known interactions such as USP7 regulation of the MDM2 E3 and CYLD regulation of the TRAF2 E3.

This suggests that XL177A affects the same TP53 signaling pathway as USP7 knockout but to a greater degree. This difference might reflect differences in time point (24 hr for inhibition vs. 96 hr for knockout), incomplete knockout of USP7 by CRISPR-Cas9, or the existence of additional XL177A targets (some of which could include DUBs other than USP7 shown above to regulate TP53). Not all the effects of XL177A on cells were TP53-mediated however: exposure of TP53 KD cells to XL177A upregulated cell cycle genes, such as genes in the G2 checkpoint (<italic>hallmark G2M checkpoint</italic>, NES =1.94, adjusted p-value =6.76 x 10<sup>–6</sup>) as well as histone genes (<italic>DNA packaging complex</italic>, NES =1.76, adjusted p-value = 0.0066) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref><bold>).</bold></p><p>Exposure of cells to the OTUD7B inhibitor I-145, the USP30 inhibitor MF-094, USP19 inhibitor I-124, or the CSN5 inhibitors Compound 6 or CSN5i-3 resulted in strong perturbation of transcription (651, 30, 316, 246, and 457 DE genes, respectively) whereas CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout of OTUD7B, USP30, USP19, or COPS5 resulted in far fewer DE genes (0, 3, 11, and 52, respectively) and the small molecule and CRISPR-Cas9 signatures were not significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). However, the transcriptomic signature for the OTUD7B inhibitor I-145 had significant similarity to multiple tubulin inhibitors in CMap data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) but no DepMap dependency was identified for OTUD7B knockout in MDAMB231 cells.

In CMap data, Compound 6 was dissimilar to COPS5 knockdown (tau =25.4), whereas CSN5i-3 was similar to COPS5 knockdown (tau =94.8). From these data, we conclude that I-145, I-124, Compound 6, and MF-094 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> for details) are very likely to target proteins other than the DUB they were designed to inhibit. CSN5i-3 may or may not be acting on-target given mixed results (similar by RNAi in CMap but dissimilar to CRISPR-Cas9 knockout) but we cannot rule out inefficient CRISPR-Cas9 knockout or differences in the timing of protein run-down as opposed to inhibition by a small molecule as a contributor to differences in transcriptomic signatures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rapid growth in publicly available and ‘functional genomic’ datasets affords an opportunity for extensive analysis of large gene families such as human DUBs. A total of nine different public resources measuring transcript signatures following gene perturbation (CMap), gene essentiality (DepMap, IMPC, ad MGI), protein co-expression (CCLE proteomics), and protein-protein interaction (BioGRID, IntAct, Pathway Commons PPID, and NURSA PPID) were mined for data, in most cases starting with a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout or small molecule signature we collected in our laboratories. Comparison of enriched gene sets or GO terms made it possible to bridge different types of data. We observed substantial and encouraging consistency among datasets. For example, genes identified as co-dependent with DUBs in DepMap data frequently exhibited similar transcript signatures, were co-expressed across cell lines, and were physically associated. Overall, our analysis yielded three types of information: (i) potentially new or more precisely specified functions for several well-characterized DUBs, including a UCHL5, USP7, USP8, and USP14 (ii) potential pathways or functional roles for understudied DUBs, including a role for USPL1 in the Little Elongation Complex and UCHL3, USP38, VCPIP1, and USP42 in the regulation of TP53 signaling; (iii) insight into the DUB family as a whole, including evidence that 23 DUBs play a role in stabilizing 33 E3 ubiquitin ligases, most likely by antagonizing their auto-ubiquitination activities. 52 DUBs were found to be essential for proliferation in at least five cancer cell lines, and 34 of these DUBs affected the proliferation of cell lines from one tumor type more than cell lines from all other tumor types, potentially providing insight into disease context. These data are summarized in a simple graphical form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, as a series of tables suitable for computational analysis in supplementary materials, and in an automatically updating set of tables at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/">DUB Portal</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Discriminating among essential and non-essential DUB functions</title><p>In several cases, our studies yielded unexpected hypotheses about the functions of DUBs that have already been well studied. For example, USP14 is a component of the proteasome and considered to be a promising therapeutic target in cancer due to the clinical success of other proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). However, we found that USP14 was strongly co-dependent in DepMap data not with subunits of the proteasome but instead with the UBC polyubiquitin gene, a primary source of ubiquitin in mammalian cells. Knockout of USP14 by CRISPR-Cas9, or exposure of cells to the USP14 inhibitor I-335 resulted in highly selective upregulation of the UBC gene. We therefore propose that maintenance of the pool of free ubiquitin, not regulation of the proteasome, is likely to be the key, non-redundant function for USP14. A similar story emerged for UCHL5, which is a component of both the INO80 complex and the proteasome. The effect of UCHL5 knockout is most similar to that of knockout of other INO80 subunits and no significant correlation was observed in DepMap data with knockout of proteosome subunits. In this case, we hypothesize that UCHL5 plays an essential and non-redundant function in the INO80 complex rather than the proteasome. These data strongly suggest that the therapeutic context for use of USP14 and UCHL5 inhibitors currently in pre-clinical development is likely to be different from that of proteasome inhibitors. More generally, the data show how DepMap data can distinguish among multiple activities for a protein and identify those activities most important for cell survival.</p><p>One of the most promising potential uses of DUB inhibitors is to indirectly regulate the levels of disease-associated genes that are not conventionally considered to be druggable such as transcription factors and scaffolding proteins. This strategy has been most actively pursued for USP7, which is a regulator of MDM2, the E3 ligase for the TP53 tumor suppressor protein: inhibition of USP7 increases the levels of ubiquitinated MDM2, promoting its degradation and thereby increasing TP53 levels. Our data on USP7 are consistent with this hypothesis: we find that the top DepMap co-dependent gene for USP7 is MDM2, and knockdown of TP53 largely rescues the transcriptional phenotype observed for USP7 inhibition in TP53 wildtype cells. We find that USP7 has at least one additional substrate, C16orf72, that may also be a TP53 regulator. Moreover, the USP7 inhibitor XL177A has a phenotype that is independent of TP53 and involves upregulation of histone genes and genes involved in the G2M cell cycle checkpoint. We speculate that this may reflect the reported involvement of USP7 in the regulation of polycomb complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Bie et al., 2010</xref>), although we cannot rule out an off-target activity for XL177A. Regardless, we conclude that the primary role of USP7 in cancer cells involves regulation of the MDM2-TP53 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>). A number of other DUBs also appear to be TP53 regulators including UCHL3, USP38, VCPIP1, and USP42. Targeting these DUBs in addition to USP7 may be useful as a means to modulate TP53 levels for therapeutic benefit. This could potentially be achieved by developing a small molecule inhibitor active against multiple TP53-regulating DUBs or by using a combination of selective compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DUBs as E3 regulators</title><p>The relationship between USP7 and MDM2 does not appear to be the only instance of a DUB regulating an E3 ligase. DepMap co-dependent genes for DUBs were strongly enriched and positively correlated with E3 ligases and other ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like transferases; in many cases, DepMap data were supported by PPID or co-expression data (e.g. the VCPIP1 DUB and HUWE1 E3 ligase). Overall, we identified 23 DUBs with at least one co-dependent E3 ligase, and eight of these DUBs had a co-dependent E3 ligase also supported by PPID or co-expression data. Selected DUBs have previously been reported to stabilize E3 ligases; for example, USP7 stabilizes MDM2, CYLD stabilizes TRAF2, and OTUD5 stabilizes UBR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vivo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lork et al., 2017</xref>). However, our data suggest that this may be a general feature of the DUB family, with many E3 ligases interacting with DUBs that antagonize E3 auto-ubiquitination and increase protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wilkinson, 2009</xref>). Multiple E3 ligases act as oncogenes and promoting their degradation via DUB inhibition may be a broadly useful therapeutic strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparing DUB inhibitors and DUB knockouts</title><p>Using transcript profiling we compared seven small molecules reported by their developers to be highly selective inhibitors of specific DUBs to CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of their targets. DUB inhibitor signatures were significantly similar to knockout signatures in only two cases: USP14 inhibition with I-335 and USP7 inhibition with XL177A. We conclude that these compounds are selective, although the signature of USP7 inhibition was substantially stronger than that of USP7 knockout. This was true in general, with exposure of cells to DUB inhibitors resulting, in all cases, in significantly more DE genes than knockouts. In the case of XL177A, our studies cannot determine whether this difference reflects the time at which the measurements were made, the degree of USP7 inhibition by drug or mRNA depletion by CRSPR-Cas9, or the existence of off-target effects. In the cases of the COPS5, OTUD7B, USP19, and USP30 inhibitors, the lack of a significant correlation between weak knockout phenotypes and the strong drug-induced phenotypes suggest substantial off-target activity. Small molecules targeting multi-protein families via competitive inhibition at the active site commonly exhibit some degree of polypharmacology (that is, they exert their biological effects by binding to multiple targets; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giri et al., 2019</xref>). It appears that, except in the case of USP7 and USP14, additional medicinal chemistry will be required to manage polypharmacology.</p><p>It has been suggested that redundancy among DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vlasschaert et al., 2017</xref>) might limit the effectiveness of selective DUB inhibitors as therapeutic agents, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis and Simeonov, 2015</xref>). However, we find that single gene knockouts of 43 DUBs impact proliferation in at least 8 DepMap cancer cell lines, and 21 DUBs are embryonic lethal with complete or partial penetrance in mice; deletion of an additional 26 DUBs has a scorable murine phenotype. Thus, many DUBs appear to have non-redundant functions. Moreover, since many targets for successful anticancer drugs are embryonic lethal, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu and Xu, 2020</xref>) our data support further development of DUBs as cancer therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>The goal of this work was to study the DUB gene family as broadly as possible with limited follow-up on a subset of inferred functions. As a result, deep analysis of individual genes was not possible, and many interferences made from public data are necessarily indirect. We also generate many more hypotheses than we are able to test. The high degree of concordance observed among datasets suggests that pursuing many of these hypotheses will be worth the effort. One nominal ‘disagreement’ among datasets is essentiality as scored by DepMap data and transcriptional responses as measured by CMap (and our own mRNA profiling studies). For example, seven DUB knockouts impact MDAMB231 viability in the DepMap but do not elicit a strong transcriptional phenotype following CRISPR-Cas9 knockout. We speculate that these discrepancies are due to differences in time point (4 days in the transcriptomics and three weeks in the DepMap screen) or incomplete knockout (although we could confirm successful depletion of four of seven DUBs in question). More study is required to understand the origins and significance of discrepancies between DepMap and CMap. We also found that many physically-interacting and co-expressed genes are not co-dependent in DepMap. Such differences are not unexpected from a biological perspective, given the many different ways in which genes can interact, but further work focused on distinguishing technical errors from functional differences will be important.</p><p>Because we analyzed whole gene knockouts rather than point mutations or protein deletions, the results in this paper do not distinguish among catalytic and structural functions for DUBs. This will be an important next step, particularly for clarifying the therapeutic utility of competitive small molecule inhibitors. For example, copy number loss was predictive of increased sensitivity to USPL1 deletion, so we hypothesize that a USPL1 inhibitor may be useful in this context; however, one study suggests that USPL1 is important for Cajal body architecture independent of its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schulz et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our studies provide a diverse set of data on the DUB family as a whole, as well as new insight into many individual DUBs, including several that have been studied intensively. One theme that emerges is that for genes with multiple proposed functions (USP7 and UCHL5 for example), a combination of profiling CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts or drug-induced perturbations with systematic mining of functional genomic databases makes it possible to distinguish among essential and non-essential phenotypes. A second is that more DUBs than anticipated have non-redundant roles in the tumor suppressor and oncogenic pathways, most notably TP53 regulation, suggesting new approaches to undruggable targets. The approaches described in this work are also directly applicable to other gene families and therapeutic targets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DUB CRISPR-Cas9 screening library: Dharmacon EDIT-R crRNA Library - Human Deubiquitinating Enzymes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GC-004700 Lot 17,107</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon Edit-R tracrRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">U-002005–05</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmafect 4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dharmacon (Horizon Discovery)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T-2004–02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MDAMB231</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRM-HTB-26</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-22</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Flag-tag (L5) antibody (rat monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fischer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MA1-142</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USP7 antibody (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4,833</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USP8 antibody (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sc-376130</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USP10 antibody (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">8,501</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USP1 antibody (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D37B4</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USP11 antibody (rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ab109232</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UCHL5 antibody (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">sc-271002</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:1,000 dilution</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies, cell lines, and reagents</title><p>The Cas9-Flag was a generous gift from Andrew Lane at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Compounds</title><p>All compounds were quality control checked using LCMS and NMR.

The plates were incubated for 5 min at room temperature to aid cell lysis, and then frozen at –80 °C until RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>3’DGE-seq transcript profiling</title><p>The DGE RNA-seq was performed as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Semrau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soumillon et al., 2014</xref>) with modifications described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schauer et al., 2020</xref>) (full protocol at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.protocols.io/view/3-39-dge-high-throughput-rna-library-preparation-bumynu7w">https://www.protocols.io/view/3-39-dge-high-throughput-rna-library-preparation-bumynu7w</ext-link>). All automated liquid handling steps described below were performed at the ICCB-Longwood Screening Facility. The cell lysates were mixed and 10 µl was transferred from each well of the 96 well screening plates to a well in a clean 384-well PCR plate, consolidating samples from up to four 96 well plates into a single 384-well plate for RNA extraction. SPRI (solid-phase reversible immobilization) beads, prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohland and Reich, 2012</xref>), were added to the lysate (28 µL/well), mixed, and incubated for 5 min. The beads were then pulled down magnetically, washed with 80% ethanol two times, air dried for one minute, and rehydrated with nuclease free water (20 μL/well). The plate was removed from the magnet, and the beads were resuspended by mixing. After a 5-min incubation, the beads were pulled down again by placing the plate back on the magnet, and the supernatant was transferred to a new 384-well plate. The Qubit Fluorometer and the Agilent BioAnalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit were used to verify RNA quantity and quality respectively. RT master mix, 1 µL of barcoded E3V6NEXT adapters, and 5 μl of the total RNA supernatant was transferred to a new 384-well plate for reverse transcription and template switching. All RNA extraction steps were performed with a BRAVO Automated Liquid Handling Platform (Agilent). Following a 90-min incubation at 42 °C, the cDNA was pooled, and the QIAquick PCR purification kit was used for purification. In order to remove excess primers, the cDNA was treated with Exonuclease I for 30 min at 37 °C. The Advantage 2 PCR Enzyme System and the SINGV6 primer were used to amplify the cDNA (5 cycles). Following amplification, Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads were used to purify the cDNA and the Qubit Fluorometer was used for quantification. The Nextera DNA kit was used to prepare the sequencing library following the manufacturer’s instructions. 55 ng of cDNA was tagmented for 5 min at 55 °C and purified using a Zymo DNA Clean &amp; Concetrator-5 column. The cDNA was amplified (7 cycles) then purified using a 0.9 x ratio of AMPure XP magnetic beads. The Agilent BioAnalyzer HS DNA Kit was used to assess the library size distribution before qPCR quantification and sequencing at the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility (paired end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq).</p><p>The data was separated by well barcode and the reads were converted to counts using the bcbio-nextgen single cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>). The pipeline removes any barcodes that differ by more than one base from an expected barcode and uses unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to identify unique reads and remove PCR duplicates. RapMap was used to align reads to the transcriptome (GRCh38). The R package DESeq2 (version 1.30.0) was used for differential expression analysis, and the R package gseaMultilevel was used for gene set enrichment analysis of all genes sorted by the log2 fold change (adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) using Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) gene sets.</p><p>To compare the small molecules and CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, we performed hierarchical clustering of the DE genes of the small molecule treatments, the DE genes of the CRISPR-Cas9 knock outs of each putative target of the small molecules, as well as the DE genes of the DUB CRISPR-Cas9 knock outs that induced the strongest transcriptomic responses in our CRISPR-Cas9 screen (more than 20 DE geness).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Dependency map analysis</title><p>The Broad Institute Dependency Map dataset (CRISPR AVANA dataset 2020 Q3) was analyzed to determine the impact of DUB knockouts on cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsherniak et al., 2017</xref>). The recommended dependency score threshold of –0.5 was used to score dependent cell lines. The number of cell lines with scores below –0.5 divided by the total number of cell lines tested for a particular DUB was used to determine the fraction of cell lines dependent on a particular DUB. To determine differential response by cancer type, t-tests were conducted to compare the dependency scores for a particular tumor type for a given DUB to the scores of all other cell lines. This was repeated for each tumor type for each DUB, and the p-values were FDR corrected.</p><p>To determine co-dependent genes for each DUB, the CRISPR AVANA dataset was used to calculate Pearson correlations between each DUB and all other gene knockouts in the dataset. We limited this analysis to DUBs that had at least three dependent cell lines. To find the pathways and complexes significantly enriched in the strongest co-dependent genes for each DUB, the R package ClusterProfiler was used for gene set overrepresentation analysis of the top 5, 7, or 10 co-dependent genes for each DUB using MSigDB GO gene sets. The overall results were similar, but because the top seven co-dependent gene analysis yielded the largest number of expected GO terms for the well-studied DUBs, the top seven results were used.</p><p>In order to extract the associations between DUBs and ubiquitin transferase enzymes, the GO gene set GO Ubiquitin Like Protein Transferase Activity was used to subset DUB co-dependent genes that are ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like transferases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein-protein interaction database analysis</title><p>To compile rich protein-protein interaction data for each DUB, interactions from multiple sources were compiled: IntAct, BioGRID, PathwayCommons, and NURSA.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cerami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermjakob et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malovannaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rouillard et al., 2016</xref>) The R package ClusterProfiler was used for gene set overrepresentation analysis of the interacting proteins for each DUB using MSigDB GO gene sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CCLE proteomics co-expression analysis</title><p>The normalized protein abundance data for CCLE cell lines was analyzed to determine genes co-regulated with each DUB(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nusinow et al., 2020</xref>). Pearson correlations in protein abundance were calculated between each protein in the dataset and each DUB. Only correlations where both proteins were detected in at least 100 cell lines were considered. Significant correlations were selected by thresholding Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values &lt;0.01 (the same significance threshold described in the dataset publication) as well as |z-score|&gt;2. The R package ClusterProfiler was used for gene set overrepresentation analysis of the significant co-expressed genes using MSigDB GO gene sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Overlapping DUB-gene association analysis</title><p>To determine which associations between DUBs and genes have support across multiple analyses, the DUB-gene pairs were integrated across the four analyses: top seven DepMap co-dependent genes, CMap (Broad recommended threshold of Score &gt;90), CCLE proteomics coexpression (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values &lt;0.01 (the same significance threshold described in the dataset publication) and |z-score|&gt;2), and PPIDs (DUB and gene interact in any of four databases compiled: BioGRID, IntAct, PathwayCommons, or NURSA). Each DUB-gene association was given an evidence count score computed as the sum of the number of analyses that interaction was significant in. Thus, evidence scores range from 0 (DUB gene pair not significant in any of the analyses) to 4 (DUB gene association in all four analyses). The complete table integrating all of these datasets is provided so individual DUBs can be explored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>The DUB portal</title><p>To make the data and results presented in this paper available in a reusable form, we also generated online data resources.</p><p>First, we created the DUB Portal (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_022476">SCR_022476</ext-link>, version 2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/">https://labsyspharm.github.io/dubportal/</ext-link>), for exploring the most notable results from the experimental and computational analyses for each DUB. The page for each DUB first lists the standard identifier for the related gene, protein, and orthologs in model organisms. It also shows the significantly differentially expressed genes resulting from its knockout in the CRISPR-Cas9 screen described above as well as the significant gene sets calculated by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) over the MSigDB.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>) It lists the DUB’s top correlations with other genes from the DepMap and provides evidence from PPIDs for direct physical interaction between the correlated genes, when available. In addition, we provide evidence for relations (direct or indirect) between the correlated genes from the INDRA system, which integrates pathway databases and text mined relations from the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gyori et al., 2017</xref>). The results are further contextualized by presenting the significant Gene Ontology (GO) terms from over-representation analysis. Finally, the portal allows browsing the interactions of each DUB and their supporting evidences collected using INDRA. The DUB portal is automatically generated from source data using Python scripts that standardize the names and identifiers for genes, biological processes, and pathways to promote interoperability (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_022476">SCR_022476</ext-link>, version 2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/labsyspharm/dubportal">https://github.com/labsyspharm/dubportal</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoyt, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Second, we added the family- and complex hierarchy of DUB proteins presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> to the FamPlex ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachman et al., 2018</xref>) and curated cross references to related resources including Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), IntAct, and HGNC Gene Groups (for families of DUB proteins) as well as the Complex Portal and Gene Ontology (for DUB protein complexes).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Integrating multi-omics data reveals function and therapeutic potential of deubiquitinating enzymes&quot; for consideration as a Tools and Resources article by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benedikt M Kessler (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The compilation of all the available DUB information in one resource was seen as a useful contribution to the field by the majority of the reviewers. To be acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>, a better presentation of the data (including in the online portal), as well as clearer explanations on steps taken and thresholds applied will be needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A major question that arose was how quickly the DUB portal is going to be outdated. Surely, for example, the number of papers column will be outdated in the near future. Are the underlying databases and the statistical analysis linked to the portal in a way that any new entries to these databases or any new relevant large datasets will be reflected in the DUB portal? This would make it a reliable resource for the community in the long term.</p><p>2. Better presentation of the data:</p><p>– The &quot;synthesis&quot; of data that the paper promises, and which to some extent is covered in the paper in Figure 3, is not well reflected in the online portal. Could there be a more innovative way, rather than tables, to present the data? A real benefit of this paper is seeing correlation or consistency among multiple data sources – so this should be better highlighted.</p><p>– Columns in the online portal should be explained and defined within the portal.</p><p>– The &quot;About&quot; page in the DUB Portal seems undeveloped.</p><p>– Figure 1 was experienced as confusing by several reviewers. The figure implies that data is entered into the databases, when mostly data is taken out of databases. Please make it match with your workflow in a more intuitive way. This figure is important for readers to be able to follow the strategies taken.</p><p>– For a reader of the paper, it would be interesting to know to what extent the new data (knockout/RNA-seq of 81 DUBs) has changed the conclusions or enabled conclusions that were not possible with only the mining of the existing databases.</p><p>– Figure 3B: USP5 is represented twice, and one of these instances should probably instead be USP53.</p><p>– Please provide the GEO accession number for the new data.</p><p>– The abstract could better reflect the findings. A current focus is on c-myc, where it is somewhat unclear what new biology has been discovered.</p><p>– In the discussion, page 30, &quot;… by a molecule that inhibits multiple TP53-regulating DUBs&quot;. Do multiple TP53-regulating DUBs have highly similar binding pockets? And wouldn't such nonspecific inhibitors have more off-target effects? Is there prior evidence that makes this a viable strategy?</p><p>3. Clearer explanations on steps taken and thresholds applied:</p><p>– Knockout/RNA-seq data and Figure 2A: Why were those 81 DUBs chosen?</p><p>– Many terms used are highly specialized and not easily accessible to the general reader of <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript would benefit from an effort to provide simplified explanations for the rationale and what can be extrapolated in biological terms.</p><p>– Please provide information on how thresholds were selected. For example, genes whose knockout resulted in 20 or more DE genes – why 20? Page 24: why top 7 co-dependent genes?

A major question that arose was how quickly the DUB portal is going to be outdated. Surely, for example, the number of papers column will be outdated in the near future. Are the underlying databases and the statistical analysis linked to the portal in a way that any new entries to these databases or any new relevant large datasets will be reflected in the DUB portal? This would make it a reliable resource for the community in the long term.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this concern we have implemented a new, automated workflow that updates the information in the DUB portal on a regular basis. We are grateful for this suggestion and feel that the updates will help to make it a useful resource in the medium to long term. We describe below the specific elements of the website that have now been automated.</p><p>The DUB Portal website is hosted on GitHub and therefore has version control. We used GitHub Actions to create a continuous integration service that automatically rebuilds the DUB Portal on a weekly basis. The build date and the versions of the resources used for the current DUB Portal are now shown on each page. Each build has an associated commit in version control, so it is always possible to retrieve and re-deploy an old version of the DUB Portal if desired. Each build of the DUB Portal now includes information derived from the following actions:</p><p>– Querying PubMed for the number of publications associated with a given DUB gene. As the reviewers pointed out, this is almost certain to increase over time.</p><p>– Querying the INDRA Database for the latest statements associated with a given DUB gene (the INDRA Database itself is updated nightly). INDRA includes the protein-protein interaction databases, so new entries to these databases will get added to the DUB portal. These databases are always expanding, so this automation will also add data moving forward.</p><p>– Querying Reactome for the latest pathway annotations.</p><p>– Retrieving explanations for DUB dependencies derived from integrated analysis of BioGRID, IntAct, PathwayCommons, has also been automated. Data from BioGRID, IntAct, and Pathway Commons are re-queried on a weekly basis. NURSA is a static data source (i.e., we obtained it from the publication) so therefore it does not update and does not need to be repeatedly queried, Furthermore, BioGRID and PathwayCommons are included within INDRA, so new additions to these datasets will be included in the Evidence column of the appropriate DUB Portal table along with a link to a page that explains which datasets provided a specific piece of INDRA evidence. We describe these new features of the DUB Portal in an updated version of the <italic>About</italic> page.</p><p>As described above, we have also integrated the graphics of the manuscript with the tables in the Portal to make access to the underlying information more intuitive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Better presentation of the data:</p><p>– The &quot;synthesis&quot; of data that the paper promises, and which to some extent is covered in the paper in Figure 3, is not well reflected in the online portal. Could there be a more innovative way, rather than tables, to present the data? A real benefit of this paper is seeing correlation or consistency among multiple data sources – so this should be better highlighted.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this suggestion, we have made numerous changes to the DUB Portal and the way it generates data. However, for the Portal to be updatable, it requires that data we read into the portal have a structured format such as tables with hyperlinks. This is not easily converted to the more visually appealing but inherently unstructured, static figures we have created for the publication itself. While an expert in data visualization might be able to program a site in which tables are used to automatically generate a new version of Figure 3 (the circular plot), this is not a function found in tools such as R-Shiny. Such a complex task seems to us beyond the scope of the current paper and our own expertise in data visualization.</p><p>We note that even if the tabular presentation of data in the DUB Portal is less visually striking, it includes additional information that is not included in the manuscript itself such as an <italic>evidence</italic> column that provides information on correlation or consistency among multiple data sources. This is an important type of information for integrating data across types and sources.</p><p>(As mentioned above – we have also added Figure 3 to the website to capture the integration in a visually appealing way and better key the summary figure to the tabular information).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Columns in the online portal should be explained and defined within the portal.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. Each header field in the tables now has hover text explaining its meaning. A more detailed explanation for each field is provided on the <italic>About</italic> page.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The &quot;About&quot; page in the DUB Portal seems undeveloped.</p></disp-quote><p>We have significantly extended the <italic>About</italic> page to provide detailed documentation of the DUB Portal and each of its components. The About page also contains metadata on the version of different resources used to build the portal and links to Github where issues can be submitted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1 was experienced as confusing by several reviewers. The figure implies that data is entered into the databases, when mostly data is taken out of databases. Please make it match with your workflow in a more intuitive way. This figure is important for readers to be able to follow the strategies taken.</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated an updated version of Figure 1 that more closely matches the actual workflows. In this revised figure datasets are placed above one arrow that conveys their use in achieving the results below the arrow. We hope that the reviewers find this representation more intuitive. If not, we are happy to consider additional changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For a reader of the paper, it would be interesting to know to what extent the new data (knockout/RNA-seq of 81 DUBs) has changed the conclusions or enabled conclusions that were not possible with only the mining of the existing databases.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point that cannot be answered precisely since it is a counterfactual scenario. However, we found that collecting a set of original (experimental) data on DUB knockouts was essential for us to gain traction with online resources, particularly the Connectivity Map. To query the Connectivity Map, an RNA-seq signature is required. There are not many DUB knockdowns in the Connectivity Map, and thus, we could not query the gene family directly. Moreover, signatures in the Connectivity Map were collected using an unusual L1000 Luminex bead-based assay that does not allow for conventional gene set enrichment. Thus, with respect to DUB biology the transcriptional knockout signatures we have collected are potentially more broadly useful than those in the Connectivity Map. One limitation in our study is that we did not use a CRISPR-Cas9 library for all 94 DUBs that were subsequently included in our bioinformatic analysis; however, as mentioned above, Dharmacon is interested in using data in the current paper to enhance its library.</p><p>We now highlight a specific use case of newly acquired RNA-seq dataset in the <italic>Discussion</italic>: this involves a comparison of CRISPR knockout RNA-seq signatures with signatures for small molecule inhibitors. Such an analysis would not have been possible without newly acquired data since no database of which we are aware has the necessary information on CRISPR and small molecule perturbations.</p><p>Moreover, in the section of the results describing USP8 we discuss use of our RNA-seq data and the DepMap to generate hypotheses about USP8 biology. The RNA-seq data gives insight into the downstream pathways that are perturbed (e.g. cytokine expression in the case of USP8 knockout) which provided additional insight beyond the functions predicted by the databases (endosomal sorting in the case of USP8). Many receptors are trafficked through endosomes, so predicting that cytokine signaling would be the dominant pathway perturbed by loss of ESCRT machinery would not have been intuitive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3B: USP5 is represented twice, and one of these instances should probably instead be USP53.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this typographical error. We updated Figure 3B to correct the instance of USP5 that is supposed to be USP53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please provide the GEO accession number for the new data.</p></disp-quote><p>The GEO accession number (GSE187008) has been added to the Data Availability section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The abstract could better reflect the findings. A current focus is on c-myc, where it is somewhat unclear what new biology has been discovered.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We removed the reference to c-myc and instead highlighted the individual DUBs that are the focus of the follow up studies in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the discussion, page 30, &quot;… by a molecule that inhibits multiple TP53-regulating DUBs&quot;. Do multiple TP53-regulating DUBs have highly similar binding pockets? And wouldn't such nonspecific inhibitors have more off-target effects? Is there prior evidence that makes this a viable strategy?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this issue. Our study suggests it would be worth targeting the redundancy of the DUB p53 regulatory mechanism. However, we were actually imagining that it might be necessary to develop a combination therapy to achieve this. The possibility that a multi-targeting compound might be developed is less certain, for the reasons the reviewer describes. To make it clear that multiple, selective DUB inhibitors may be the easiest way to address redundancy we modified the sentence in the Discussion to:</p><p>“This could potentially be achieved by developing a small molecule inhibitor active against multiple TP53-regulating DUBs or by using a combination of selective compounds.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Clearer explanations on steps taken and thresholds applied:</p><p>– Knockout/RNA-seq data and Figure 2A: Why were those 81 DUBs chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>At the time this part of our study was performed, it seemed logical to use a commercially available guide RNA collection, in part because it would then be easy for others to repeat relevant aspects of our study. We therefore used a library from Dharmacon that is predominantly focused on DUBs. To our knowledge, there is no specific reason that the 81 DUBs in this library were selected out of ~100 in the whole genome. One factor is that, at the time that the library was constructed, annotation of DUBs was incomplete. For example, there are no guides in the library targeting the genes in the recently discovered MINDY and ZUP1 DUB families. To make this point clear we have modified the main text to read:</p><p>“To generate knockouts, we used a commercially available arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 81 out of ~100 DUBs and 13 additional proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, including ubiquitin-like proteins…”</p><p>We have written to Dharmacon to recommend that they update the collection in the DUB focused CRISPR library to make it more comprehensive and up to date, and they stated they are now considering this possibility. We anticipate that publication of this manuscript will increase their enthusiasm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Many terms used are highly specialized and not easily accessible to the general reader of eLife. The manuscript would benefit from an effort to provide simplified explanations for the rationale and what can be extrapolated in biological terms.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point! In response, we have made two changes to the manuscript. First, we have added a new Table (Table 1) that briefly describes specific data types as well as their key features, parameters, and abbreviations. Second, we have revised the text to ensure that a rationale is included for each of the datasets collected and resources used. This rationale is included in the first section of the results so the reader will understand the approach before detailed information on individual DUBs is presented.</p><p>For example, we expanded the rationale for collecting knockout RNA-seq data and using the CMap, which now states:</p><p>“As a first step, we sought to leverage CMap to identify genes that, when silenced with RNAi, or overexpressed, had similar transcriptional effects as DUB knockouts. Perturbations that act on the same pathway often share similar transcriptomic signatures. (Lamb et al., 2006)”</p><p>The rationale for the DepMap analysis is:</p><p>“It has been observed that genes with similar DepMap scores across cell lines are more likely to have related biological functions (Meyers et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2018; Tsherniak et al., 2017), a property known as co-dependency. More specifically, co-dependent genes are frequently found to lie in the same or parallel pathways (as defined by gene ontology (GO), for example) or to be members of the same protein complex. We identified co-dependent genes for DUBs and then ran GO enrichment analysis to identify pathways in which they were likely to be active.”</p><p>The rationale for the protein-protein interaction analysis and co-expression analysis is:</p><p>“Second, we used protein-protein interaction databases (PPIDs) such as BioGRID, IntAct, Pathway Commons, and NURSA to ascertain whether co-dependent genes might interact physically with one another. Third, we searched CCLE proteomics data for proteins whose expression levels across ~375 cell lines strongly correlated with the level of each DUB; it has previously been observed that proteins in the same complex are often co-expressed to a significant degree across a cell line panel (Nusinow et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please provide information on how thresholds were selected. For example, genes whose knockout resulted in 20 or more DE genes – why 20? Page 24: why top 7 co-dependent genes? (Sometimes, details are available in the methods section, but it would help readers to have it briefly mentioned in the main text as well.) What do the authors consider a significant &quot;normalized enrichment score&quot;, what a good &quot;CMap tau score&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>These are all good points. In response we have added the text to clarify threshold our selections, while also admitting that the specific values are sometimes somewhat arbitrary. Our goal was to set them at a level that emphasized strong phenotypes that we might attempt to explain biologically. For example, for co-dependent genes we played with a range of threshold values and found using a large number had little impact on the conclusions: when more weaker phenotypes were included in the analysis, few additional insights were obtained (see below). We have provided the complete dataset so other researchers interested in exploring the data more deeply can easily apply different thresholds.</p><p>There were also some boundaries imposed by the methodology. For example, the CMap tool requires at least 10 differentially expressed genes for a signature query, but not all gene names are included in the CMap analysis because the tool uses only ~10,000 genes that are either measured or judged to be reliably inferred from L1000 signatures. Thus, we selected for analysis only knockouts that resulted in &gt;20 significantly differentially expressed genes. All raw RNA-seq data are available on GEO (accession number: GSE187008) and differential expression results are provided on Synapse (syn25008205), so the readers can easily explore subtler phenotypes as well.</p><p>To explain our choice of 7 top co-dependent genes for the DepMap analysis, we added the following sentence to the Results section: “When the top five, seven, or ten co-dependent genes were analyzed with GO enrichment analysis, the overall results were similar, but because the top seven co-dependent gene analysis yielded the largest number of anticipated GO terms for the well-characterized DUBs, we used the top seven co-dependent genes.” These details are reiterated in the Methods section. We uploaded the code for analyzing the top co-dependent genes in the DepMap to GitHub (https://github.com/lauradohertyws/DUBcodependencies) so that the reader can easily run the code with different thresholds.</p><p>We did not use the Normalized Enrichment Score as a threshold for significance. Instead, we used the adjusted p-value to identify significant gene sets (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05). We therefore added the adjusted p-values in parentheses along with the Normalized Enrichment Scores to demonstrate the significance of the results.</p><p>The Broad recommends that CMap tau scores larger than 90 be considered significant. The following sentence is included in the Results section:</p><p>“We used the recommended threshold of tau similarity score &gt; 90 to determine significantly similar perturbations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Since your paper is considered for the &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; section, we won't make this a prerequisite for publication, but the confidence of the community in the mined data would be greatly enhanced by providing at least one targeted follow-up experiment on one of the novel hypotheses generated – for example substantiating novel findings presented in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly appreciate this feedback but are not sure that we understand the criticism. From our perspective, the majority of the manuscript is made up of follow-up experiments designed to test the veracity of conclusions from database analyses. Admittedly, these do not have the depth one would expect for a manuscript focused on a single gene, but we have arrived at a number of new and potentially significant conclusions. The Discussion and DUB Portal now discuss how our “validation” studies could be followed up further. Specific examples of hypotheses from data-mining that were confirmed experimentally include the following:</p><p>1. By comparing the KO of USP14 to inhibition of USP14 with a small molecule inhibitor we confirmed that loss of USP14 enzymatic activity results in selective upregulation of the ubiquitin gene. This provides experimental evidence that the correlation between USP14 and ubiquitin in the DepMap is meaningful. Given the many reported functions for USP14, the resulting hypothesis that it plays a key role in ubiquitin recycling, and this is likely to be its primary non-redundant function is unexpected.</p><p>2. Using additional CRISPR knockouts we compared the impact of loss of USP8 on cytokine transcription to the impact of loss of ESCRT components to determine whether the phenotype was likely due to perturbed ESCRT function. The ESCRT members we selected to test were chosen based on the analysis of the DepMap.</p><p>3. Based on the DepMap analysis, we predicted that C16orf72 would be a novel regulator of TP53 signaling. When we knocked out C16orf72 we observed an impact on TP53 target genes. To our knowledge (at least at the time of our experiment) no connection between C16orf72 and TP53 existed in the literature.</p><p>4. Given the strong correlation between MDM2 and USP7 (as well as more recent literature on USP7), we predicted that knockdown of TP53 would rescue the impact of a USP7 inhibitor, and we tested this experimentally.</p><p>5. Analysis of the DepMap suggested that USPL1’s key function is in the Little Elongation Complex. Although USPL1 has been connected to the Little Elongation Complex in the literature, USPL1 has not been well-characterized, so the systematic comparison of USPL1 loss to loss of other components of the Little Elongation Complex is a valuable test of data derived from integrated DUB analysis. We conclude the pleiotropic phenotype associated with following loss of USPL1 is mediated by the Little Elongation Complex rather than another, as-yet undiscovered function of USPL1.</p><p>6. We also provide confidence in the mined data via systematic comparisons with a large body of existing DUB literature. This should provide confidence to readers less familiar with DUB biology.</p></body></sub-article></article>
