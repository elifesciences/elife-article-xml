However, these clocks have limited accuracy in short time-scales. Here we trained deep learning models on fundus images from the EyePACS dataset to predict individuals’ chronological age. Our retinal aging clocking, ‘eyeAge’, predicted chronological age more accurately than other aging clocks (mean absolute error of 2.86 and 3.30 years on quality-filtered data from EyePACS and UK Biobank, respectively). Additionally, eyeAge was independent of blood marker-based measures of biological age, maintaining an all-cause mortality hazard ratio of 1.026 even when adjusted for phenotypic age. The individual-specific nature of eyeAge was reinforced via multiple GWAS hits in the UK Biobank cohort. The top GWAS locus was further validated via knockdown of the fly homolog, <italic>Alk</italic>, which slowed age-related decline in vision in flies. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a retinal aging clock for studying aging and age-related diseases and quantitatively measuring aging on very short time-scales, opening avenues for quick and actionable evaluation of gero-protective therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging clock</kwd><kwd>fundus imaging</kwd><kwd>deep learning</kwd><kwd>biological age</kwd><kwd>longitudinal sampling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AG000266-23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Kenneth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG038688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapahi</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG045835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapahi</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

Identifying specific markers of aging is a critical area of research, as each individual ages uniquely depending on both genetic and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahadi et al., 2020</xref>). While a variety of aging clocks have recently been developed to track the aging process, including phenotypic age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; a combination of chronological age and nine biomarkers predictive of mortality) and epigenetic clocks derived from DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>), many require a blood draw and multiplex assay of many analytes.</p><p>A growing body of evidence suggests that the microvasculature in the retina might be a reliable indicator of the overall health of the body’s circulatory system and the brain. Changes in the eyes accompany aging and many age-related diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luu and Palczewski, 2018</xref>), diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Namperumalsamy et al., 2009</xref>), and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luu and Palczewski, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archibald et al., 2009</xref>) and Alzheimer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frost et al., 2013</xref>). Eyes are also ideal windows for early detection of systemic diseases by ophthalmologists, including AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunningham and Margolis, 1998</xref>), chronic hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong and McIntosh, 2005</xref>), and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kreusel et al., 2002</xref>). This broad utility is perhaps unsurprising, as any subtle changes in the vascular system first appear in the smallest blood vessels, and retinal capillaries are amongst the smallest in the body.</p><p>The subtle changes induced in these small vessels often go undetected by even the most sophisticated instruments, necessitating the use of better approaches involving deep learning. Fundus imaging has proven to be a powerful and non-invasive means for identifying specific markers of eye-related health. Deep-learning was initially employed to predict diabetic retinopathy from retinal images at accuracies matching, or even exceeding, experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gulshan et al., 2016</xref>). Since then, retinal images have been employed to identify at least 39 fundus diseases including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong and McIntosh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cen et al., 2021</xref>), cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poplin et al., 2018</xref>), chronic kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sabanayagam et al., 2020</xref>), and, most recently, in predicting age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2023</xref>). Given its non-invasive, low-cost nature, retinal imaging provides an intriguing opportunity for longitudinal patient analysis to assess the rate of aging.</p><p>Here, we use deep learning models to predict chronological age from fundus retinal images, hereafter ‘eyeAge’, and use the deviation of this value from chronological age, hereafter ‘eyeAgeAccel’, for mortality and association analyses. We train this model on the well-studied EyePACS dataset and apply it on both the EyePACS and UK Biobank cohorts. Together, our results suggest that the trajectory of an individual’s biological age can be predicted in timelines under a year and that statistically significant genome-wide associations are possible. Enrichment analysis of top GWAS hits as well as experimental validation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>ALKAL2</italic>, a gene in the top GWAS locus, indicates genetic markers of visual decline with age and demonstrates the potential predictive power of a retinal aging clock in assessing biological age.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prediction of age from fundus images</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the analysis workflow for the study. Using the EyePACS dataset, we trained a fundus image model on 217,289 examples from 100,692 patients and tuned it on 54,292 images from 25,238 patients. These models were employed for longitudinal analysis of repeat patients and also applied on the UK Biobank dataset (119,532 images) which had a notably distinct demographic distribution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For both studies, most visits generated two images, one image each for the left and right eye, the EyePACs dataset had more repeat visits by patients making the ratio of total images to total patients slightly larger (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In both analyses, we took the average of the predictions between the left and right eye from a single visit to infer age (See Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of analysis pipeline.</title><p>EyePACS images were split into train and tune sets based on the patient. The model was then trained with the final model step being selected via the tune set. Prediction results on the EyePACS tune set were used for longitudinal analysis of aging. After filtering for image quality, inference was performed with the same model on the UK Biobank dataset and filtering for image quality, and the resulting eyeAgeAccel was used for GWAS analysis.

Next, we evaluated the efficacy of our predictions in one to two year time scales using longitudinal data. Using the EyePACS Tune dataset, we restricted ourselves to data from patients with exactly two visits (1719 subjects) and examined the models’ ability to order the two visits over multiple time scales. Note that no longitudinal information about patients was specifically used to train or tune the model to predict chronological age. While the observed and predicted age differences between the two visits (M=0.033, SD = 2.34, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) had low correlation (pearson ⍴=0.17, p-value = 1.4e-12), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that the model correctly ordered 71% of visits within a year with an MAE less than 2 years.

These clinical markers enabled comparison of eyeAge with phenoAge, a clinical blood marker-based aging clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The observed 0.87 correlation between eyeAge and chronological age in the UK Biobank cohort was consistent with (and slightly higher than) the observed correlation of phenoAge and chronological age (0.82) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

In this study, we applied deep learning models for predicting an individual’s age from retinal fundus images and showed that these predictions may be informative for tracking aging patterns longitudinally. While other cellular and blood-related molecular markers of aging have recently been identified, these are at times invasive and, although accurate, take a long time to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horvath, 2013</xref>). Other aging clocks from blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peters et al., 2015</xref>), saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocklandt et al., 2011</xref>), skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bocklandt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleischer et al., 2018</xref>), muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mamoshina et al., 2018</xref>), and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) showed an MAE deviating 4–8 years from the actual age. More dynamic markers such as proteins and metabolites can track aging in shorter time intervals but are still limited to 2–4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahadi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, using deep learning models on retina fundus images, we were able to predict changes in aging at a granularity of less than a year. These small time-scales, and relative low-cost of imaging, makes eyeAge promising for longitudinal studies.</p><p>Correlation and hazard ratio analyses from our study suggest that eyeAge and phenotypic age are conditionally independent given chronological age. Therefore, eyeAge is a potential biomarker that reflects a layer of biological aging not included in blood markers. This is supported by our GWAS findings; different genes were associated with eyeAgeAccel compared to phenoAgeAccel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuo et al., 2021</xref>). However, there are limitations with this approach. Similar to other aging clocks (such as DNA-methylome), eyeAge underperforms phenotypic age in mortality prediction. This is likely because the biomarkers used to calculate phenotypic age were explicitly selected based on their ability to predict mortality. New algorithms that incorporate blood markers and retinal clocks have the potential to be better predictors of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, it remains to be seen whether eyeAgeAccel would reflect interventions such as behavioral changes or medication.</p><p>Our GWAS identified candidate genes associated with several eye- and age-related functions, such as <italic>POC5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>GJA3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). Additional significant candidates had previously identified functions that are not restricted to the eye but are still related to age, e.g. <italic>MEF2C</italic> being associated with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xue et al., 2021</xref>) and multiple candidates (TSPAN11, NKX6-1, SLC16A1, RAET1G, SNTG1, ARRDC3, RASSF3, DIRC3, and GCNT3) associated with cancer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). These suggest that eyeAge may identify general signatures of aging rather than purely eye-related traits. Pathway analyses similarly were split between eye-related pathways and others that were not eye-specific. While we suspect many of the eye-related pathways to have an aging component, some pathways may be enriched artifactually. For example, though melanin biosynthesis has been associated with protection from photodamage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hodge et al., 2022</xref>), the predicted quality of fundus images has also been shown to be influenced by eye color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guenther et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, an independent group separately identified our top GWAS candidate locus as the most significant locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goallec et al., 2021</xref>). This combined with previous studies showing <italic>ALK</italic> to be important for lifespan extension in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodling et al., 2020</xref>) and our own experimental validation confirming improved ocular health in a fly homolog, <italic>Alk,</italic> is compelling evidence of a true biological signal in the GWAS.</p><p>Taken together, our work reinforces the utility of fundus imaging for evaluating overall health and opens up new opportunities for using it to predict longevity. eyeAge has substantial applications in aging and aging-related diseases, from biomarker application to tracking therapeutics. In particular, the retinal aging clock because of its ease of use, low cost, and non-invasive sample collection, has the unique potential to additionally assess lifestyle and environmental factors implicated in aging. Retinal aging clocks can be immensely valuable to future clinical trials of rejuvenation/anti-aging therapies and for personalized medicine to measure improvements in aging over short periods, not only improving actionability but also enabling rapid iteration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, <italic>w<sup>Dah</sup></italic> background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, females)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>Dah</sup> control strain</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Laboratory of Linda Partridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodling et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained in Kapahi Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, <italic>w<sup>Dah</sup></italic> background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, females)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-ALK<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> RNAi for <italic>ALK</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Laboratory of Linda Partridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodling et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VDRC GD 11446</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained in Kapahi Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, <italic>w<sup>Dah</sup></italic> background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, females)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-ALK<sup>DN</sup> dominant negative ALK overexpression</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Laboratory of Linda Partridge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodling et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained in Kapahi Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, <italic>w<sup>Dah</sup></italic> background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, females)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>elav-GS Ru486 inducible Gal4 driver</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Woodling et al., 2020</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC 43642</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained in Kapahi Lab</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RU486 (mifepristone)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">United States Biological, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">282888</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">For inducting fly GeneSwitch expression system; 200 µM final concentration in food</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>EyeAge model development</title><p>Model development was done on the EyePACS train dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

As some of the color fundus images in the UK Biobank dataset were of very low quality, we also trained a separate deep learning model to predict image quality, similar to what was reported in our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mitani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Varadarajan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>EyeAge model evaluation</title><p>The model described above was applied to images to predict chronological age. The image quality model described above was used to discard low quality images – reducing the initial 85,645 patient (174,049 image) dataset to 66,533 patients (120,362 images). Finally, we restricted the data to the first assessment visit to UK Biobank. This was done to reduce bias associated with image quality differences, as we observed quality differences between images captured in the later follow-up visits. Since these follow-up visits happened several years after the initial assessment, the time to event or censorship is much smaller, and a model could exploit this association. For participants that had images of both eyes passing the quality filter, we averaged the predictions across the two eyes. After these processing steps, we ended up with 55,267 data points total, one per remaining participant. Next, using the predicted eyeAge and the chronologicalAge of the participant at the time of imaging, an ‘eyeAgeAcceleration’ score was calculated for each participant as the residuals of the ordinary least squares regression model ‘chronologicalAge ~eyeAge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In order to compare with another well-known biological marker of age, phenoAge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) was also computed using the values of blood markers available for the participants. PhenoAgeAcceleration was then computed in an analogous manner to eyeAgeAcceleration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Method on selection of random set</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> required identification of matched, random individuals to assess the potential person-specific component of eyeAge predictions. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, we created matched sets of visit pairs for each patient’s first visit by identifying a randomly matching patient visit that was 0–2 years after a patient’s first visit. To eliminate artifacts due to sampling differences between first and second visits, once we identified a patient’s first visit to match, we constrained its set of potential randomly matched patient visits to only be from second visits. For the longitudinal analysis in 2B (right), individuals were split both by age and by time between visits (using 2 month buckets) and, again, randomly matched. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the individuals were split evenly in 2-year buckets. Individuals within the same bucket had their left and right predictions compared to one another.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Regression analyses in UK Biobank</title><p>Cox proportional hazards regression was performed using the lifelines package, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines">https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines</ext-link>. Since retinal imaging was performed at the initial visit, individuals with events with an unknown date or date prior to the initial visit were excluded. All UK Biobank algorithmically defined outcomes with at least 4000 events were analyzed: asthma (field 42014), COPD (field 42016), dementia (field 42018), myocardial infarction (field 42000), all-cause Parkinsonism (field 42030), and stroke (field 42006). We note that because eyeAgeAccel is defined as eyeAge - alpha * age - beta for constants alpha and beta identified through regression of age on eyeAge, hazard ratios for eyeAge are identical to those in which eyeAgeAccel is used in the model instead.</p><p>Linear regression was performed on morbidity-related measurements taken at the same visit during which retinal imaging occurred, and was implemented using the statsmodels package with the model INT(outcome)~INT(age)+sex + INT(eyeAgeAccel), where INT(...) represents the rank-based inverse normal transformation. Individuals for which any of the outcome, age, or eyeAgeAccel variables were in the top 1% of outlier values were excluded. Measurements analyzed were: Overall health rating (field 2178), Long-standing illness (field 2188), Systolic blood pressure (field 4080), Diastolic blood pressure (field 4079), Pulse wave arterial stiffness index (field 21021), Health score (England) (field 26413), Fluid intelligence score (field 20016).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>GWAS</title><p>The eyeAgeAccel value defined above was used as the target for GWAS analysis. GWAS analysis was performed on the fundus-based phenotype as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alipanahi et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, samples were restricted to individuals of European ancestry to avoid confounding effects due to population structure. European genetic ancestry was defined by computing the medioid of the 15-dimensional space of the top genetic principal components in individuals who self-identified as ‘British’ ancestry and defining all individuals within a distance of 40 from the medioid as ‘European’ (corresponding to the 99th percentile of distances of all individuals who self-identified as British or Irish). Samples were further restricted to those who also passed sample quality control measures computed by UK Biobank, that is those not flagged as outliers for heterozygosity or missingness, possessing a putative sex chromosome aneuploidy, or whose self-reported and genetically inferred sex were discordant.</p><p>BOLT-LMM v2.3.4 was used to examine associations between genotype and eyeAgeAcceleration in European individuals in the UK Biobank (n=45,444). All genotyped variants with minor allele frequency &gt;0.001 were used to perform model fitting and heritability estimation. GWAS was performed in genotyped variants and imputed variants on autosomal chromosomes, with imputed variants filtered to exclude those with minor allele frequency (MAF) &lt;0.001, imputation INFO score &lt;0.8, or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) <italic>P</italic>&lt;1 × 10<sup>–10</sup> in Europeans. In total, 13,297,147 variants passed all quality control measures. Covariates included in the association study were chronological age, sex, genotyping array type, the top five principal components of genetic ancestry, and indicator variables for the six assessment centers used for the imaging.</p><p>Genome-wide suggestive (p≤1 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) lead SNPs, independent at R<sup>2</sup> ≤0.1, were identified using the –clump command in PLINK version v1.90b4. The LD reference panel contained 10,000 unrelated UK Biobank subjects of European ancestry (as defined above). To identify distinct non-overlapping loci of association, all variants with R<sup>2</sup> ≥0.1 with a lead SNP were grouped into a ‘cluster’ with that lead SNP, and subsequently clusters within 250 kilobases of each other were merged, with the lowest p-value lead SNP retained as the locus representative. Putative causal variants were identified using susieR version 0.9.0. At each locus containing at least 10 variants in LD, the susieR::susie_suff_stat function was used to estimate posterior inclusion probabilities for each variant in the locus, using the same LD reference panel as was used to generate loci and with a maximum of L=10 causal variants per locus and 200 iterations of coordinate ascent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Validation of Alk in fly</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Fly husbandry and phenotyping</title><p>For fly crosses, 15 virgin females were crossed with 3 males in bottles containing 1.55% live yeast, cornmeal, sugar, and agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional investigations on the age acceleration residuals are suggested, to differentiate between chronological and biological aging, which is needed.</p><p>2) Additional follow-up analyses in UKB as suggested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The clock is trained on chronological age and age acceleration measures are compared between this clock and phenotypic age acceleration. However, another way would have been to train the clock on phenotypic age instead of chronological age. The second-generation epigenetic clocks are done in this way and those clocks perform better than the first-generation clocks. Since the authors use two sets of data, this approach could have been employed if starting with the UK Biobank where the phenoage clock is available. Could the authors please comment on this approach and discuss whether you think that your results could have been different?</p><p>Gender is a social construct while sex is the biological variable that is intended in this paper. Please change accordingly.</p><p>Please comment on sex differences. Are there differences in retinal aging between men and women? Is the eye clock performing better if trained separately in men and women? Whenever possible, please provide supplementary figures for sex-stratified analyses (Table 1, Figure 3D, etc.).</p><p>Figure 3D – please provide the full scale on the x-axis, and add the 95% Cis in numbers.</p><p>How is the pathway enrichment analysis done? I cannot find any information on that. Likewise, no statistical analysis section is included in the methods. A description of the Cox models is needed. Are the proportional hazards assumption met? How is age adjusted for in the model? What is the underlying time scale? Many more lifestyle factors etc. are available in UK Biobank that could additionally be adjusted for in the model.</p><p>The GWAS result, how does it compare to other GWAS of biological aging? There have been GWAS publications on phenotypic age, epigenetic clocks, telomere length, mitochondrial DNA abundance, etc.</p><p>For all figures: The figure legend should stand alone. Please provide additional information about the data used in the figure, sample sizes, methods used to perform the analyses, etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below I have a few specific comments that, being addressed, would improve the article:</p><p>The background in para 1 requires a bit of revision for accuracy:</p><p>– In para 1, the article states that the PhenoAge is an algorithm derived from blood biomarkers based on chronological age. It is not. In fact, the PhenoAge includes chronological age as a component in addition to biomarker information. The biomarkers included were selected on the basis of their age-independent associations with mortality risk. The parenthetical text should be revised.</p><p>– Also in para 1, the authors refer to &quot;an epigenetic clock&quot;. But the reference is to a review article that summarizes many of these clocks. I would suggest that they should simply refer to &quot;clocks&quot; plural.</p><p>– Finally the suggestion that these clocks require invasive cell or tissue extraction is a bit of an overstatement. What the existing measures of biological age do require is a blood draw + multiplex assay. The authors should just say that.</p><p>The longitudinal analysis reported in para 2 is very helpful. However, given the claims about the accuracy of the assessment, the authors should report how close the estimated change in age from the retinal measures was to the calendar time elapsed between measurements, not just the probability that the measurements were correctly ordered. (perhaps this is what they are reporting as MAE in this analysis. But if so, it should be clarified) Also, given the very large size of the EyePACS data, it would be feasible to exclude the longitudinal samples from the training entirely. This would make for a cleaner version of the longitudinal analysis, although I don't think this is necessary.</p><p>The UKB analysis comparing EyeAge and PhenoAge is also very helpful. However, it would be enhanced by including a set of analyses in which both EyeAge and PhenoAge were regressed on chronological age (separately) and residual values predicted. The correlation among these residuals will inform whether the biological aging information in the two measures is similar or different. In addition, it would be helpful to see effect sizes for associations of the residuals with mortality. (separate models for each measure with the inclusion of covariates for chronological age and sex would be ideal) These additional analyses can clarify (a) how similar the age-independent information in the two measures is, and (b) how they compare as mortality predictors.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Longitudinal fundus imaging and its genome-wide association analysis provide evidence for a human retinal aging clock&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below by reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed the reviewer comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have mostly addressed my comments.

As noted below, based on data reported by the authors, the accuracy of prediction of time elapsed between repeated measures is &lt;3%. The claim in the abstract should be revised for clarity.</p><p>Further comments:</p><p>original reviewer comment: The longitudinal analysis reported in para 2 is very helpful. However, given the claims about the accuracy of the assessment, the authors should report how close the estimated change in age from the retinal measures was to the calendar time elapsed between measurements, not just the probability that the measurements were correctly ordered. (perhaps this is what they are reporting as MAE in this analysis. But if so, it should be clarified).</p><p>Author response: Correlation calculated between estimated change in chronological age and predicted age, while significant, is low (pearson Rho = 0.17, p-value = 1.4e-12). These differences may be due to the distinction of measuring chronological age vs. biological age as well as the inherent noise associated in the measurement. However, we agree that this information may be valuable to the reader and we have included this correlation number and p-value in the manuscript (changes underlined below).</p><p>&quot;Using the EyePACS Tune dataset, we restricted ourselves to data from patients with exactly two visits (1,719 subjects) and examined the models' ability to order the two visits over multiple time scales. Note that no longitudinal information about patients was specifically used to train or tune the model to predict chronological age. While the observed and predicted age differences between the two visits had low correlation (pearson ⍴ = 0.17, p-value = 1.4e-12), …&quot;.</p><p>R1 reviewer comment: That correlation is quite low. However, to interpret it, we need a bit more information about how much variation there is in time elapsed between the two visits included in analysis. I wonder if a scatterplot as a supplemental figure would help clarify. Specifically, I am thinking that if there is little variation in the time elapsed, the correlation is likely to be very low. Why not instead report the distribution of the prediction error? In other words, what was the mean and SD of the difference between time elapsed and change in EyeAge?</p><p>In addition, the authors should revise the statement in the abstract:</p><p>&quot;Longitudinal studies showed that the resulting models were able to predict individuals' aging in time-scales less than a year with 71% accuracy&quot;.</p><p>In fact, it appears that the accuracy of prediction is just slightly under 3% (i.e. 0.17^2). What the algorithm could do with 71% accuracy was correctly order two repeated observations in time. The abstract should be revised.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82364.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The clock is trained on chronological age and age acceleration measures are compared between this clock and phenotypic age acceleration.

This introduces a clear collinearity between the variables, since chronological age is included multiple times with different weights.

In both metrics the fidelity decreased in older groups and with smaller age gaps.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors should revise the statement in the abstract:</p><p>&quot;Longitudinal studies showed that the resulting models were able to predict individuals' aging in time-scales less than a year with 71% accuracy&quot;.</p><p>In fact, it appears that the accuracy of prediction is just slightly under 3% (i.e. 0.17^2).
