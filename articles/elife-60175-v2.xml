The canonical model is that 3:3 interactions between SUN and KASH proteins underlie the nucleocytoskeletal linkages provided by the LINC complex. Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence that SUN-KASH is a constitutive 6:6 complex in which two constituent 3:3 complexes interact head-to-head. A common SUN-KASH topology is achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interaction mechanisms by distinct KASH proteins, including zinc-coordination by Nesprin-4. The SUN-KASH 6:6 interface provides a molecular mechanism for the establishment of integrative and distributive connections between 3:3 structures within a branched LINC complex network. In this model, SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes act as nodes for force distribution and integration between adjacent SUN and KASH molecules, enabling the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LINC complex</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>SUN1</kwd><kwd>Nesprin-1</kwd><kwd>Nesprin-4</kwd><kwd>KASH5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104158/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Owen Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104158/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Owen Richard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The LINC complex has a core 6:6 structure in which KASH-binding induces head-to-head interactions between SUN trimers, suggesting force transduction between cytoskeletal and nuclear components through branched LINC complex networks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear envelope partitions nuclear components from the cytoskeleton, thereby necessitating their mechanical coupling across the nuclear envelope to enable cytoskeletal function in the structure and positioning of nuclear contents.

SUN proteins then traverse the approximately 50 nm peri-nuclear space and cross the inner nuclear membrane, enabling their N-termini to bind to nuclear contents, including reported interactions with the nuclear lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haque et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haque et al., 2010</xref>), chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2007</xref>), and the telomeric ends of meiotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shibuya et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, KASH domain proteins cross the outer nuclear membrane and have large cytoplasmic extensions to enable their N-termini to bind to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spindler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>). Thus, the LINC complex axis is established by a peri-nuclear SUN-KASH core interaction and mechanically couples the cytoskeleton and nuclear contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, there are five SUN proteins, of which SUN1 and SUN2 are widely expressed and perform partially redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). There are similarly multiple KASH proteins, four of which are Nesprins (Nuclear Envelope Spectrin Repeat proteins). Nesprin-1 and Nesprin-2 are widely expressed, perform overlapping functions and contain large cytoplasmic spectrin-repeat domains with N-termini that bind to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sakamoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2018a</xref>). Nesprin-3 shares a similar KASH domain but its cytoplasmic region binds to plectin, mediating interactions with intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilhelmsen et al., 2005</xref>). The two most divergent KASH proteins, Nesprin-4 and KASH5, exhibit substantial sequence diversity within their KASH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Nesprin-4 functions in the outer hair cells of the inner ear and is essential for hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2013a</xref>). Its N-terminus interacts with kinesin, which mediates microtubule binding and plus-end directed movements that achieve the basal positioning of nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 2009</xref>). KASH5 functions in meiosis and is essential for fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horn et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>). Its N-terminus interacts with dynein-dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horn et al., 2013b</xref>), which mediates microtubule binding and minus-end directed motility that drives rapid chromosomal movements to facilitate homologous chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zetka et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, KASH proteins execute a range of LINC complex functions in transmitting actin forces, plus-/minus-end directed microtubule movements and the tensile strength of intermediate filaments into the nucleus.</p><p>The canonical model of the LINC complex is based on crystal structures of the SUN-KASH domain complexes formed between SUN2 and Nesprin-1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The SUN domain adopts a ‘three-leaf clover’-like structure, in which a globular trimer extends from a short N-terminal trimeric coiled-coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sosa et al., 2013</xref>). KASH domains are intertwined between SUN protomers and their path is defined by three distinct regions. The KASH C-terminus contains a triple proline motif that packs between the globular cores of SUN protomers. The KASH mid-region winds around the trimeric arc and is wedged between the globular core of one SUN protomer and a β-turn-β loop, known as the KASH-lid, of the adjacent protomer. The KASH N-terminus then turns by &gt;90° to radiate out from the trimer axis and forms a disulphide bond with a SUN protomer (between SUN2 and KASH1 amino acids C563 and C8774, respectively), which is predicted to enhance the tensile strength of SUN-KASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jahed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>). The extensive 3:3 complex of three KASH domains bound to a single SUN trimer was interpreted as the biological unit of the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). On this basis, it was proposed that the LINC complex consists of a SUN-KASH 3:3 complex that is orientated vertically to allow KASH proteins to cross the outer nuclear membrane and SUN to form an extended trimeric coiled-coil that spans the peri-nuclear space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In support of this model, the luminal region of SUN2 was shown to be trimeric in vitro by analytical ultracentrifugation, SEC-MALS, and gel filtration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahed et al., 2018b</xref>) and upon targeting to the nuclear envelope in vivo, the luminal regions of SUN2 and SUN1 were shown to form trimers and larger structures by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennen et al., 2018</xref>). However, the stoichiometry of SUN-KASH complexes has not yet been tested in solution. Further, whilst it has been widely recognised that branching or higher order assembly of LINC complexes may be advantageous in distributing large forces and achieving coordinated motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahed et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2012</xref>), we have hitherto lacked structural evidence and a molecular basis for higher order assembly of the LINC complex.</p><p>Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence in support of the LINC complex forming a branched network. We find that SUN-KASH complexes between SUN proteins and Nesprin-4, KASH5 and Nesprin-1 are 6:6 structures formed of constitutive interactions between two 3:3 complexes. The three distinct KASH domains provide structurally diverse but related 6:6 interfaces that achieve the same topology with potential hinge-like motion between SUN trimers. The SUN-KASH 6:6 interface consists of a ‘head-to-head’ interaction between SUN’s trimeric C-terminal ‘heads’, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for formation of a branched LINC complex network. Thus, we propose that SUN-KASH domain complexes act as nodes for branching and integration between LINC complexes to achieve the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SUN1-KASH complexes are 6:6 hetero-oligomers</title><p>The previously reported crystal structures of SUN-KASH complexes between SUN2 and Nesprins 1–2 revealed almost identical structures that were interpreted as 3:3 hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The KASH domains of Nesprin-4 and KASH5 exhibit sequence divergence from Nesprins 1–3, including the presence of N-terminal motifs of 381-CCSH-384 and 545-PPP-547, which are conserved within Nesprin-4 and KASH5 sequences, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). On this basis, we reasoned that Nesprin-4 and KASH5 may impose unique SUN-KASH structures that differ from the classical architecture of Nesprin 1–3 complexes, which may underlie their specialised functional roles. We thus solved the X-ray crystal structures of SUN-KASH complexes formed between the SUN domain of SUN1 and KASH domains of Nesprin-4 and KASH5 (herein referred to as SUN1-KASH4 and SUN1-KASH5). The SUN1-KASH4 structure was solved at a resolution of 2.75 Å and revealed a 6:6 assembly in which two globular 3:3 complexes are held in a head-to-head configuration through zinc-coordination by opposing KASH4 molecules across the 6:6 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). The SUN1-KASH5 crystal structure was solved at 1.54 Å resolution and revealed a similar 6:6 assembly in which opposing 3:3 complexes are held together by extensive interactions between opposing KASH5 molecules and KASH-lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,c</xref>). Thus, both Nesprin-4 and KASH5 form SUN-KASH 6:6 hetero-oligomers in which similar topologies of head-to-head 3:3 complexes are achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interfaces.</p><table-wrap

We next solved the crystal structure of the SUN-KASH complex between SUN1 and Nesprin-1 (herein referred to as SUN1-KASH1). The SUN1-KASH1 structure was solved at 1.82 Å resolution and demonstrated a similar 6:6 head-to-head assembly, albeit with less extensive interface-spanning interactions provided solely by opposing KASH-lids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,d</xref>). The electron density indicated the presence of a molecule bound close to the 6:6 interface, which we interpreted as a disordered HEPES molecule from the crystallisation condition. This likely provided structural rigidity that underlies the high resolution of the dataset, but was not essential for the structure as we solved numerous other datasets at lower resolution in which an identical 6:6 interface was present in absence of a bound molecule (data not shown). Importantly, the SUN1-KASH1 structure closely matches the previous SUN2-KASH1/2 structures, in which similar 6:6 interfaces were present in the crystal lattice but were thought to be crystal contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). It was thus critical to determine whether SUN1-KASH1 is a 6:6 complex in solution. We utilised size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) as the gold standard for determining molecular species. SEC-MALS revealed that all SUN1-KASH complexes exist solely as 6:6 hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, their 6:6 complexes remained intact at the lowest detectable concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>) and we failed to detect 3:3 complexes in any biochemical conditions tested. Thus, we conclude that the SUN-KASH complexes formed by SUN1 are constitutive 6:6 hetero-oligomers in which two 3:3 structures are locked in head-to-head interactions. Hence, their 6:6 interfaces could mediate the physical coupling of adjacent LINC complexes within the peri-nuclear space.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes are stable in solution.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) SEC-MALS analysis performed in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT.

The presence of metal ions in the crystal structure was confirmed by corresponding peaks in anomalous difference electron density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), and their identity as zinc ions that were co-purified from bacterial expression was confirmed by the spectrophotometric determination of three zinc ions per 6:6 complex in solution that were lost upon pre-incubation with EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The zinc-sites are coordinated by asymmetric ligands from 381-CCSH-384 motifs of opposing KASH4 molecules, comprising C381 and C382 from one molecule, and C382 and H384 from the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), and mutation of both cysteine residues to serine was sufficient to preclude zinc-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The three zinc-sites form a tripod of interactions that provide the sole interface-spanning contacts between opposing 3:3 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>SUN1-KASH5 demonstrates the most extensive 6:6 interface in which KASH5 molecules and SUN1 KASH-lids from opposing 3:3 complexes wind around each other in a right-handed screw to create a complete circumferential interface enclosing a hollow core, similar to a β-barrel fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). KASH5 follows an almost linear path, packed between a SUN1 globular core and KASH-lids of opposing SUN1 protomers, with N-terminal 545-PPP-547 motifs of opposing molecules interacting across the interface. KASH5 and KASH4 follow similar paths, with KASH5 PPP-motif interactions and KASH4 zinc-sites located at the same positions and providing analogous interface-spanning interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). However, an important distinction is that a torsional rotation of approximately 20° between the 3:3 complexes of SUN1-KASH5, relative to SUN1-KASH4, brings together opposing KASH-lids and enables their interaction across the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Thus, tip-to-tip interactions via amino acids I673 and F671 of opposing SUN1 KASH-lids contribute to the extensive 6:6 interface of SUN1-KASH5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p><p>The SUN1-KASH1 6:6 complex is formed solely of a tripod of KASH-lid tip-to-tip interactions mediated by amino acids I673 and F671, in the same manner and owing to the same torsional rotation as in the SUN1-KASH5 structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). KASH1 undergoes acute angulation away from the 6:6 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>), as previously observed in SUN2-KASH1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). As such, whilst amino acid F8784 binds to the KASH-lids of each tip-to-tip interaction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>), KASH1’s N-terminus does not contribute to the 6:6 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). This creates an open interface, with large solvent channels between opposing 3:3 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Overall, the three structures demonstrate alternative SUN-KASH 6:6 interaction mechanisms that are differentially exploited by KASH proteins.</p><p>Our findings of differential 6:6 assembly mechanisms raise the possibility that the same SUN1-KASH 6:6 complex could be supported by distinct interfaces. We confirmed this hypothesis for SUN1-KASH4 through the finding that the 6:6 complex is retained upon zinc removal by pre-incubation with EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), likely through reversal to a KASH1-like interface in which the head-to-head interaction is mediated solely by SUN1 amino acids. The zinc-stripped SUN1-KASH4 complex also formed a prominent 12:12 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that in absence of metal coordination, KASH4 can mediate interactions between KASH1-like 6:6 complexes, which could occur through disulphide bond formation of exposed C381 and C382 amino acids. These findings illustrate how SUN1-KASH4 and SUN1-KASH1 represent either ends of a spectrum of possible inter-trimer interfaces in which 6:6 structures are supported solely by KASH-mediated metal coordination and SUN1’s KASH-lids, respectively. In contrast, SUN1-KASH5 is an intermediate structure that utilises both KASH and KASH-lid mechanisms to form a fully enclosed 6:6 interface.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SUN1-KASH1 complex formation depends on KASH-lid 6:6 interactions</title><p>On the basis of our SUN-KASH crystal structures, we predicted that KASH-lid tip-to-tip interactions are essential for 6:6 hetero-oligomer formation in solution by SUN1-KASH1 but not SUN1-KASH4. We tested this by generating glutamate mutations of KASH-lid tip amino acids I673 and F671, which mediate interface-spanning tip-to-tip interactions within SUN1-KASH1 and SUN1-KASH5 but have no contacts within their respective 3:3 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,f,g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>). We also analysed a glutamate mutation of amino acid W676, which mediates hydrophobic interactions with the KASH domain within a constituent 3:3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>), and acted as a negative control in disrupting all three SUN-KASH complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). It was not possible to analyse SUN-KASH binding through amylose pull-down owing to the non-specific binding between SUN1 and amylose resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Instead, we exploited this phenomenon by using amylose resin to purify complexes and dissociated proteins following GCN4-SUN1 and MBP-KASH co-expression, which we enriched by ion exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>), and then pooled all fractions containing SUN-KASH complexes and dissociated proteins for analysis by analytical gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>).

To address this, we purified SUN2 complexes with the three characteristic KASH proteins. SUN2-KASH4 was stable during purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and SEC-MALS analysis confirmed that it constitutes a 6:6 hetero-oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, SUN2-KASH5 and SUN2-KASH1 proved to be less stable and more heterogeneous than their comparative SUN1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), and underwent substantial dissociation to SUN2 trimers and KASH monomers during SEC-MALS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Nevertheless, eluted SUN2-KASH5 and SUN1-KASH1 complexes are molecular species of 350–650 kDa and 350–850 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>), which are substantially larger than 3:3 complexes (232 kDa) and include 6:6 complexes (463 and 465 kDa). Thus, SEC-MALS profiles likely represent dissociation from SUN2-KASH complexes of 6:6 and higher order hetero-oligomers. We confirmed this for SUN2-KASH1 by introducing SUN2 mutation C705A (designed to prevent disulphide bond formation and hence minimise heterogeneity), which removed higher order structures and demonstrated the presence of dissociating 6:6 hetero-oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Finally, we introduced SUN2 mutation I579E, which targets the inter-trimer interface in precisely the same manner as SUN1 mutation I673E. The SUN2 mutation I579E fully disrupted the SUN2-KASH1 complex, mimicking the phenotype of SUN1 I673E mutation in SUN1-KASH1, confirming that KASH-lid tip-to-tip interactions are essential for assembly of SUN2-KASH1 complexes. Thus, we conclude that despite their lower stability and greater heterogeneity, SUN2-KASH complexes are 6:6 and higher order structures, and interactions that solely span the 6:6 interface are essential for SUN1-KASH1 complex formation.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SUN2 forms 6:6 and higher molecular weight SUN-KASH complexes through head-to-head assembly.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gel filtration analysis shown as SDS-PAGE of elution fractions.

Its head-to-head assembly suggests a horizontal orientation, parallel to the outer nuclear membrane, with SUN trimers organised obliquely within the peri-nuclear space. In this configuration, tension forces carried by SUN and KASH molecules would exert bending moments on the structure, favouring a hinge-like angulation between opposing 3:3 complexes. We thus utilised small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to determine whether SUN-KASH complexes adopt angled conformations in solution. Whilst SAXS data of SUN1-KASH4 and SUN1-KASH5 were closely fitted by their crystal structures upon flexible modelling of missing termini (χ<sup>2</sup> values of 1.25 and 1.70), we achieved only poor fits for SUN1-KASH1 (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In case of large-scale motion, we performed SAXS-based rigid-body modelling using two SUN1-KASH1 3:3 complexes as independent rigid bodies.

In this model, two pairs of KASH-lid tip-to-tip interactions by I673 and F671 are retained, whilst the third is disrupted, and an additional interface is formed between opposing central KASH-lids. Thus, KASH-lids may act as a hinge at the 6:6 interface, allowing the linear crystal structure to open into a continuous range of angled conformations, including (but not limited to) the 60° angulation predicted by SAXS analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SEC-SAXS analysis of SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SAXS scattering curves of SUN1-KASH4, SUN1-KASH5, and SUN1-KASH1 overlaid with theoretical scattering curves of their crystal structures (red), crystal structures with KASH flexible N-termini modelled by CORAL (blue) and rigid body model of two 3:3 complexes (green).

It was previously shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, SEC-MALS, and gel filtration that luminal SUN2 is trimeric, and its isolated SUN domain is a trimer or monomer, depending on biochemical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sosa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahed et al., 2018b</xref>). These findings agree with our observations that the isolated SUN domain of SUN1 becomes monomeric upon cleavage of its N-terminal GCN4 expression tag (which mimics the trimeric luminal coiled-coil), so is entirely dependent on KASH-binding to stabilise its trimeric structure and head-to-head assembly. The only previous analysis of SUN-KASH in solution involved demonstrating complex formation by analytical gel filtration, without means for oligomer determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esra Demircioglu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the 3:3 SUN-KASH model was the natural conclusion of combining SUN’s luminal trimer with the extensive 3:3 complexes within SUN2-KASH1/2 crystal lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Our SEC-MALS and SEC-SAXS analyses provide the first reported evidence of solution structure, revealing that SUN-KASH complexes formed by SUN1 and SUN2 are 6:6 hetero-oligomers in which 3:3 structures are locked in head-to-head interactions, as observed in our SUN1-KASH crystal structures and in previous SUN2-KASH crystal lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Further, mutational analysis confirmed that SUN1/2-KASH1 complexes depend on interactions across the 6:6 interface for their stability. Hence, our conclusion that SUN-KASH complexes are 6:6 hetero-oligomers in vitro is consistent with all existing crystallographic, biochemical, and biophysical data.</p><p>How does the SUN-KASH 6:6 assembly relate to previous observations of LINC complex structure and function within the cell? The oligomeric states of luminal regions of SUN1 and SUN2, upon expression and targeting to the nuclear envelope, were determined by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy as trimers with additional higher order SUN1 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennen et al., 2018</xref>). In these studies, expressed KASH domains and isolated SUN domains remained mostly monomeric, suggesting that expressed constructs did not form SUN-KASH complexes with endogenous partners. Hence, these studies provided important evidence that the coiled-coils of SUN’s luminal regions form trimers and larger oligomers but did not determine the stoichiometry of SUN-KASH complexes. The assembly of higher order LINC structures has also been suggested by numerous other cellular findings, including immobility within the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2008</xref>), foci formation within the meiotic nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horn et al., 2013b</xref>), and the formation of transmembrane actin-associated nuclear (TAN) lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luxton et al., 2010</xref>). Our model of LINC complex branching by SUN-KASH 6:6 assembly is consistent with the observed oligomeric state of SUN’s luminal region and higher order LINC assembly, but its molecular details are not directly tested by any existing cellular data. Thus, our molecular model of a branched LINC complex, and similarly the role of zinc-binding in the SUN1-KASH4 complex, must be tested in future studies of the consequence of separation of function mutations (such as targeting the 6:6 interfaces of SUN1/2-KASH1 complexes by I673E and I579E mutations) on the cellular structure and function of the LINC complex.</p><p>The advantages of a branched LINC complex network include its ability to transmit large forces, being impervious to the breakage of individual linkages, and in mediating communication and coordination between adjacent molecules. The SUN-KASH 6:6 assembly provides an attractive structural means for branching, which may combine with a series of episodic instances of oligomer variation along the SUN-KASH axis to generate a highly branched LINC complex network. Firstly, oligomer variation could occur through higher order assembly of SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes, as indicated by our observation of higher order SUN2-KASH structures and the formation of SUN1-KASH4 12:12 complexes upon disruption of zinc-binding. Secondly, oligomeric variation within SUN’s luminal regions may mediate branching, such as indicated by the formation of trimers and larger oligomer by luminal SUN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennen et al., 2018</xref>) and disulphide bond formation by SUN1 amino acid C526 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, oligomer variation between SUN and KASH proteins could mediate branching across the outer nuclear membrane. Indeed, KASH5 is dimeric (Gurusaran and Davies, unpublished findings), raising the question of how SUN trimers and KASH dimers are organised into discrete 6:6 complexes? We suggest that each KASH dimer likely spans both SUN trimers, thereby establishing a symmetrical array of SUN1-KASH interfaces within each 6:6 structure, which constitute branching events between SUN-KASH5 6:6 complexes and their dimeric cytoskeletal attachments. Thus, we propose that coordinated force transduction is achieved by a highly branched LINC complex network in which SUN-KASH 6:6 hetero-oligomers contribute to branching by mediating force distribution and integration between three KASH dimers and two SUN trimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>The head-to-head nature of SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes suggests their orientation parallel to the outer nuclear membrane, with SUN trimers organised obliquely within the peri-nuclear space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our SAXS analysis of SUN1-KASH1 indicated that it adopts a hinged conformation in solution, stabilised by two KASH-lid tip-to-tip interactions and laterally associated central KASH-lids. Whilst hinged motions were not required to explain SAXS data of SUN1-KASH4/5, normal mode analysis predicted that hinged structures of up to approximately 60° angulation are conformationally accessible states for all three SUN1-KASH complexes. Thus, we suggest that all SUN-KASH head-to-head structures can undergo hinge-like motion at their 6:6 interface, with a large proportion of highly angled conformations accounting for their dominance in the SAXS data of SUN1-KASH1 but not other complexes. This hinge-like motion would result in SUN-KASH complexes becoming angled in response to the magnitude and direction of tension forces carried by SUN and KASH molecules, whilst providing the conformational flexibility necessary for constituent KASH proteins to adopt orientations that allow upstream transmembrane sequences to cross the outer nuclear membrane. Further, all three SUN-KASH 6:6 interfaces are largely hydrophobic, so could be stabilised by interactions with phospholipids, possibly as part of integrated membrane-bound complexes that include KASH’s transmembrane regions. Thus, hinge-like flexibility of SUN-KASH may result in a diverse range of angled conformations owing to distinct tension forces, steric constraints and membrane structures of particular spatiotemporal environments.</p><p>What are the roles of distinct SUN and KASH proteins in LINC complex structure and function? Whilst SUN1 and SUN2 form similar 6:6 hetero-oligomers, we observed notable differences in the stability and higher assembly of their SUN-KASH complexes. The reduced stability of SUN2-KASH complexes could facilitate a faster turnover of SUN2-containing LINC complexes, whilst higher order assembly of SUN2-KASH may combine with differential SUN1/2 luminal assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennen et al., 2018</xref>) to achieve distinct LINC complex architectures. These findings may underlie some of the observed asymmetries between SUN1 and SUN2 LINC complexes, such as their differential preference for cytoskeletal components and their non-redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thakar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">May and Carroll, 2018</xref>). It is important to note that SUN2-KASH4, in which the 6:6 interface is mediated solely by KASH4 zinc sites, is the only SUN2 complex that retains the high affinity observed for SUN1 complexes. In contrast, SUN amino acids contribute to the 6:6 interfaces of KASH1/5 complexes, explaining how SUN protein sequence diversity can account for the substantially reduced affinity of SUN2-KASH1/5 in comparison with their SUN1 complexes. The variation of KASH proteins seemingly provides even greater functional diversity given their entirely non-redundant roles. An intriguing observation is that Nesprin-4 and KASH5, which transduce microtubule forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horn et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morimoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horn et al., 2013b</xref>), demonstrate extensive interactions at their 6:6 interfaces. In contrast, a far less extensive 6:6 interface is found in classical Nesprins, which transduce actin forces and the tensile strength of intermediate filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ketema and Sonnenberg, 2011</xref>). Thus, cytoskeletal components may have differential requirements for the strength, structure and stability of SUN-KASH 6:6 hetero-oligomers. Further, differences in regulatory mechanisms, such as zinc-binding in SUN1-KASH4 assembly, may contribute towards specialisation. The expression levels and relative availability of SUN and KASH proteins will determine their incorporation into LINC complexes, and specialised functionalities may be achieved by combining distinct isoforms within the same LINC complex network or within separate networks of the same cell.</p><p>How is LINC complex assembly regulated within the cell? An intriguing finding is that SUN proteins undergo autoinhibition, in which SUN domains become bound by upstream sequences in monomeric conformations that are incapable of binding to KASH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahed et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahed et al., 2018a</xref>). These autoinhibitory conformations likely represent unassembled states that may be crucial intermediates in the dynamic process of LINC complex expression, localisation, and assembly within the cell. They may also represent a ‘storage form’ of SUN proteins that form when quantities of available KASH proteins are limiting. This would establish discrete pools of assembled and unassembled SUN proteins, which could play an important role in preventing unbound SUN molecules from weakening established LINC structures by continually competing for KASH-binding. Further, given the myriad of LINC complex functions in almost all eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Burke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meinke and Schirmer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Starr and Fridolfsson, 2010</xref>), assembly is likely directed along specific pathways to achieve distinct LINC complex structures for the fulfilment of specialised functions. Thus, regulatory processes must overcome autoinhibition, enable KASH-binding, and direct LINC assembly in a timely manner. These may involve chaperones, enzymatic modification, protein interactions, and/or chemical conditions of the nuclear envelope environment. In specific, these may include regulation by luminal ion concentration and pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahed et al., 2018b</xref>), local regulation of SUN-KASH angulation, control of SUN1-KASH4 assembly by zinc availability, and determining the nature of LINC complexes through relative availability of SUN and KASH protein isoforms. We have hitherto considered variations within SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes, but also recognise the potential for regulatory mechanisms of the nuclear envelope to induce more substantial structural changes. Thus, whilst our model of LINC complex branching through SUN-KASH 6:6 assembly is consistent with all existing data, it remains possible that alternative LINC complex conformations may form within the spatial and temporal contexts of disparate cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sophie Zinn-Justin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The current model of LINC complex organization features a SUN protein trimer that engages with up to three KASH peptides. Inner nuclear membrane SUN proteins, SUN1 and SUN2 in mammalian somatic cells, are anchored to nuclear components including the nuclear lamina, while outer nuclear membrane KASH proteins, which include Nesprin family members, bind a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. In this way, LINC complexes span the two nuclear membranes to mechanically couple nuclear and cytoplasmic structures. In this manuscript Gurusaran and Davies use biochemistry, SEC-MALS, X-ray crystallography, SAXS, and molecular modeling to probe the molecular underpinnings of several SUN-KASH interfaces, including SUN1 with KASH1, KASH4 and KASH5 taken from Nesprin-1, Nesprin-4 and KASH5, respectively. Taking on what has historically been a challenging biochemical system, they succeed in carrying out extensive biophysical analysis on the oligomeric states of these SUN-KASH complexes in solution. Applying these tools, the authors extend previous structural studies on the assembly of LINC complexes through the interactions of SUN and KASH domain proteins to reveal new insights. Specifically, these new biophysical studies support a model in which many LINC complex structures are likely exist in a 6:6 assembly mediated by two SUN trimers in a fashion that is influenced by the specific KASH peptide that is engaged. In this way, the somewhat atypical KASH proteins, KASH4 and KASH5 have a more significant role in stabilizing the head to head associations of SUN1 trimers than do the KASH domains from other Nesprins. Overall the reviewers found the experimental design and quality to be outstanding and robust while the new model for a force distribution network at the nuclear periphery facilitated by a branching network of LINC complexes is provocative. While all reviewers appreciated the structural biology and biophysics and were supportive of publication, there was some concern that it may fall short of providing a realistic view of LINC complex organization in vivo given the lack of supportive data.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Two of the three reviewers found the manuscript overly dismissive of the prior trimer model rather than seeing the work as an extension of previous studies (and found the discussion of the work in this context lacking). Indeed, prior work hypothesized that the trimer model could support a branching network depending on the configuration of SUN and KASH protomers and the cytoskeleton. For example, please see the work from Karakesisoglou and colleagues (Lu et al., 2012). A cautious interpretation by the prior structural biologists (Sosa et al.) given the relatively small buried surface area of the trimers (composed of SUN2) was not inappropriate (without data from solution studies) nor was it inconsistent with the observations here for the SUN1-KASH1 structure. Although the reviewers agree that the solution studies carried out by the authors are critical and provide new insight, they found it unnecessary to over-emphasize this as a major discrepancy, particularly as the authors do not analyze SUN2 in this study. Given all these points, such suggestions in the text should be toned down.</p><p>2) Aspects of the manuscript that are subject to alternative explanations that should be considered/discussed. Including:</p><p>a) The sentence &quot;Thus, KASH-lids act as a hinge at the 6:6 interface, opening the linear crystal structure into an angled conformation that is seemingly more stable in solution&quot; is misleading as it suggests that there is in solution only one structure in which the two trimers have a defined relative position different from that observed in the crystal. The reviewers felt that the manuscript lacks experimental evidence supporting the existence of a more stable structure in solution. Given this, the text should be edited or additional supportive data should be included.</p><p>b) The sentence &quot;the asymmetrical hinged structure places all six KASH1 N-termini in favourable positions and orientations for their upstream transmembrane sequences to cross the outer nuclear membrane&quot; was found to not be convincing. We encourage the authors to consider that some flexibility in the positioning of one trimer relatively to the other enables/facilitates the interaction between two trimeric complexes anchored in the same membrane.</p><p>3) Further clarification in the context of prior biological studies. Please clarify: in the arrangement of the SUN hexamer parallel to the ONM, individual KASH proteins would appear to be non-equivalent. This is compounded by the fact that it is not clear how an individual KASH dimer engages with the two SUN trimers. There are basically two possibilities. In the first, a KASH dimer would engage with a single SUN trimer, with the two KASH peptides occupying adjacent binding sites. The alternative would be that KASH dimers would engage binding sites within head to head paired SUN trimers, in this way tying the trimers together. In the first scheme, however, there would be a single unoccupied KASH binding site within each trimer. This would require a KASH dimer to either span both SUN trimers (as in the second scheme) or one KASH peptide to remain unbound. Does the conformation therefore depend to a large extent on the SUN-KASH stochiometry in vivo, not to mention the activities of chaperones such as Torsin A? This should be discussed in the context of the fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy studies by the Luxton lab which directly addressed the issue of SUN protein oligomerization in vivo (Hennen et al., 2018).</p><p>4) Homogeneity versus heterogeneity in LINC complexes and SUN1 versus SUN2. Two of the reviewers felt that discussing the possibility for differences between SUN1 and SUN2 containing LINC complexes was important, particularly given that this is a major difference between this and prior structural studies. For example, it is likely that within their respective cell types (inner hair cells and spermatocytes), Nesprin 4 and KASH 5 are the predominant KASH proteins. Certainly in IHCs, SUN1 appears to be the only SUN protein. Thus LINC complexes in these cells would appear to be quite homogenous. This may not be the case for somatic cells. Do the authors envisage that different KASH proteins may pair up indiscriminately with available SUN proteins. This is not a trivial issue, since Gundersen and colleagues suggest that SUN1 may be bound preferentially by Nesprins associated with the microtubule system. SUN2 in contrast, appears to have a preference for actin-associated Nesprins (Zhu, Antoku and Gundersen, 2017). Moreover, there is additional evidence that the two SUN proteins are not redundant and may indeed be antagonistic (see Thakar et al., 2017, May and Carroll, 2018) – could this relate to the different types of assemblies? Is there any evidence, then, that SUN1 and SUN2 might have differing abilities to form 6:6 versus 3:3 LINC complexes and might this explain the differing specializations of these two proteins? Might SUN1 and SUN2 compete for the oligomeric state that LINC complexes are displaying? In other words, is it possible that SUN2 does not engage in these type of oligomers? While the authors do not assess SUN2 here, given the prior studies might it simply be a different story?</p><p>5) Discussion and interpretation of the SAXS data. the authors show that the SAXS data fits perfectly well with X-ray structure of SUN1-KASH4. In the case of SUN1-KASH5, modeling the N-termini greatly improved the fitting. Why does this modeling specifically impact the SAXS curve of SUN1-KASH5 and not SUN1-KASH1/5? If a rigid body modeling was performed instead for SUN1-KASH5, would it also be possible to fit the SAXS data? In the case of SUN1-KASH1, what is the impact of modeling the N-termini on the SAXS curve? Could the authors discuss about the fact that some mobility might exist on the relative positioning of SUN1 vs. KASH5 and SUN1 vs. KASH1, which could account for the difference between the SAXS and X-ray data?</p><p>6) The role of Zn. Is the presence of Zn atoms responsible for a more rigid interface in SUN1-KASH4? The zinc-mediated association of the Nesprin 4 6:6 complex is dependent upon the paired cysteines (C381 and C382) as well as H384. Has C381 also been suggested to form a disulphide with a cysteine in SUN1, comparable to that observed with KASH1 (from the Sosa paper)? By mutating the cysteines to serine, the Zn coordination is lost. Does this render the complex more similar to the &quot;looser&quot; structure observed with KASH1? Does treatment with EDTA/mutation of the relevant KASH4 cysteines disrupt the SUN1-KASH4 assembly?</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) Given that the most substantial criticism focused on the biological relevance of the 6:6 assembly in vivo, the reviewers wished to emphasize that the impact of the work would be greater if the authors provided some supportive data from cells focusing on how mutations that abrogate the identified interface necessary for 6:6 but not 3:3 assemblies affects LINC complex structures/function. Likewise, in vivo data to support the importance of Zn binding would strengthen the impact of this unexpected component. However, particularly given current constraints, the reviewers found that the compelling nature of the biochemical and biophysical studies was sufficient to warrant publication provided editing of the text according to the major points, above.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60175.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Two of the three reviewers found the manuscript overly dismissive of the prior trimer model rather than seeing the work as an extension of previous studies (and found the discussion of the work in this context lacking).

We find that SUN1 complexes are extremely stable and we have never observed species with reduced occupancy. Thus, we think it is extremely unlikely that each KASH dimer would bind to a SUN trimer, leaving two binding sites unoccupied. Instead, we strongly favour the model in which each KASH dimer spans both SUN trimers, in which all KASH molecules interact symmetrically. It is notable that this conundrum is solved only by the 6:6 stoichiometry as it would not be possible to form a 3:3 complex with full occupancy in vivo (other than with asymmetric binding in which half of KASH molecules are split between different complexes). We have added a discussion of this point in the section in which we describe how variation in oligomer state along the SUN-KASH axis can provide branching events – in this case, the dimer-trimer interface provides a branching event across the outer nuclear membrane (Discussion).</p><p>Given the stability of SUN1 complexes, our observations of only full-occupancy complexes and the nature of the structure, we think it is unlikely that the in vivo stoichiometry would affect the nature of SUN-KASH binding. Instead, we suggest that the limiting component would determine the amount of 6:6 complex formed, with the component in excess remaining unbound. An excess of SUN proteins would likely result in unbound molecules adopting their “autoinhibited” conformation in which trimerization and KASH-binding of the SUN domain is blocked. This may be important in establishing discrete pools of assembled and unassembled SUN molecules in which autoinhibited SUN molecules are unable to compete for KASH-binding which would weaken established LINC assemblies. We have integrated this point into our wider discussion of autoinhibition and alternative conformations (Discussion).</p><p>We agree that proteins chaperones (alongside enzymatic modification, protein interactions and chemical conditions) may play important roles in guiding LINC complex assembly (including overcoming autoinhibition in a timely manner). We have included a description of this and highlight some potential mechanisms in the Discussion.</p><p>The fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy studies are important in understanding the oligomeric assembly of the SUN’s luminal regions within the context of the nuclear envelope. It is important to point out that individual KASH domains and isolated SUN domains remained monomeric in these experiments, suggesting that the expressed proteins did not undergo SUN-KASH complex formation with endogenous proteins of the nuclear envelope. Thus, the oligomeric states observed do not determine the stoichiometry of SUN-KASH complexes but do describe the oligomeric assembly of the coiled-coils of SUN’s luminal region within the nuclear envelope. Indeed, the authors state that full-length SUN proteins were highly immobile, which is why they had to analyse luminal fragments that proved to be mobile and thereby suitable for FFS analysis. We would suggest that immobility may be a consequence of LINC network assembly upon KASH-binding. Nevertheless, the determined oligomeric states of the SUN luminal regions greatly add to our understanding – these were observed to be trimers, with additional higher order structures for SUN1. These findings are consistent with SUN-KASH complexes establishing head-to-head assembly of SUN trimers, with possible additional branching between SUN1 trimers. We have added a discussion of this to the manuscript (Introduction and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Homogeneity versus heterogeneity in LINC complexes and SUN1 versus SUN2.

While the authors do not assess SUN2 here, given the prior studies might it simply be a different story?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an important question, which we addressed by purifying and performing gel filtration and SEC-MALS analysis of SUN-KASH complexes formed between SUN2 and KASH1/4/5. We find that SUN2-KASH4 complexes are 6:6 hetero-oligomers of similar stability to SUN1 complexes. Our analysis of SUN2-KASH1/5 complexes was complicated by their substantially reduced stability in comparison with the highly stable SUN1 complexes, in which they readily dissociated during purification and SEC-MALS analysis. Nevertheless, SEC-MALS analysis revealed that their dissociating complex species had molecular weight ranges that include and exceed (by approximately double) the theoretical molecular weights of 6:6 complexes, and are far in excess of the theoretical molecular weights of 3:3 complexes. These findings suggest that SUN2-KASH1/5 are dissociating structures of 6:6 and larger hetero-oligomers. We improved the clarity of SUN2-KASH1 data by using SUN2 mutation C705A, which targets a non-structural cysteine residue to prevent it from forming disulphide bonds. This mutation blocked the higher-order assembly of SUN2-KASH1, and demonstrated a clear (but still dissociating) 6:6 hetero-oligomer. We further tested SUN2 mutation I579E, a direct copy of SUN1 mutation I673E, which targets the isoleucine residue that solely mediates interactions across the 6:6 interface in the SUN-KASH1 structures, and would be entirely solvent-exposed in a 3:3 complex. The SUN2 I579E mutation completely disrupted SUN2-KASH1 complex formation, in precisely the same way as SUN1 mutation disrupted SUN1-KASH1 complex formation. Thus, we can conclude that the SUN2-KASH1 is entirely dependent on the 6:6 interface for stability of the complex. Together, our data demonstrate that SUN2-KASH complexes are 6:6 hetero-oligomers (and larger structures) and that the 6:6 interface is essential for SUN2-KASH1 complex formation. Hence, our findings and conclusions regarding 6:6 assembly apply to LINC complexes formed of SUN1 and SUN2 proteins. We have included these data as new Figure 5 and inserted a discussion of these findings in the text (Results and Discussion).</p><p>Our findings that SUN2-KASH1/5 form higher-order structures and are substantially less stable that SUN1-KASH1/5 may explain some of the observed functional differences between SUN1 and SUN2. Specifically, reduced stability could favour a higher rate of turnover of a LINC complex assembly, whilst higher-order structures could establish different branched LINC complex architectures. We have included a discussion of these ideas, how they may explain some observed differences between SUN proteins, and wider means by which LINC complexes may form distinct structures to achieve specialised functions (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion and interpretation of the SAXS data. the authors show that the SAXS data fits perfectly well with X-ray structure of SUN1-KASH4. In the case of SUN1-KASH5, modeling the N-termini greatly improved the fitting. Why does this modeling specifically impact the SAXS curve of SUN1-KASH5 and not SUN1-KASH1/5? If a rigid body modeling was performed instead for SUN1-KASH5, would it also be possible to fit the SAXS data? In the case of SUN1-KASH1, what is the impact of modeling the N-termini on the SAXS curve? Could the authors discuss about the fact that some mobility might exist on the relative positioning of SUN1 vs. KASH5 and SUN1 vs. KASH1, which could account for the difference between the SAXS and X-ray data?</p></disp-quote><p>As SAXS is a relatively low-resolution technique, it is important to prevent over-fitting of data. In essence, given a sufficiently large number of parameters, it would be possible to fit data with any model, but this would poorly reflect the true structure. A prudent approach is to start with simplest explanation of the data (minimum number of parameters) and only increase the complexity and number of parameters if necessary and in increments (utilising Occam’s razor). In this case, we started with the crystal structure, then added unstructured residues that are missing from the structure but are definitely present in the sample, and only if this failed did we explore alternative conformations. SUN1-KASH4/5 could have been fitted with rigid body models, but this would have added unnecessary potential for artefactual results given that the data could be adequately explained by a much simpler model. In contrast, SUN1-KASH1 could not be explained by the simple model, demonstrating that large-scale structural alterations must have occurred. The reason for this can be seen in the data as the real-space plot shows that the maximum dimension of SUN1-KASH1 is slightly shorter than SUN1-KASH4/5 (Figure 6B). This shortening of the molecule could never be modelled by adding termini and can only be explained by its predicted angulation. Importantly, we think that all three complexes undergo hinge-like motion through their 6:6 interface (as demonstrated by normal mode analysis – Figure 7) and thereby exist in a range of angled conformations in solution. For SUN1-KASH1, there must be a large proportion of highly angled conformations that dominant the ensemble SAXS data. In contrast, the proportion and angulation of SUN1-KASH4/5 structures is likely lower, meaning that their ensemble SAXS data more closer resemble the linear conformation. We have edited our discussions of the SAXS data, normal modes analysis and interpretation of hinge-like motion to clarify these points (Results and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The role of Zn.

It is notable that SUN2-KASH4 was the only SUN2 complex that retained the high binding affinity of the SUN1 complex, which is explained as the 6:6 interface is mediated solely by KASH4 zinc sites, whereas KASH1/5 complexes involve SUN residues at the interface, where sequences differences between SUN1 and SUN2 could explain the substantially reduced affinity of SUN2-KASH1/5. We have added this point to the Discussion.</p><p>The zinc ligand C381 was proposed by Sosa et al. to form a disulphide with SUN1, but this was based on a KASH domain alignment and the assumption that KASH4 would adopt the same structure as KASH1 (in which a cysteine at this position does form a disulphide with SUN1). We now know that this assumption was incorrect as KASH4 has a different conformation to KASH1 so their cysteine residues are non-equivalent.</p><p>We have analysed the oligomeric state of SUN1-KASH4 upon removal of bound zinc by EDTA-treatment, and find that it retains 6:6 structure and also forms a new 12:12 species, with no loss of complex stability. The retention of 6:6 assembly is simply explained by the structure reverting to the KASH1-like mode 6:6 interface, as correctly predicted by the reviewer. We suggest that the 12:12 structures likely consist of two 6:6 assemblies (with KASH1-like interfaces), interacting through KASH4 sequences that were liberated from zinc-sites. These interactions could include disulphide bond formation by newly exposed cysteine residues. We have added these data to the manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and have included a description of how these conformational changes provide a potential regulatory mechanism upon change to zinc availability and sequestration within the nuclear envelope (Results and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) Given that the most substantial criticism focused on the biological relevance of the 6:6 assembly in vivo, the reviewers wished to emphasize that the impact of the work would be greater if the authors provided some supportive data from cells focusing on how mutations that abrogate the identified interface necessary for 6:6 but not 3:3 assemblies affects LINC complex structures/function.
