cyto-architecture of the cerebellar cortex, its overall physiological characteristics have traditionally been considered to be homogeneous. In this study, we show in awake mice at rest that spiking activity of Purkinje cells, the sole output cells of the cerebellar cortex, differs between cerebellar modules and correlates with their expression of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C or zebrin. Simple spike and complex spike frequencies were significantly higher in Purkinje cells located in zebrin-negative than zebrin-positive modules. The difference in simple spike frequency persisted when the synaptic input to, but not intrinsic activity of, Purkinje cells was manipulated. Blocking TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that have zebrin-like distribution patterns, attenuated the simple spike frequency difference. Our results indicate that zebrin-discriminated cerebellar modules operate at different frequencies, which depend on activation of TRPC3, and that this property is relevant for all cerebellar functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02536.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02536.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02536.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cerebellum, located at the back of the brain underneath the cerebral hemispheres, is best known for its role in the control of movement. Despite its small size, the cerebellum contains more than half of the brain's neurons. These are organized in a repeating pattern in which cells called Purkinje cells receive inputs from two types of fibers: climbing fibers, which ascend into the cerebellum from the brainstem; and parallel fibers, which run perpendicular to the climbing fibers. This gives rise to a characteristic ‘crystalline’ structure.</p><p>As a result of this uniform circuitry, it was widely believed was that all Purkinje cells throughout the cerebellum would function the same way. However, the presence of distinct patterns of gene expression in different regions suggests that this is not the case. Molecules called zebrins, for example, are found in some Purkinje cells but not others, and this gives rise to a pattern of zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative stripes. A number of other molecules have similar distributions, suggesting that these differences in molecular machinery could underlie differences in cellular physiology.</p><p>Zhou, Lin et al. have now provided one of the first direct demonstrations of such physiological differences by showing that zebrin-positive cells generate action potentials at lower frequencies than zebrin-negative cells. This pattern is seen throughout the cerebellum, and is evident even when the positive and negative cells are neighbors, which indicates that these differences do not simply reflect differences in the locations of the cells or differences in the inputs they receive from parallel fibers. Additional experiments revealed that the distinct firing rates are likely not generated by zebrin itself, but rather by proteins that are expressed alongside zebrin, most notably those that work through an ion channel called TRPC3.</p><p>By showing that cells arranged in the same type of circuit can nevertheless have distinct firing rates, the work of Zhou, Lin et al. has revealed an additional level of complexity in the physiology of the cerebellum. In addition to improving our understanding of how the brain controls movement, these findings might also be of interest to researchers studying the increasing number of neurological and psychiatric disorders in which cerebellar dysfunction has been implicated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02536.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02536.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>cerebellar modules</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cells</kwd><kwd>zebrin II</kwd><kwd>TRPC3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001828</institution-id><institution>Erasmus University Rotterdam Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoebeek</surname><given-names>Freek E</given-names></name><name><surname>Schonewille</surname><given-names>Martijn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Organization for Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Organization for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoebeek</surname><given-names>Freek E</given-names></name><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name><name><surname>Schonewille</surname><given-names>Martijn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Community</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Prinses Beatrix Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>China Scholarship Counsil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ju</surname><given-names>Chiheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zebrin-positive cerebellar Purkinje cells fire at lower frequencies than zebrin-negative cells, indicating that cerebellar circuits are not physiologically homogeneous.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Resolving structure–function relations remains one of the main challenges of modern neuroscience. The unique cyto-architecture of the cerebellum is characterized by the crystalline matrix of its sagittally oriented PC dendrites and climbing fibers and its orthogonally running parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Voogd, 2011</xref>). The ubiquitous nature of this relatively simple matrix throughout all lobules and modules of the cerebellar cortex made scientists predict in 1967 that this neuronal machine was probably the first to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eccles, 1967</xref>). Yet, about half a century later, we have collected a wealth of information about the molecular and physiological identity of the various cell types in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2012</xref>), but gross structure–function relations are still largely lacking. For example, the amount of evidence for physiological differences within the cerebellar cortex is limited and there is little comparative analysis of spiking activity throughout the cerebellar cortex in adult awake animals. In fact, even most slice physiology studies do not discriminate between lobules or modules, indicative of the fact that the cerebellum is still considered physiologically homogeneous.</p><p>At the same time, several molecular markers have been identified that can subdivide the cerebellar cortex into distinct bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>). The best-known of these molecules are the zebrins, which are highly expressed by specific bands of Purkinje cells (PCs), that is the sole output of the cerebellar cortex. Immunostainings for both zebrin I and II give rise to symmetric stripes that are oriented perpendicular to the cerebellar folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leclerc et al., 1990</xref>). The combined presence of zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs can be found in all vertebrate classes, and zebra-like patterns are present in the cerebellum of birds and mammals, varying from pigeons and mice up to monkeys and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sillitoe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marzban and Hawkes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham and Wylie, 2012</xref>). In most cases, adjacent PCs with zebrin II (from hereon referred to as zebrin) are located in the same bands, receive CF inputs from the same part of the inferior olive, and project their axons to the same part of the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pijpers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apps and Hawkes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugihara, 2011</xref>). Moreover, although their various terminal rosettes may be located in different parts of the cerebellar cortex, individual mossy fibers often also adhere to the same zebrin signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pijpers et al., 2006</xref>). As such zebrin may be regarded as a biomarker linking different cerebellar cortical zones, potentially binding activity of different olivo-cerebellar modules and mossy fiber systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voogd and Ruigrok, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pijpers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruigrok, 2011</xref>). However, what the basic characteristics of this zebrin-related activity might be is unknown. Since zebrin has been identified as the glycolytic enzyme aldolase C, its presence might in principle be linked to the level of metabolic and/or electrophysiological activity. Indeed, the distribution of zebrin in the cerebellum is similar to that of the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) and complementary to splice variant b of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dehnes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>). Intracellularly, several proteins in a molecular cascade linked to mGluR1 are also expressed in zebrin-like bands, including the IP3-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furutama et al., 2010</xref>), PLCβ3/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarna et al., 2006</xref>), PKCδ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barmack et al., 2000</xref>), and NCS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinno et al., 2003</xref>). This cascade controls the activity of the transient receptor potential cation channel type C3 (TRPC3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann et al., 2008</xref>), which in turn can influence the firing activity of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekerkova et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that differential activity of this cascade of proteins with zebrin-related expression might lead to differential activity of their effector channel, TRPC3, and thereby to differences in simple spike (SS) firing frequency between modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2012b</xref>).</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we investigated the activity of PCs in awake mice at rest in relation to the zebrin-identity of their module. We demonstrate that there are zebrin-related differences in firing frequency of both SSs and complex spikes (CSs), that these differences are intrinsically driven, and that they are consistently present throughout the cerebellar cortex contributing to all its functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simple spike firing activity differs between Purkinje cell populations</title><p>We performed extracellular recordings from PCs in the cerebellar cortex of awake, restrained C57Bl/6 mice at rest with the use of double-barrel electrodes marking the recording location with Alcian Blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Purkinje cells were identified by the presence of SSs and CSs and the consistent presence of a pause in SS firing after a CS (i.e., climbing fiber pause) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). Recordings that were used for analysis had to meet several criteria including a minimum duration of 120 s, stable spike amplitude over the whole recording period and no detectable tissue damage in a 400-µm radius (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following perfusion of the animals and processing of their cerebella, the zebrin-negative (Z−) and zebrin-positive (Z+) zones were identified by immunostaining. Of the 104 PCs included in the analysis (50 mice), 47 and 57 cells were located in Z− and Z+ zones, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, plot adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugihara and Quy, 2007</xref>). The SS firing frequency was significantly higher in Z− zones than in Z+ zones (Z−: 96.1 ± 15.4 Hz, Z+: 61.4 ± 19.3 Hz, <italic>t</italic> = 9.942, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Hence, one could argue that the difference between Z+ and Z− is related to location, rather than directly linked with zebrin identity. Re-plotting the results, but now color-coded for simple spike frequency to facilitate individual comparisons, seems to largely contradict this possibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To more thoroughly test our hypothesis that differences are indeed related to zebrin identity, we also attempted to record neighboring, online identified, Z+ and Z− PCs in a single experiment. To this end, we performed two-photon imaging in vivo in awake, head-fixed mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the EAAT4 promoter in a pattern similar to that of zebrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gincel et al., 2007</xref>). In the dorsal layer of lobule V, VI, and Crus I we identified Z+ and Z− bands and recorded PCs in adjacent zebrin bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In line with our hypothesis, we observed higher simple spike activity in Z− than in Z+ Purkinje cells (Z+: 36.0 ± 15.5 Hz, n = 8; Z−: 75.8 ± 19.5 Hz, n = 9; <italic>t</italic> = 4.618, p&lt;0.001) and concommitant longer climbing fiber pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast to the immunohistochemically subdivided PC dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), that covers the entire cerebellar cortex, this spatially restricted dataset did show a difference in simple spike regularity, suggesting that variations in regularity may occur more locally.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02536.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simple spike firing frequency correlates with the zebrin identity of Purkinje cells.</title><p>To determine of the differences in simple spike activity are related to the location of the Purkinje cells, or to their zebrin identity, we compared PC activity of Z+ against Z– Purkinje cells in various smaller areas of the cerebellar cortex.

Along the rostro-caudal axis the cerebellum can be subdivided into four transverse zones: the anterior, central, posterior, and nodular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ozol et al., 1999</xref>). We consistently observed a similar difference in simple spike activity between Z+ and Z− PCs in each zone, independent of the location within the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). This approach also revealed a difference within the population of Z+ PCs.

Therefore, one can expect the CS activity that results from activity in the climbing fibers originating in the inferior olive to be reduced as well. This prediction indeed holds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The CS activity of immunostaining identified Z+ PCs was significantly lower than that in Z− PCs (same PCs as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–J</xref>; Z−: 1.13 ± 0.25 Hz, Z+: 0.92 ± 0.28 Hz, <italic>t</italic> = 3.926, p&lt;0.001). This difference persisted in the subset of two-photon imaging identified Z+ and Z− PCs recorded in lobule V–VI and Crus I, supporting the link to zebrin-identity, rather than cortical location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the gradual trend that we observed for SS firing frequency, but not for CV2, in the different lobules in both the vermis and hemispheres was also observed for CS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since climbing fibers evoked prolonged EPSCs in Z+ Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paukert et al., 2010</xref>), we also investigated the half-width of the first upward deflection in potential and the integrated deviation of the CS potential from zero. Both parameters were significantly higher in immunostaining identified Z+ PCs (half-width: <italic>t</italic> = −3.269, p=0.001, spike area: <italic>t</italic> = −2.523, p=0.013) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Given that SS activity and the wave of CS activity correlated with zebrin, the distribution of post-CS configurations of SS activity might in principle also be affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Simpson et al., 1996</xref>). Based on the peri-CS time histograms, we could distinguish four different types of SS responses following the climbing fiber pause. These included a neutral pattern (i.e., normal type), a pattern with increased SS activity (i.e., facilitation type), and two patterns with decreased SS activity, one without and one with a superimposed oscillatory effect (i.e., suppression and oscillation type, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, if there is a relation with zebrin expression, one could predict that the facilitation type of cells prevail in the Z− zones, whereas the suppression and oscillation type of cells occur predominantly in the Z+ zones. This prediction did hold. Even though the normal type dominated in both Z− and Z+ PCs, the suppression and oscillation types only occurred in Z+ PCs. The facilitation type occurred in both Z− and Z+ PCs, but significantly more in the Z− areas (Z−: 17 /47, Z+: 6/57; <italic>χ</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 9.835, p=0.002, Pearson's Chi-squared test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

This raises the question as to what extent the difference in SS firing frequency between Z+ and Z− PCs results from differences in input or intrinsic activity. We used two approaches to tackle this question. First, we completely removed the impact of external inputs onto the PCs using blockers for AMPA, NMDA, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors during cell-attached recordings from sagittal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The average SS firing frequency was, on average, 22 ± 7% lower over all lobules in vitro than that in vivo indicating that the larger part of SS activity is internally driven by PCs. The dominant impact of intrinsic PC activity was also reflected by the finding that the differential firing frequency pattern over all lobules in vitro correlated with that in vivo (<italic>r</italic> = 0.916, p=0.010, Pearson's correlation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). For example, the in vitro SS firing frequency of PCs in lobules III, which are predominantly Z−, was alike the in vivo recordings significantly higher than that in lobule X, where PCs are Z+ (<italic>t</italic> = 2.844, p=0.007). This higher firing frequency in lobule III was associated with a higher intrinsic excitability in lobule III compared to lobule X, reinforcing the interpretation that the difference is predominantly intrinsic to Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2012a</xref>).

This may be particularly relevant as zebrin, or aldolase C, is a glycolytic enzyme and probably plays a secondary role via energy consumption without a direct impact on the electrophysiological properties of PCs. In fact, when the products of aldolase C, that is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), were introduced to the ACSF in our in vitro recordings, SS firing increased in both the largely zebrin-negative lobule III and zebrin-positive lobule X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), arguing against the possibility that aldolase C's enzymatic function directly contributes to a lower SS firing frequency in Z+ PCs. Hence, we shifted our focus to TRPC3, which can be associated with zebrin-negative PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012b</xref>), and underlies the mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and et al, 2008</xref>) and mGluR1-agonist (DHPG)-induced currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson and Glitsch, 2012</xref>), that have been shown to affect SS activity even in the absence of synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamakawa and Hirano, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coesmans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chanda and Xu-Friedman, 2011</xref>).

Based on the higher expression of EAAT4 in Z+ Purkinje cells, blocking EAAT4 would arguably affect lobule X more than lobule III, but the general EAAT blocker DL-TBOA had no significant effect on the activity of Purkinje cells in either lobule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) (lobule III: <italic>t</italic> = 1.219, p=0.227; lobule X: <italic>t</italic> = −0.597, p=0.533), maintaining the difference between lobule III and X (inset, <italic>t</italic> = 3.641, p&lt;0.001).

In line with the in vitro data, both genistein and Pyr3 (i.p. and i.c.v., 240 mg/kg and 200 µg, respectively) caused a decrease in SS activity in lobules I–III, lasting for several hours (vehicle: 90.6 ± 13.3 Hz; genistein: 74.6 ± 14.9 Hz; Pyr3: 61.6 ± 15.5 Hz; both p&lt;0.001 vs vehicle, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test), while no significant effect was recorded in lobule X (vehicle: 52.9 ± 13.3 Hz; genistein: 57.5 ± 20.8 Hz,; Pyr3: 51.1 ± 14.3 Hz, p=0.546 and p=0.887 vs vehicle, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>).

These included including climbing fiber pause, complex spike frequency and width and type of simple spike response following complex spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Together, these data suggest that TRPC3 contributes to the elevated SS activity in zebrin-negative PC zones.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence for ubiquitously organized differences in cerebellar Purkinje cell firing activity in vivo and for the correlation of these differences to a marker protein, zebrin II. As zebrin, as a biomarker, can be associated with the modular organization of the olivo-cortico-nuclear circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brochu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voogd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pijpers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2007</xref>), our results indicate that Purkinje cells within the same module operate around a preferred range of intrinsically determined SS firing frequencies and that this activity is different from modules with a different zebrin identity. Moreover, presumably as a secondary effect, CS activity is also altered. Since the differences were consistently found throughout the entire cerebellar cortex, these findings have direct consequences for all cerebellar functions and the coding schemes they can engage.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Difference in SS activity and underlying factors</title><p>The difference in SS firing frequency between zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs in vivo was robust (i.e., approximately 60 Hz vs 90 Hz) and highly significant, present throughout the cerebellar cortex and could be reproduced by directly comparing the activity of Purkinje cells in adjacent modules. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that lobule-specific effects contribute to the observed differences in simple and complex spike firing frequency, the results obtained in EAAT4-eGFP mice in vivo and in vitro argue against a contribution of their rostro-caudal or lobular location. The difference in SS firing frequency is probably largely determined by the intrinsic properties of PCs, as this difference was maintained in the reduced slice preparation, in which the inputs are blocked, as well as in mouse mutants, in which the excitatory (<italic>a6-Cacna1a</italic> mice) or inhibitory (<italic>PC-Δγ2</italic> mice) inputs are attenuated. Comparing the PC activity in zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs per transverse zone confirmed its link to zebrin-identity, but also revealed a more subtle difference within the population of zebrin-positive PCs. These differences could be lobule-specific and/or originate from differences in input, in more subtle variations in zebrin or its related proteins or even in the expression pattern of other proteins. It should be noted, however, that blocking TRPC3 shifts the activity of Z− PCs towards that of Z+ PCs, indicating that the potential differences within the group of Z+ PCs do not affect our conclusions.</p><p>In contrast, the level of regularity of firing (i.e., CV2) was not consistently dependent on zebrin identity, but significantly altered by impairing the excitatory and/or inhibitory inputs. In line with the notion that reduced SS activity of PCs, as observed in the zebrin-positive modules, should lead to enhanced firing of the GABAergic neurons in the cerebellar nuclei and thereby to reduced activity in the inferior olivary neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>), we found that CS activity induced by activity of olivary climbing fibers was reduced in zebrin-positive PCs. In fact, reduction of simple spike frequency in lobule III in vivo for several minutes to hours by Pyr3 application also reduced complex spike frequency, supporting the indirect control of simple spikes on complex spike activity. Interestingly, temporary increases in climbing fiber-evoked CS activity suppress SS frequency providing a homeostatic control mechanism within an olivocerebellar module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mathews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coddington et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, whereas the external inputs to PCs may control the precise temporal coding of SS activity at rest as well as the firing frequency and dynamic range during natural sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>), their intrinsic properties appear to determine the baseline frequencies of SSs as well as CSs at rest, around which they can operate.</p><p>These findings raise the question which proteins in the zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative zones may actually determine the difference in intrinsic firing frequencies of their PCs. Since zebrin's enzymatic reaction products did not underlay the differences in SS firing frequency, we shifted our attention to other proteins that are expressed in pattern similar or complementary to that of zebrin. We targeted EAAT4 that is expressed in a pattern similar to that of zebrin, and TRPC3, the effector channel of a cascade of proteins that has zebrin-like expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dehnes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>). Although blocking EAAT4 in vitro had no detectable effect on SS firing frequency, blocking TRPC3 reduced SS activity in lobule III (largely zebrin-negative), but not in lobule X (zebrin-positive), both in vitro and in vivo. It should be noted that, although TRPC3 gene expression appears to vary from anterior to posterior with higher levels in the anterior, largely zebrin-negative, lobules (Allen Brain Atlas, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org">www.brain-map.org</ext-link>), there is no immunohistochemical evidence for differences in protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sekerkova et al., 2013</xref>). If the expression of TRPC3 is indeed homogeneous throughout the cerebellum, the differential effect of blocking TRPC3 suggests that its activity might be higher in Z− PCs. Two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms could contribute to this difference in activity. First, several proteins in the molecular cascade related to TRPC3 are expressed in zebrin-like bands, including the IP3-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Furutama et al., 2010</xref>) (TRPC3 modulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012b</xref>]), PLCβ3/4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarna et al., 2006</xref>] (TRPC3 activator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012b</xref>]), PKCδ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barmack et al., 2000</xref>], and NCS-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jinno et al., 2003</xref>]. In fact, zebrin II or aldolase C, which is not likely to be involved via its enzymatic function, bears the capacity to bind IP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron et al., 1999</xref>), and thus could potentially reduce the activation of TRPC3 in Z+ PCs, through the IP3-receptor. At the same time, mGluR1 subtype b is expressed in a pattern complementary to that of zebrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>), and it has been shown that mGluR1 can be tonically activated, that mGlurR1 blockers can reduce SS firing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamakawa and Hirano, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coesmans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chanda and Xu-Friedman, 2011</xref>), and that mGluR1-evoked depolarizing currents can be blocked with TRPC3-selective blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiyonaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012b</xref>). However, the possibility that an alternative pathway, independent of mGluR1, leads to TRPC3 activition cannot be excluded. Knowledge of this pathway of proteins and their exact interactions is at current presumably incomplete and beyond the scope of this study. The findings that the expression patterns of mGluR1b, PLCβ, PKCδ, and IP3R1, all of which are key proteins in calcium release from intracellular calcium stores, are linked to cerebellar modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mateos et al., 2001</xref>) and intimately connected with TRPC3, provokes the speculation that this entire pathway contributes to the difference in SS activity between zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hartmann and et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>General functional implications</title><p>Our finding that SS activity and indirectly also CS activity at rest are determined by the intrinsic properties of PCs implies that they operate around these baseline frequencies during natural stimulation and behaviour. Interestingly, the low and high baseline frequencies of zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative PCs also appear to be in line with their propensities for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wadiche and Jahr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, PCs operating at lower frequencies may be preferentially potentiated, whereas PCs with higher SS firing frequency may have less ‘space’ for increasing the firing rate and may be more prone to express LTD. Likewise, entrainment of cerebellar nuclei neurons by synchronized SS input from PCs, which results in phase-locking of connected neurons, may occur at 50–80 Hz, but is impaired at 100 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>). If correct, this mechanism predicts that the phase-locking mechanism is engaged in contacts between zebrin-positive PCs and cerebellar nuclei neurons, whereas those involved in zebrin-negative zones may be more prone for rebound excitation, which follows strong forms of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Person and Raman, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The cerebellar nuclei can also be divided based on the zebrin expression pattern, with a rostral half that receives, predominantly, input from zebrin-negative PC's and a caudal part that mostly receives zebrin-positive inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sugihara and Shinoda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sugihara, 2011</xref>). This implies that PC input to cerebellar nuclei neurons may be segregated on the basis of frequency, and that as a consequence the output of cerebellar nuclei neurons located within zebrin-positive and zebrin-negative territories may be distinctly different. Although this remains speculative at this stage, similar phenomena have been described for highly active neurons in cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yassin et al., 2010</xref>) and hyperpolarization-activated currents in affiliated olfactory bulb mitral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelo et al., 2012</xref>).

In short, the skin over the skull was shaven, and opened along the rostro-caudal midline. Using Optibond (Kerr, Salerno, Italy) and Charisma (Heraeus Kulzer, Hesse, Germany), a U-shaped holder (6 × 4 mm) with a magnet inside (4 × 4 mm, MTG, Weilbach, Germany) was fixed on the skull, overlying the frontal and parietal bones. Next, the medial neck muscles overlying the occipital bone were removed, a craniotomy was made over the interparietal or occipital bone and a recording chamber was placed around it, allowing in vivo electrophysiological recordings throughout different areas in the cerebellum of awake mice. The exact location of the craniotomy depended on the target area, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for details.

Electrophysiological activity in the cerebellar cortex was recorded using double barrel borosilicate glass pipettes (theta septum, 1.5 OD, 1.02 ID, WPI, FL, USA). To do so, one of the barrels was opened laterally, approximately 10 mm from the taper, to allow entrance of the electrode wire and sealed with glass glue at the back. The other barrel was filled with a blue dye (Alcian Blue, 0.1–0.2% solution in saline; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The recording half of the double barrel pipettes were filled with 2 M NaCl-solution, and had a tip size of 3–6 μm, respectively. Pipettes were advanced into the cerebellum with an oil micro-drive (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and signals were pre-amplified (custom-made preamplifier, 1000x DC), filtered (CyberAmp 320, Axon, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), digitized (Power1401, CED, Cambridge, UK), and stored for offline analysis. After successful recordings, brief pressure pulses were delivered through the other barrel of the electrode, using a custom-built device, to mark the recording site. To obtain <italic>a6-Cacna1a</italic> and <italic>PC-Δγ2</italic> mice, we used the Cre/loxP system to delete exon 4 of the gene coding for the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (<italic>Cacna1a</italic>) selectively from granule cells and exon 4 of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ2 subunit gene (<italic>Gabrg2</italic>) selectively from PCs, respectively, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wulff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>).

Both lines were maintained in a C57Bl6 background. In the experiments with mutant mice and blocker injections, double and single barrel (2.0 mm OD, 1.16 mm ID, Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) borosilicate glass pipettes were used, and alcian blue was injected to confirm that the recordings were from lobules I–III or X.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>In vivo two-photon imaging of EAAT4-eGFP mice</title><p>EAAT4-eGFP mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under control of the EAAT4 promoter, and were generated using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gincel et al., 2007</xref>). Targeted recordings of eGFP-positive and eGFP-negative Purkinje cells were made after visualizing the eGFP-positive bands using in vivo two-photon imaging of 5 awake EAAT4-eGFP mice (3 females, 2 males, 10–26 weeks old). Images were acquired using a TriM Scope II (LaVision BioTec, Bielefeld, Germany) attached to an upright microscope with a 40x/0.8 NA water-immersion objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Laser illumination was provided by a Chameleon Ultra titanium sapphire laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). We aimed to image Purkinje cells in the superficial layer of a restricted part of the cortex (lobules V-VI and Crus I) at a depth of ∼250 µm using an excitation wavelength of 920 nm, and their location in relation to zebrin bands was determined online. The recording pipette was filled with Alexa-594 (10 µM in 2 M NaCl; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized with an excitation wavelength of 800 nm, the minimum recording duration was 30 s. Images from eGFP and Alexa-594 were filtered using a Gaussian kernel, contrast-optimized and subsequently merged in Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA).

To assure the quality and reliability of the recording the following criteria were imposed: (1) a minimum recording duration of 120 s, (2) stable simple spike amplitude, (3) no clear signs of tissue damage in a circle with 400 µm radius, around the recording site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). All in vivo data were analyzed using SpikeTrain (Neurasmus BV, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neurasmus.com">www.neurasmus.com</ext-link>), running under Matlab (Mathworks, MA, USA). SpikeTrain uses wave clustering to identify simple and complex spikes, and in case of doubt manual checking (and correcting) would be performed. For each cell the firing rate, CV and mean CV2 were determined for simple and complex spikes, as well as the climbing fiber pause. CV is the standard deviation of inter-spike intervals (ISI) divided by the mean, the mean CV2 is calculated as the mean of 2·|(ISI)<sub>n+1</sub>−ISI<sub>n</sub>|/(ISI<sub>n+1</sub> + ISI<sub>n</sub>). Both are measures for the regularity of the firing, with CV reflecting that of the entire recording and mean CV2 that of adjacent intervals, making the latter a measure of regularity on small timescales. The climbing fiber pause is determined as the minimum duration between a complex spike and the following simple spike. To extend this analysis, we also plotted histograms of simple spike activity time locked on the complex spike, and labelled the shape of this time histogram as normal, facilitation, suppression, and oscillation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for examples). The spike characteristics half maximum width (HMW) and spike area were determined from the normalized average signal of simple and complex spikes of individual recordings. Half-width was calculated as the width of the first peak at half of its maximum amplitude. The spike area was defined as the integral of the rectified complex spike wave form in a time window of 0.5 ms pre and 3 ms post spike onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vitro cell-attached and whole-cell patch recordings</title><p>Acute sagittal slices (250 μm thick) were prepared from the cerebellar vermis of 3–5 month old male C57BL/6J mice (Charles River) in ice-cold slicing medium that contains the following (in mM): 240 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 D-glucose, bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Slices were typically used within 5 hr ex vivo. NBQX (10 μM), DL-AP5 (50 μM), and picrotoxin (100 μM) were bath-applied to block AMPA-, NMDA-, and GABA subtype A (GABA<sub>A</sub>)-receptors, respectively. Borosilicate glass pipettes (WPI) were filled with ACSF and had an open pipette resistance of 2–4 MΩ. Purkinje cells were identified using visual guidance by DIC video microscopy and water-immersion 40X objective (Axioskop 2 FS plus; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Slices were transferred to the recording chamber and incubated for at least 10 min before starting the recordings. We recorded the Purkinje cell activity in cell-attached mode (0 pA injection) at 33.0 ± 1.0°C, with a distance of 0.5 cm between temperature probe and slice. Current clamp recordings were performed with the same setting as cell-attached recording, except that pipettes were filled with intracellular solution contains the following (in mM): 120 K-Gluconate, 9 KCl, 10 KOH, 3.48 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 17.5 sucrose, pH 7.25 and Osm 295.</p><p>For experiments in EAAT4-eGFP mice, all experimental conditions were the same as cell-attached experiments above, except that coronal slices (300 μm thick) were used to record from identified EAAT4-positive and EAAT4-negative Purkinje cells within the same lobules. We first identified the lobules by their locations and band patterns with a 10X objective, and then zoomed in with a 40X objective to proceed to recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological data were acquired using an EPC9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 25 kHz. Acquisition was controlled using PULSE software (HEKA) and the data were exported and analyzed using Minianalysis (v6.0.3) software (Synaptosoft, Fort Lee, NJ, USA) or Matlab. The typical signal-to-noise ratio was larger than 5:1, and minimum recording duration was 120 s, unless stated otherwise. Cells were included based on the following criteria: (1) the CV over the whole period of recording was &lt;0.2; (2) the average frequency changed less than 20% between the first and the last (30 s), except for those in the wash-in experiment. To minimize the day-to-day and slice-to-slice variations, recordings were targeted at different lobules for every slice. For the Pyr3 wash-in experiment, firing frequencies were normalized to the average frequency over the 2-min period before adding the drug to the ACSF (pre). The wash-in effect was determined by calculating the firing frequency in the period of 5–7 min after the drug was in the recording chamber (post).</p><p>In the whole-cell patch recording, the membrane potential of Purkinje was held at −65 mV using current injection to avoid spontaneous spiking activity (average: −454 ± 38 pA). We recorded the intrinsic excitability by injecting depolarizing currents ranging from 100 to 1000 pA (100 pA steps) relative to the holding current. Data were exported and analysed using threshold search with Clampfit (v10.4, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Drugs</title><p>DL-TBOA (EAAT blocker, Tocris, Ellisville, MO, USA), genistein (TRPC3 blocker, Sigma–Aldrich), and Pyr3 (TRPC3 blocker, Tocris) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and ACSF. For in vivo recordings, mice were injected with 240 mg/kg genistein (i.p.) and 200 µg Pyr3 (i.c.v) dissolved in saline or DMSO. Vehicle control mice were injected with 100 µl DMSO (i.p.). After injection, extracellular Purkinje cell activity was recorded as described above, and alcian blue was injected to verify that the recordings were from lobules I-III or X. The minimum recording duration was 60 s and recordings were made for up to 4 hr after injection for these experiments. For in vitro experiments all blockers were prepared in 1:1000 stock solutions in DMSO, stored at −20°C and used within 4 weeks after preparation. Blockers were bath applied where indicated in the following concentrations: DL-TBOA (25 μM), genistein (10 μM), and Pyr3 (100 μM). Except for the wash-in experiments, all recordings started after the slice was incubated in the drug-containing ASCF for at least 15 min. In the cases where we observed an effect in the wash-in experiments, the firing frequency of Purkinje cells typically dropped the moment the drug reached the bath, an effect maximizing within a few minutes and sometimes followed by a smaller recovery. The experimenter was blind to the presence and type of drug applied until analysis was completed. The tubing was changed after every blocker experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histochemistry</title><p>After recordings, mice were deeply anesthetized with Nembutal and perfused with 75 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were removed from the skull and post-fixed for 1–2 hr in 4% PFA, and stored in 0.1M PB containing 10% sucrose. After embedding in 10% gelatin and 10% sucrose, blocks were hardened in a solution containing 10% formaldehyde, 30% sucrose for 1–2 hr at room temperature and then stored overnight in 0.1M PB with 30% sucrose at 4°C. To identify if recordings were made in a Z+ or Z− band, coronal sections with a thickness of 40 µm were processed based on a standard immunostaining procedure; next, they were thoroughly rinsed with 0.1MPB. The goat-derived zebrin II antibody (Santa cruz, TX, USA) was diluted at 1:1000 in PBS, pH 7.6, containing 2% normal horse serum and 0.4% Triton. Rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody HRP conjugate diluted at 1:200 was used as a secondary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The sections were thoroughly rinsed three times with PBS and PB, followed by diaminobenzidine (DAB) incubation (0.66% DAB, and 0.033% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 10–20 min). The sections were put on glass and then dehydrated by different grades of ethanol (70%, 80%, 90%, 96%, 96%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 2 min per grade), xylene was applied to clean the ethanol, and subsequently the sections were covered with Permount. To only determine the recording sites for recordings throughout the cerebellum, sagittal sections were cut at 80 µm followed by neutral red staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of immunohistochemistry</title><p>The injection sites were located by the light microscope. If the same injection could be found in several slices, the injection was allocated to the slice with the highest density of Alcian Blue. If the injection site was at the border of two cerebellar lobules, the cell was allocated to the most rostral lobule. Particularly in the hemipsheres, a distinction between positive and lightly positive areas can be made. In this study, they were taken together as positive, and compared to the—clearly identifiable—negative bands. Recordings were excluded from further analysis if there was clear tissue damage within a circle with a radius of 400 µm around the injection site. The recording sites of 7 out 8 cells in the flocculus (FL) were confirmed by the response to visual stimulation instead of histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>). Example sections and sections used to determine the staining intensity of zebrin II were photographed using a Leica DMRB microscope equipped with Leica DC300 camera. To compare zebrin intensity between lobules the average pixel intensity of the PC somas in each lobule was determined using ImageJ software, based on the average of a total of 3 sections for vermis and 2 sections for the hemisphere per mouse, from 3 mice. Sections compared in the same panel, were processed in parallel. To correct for minor differences in overall staining intensity between vermis and hemispheres, soma intensities were normalized based on background (granule cell layer) intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>All values are shown as mean ± SD, unless stated otherwise.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an important study presenting a systematic examination of the physiological properties of Purkinje cells from different cerebellar areas that are referred to as zonal compartments. Cerebellar compartments are fundamental units of circuit organization and they have been studied from many approaches ranging from developmental biology and genetics to imaging and behavior. The powerful in vivo electrophysiology conducted here is superb and this work can be a highly significant contribution to the field.</p><p>A wealth of data is presented showing that many properties, including simple spike firing rate, intrinsic excitability, complex spike rate and width, and simple spikes around complex spikes, vary by cerebellar module. One of these properties, simple spike firing rate, can be reduced in some (anterior) modules by blocking TRPC3 channels. The mapping of physiological heterogeneity of the oft-assumed homogenous Purkinje cell population onto different cerebellar regions, and the proposed role for TRPC3 in this difference is potentially quite interesting. However, as written, it could appear that the paper focuses on the stronger conclusion that the differences across regions are determined by zebrin banding. Here the arguments are weaker for two major reasons. 1) The zebrin&gt;mGluR1b&gt;TRPC3 assumption is indirect. 2) The evidence that zebrin identity is the key predictor of Purkinje cell physiology is not convincing and premature. This is especially confusing because the authors eliminate zebrinII itself as the determinant. Please change the presentation to avoid this problem. Below, the reviewers have provided specific suggestions to address these issues.</p><p>The reviewers' specific comments follow:</p><p>1) The links between zebrin&gt;mGluR1b&gt;TRPC3 are indirect.</p><p>The authors acknowledge this, but still use the TRPC3 data as an argument for their zebrin hypothesis. In the Results section the authors discuss the striped expression of several proteins, and included here are references that lead the reader to information supposedly regarding the striped expression of TRPC3. Unless I am missing something, these references do not discuss anything about TRPC3 stripe expression. In fact, throughout the manuscript the authors are a little vague as to what TRPC3 expression looks like. Are there any actually data for this? Please clarify these issues and provide a better set of references, or revise the statement please. As a suggestion, the authors may want to look at the Allen Brain Atlas for the gene expression of TRPC3 in the adult. To me, on the midline sagittal sections it looks like TRPC3 expression is weak in Purkinje cells of lobules VI/VII and X, which are predominately Z+ lobules. This could be helpful to the authors' argument. However, the problem remains that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (as all figures except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is based on lobule, not actual zebrin identity.</p><p>Too much emphasis is placed on mGluR1b given that no experiments address it.</p><p>Have the authors looked at what happens to Purkinje cell firing activity when mGluR itself is blocked? I realize that TRPC3 is an attractive target for several different reasons, but much of the argument for looking at this molecule was in fact its link to mGluR1b.</p><p>2) The evidence that zebrin identity is the key predictor of Purkinje cell physiology is not convincing as it is currently presented.</p><p>- Importantly, everything rests on the analysis in Figure 1–figure supplement 3B, C, E. Without these panels, all of the results in the paper could be due to regional differences that are independent of zebrin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 2-5</xref> all use cerebellar lobule as a proxy for zebrin status (based on average zebrin staining).</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> only exists to illustrate experiments not presented in a figure. The text description indicates simultaneous recordings from Z+/- pairs, but Z+ n=3 and Z- n=2...?</p><p>- The analyses presented in Figure 1–figure supplement 3 are incomplete.</p><p>- Figure 1–figure supplement 3B is a non-quantitative “random comparison” that is not useful.</p><p>- In general, Figure 1–figure supplement 3 and the accompanying text in the Results section ,the authors focus on demonstrating that Z+/Z- differences exist in all regions, but they do not show us that there are not also differences based on lobule, independent of zebrin identity. In fact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 3E appears to show differences in SS rate in Z+ neurons across zones. If there are indeed differences between Purkinje cells in different lobules with the same zebrin identity, how can we conclude that all further observations based solely on lobule (in other words, the entire rest of the paper) depend on zebrin identity, as claimed?</p><p>The reviewers' suggestion was as follows:</p><p>The simplest way to de-emphasize the (weak according to the data presented) argument that the data have successfully dissociated zebrin identity from physical location would be to re-order the Figures, moving <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2-4</xref>. In addition, conclusions on this point should be toned down. Further, for the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5">figures 2-5</xref>, wording like “Z+ or Z- PCs” should be replaced with “PCs in zebrin +/- lobules”. Instead of referring to features that “depend on the zebrin identity”, it would be better to say “correlates with zebrin intensity of the lobule,” or similar. This is necessary if figures are re-ordered, and is a much more accurate interpretation of the data. The TRPC3 data should be the last figure, more to generate a hypothesis of mechanism, with less emphasis on the lobule&gt;zebrin&gt;mGluR1b&gt;TRPC3 arguments that both reviewers found problematic.</p><p>It would also be nice to discuss possible differences in Z+ PCs across modules - because they look different in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 3E, yet there is no direct comparison. What about if something besides zebrin identity were at play here (see comments below)?</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1) Even if zebrin=TRPC3, we would want to know whether blocking TRPC3 affected more than just simple spike rate. Does intrinsic excitability, complex spike rate and width, and simple spikes around complex spikes depend on TRPC3? To what extent are they linked to changes in SS rate? Some of these experiments have already been done and could be analyzed to strengthen the claim that the many physiological features that vary with region share the same cellular basis. And some slice experiments could easily be done in EEAT2-GFP mice (though this too is indirect), to reduce the dependence on lobule as a proxy for zebrin.</p><p>2) In the Introduction, the authors refer to the markers as genetic markers. This is a minor point but what the authors actually mean in this context is “molecular markers”. Along the same lines, in the very next sentence it is more appropriate to refer to the zebrins as “the best known of these molecules”. Indeed zebrinII mRNA expression has been studied a while back by Karl Herrup and Richard Hawkes, but this is not what the authors are referring to here.</p><p>3) The Results section has some wording issues under the heading “Complex spike characteristics depend on the zebrin identity”. I am not entirely sure what the authors mean here. Please rephrase.</p><p>4) Similarly, the first paragraph under the heading “Complex spike characteristics depend on the zebrin identity” is unclear. What are you actually comparing? I think I understand, but this can be reworded for clarity.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–figure supplement 3, the legend needs some alterations. The authors state that “In addition to classification based on lobules, cerebellar Purkinje cells can be subdivided based on the input they receive into four transverse zones'. They cite Marzban and Hawkes, 2011. A better Hawkes reference for this should be chosen. I suggest the authors cite Ozol et al., 1999 J Comp Neurol. Second, Purkinje cells are subdivided based on 1) their developmental lineage, 2) gene and protein expression patterns, 3) sensitivity to mutations in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis, AND 4) on the inputs they receive. And, in any case what classifies Purkinje cells based on lobules?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02536.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have now included more experimental data to confirm the link between zebrin-identity and simple spike firing frequency.</p><p><italic>1) The links between zebrin&gt;mGluR1b&gt;TRPC3 are indirect</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors acknowledge this, but still use the TRPC3 data as an argument for their zebrin hypothesis.

This could be helpful to the authors' argument</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting, and admittedly, more difficult point. Even though the link between zebrin (as a biomarker) and mGluR1b is strong, in that the distribution of mGluR1b is complementary to that of zebrin (see Mateos et al., 2001), we agree with the reviewers that the connection from mGluR1b to TRPC3 in term of expression is less clear, and other proteins could very well be involved here. In this manuscript we provide evidence supporting a significant contribution of TRPC3 to the difference in simple spike frequency, but there is no evidence, as far as we know, that the expression of TRPC3 is complementary to that of zebrin. We agree that the link between zebrin and TRPC3 is therefore indirect, and want to make clear that we believe that the evidence for the zebrin hypothesis comes from the experimental data, linking PC activity to zebrin identity (including newly added results). We have toned down the text in the Introduction and Discussion sections regarding the link, and clarify that there is no evidence for a pattern in the expression pattern of TRPC3 other than that in the Allen Brain Atlas.</p><p>We had indeed noticed the apparent inhomogeneous pattern of TRPC3 expression in the Allen Brain Atlas and we now refer to it in the Discussion. In fact, we tried staining for TRPC3 ourselves, but could not get a conclusive answer to the question whether or not TRPC3 is expressed in bands or not, probably due to poor antibody quality. We have discussed this issue with colleagues from other labs, and they confirmed that the TRPC3 antibody quality is suboptimal. In the end, we were not confident in the results. But, even though we fully agree with the reviewers that it is an interesting question, we do not believe this to be absolutely essential for the current study. If TRPC3 is not expressed in bands, the differential effect of blocking TRPC3 suggests that there are differences in the expression and/or activity of other proteins that are directly linked to TRPC3 or its pathway. This has been shown for several proteins in this cascade, including e.g. IP3R1, PLCbeta3/4, PKCdelta and mGluR1b. This point is now also addressed in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>However, the problem remains that</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>(as all figures except</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>) is based on lobule, not actual zebrin identity</italic>.</p><p>We now provide additional evidence obtained in vivo <italic>and in vitro</italic> using EAAT4-eGFP mice, that links the difference in firing activity to zebrin rather than lobular location (see answer to point 2). We believe this also strengthens our choice for lobule III as proxy for Z− and lobule X for Z+ Purkinje cells. We would like to point out that not only all data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, but also the data regarding complex spikes in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are largely from PCs of which we determined their zebrin identity via staining or two-photon imaging (i.e. new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> all panels, except C). This is now indicated more clearly in the Results section, in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and in the legend.</p><p><italic>Too much emphasis is placed on mGluR1b given that no experiments address it</italic>.</p><p><italic>Have the authors looked at what happens to Purkinje cell firing activity when mGluR itself is blocked?

However, we have previously shown that blocking mGluR1 attenuates Purkinje cell simple spike firing frequency in vitro (Coesmans et al., 2003, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), which fits with the described mechanism.</p><p>Even so, we agree with the reviewers that the link between mGluR1b and TRPC3 is indirect, and therefore (and also in response to comments above) we have shifted the focus from mGluR1b to the cascade of proteins, of which mGluR1b is one element, but that also includes IP3R, PKCdelta, etc. he suggestion to block mGluR1 has been considered, but since there are no specific blockers for mGluR1b and because TRPC3 is the channel carrying mGluR1-activation induced current, we focused on TRPC3. To address this comment of the reviewers, we now consistently throughout the text refer to the cascade of proteins related to TRPC3, and restrict the discussion of the possible role of mGluR1b, and the other elements in the cascade, to the discussion.</p><p><italic>2) The evidence that zebrin identity is the key predictor of Purkinje cell physiology is not convincing as it is currently presented</italic>.</p><p><italic>- Importantly, everything rests on the analysis in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>–figure supplement 3B, C, E.

We did so using the EAAT4-eGFP mice, making use of the similar expression patterns of EAAT4 and zebrin. We recorded the activity of EAAT4-eGFP positive and negative Purkinje cells in restricted parts of the cerebellum, either in vivo using two-photon imaging or in vitro using a fluorescence microscope. In vivo we recorded 17 cells (Z+: n=8; Z−: n=9) in lobules V-VI and Crus I, and confirmed the difference between Z+ and Z− PCs (Z+, 36.0 ± 15.5; Z−, 75.8 ± 19.5, <italic>t</italic> = 4.618, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, we performed recordings in slices of EAAT4-eGFP mice in two areas that we were not able to reach by two-photon imaging. We obtained recordings from 11 cells (7 vs. 4) in lobules II-V and 11 cells (6 vs. 5) in lobules VIII-IX, that again confirm the difference (II-V: Z+, 30.9± 3.4; Z−, 67.5 ± 34.4, <italic>t</italic> = 2.910, <italic>p</italic>= 0.017; VIII-IX: Z+, 35.4 ± 9.2; Z-, 55.1 ± 18.0, <italic>t</italic> = 2.352, <italic>p</italic> = 0.043). These results are now described in a separate Results paragraph and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref> (in vivo), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (in vivo) and added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, as panel C (in vitro). Together the in vivo and in vitro results cover nearly the entire vermal cortex. The fact that the differences in simple spike frequency between Z+ and Z− PCs persist in each comparison in these new experiments, as well as in the previously presented comparisons per transverse zone (with new two-photon data added, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we believe, argues strongly against their dependence on lobular location, and instead indicates that they correlate with the zebrin identity of the PC.</p><p><italic>-</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref> <italic>only exists to illustrate experiments not presented in a figure. The text description indicates simultaneous</italic> <italic>recordings from Z+/- pairs, but Z+ n=3 and Z- n=2...?</italic></p><p>We agree that the original sample was very small. We have performed additional experiments and confirm our earlier findings, now with n=8 for Z+ and n= 9 for Z− in vivo and 2 additional datasets recorded in vitro. To address the question of whether the differences in PC activity are related to lobules or zebrin, we introduce a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with results obtained using the EAAT4-eGFP mice including the example from the former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, and analyses of Z+ vs. Z− PC activity per transverse zone. Each of these panels indicates that the difference is related to zebrin identity, rather than which lobule the PCs is in.</p><p><italic>- The analyses presented in Figure 1–figure supplement 3 are incomplete</italic>.</p><p><italic>- Figure 1–figure supplement 3B is a non-quantitative “random comparison” that is not useful</italic>.</p><p>To give a complete, un-biased overview, we have replaced the random comparisons with the same plot of the unfolded cerebellum, but now with a color coded dot for each recorded and identified PC (new Figure 2–figure supplement 1).</p><p><italic>- In general, Figure 1–figure supplement 3 and the accompanying text in the Results section, the authors focus on demonstrating that Z+/Z- differences exist in all regions, but they do not show us that there are not also differences based on lobule, independent of zebrin identity. In fact, Figure 1-figure supplement 3E appears to show differences in SS rate in Z+ neurons across zones. If there are indeed differences between Purkinje cells in different lobules with the same zebrin identity, how can we conclude that all further observations based solely on lobule (in other words, the entire rest of the paper) depend</italic> <italic>on zebrin identity, as claimed?</italic></p><p>This is indeed an interesting point. Before the sample sizes were quite low in most cases, but the additional data obtained from EAAT4-eGFP mice allow us to make a better comparison. In the new dataset the simple spike frequency of Z+ PCs in the anterior zone is lower than that of those in the nodular zone. We would like to emphasize that we do not think that, also considering the large variability in the PC activity within Z+ and Z− groups, Z+ or Z− PCs by definition form a homogeneous group. It is, in our view, very well possible there are sub-groups with their own differences, but this is currently outside the scope of this study.</p><p>In that respect it is important to note that we only see evidence for within-group differences in the Z+ group, not between subsets of Z− PCs. Yet, it are these putatively more homogenous Z− PCs, of which the activity shifts towards that of the group of Z+ PCs by blocking TRPC3, indicating that the potential differences within the group of Z+ PCs do not affect our conclusions.</p><p>We now address this matter in the Results section and refer to it in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>The reviewers' suggestion</italic> <italic>was as follows:</italic></p><p><italic>The simplest way to de-emphasize the (weak according to the data presented) argument that the data have successfully dissociated zebrin identity from physical location would be to re-order the Figures, moving</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>to after</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4"><italic>Figures 2-4</italic></xref><italic>. In addition, conclusions on this point should be toned down</italic>.</p><p>We believe this is an essential point for our manuscript and have therefore performed additional experiments to obtain more insight in the correlation of PC activity with lobule and/or zebrin identity. These results, described more extensively above, argue against an important contribution of the physical (lobular) location, and strengthen the evidence for the direct relation between zebrin identity and Purkinje cell activity. We understand the reviewer suggestion to change the figure order in order to de-emphasize our argument, but felt that the new datasets we obtained could influence this suggestion. Therefore we consulted the editors via email, inquiring if, based on these new results, we could maintain the original order. We appreciate the opportunity to ask this question directly. Following their advice to proceed as we suggested, we did not change the order of the figures, but instead include new results obtained with EAAT4-eGFP mice in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In addition, based on the suggestions of the reviewers, we specifically address this topic in a separate paragraph in the results, and toned down our conclusions in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Further, for the current</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>figures 2</italic></xref><italic>-5, wording like “Z+ or Z- PCs” should be replaced with “PCs in zebrin +/- lobules”. Instead of referring to features that “depend on the zebrin identity”, it would be better to say “correlates with zebrin intensity of the lobule,” or similar. This is necessary if figures are re-ordered, and is a much more accurate interpretation of the data</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the wording should be accurately reflecting the status of the obtained recordings, but we believe there is a misunderstanding. Except for panel 4C, the data in this paragraph describe the characteristics of complex spikes in immunostaining identified Z+ vs. Z− PCs, the same group as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We now state this more clearly in the text and legend. Panel C is based on random Purkinje cell recordings in different lobules and hemisphere areas, the same as those described in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and regarding those we do not directly refer to zebrin identity.</p><p>We have now added the complex spike activity and regularity in two-photon imaging identified Z+ vs. Z− PCs to this Figure in panel B. Here too, comparable to the results obtained using immunostaining, we found a significantly higher complex spike frequency in Z+ compared to Z− PCs.</p><p><italic>The TRPC3 data should be the last figure, more to generate a hypothesis of mechanism, with less emphasis on the lobule&gt;zebrin&gt;mGluR1b&gt;TRPC3 arguments that both reviewers found problematic</italic>.</p><p>The TRPC3 data are only presented in the last figure. We have changed the Introduction, Results and Discussion (as described above) to de-emphasized the link of mGluR1b to TRPC3 and now restrict ourselves where possible to a discussion of the possible link with the cascade that includes several proteins that are expressed in a zebrin-like pattern.</p><p><italic>It would also be nice to discuss possible differences in Z+ PCs across modules - because they look different in Figure 1–figure supplement 3E, yet there is no direct comparison. What about if something besides</italic> <italic>zebrin identity were at play here (see comments below)?</italic></p><p>We agree that this is a potentially interesting observation. The new data obtained by two-photon imaging identified Z+ and Z− PCs in more anterior parts seem to confirm the impression of the reviewer. Although we demonstrate here that there are relatively large differences in PCs activity between zebrin-positive and -negative modules, we do not want to exclude the possibility that other factors could further subdivide these groups into subgroups (as also suggested above and discussed in relation to new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>),; probably more subtle inter-subgroup differences. These factors could include differences in: 1) the inputs, 2) other proteins or cascades that affect activity or even 3) the relative expression levels of zebrin or proteins in the cascade with similar expression pattern. We now address the possible differences in Z+ PCs in the Results section and include this consideration in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Additional</italic> <italic>comments:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Even if zebrin=TRPC3, we would want to know whether blocking TRPC3 affected more than just simple spike rate. Does intrinsic excitability, complex spike rate and width, and simple spikes around complex spikes depend on TRPC3? To what extent are they linked to changes in SS rate? Some of these experiments have already been done and could be analyzed to strengthen the claim that the many physiological features that vary with region share the same cellular basis. And some slice experiments could easily be done in EEAT2-GFP mice (though this too is indirect), to reduce the dependence on lobule as a proxy for zebrin</italic>.</p><p>In addition to simple spike firing frequency, blocking TRPC3 with selective blocker pyr3 <italic>in vivo</italic> affected several other parameters, including: climbing fiber pause, complex spike frequency and half width. Blocking TRPC3 with pyr3 consistently shifted these parameters in lobule III towards values observed in lobule X without blocker, typically changing significantly compared to lobule III without blocker. In addition, the effect on post-complex spike configuration was interesting, as blocking TRPC3 with pyr3 introduced the configuration types suppression and oscillation in PCs of lobule III, where they do not occur when TRPC3 is not blocked. The effects of genistein were less consistent, presumably due to its less specific nature. These results have now been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref> and are addressed in the Results section and Discussion section</p><p>Since the expression of EAAT4 is practically identical (at least in the vermis) to that of zebrin, we did consider it worthwhile to use the EAAT4-eGFP mice to test whether the differences between Z+ and Z− PCs still exist in Purkinje cells that are virtually side-by-side in the same lobule(s) in coronal cerebellar slices. As described above, we confirmed that the differences pertained both in a set of PCs from lobule II-V and in a separate set from lobule VIII-IX, and included these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) In the Introduction, the authors refer to the markers as genetic markers. This is a minor point but what the authors actually mean in this context is “molecular markers”. Along the same lines, in the very next sentence it is more appropriate to refer to the zebrins as “the best known of these molecules”. Indeed zebrinII “ expression has been studied a while back by Karl Herrup and Richard Hawkes, but this is not what the authors are referring to here</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing these errors. We have corrected them accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The Results section has some wording issues under the heading “Complex spike characteristics depend on the zebrin identity”. I am not entirely sure what the authors mean here. Please rephrase</italic>.</p><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the use of the word “coincided” here and have replaced it. The sentence now reads: “This higher firing frequency in lobule III is associated with a higher intrinsic excitability in lobule III compared to lobule X, reinforcing the interpretation that the difference is predominantly intrinsic to Purkinje cells (Figure 4–figure supplement 1).”</p><p><italic>4) Similarly, the first paragraph under the heading “Complex spike characteristics depend on the zebrin identity” is unclear. What are you actually comparing? I think I understand, but this can be reworded for clarity</italic>.</p><p>We have attempted to clarify this sentence; it now reads:</p><p>“In both <italic>a6-Cacna1a</italic> and <italic>PC-Δγ2</italic> mutant mice the differences in vivo in SS firing frequency between lobules I-III and lobule X were still significant, analogous to normal mice (<italic>a6-Cacna1a</italic>, I-III: 75.1 ± 19.0 Hz, X: 49.1 ± 9.9 Hz, <italic>t</italic> = 3.988, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <italic>PC-Δγ2</italic>, I-III: 89.8 ± 14.9 Hz, X: 60.9 ± 15.6 Hz, <italic>t</italic> = 4.876, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure. 4D</xref>).”</p><p><italic>5) Figure 1–figure supplement 3, the legend needs some alterations. The authors state that “In addition to classification based on lobules, cerebellar Purkinje cells can be subdivided based on the input they receive into four transverse zones'. They cite Marzban and Hawkes, 2011. A better Hawkes reference for this should be chosen. I suggest the authors cite Ozol et al., 1999 J Comp Neurol. Second, Purkinje cells are subdivided based on 1) their developmental lineage, 2) gene and protein expression patterns, 3) sensitivity to mutations in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis, AND 4) on the inputs they receive. And, in any</italic> <italic>case what classifies Purkinje cells based on lobules?</italic></p><p>We have replaced the reference according to the reviewer’s suggestion. Regarding the second point, we appreciate the variety of potential ways to subdivide the cerebellar cortex, however, in our current dataset we are restricted by the parameters we determined. We believe there could be a role for diversity in inputs to different parts of the cortex (and we now include this also in the discussion on differences in Z+ PCs), but show that the simple spike frequency differences can be largely explained by intrinsic activity. We appreciate the reviewer’s comment that a subdivision based on lobules has little added value and have removed these panels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
