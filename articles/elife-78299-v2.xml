systems, but the origins and evolution of these proteins remain unclear. Recent genomic sequence analyses in several organisms suggest that new functions encoded by small open reading frames (sORFs) may emerge de novo from noncoding sequences. However, experimental data demonstrating if and how randomly generated sORFs can confer beneficial effects to cells are limited. Here, we show that by upregulating <italic>hisB</italic> expression, de novo small proteins (≤50 amino acids in length) selected from random sequence libraries can rescue <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells that lack the conditionally essential SerB enzyme. The recovered small proteins are hydrophobic and confer their rescue effect by binding to the 5′ end regulatory region of the <italic>his</italic> operon mRNA, suggesting that protein binding promotes structural rearrangements of the RNA that allow increased <italic>hisB</italic> expression. This study adds RNA regulatory elements as another interacting partner for de novo proteins isolated from random sequence libraries and provides further experimental evidence that small proteins with selective benefits can originate from the expression of nonfunctional sequences.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>de novo</kwd><kwd>small proteins</kwd><kwd>auxotroph</kwd><kwd>gene evolution</kwd><kwd>his operon</kwd><kwd>RNA binding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015.0069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Dan I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-01527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Dan I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-00666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knopp</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020‐04395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jemth</surname><given-names>Per</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017.0071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>Mårten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>De novo-generated small proteins can cause deattenuation of an amino acid biosynthetic operon by direct protein–RNA interactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Once overlooked, the study of small proteins is a rapidly growing field. Typically defined as polypeptides consisting of 50 or fewer amino acids, small proteins originate from the translation of distinct small open reading frames (sORFs), rather than from the cleavage of larger precursor proteins or synthesis via ribosome-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz et al., 2014</xref>). Recent advancements in genome and transcriptome sequencing, ribosome-profiling techniques, proteomics, and bioinformatic analyses have led to the discovery of numerous previously unannotated small proteins in all domains of life and efforts to elucidate the targets and functions of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Lima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steinberg and Koch, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Su et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weidenbach et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). The detection and characterization of small proteins in bacteria have been a particularly prolific research area over the past decade, and bacterial small proteins have been implicated in many fundamental physiological processes, including cell division, sporulation, lysis, transport, stress responses, virulence, antibiotic resistance, and cell-to-cell communication (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duval and Cossart, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garai and Blanc-Potard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hemm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the progress made in the identification and validation of an increasing number of small proteins with versatile cellular functions, much remains unknown about the origins, evolution, and phylogenetic distribution of these small genes and their encoded proteins.</p><p>In addition to the current underannotation of sORFs within genomic databases, the short lengths of the coding sequences and subsequent lack of conserved protein domains render it challenging to identify small protein orthologs and establish evolutionary relationships between small proteins across different organisms. For select bacterial small proteins encoded within operons containing larger, more conserved proteins, conservation of gene synteny and/or operon content has aided in the identification of orthologs in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horler and Vanderpool, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz et al., 2014</xref>), but only a handful of bacterial small proteins have been found to traverse multiple phylogenetic classes. Instead, most appear to be poorly conserved and are limited to a single species or a few closely related bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alix and Blanc-Potard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz et al., 2014</xref>). This lack of conservation raises the question: where did these small protein-coding genes come from? Are they bona fide new genes that emerged independently or the remnants of genes that once encoded larger proteins?</p><p>A plausible mechanism for the de novo emergence of small protein-coding genes is the proto-gene model, wherein the transcription of noncoding DNA and subsequent ribosome association lead to the synthesis of novel proteins. Large-scale expression studies demonstrate pervasive transcription of non-genic stretches within characterized genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dinger et al., 2008</xref>) and ribosome-profiling data indicate that many noncoding RNAs are engaged by the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson and Masel, 2011</xref>), supporting the notion that the expression of randomly occurring sORFs from non-genic sequences can serve as a pool for the de novo selection of beneficial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samayoa et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, several reports show that genes recently emerged from noncoding DNA are often short in length, poorly conserved, composed primarily of hydrophobic amino acids, and tend to form alpha-helical domains – all of which are hallmark characteristics of most small proteins described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent experimental work from our group has demonstrated that de novo small proteins with beneficial functions can be selected in vivo from completely random DNA sequence libraries. Due to their small size, the functions of the proteins recovered from these studies, as well as those of most naturally occurring small proteins, are mostly limited to interactions with preexisting cellular machineries or regulatory pathways rather than bona fide enzymatic activities. Specifically, our previously isolated de novo small proteins confer antibiotic resistance by altering cell permeability via direct interactions with the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>) or by activating a sensor kinase via protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knopp et al., 2021</xref>). Along similar lines, an earlier study by Digianantonio and Hecht using structurally constrained and partially randomized DNA libraries showed that selected proteins 102 amino acids in length can rescue an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> auxotroph caused by the deletion of <italic>serB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Digianantonio and Hecht, 2016</xref>). While the precise mechanism of these semi-random proteins has not been elucidated, the dependence of the growth restoration on the deattenuation/increased transcription of the <italic>his</italic> operon and subsequent upregulation of the multi-copy suppressor, HisB, points toward a possible protein-RNA regulatory interaction as the underlying molecular basis of the rescue.</p><p>The abundance and mechanisms of RNA regulatory elements, especially those that regulate gene expression in response to direct protein binding, such as ribosomal protein leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zengel and Lindahl, 1994</xref>) and Rho-dependent transcription terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>), render them promising potential targets for de novo small protein functionality. Additionally, the rescue of auxotrophies is a convenient means to probe for de novo small proteins with novel regulatory interactions as a number of biosynthetic operons are controlled by combinations of different regulatory proteins, RNA elements, and/or small molecules, and many auxotrophic phenotypes can often be suppressed by modulating the expression of alternate enzymes with moonlighting activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Patrick et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To experimentally investigate the extent to which completely random, unconstrained, and/or noncoding sequences can serve as substrates for natural de novo gene evolution, we utilized random sequence expression libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>) to select for de novo small proteins that can restore the growth of an auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain lacking the conditionally essential enzyme, SerB, and characterized the mechanisms responsible for the rescue phenotype. We isolated three small proteins from our screen that are less than or equal to 50 amino acids in length and are novel and distinct from those isolated from past studies. Our selected proteins confer their rescue effect by upregulating the alternative enzyme HisB, and the increase in <italic>hisB</italic> expression is likely caused by direct RNA-binding interactions with the regulatory 5′ end of the <italic>his</italic> operon mRNA transcript. In addition to their small size and gene regulatory roles, the recovered proteins exhibit other traits characteristic of most known naturally occurring small proteins, providing additional in vivo evidence that sORFs encoding novel beneficial functions can indeed originate de novo from previously noncoding and/or nonfunctional DNA sequences, without any preexisting structural or functional scaffolds. These findings add nucleic acids to the list of interacting partners for the novel de novo small proteins isolated from in vivo random sequence library screens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selection of novel sORFs that restore growth of an auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant</title><p>We used a set of highly diverse expression vector libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>) to screen for novel sORFs that confer rescue of the <italic>serB</italic> deletion mutant and other auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. The five libraries encode small proteins ranging from 10 to 50 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Three of the libraries (rnd10, rnd20, rnd50a) encode repeats of NNB, where N encodes A, C, G, or T at equal ratios and B encodes only C, G, or T. This restriction was chosen to remove two of the three stop codons to increase the likelihood of obtaining full-length proteins within the sORFs, while maintaining amino acid ratios comparable to that of NNN repeats. Libraries 50b and 50c were biased to encode a higher fraction of primordial and hydrophilic residues in an effort to recapitulate potential coding sequences in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ring et al., 1972</xref>) or generate proteins without a strong hydrophobic core that are structurally flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyson, 2016</xref>), respectively. The inserts were expressed from an IPTG-inducible low-copy plasmid (an in-house construct denoted as pRD2 containing a p15A origin of replication). A strong ribosome-binding site, a start codon, and three stop codons (one per frame) ensured translational initiation and termination of the randomly generated inserts upon IPTG induction.

We transformed all five expression libraries as well as empty vector controls into these 74 auxotrophic mutants and selected three variants that enabled growth on M9 minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

However, recoding Hdp1 resulted in a loss of function, likely due to effects on expression levels and mRNA stability. Therefore, to further demonstrate that the functionality of this insert is also dependent on the encoded protein rather than the mRNA transcript, we constructed an additional Hdp1 variant in which the start codon was removed.

Correspondingly, a nonfunctional Hdp1 variant containing a L27Q substitution within the similarity region that was derived from the random mutagenesis screens (i.e., did not rescue the Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant on minimal medium) did not increase the β-galactosidase activity of the P<italic><sub>hisL</sub>-his</italic><sub>operator</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> fusion reporter strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

It is possible, albeit unlikely, that Hdp2 rescues via a different mechanism. Consistent with our β-galactosidase activity data, no significant changes to protein abundance were observed upon expression of the Hdp1 L27Q mutant.

Co-IP experiments performed with the tagged, nonfunctional Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> L27Q mutant variant also demonstrated less enrichment for all target <italic>his</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> RNA transcripts of interest. Although these data demonstrate possible weak in vivo interactions between Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> and the <italic>thr</italic><sub>operator</sub> RNA and between Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> L27Q and the <italic>his</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> transcripts, the lower fold-enrichment for both data sets suggests that these potential interactions are negligible enough to impede any measurable regulatory activity in vivo and the subsequent rescue of Δ<italic>serB</italic> strain growth on minimal medium.</p><p>It is interesting to note that despite the fact that <italic>hisL</italic> is contained within the <italic>his</italic> operator region (the primary target for Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> binding) and there are two copies of <italic>hisL</italic> present in the reporter strain used for the experiments, the fold-enrichment for <italic>hisL</italic> is slightly lower than that of the other downstream transcripts regulated by the <italic>his</italic> operator in the pull-downs performed with both the functional and nonfunctional versions of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>. This could potentially be due to differences in transcript stability and/or reverse transcription efficiency as <italic>hisL</italic> is a very small gene located next to a highly structured region on the 5′-most ends of two very long transcripts. This is also likely the reason why the same trend is apparent in the pull-down data for the <italic>thrL</italic> versus the <italic>thrA</italic> transcripts as <italic>thrL</italic> has a genomic context similar to that of <italic>hisL</italic>. Nevertheless, the overall trends observed in the co-IP data are in agreement with those from our proteomics and β-galactosidase activity experiments and indicate that Hdp1 directly interacts with RNA transcripts regulated by the 5′ <italic>his</italic> operator region in vivo.</p><p>Binding of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> to the full-length <italic>his</italic> operator RNA was further confirmed and characterized in vitro by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> value from a 1:1 binding model was estimated as 0.63 ± 0.13 μM. Consistent with our above in vivo data, EMSAs performed with the nonfunctional Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> L27Q variant demonstrated a fivefold reduction in binding affinity to the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 3.3 ± 0.71 μM), and assays performed with the ‘wild-type’ Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> and the nonspecific control <italic>thr</italic> operator RNA exhibited an almost threefold reduction in binding affinity in vitro (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.7 ± 0.37 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). However, while a maximum bound fraction of 1 is expected from the experimental setup, the fitted maximum fraction bound was 1.45 ± 0.13 for the L27Q mutant protein. This value results from a slightly sigmoidal shape of the binding curve, suggesting positive cooperativity. We therefore fitted an equation accounting for positive cooperativity to all three data sets, resulting in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 0.54 ± 0.08 μM (Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> with the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA), 1.8 ± 0.26 μM (Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> L27Q with the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA), and 1.28 ± 0.27 (Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> with the <italic>thr</italic> operator control RNA), with Hill coefficients of around 1.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d and e</xref>). While the number of data points collected precludes any strong conclusion regarding the binding model, the EMSAs support our in vivo data by demonstrating (i) a direct binding interaction between the Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> protein and the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA, (ii) Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> displays a higher affinity for the <italic>his</italic> RNA than the <italic>thr</italic> RNA, and (iii) the ‘wild-type’ Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> has a greater affinity for the <italic>his</italic> RNA than the L27Q mutant protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Hdp1 binding alters <italic>his</italic> operator RNA secondary structure</title><p>To assess whether portions of the full-length <italic>his</italic> operator RNA undergo conformational changes upon Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> binding and/or which regions are necessary for Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> interaction, we performed nuclease protection assays with RNase T1 in the presence and absence of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> (±5.5 μM Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>, the maximum concentration used in the EMSAs). RNase T1 specifically cleaves RNA at single-stranded or unprotected G nucleotides. The <italic>his</italic> operator RNA can adopt two mutually exclusive conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolter and Yanofsky, 1982</xref>), and probing the RNA structure in the absence of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> showed hallmarks of both conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). For instance, protection of cleavage at G77 and G90 is consistent with the terminator conformation, while the strong cleavage at G96 and protection at G126-127 is consistent with the anti-terminator structure, suggesting a mixture of the two conformations, or possibly alternative conformations, in the RNA sample.</p><p>Several regions of the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA demonstrated increased cleavage in the presence of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>, and the cleavage pattern suggests a potential transition between the terminator and the anti-terminator conformations. Specifically, while the increased cleavage of nucleotides G126 and G127 in the presence of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> is consistent with the terminator conformation of the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA, the increased cleavage of nucleotides G77 and G90 is consistent with the anti-terminator structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Interestingly, only one nucleotide, G96, exhibited reduced cleavage upon the addition of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>. The protection of G96 in the presence of the protein is consistent with the terminator conformation of the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA; however, it may also indicate a region of the RNA that is directly shielded by protein binding.</p><p>The intensity of T1-cleavage products corresponding to the <italic>hisL</italic> Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start codon (nucleotides G23-G41) also increased in the Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>-bound RNA. In addition to the impact the Hdps have on <italic>his</italic> operon transcription, it is also possible that the 5′ region of the RNA becomes more accessible to the ribosome in the presence of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>, thus facilitating more efficient translation of the <italic>his</italic> operon and further increasing HisB expression. However, the biological relevance of this T1-cleavage pattern is difficult to discern, as the 5′ region of the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA is predicted to remain relatively unstructured in either conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolter and Yanofsky, 1982</xref>).</p><p>Some highly structured regions could not be fully resolved in either the T1 probing assays or the denaturing T1 reference ladder, particularly the nucleotides that comprise the terminator stem (E+F, nucleotides G153-G171) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). This indicates that the G-C-rich stem is difficult to disrupt, even under denaturing conditions and with a high RNase T1 concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kolter and Yanofsky, 1982</xref>). Similarly, the region corresponding to C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (nucleotides G103-G107) is also difficult to resolve in both the T1 ladder and the probing assays. This region is base-paired in both <italic>his</italic> operator RNA conformations, thus it may also be difficult to disrupt and subsequently generate corresponding cleavage products.</p><p>Despite these limitations and although we were unable to identify any specific Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> binding site, the RNase T1 probing assays show that the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA indeed undergoes conformational changes in the presence of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> and provide insight into the general regions of the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA that are impacted by protein binding. Our data, as well as those from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Digianantonio and Hecht, 2016</xref>), indicate that the Hdps likely increase <italic>hisB</italic> expression by deattenuation of the <italic>his</italic> operator region. Therefore, it is possible that Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> binding results in changes to the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA secondary structure that favor the canonical anti-terminator conformation or promote the formation of an alternative anti-terminator structure. Sufficient stabilization of an anti-terminator conformation and/or destabilization of the <italic>his</italic> operator terminator upon Hdp binding would likely allow increased expression of <italic>hisB</italic> and ultimately the growth of the Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotrophic mutant on minimal medium. Additional probing experiments are necessary to obtain more conclusive information on the RNA structural changes that take place upon Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> binding and how these changes may affect termination/anti-termination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The recent identification of a multitude of small proteins encoded by sORFs raises intriguing questions about their functional roles and evolutionary origins. With regard to their emergence, one possible mechanism for generating sORFs is by degradation of larger genes into pseudogenes containing shorter coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemm et al., 2008</xref>). Also in <italic>E. coli</italic>, other sORFs have been identified in prophage regions and thus may have origins stemming from an ancestral phage genomic integration event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">VanOrsdel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>). However, these mechanisms only address the origins of a fraction of small protein-coding genes. A large majority of sORFs identified to date demonstrate little to no conservation between closely related phylogenetic classes and lack the genomic context to support or indicate either of the aforementioned mechanisms, suggesting that many of these small genes may have emerged de novo from previously non-genic sequences. Nonetheless, while previous studies show that novel functions, including variants with enzymatic activity, can be selected in bacteria from templates featuring localized randomization within larger functional progenitor sequences and/or structural scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Digianantonio and Hecht, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoegler and Hecht, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), there is limited experimental evidence demonstrating that de novo genes can emerge from the expression of completely random and/or nonfunctional DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knopp et al., 2021</xref>). In this work, we identified de novo small proteins with RNA-binding regulatory activities.</p><p>We isolated three independent small proteins (Hdp1-Hdp3) that rescued an <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant by upregulating the expression of an alternate enzyme, HisB, and for Hdp1 we showed direct binding interactions with the 5′ operator region of the <italic>his</italic> operon mRNA transcript. The <italic>his</italic> operon is regulated by a transcriptional attenuation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blasi and Bruni, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1980</xref>) as well as the stringent response that acts on the promoter and transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riggs et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stephens et al., 1975</xref>). Analysis of the β-galactosidase activity of several <italic>his</italic><sub>operator</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusions in response to the presence of Hdp1 showed that (i) Hdp1 acts at the level of transcriptional attenuation (rather than the promoter), (ii) the stringent response is not involved in the Hdp1-mediated effects on <italic>his</italic> operon expression, and (iii) Hdp1 action requires the intact <italic>his</italic> operator region.</p><p>In addition, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that Hdp1 interacts with the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA and that protein binding results in changes to the RNA secondary structure that may facilitate increased transcription of the <italic>his</italic> operon, including <italic>hisB</italic>. Using a more soluble variant of Hdp1 (Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>) that maintained the Δ<italic>serB</italic>-rescue phenotype, we showed by co-IP assays and EMSAs that Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> binds to the full-length <italic>his</italic> operator RNA with micromolar affinity and that the inactive protein mutant, Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> L27Q, has a fivefold reduction in affinity. Most RNA-protein regulatory interactions exhibit in vitro K<sub>d</sub> values within the nanomolar range or lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryder et al., 2008</xref>). However, the moderate binding affinity of Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> to the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA is not surprising as the protein was directly selected from a random library without any further optimization.</p><p>More in-depth characterization of the binding interaction between Hdp1<sub>opt</sub> and the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA could be complicated by the possibility that the Hdps may exist as multimers rather than monomeric proteins as alpha-helical proteins with predominantly hydrophobic residues often have a propensity to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Hdp multimerization is conceivable as the semi-random proteins isolated from the previous Digianantonio and Hecht study that likely rescue Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotrophy via a similar (but undetermined) mechanism of action were designed to fold into four-helix structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Digianantonio and Hecht, 2016</xref>). Albeit beyond the scope of this work, further investigations are needed to determine the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the binding model and/or stoichiometry of the Hdp-<italic>his</italic> RNA interaction.</p><p>As mentioned above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Digianantonio and Hecht, 2016</xref> also recovered several proteins (SynserB1-4) that rescued growth of a Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotrophic mutant via HisB upregulation by utilizing libraries of partially randomized sequences. Even though the exact mechanism of the SynserB-mediated rescue is not characterized, it is likely that both the SynserBs and Hdps share a similar mechanism as both upregulate HisB expression in a stringent response-independent manner. Despite the functional similarity, there is no obvious sequence similarity between the SynserBs and Hdps, demonstrating that the selected function is not necessarily dependent on a specific extended sequence motif. That being said, the clustering of loss-of-function mutations in or around the predicted region of similarity within the Hdps is intriguing. However, we acknowledge that the small sample size, lack of overall sequence homology, and the short length of the proteins render it difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the functional relevance of this putative motif. As noted previously, additional experiments are required to confirm if the potential motif indeed plays any functional role in Hdp rescue activity.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that expression of Hdp1 and Hdp3 causes a specific and significant upregulation of the <italic>his</italic> and <italic>his</italic><sub>operator</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> operons. In contrast, the SynSerB3 protein showed a rather unspecific effect on gene expression, with more than 600 proteins being affected (including most of the amino acid biosynthetic operons). It is possible that the differences in global proteome/transcriptome changes observed for <italic>synserB3</italic> and <italic>hdp1</italic> and <italic>hdp3</italic> are due to different experimental conditions. SynSerB3 was tested in a <italic>serB</italic>-deficient mutant in minimal medium, which results in severely reduced growth, whereas the Hdps were tested in rich medium, which allows for wild-type growth rates and comparisons with empty plasmid control strains, but admittedly does not perfectly recapitulate the conditions under which the Hdps were functionally selected. While determination of physiological effects upon Hdp expression under permissive conditions can still reveal a biological activity, it does not necessarily reflect the level of upregulation under selective conditions. This may be why we do not observe increased His and (modified) Lac protein abundance upon Hdp2 expression in our proteome analyses and why we measure a modest increase in β-galactosidase activity with Hdp2 in our reporter assays despite Hdp2’s ability to rescue Δ<italic>serB</italic> strain growth on minimal medium.</p><p>Based on the binary pattern constraining the library design in the Digianantonio and Hecht study, the selected SynserB proteins form four-helix bundles. While this library design increases the chances of recovering well-structured proteins that likely reach high cellular concentrations without aggregating, bona fide de novo proteins evolved from completely random sequences do not share this privilege and will mostly form insoluble aggregates and be targeted for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yomo et al., 1998</xref>). Additionally, using libraries with preexisting structural properties further limits the selection of novel functionalities to those within the defined sequence and structural constraints. By utilizing expression libraries encoding completely random sORFs, we have shown that a new functionality can be selected truly de novo, without any predefined structural boundaries, demonstrating that preexisting structural scaffolds are not necessary for a novel protein to be expressed and achieve biological function with high specificity. However, randomized sequences in nature are likely not completely random as they may contain remnants of previously optimized structural or functional sequence motifs, which might increase the probability of acquiring a new function. Yet, the use of completely random sequences is a suitable starting point for proof-of-concept demonstration of the de novo evolution of small protein-coding genes as they serve as a true null model when screening for functionality, and unlike preexisting genomic sequences, they introduce little implicit bias or constraints during the selection process.</p><p>Given that the majority of small proteins described to date are predominately composed of hydrophobic amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hemm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>), it is not surprising that all functional small proteins we have selected are also hydrophobic. As our previously recovered antibiotic resistance-conferring proteins are localized to the membrane, the strong hydrophobicity is linked to their functionality. However, despite the transmembrane domain predictions, it is unlikely that the Hdps exclusively associate with the cell membrane as their mechanism involves regulating transcription and the solubility-optimized variant of Hdp1 (Hdp1<sub>opt</sub>) is not predicted to target the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider that hydrophobicity is an important contributor to functionality in random sequence space. This concept is supported by recent work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>, which identified that the beneficial fitness effects of emerging ORFs were found to be associated with the potential to produce transmembrane domains, and that thymine-rich intergenic regions in particular were identified as a reservoir for encoding transmembrane domains.</p><p>It is also worth noting that despite our extensive screen of 74 different auxotrophs, we only isolated positive ‘hits’ that rescued the Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotrophic strain. As acquiring bona fide enzymatic activity from relatively short random DNA sequences is exceedingly rare, it is not unexpected that de novo-generated functionality primarily involves targeting preexisting cellular machinery and/or regulatory mechanisms. In this regard, the rescue of a Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant is a convenient model system as <italic>E. coli</italic> already encodes a preexisting enzyme with a sufficient secondary activity (HisB) that can function in lieu of SerB when overexpressed, and <italic>hisB</italic> expression is modulated by a regulatory RNA structure (<italic>his</italic> operator region) that is an ideal target for interactions with novel small proteins.</p><p>The Hdps, as well as the small proteins selected from our past screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knopp et al., 2021</xref>), demonstrate many qualities intrinsic to most known naturally occurring bacterial small proteins: (i) they are ≤50 amino acids in length, (ii) contain a high percentage of hydrophobic amino acids, (iii) are predicted to form predominantly alpha-helical structures, (iv) are predicted to associate with the membrane, and (v) they do not encode an enzymatic activity, but rather act as regulators/interactors to modulate a specific process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Storz et al., 2014</xref>). The previously isolated aminoglycoside resistance-conferring proteins (Arps) provide resistance by membrane insertion, disruption of the proton motive force, and a subsequent reduction in antibiotic uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Knopp et al., 2019</xref>), while the colistin resistance-conferring proteins (Dcrs) exert their effect via direct protein–protein interactions that activate the sensor kinase PmrB, resulting in Lipid A modifications and decreased affinity toward colistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knopp et al., 2021</xref>). This study extends the previously known spectrum of interacting partners of experimentally selected de novo small proteins to include nucleic acids and exemplifies how direct binding of a de novo protein to an RNA regulatory element can upregulate expression of a biosynthetic operon and restore growth of an auxotrophic <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Directed evolution of our selected de novo small proteins could shed further light on the evolutionary constraints governing the emergence of new genes. For example, will selection fine-tune the function, expression, and/or stability of these proteins, and will these evolved variants converge to preexisting genes or differentiate to fill a novel and distinct structural and/or functional niche not yet occupied by naturally occurring genes?</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All strains were derivatives of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 (F<sup>-</sup>, lambda<sup>-</sup>, <italic>rph-1</italic>).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rescue of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> auxotrophy by de novo small proteins&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joseph T Wade as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mona Wu Orr (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found the paper to be interesting, and all reviewers agreed that the model for Hdp1 function is exciting since it would demonstrate a regulatory function associated with a newly evolved small protein. However, the reviewers also felt that the paper requires additional work to convincingly show that Hdp1 functions by specifically binding the his mRNA 5' UTR. The reviewers have put together a list of essential revisions. Most of these should be straightforward. The one new experiment the reviewers felt is important is to demonstrate a specific interaction of Hdp1 with the his mRNA 5' UTR in vivo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Add a table with a list of the Hdp1 and Hdp2 random mutants assayed, including any that retained function.</p><p>2. Soften the conclusions regarding the putative shared amino acid motif (Figure 1D).</p><p>3. Include all relevant bacterial growth data.</p><p>4. Include a negative control RNA in the EMSA experiment.</p><p>5. Add reporter assay data for Hdp1opt and Hdp1opt L27Q using one of the lacZ reporter fusions, to establish whether the L27Q mutation in the context of Hdp1opt disrupts function.</p><p>6. Add a replicate of the RNase T1 experiment; quantify the data.</p><p>7. Demonstrate a specific interaction of Hdp1 (or Hdp1opt) with the his mRNA 5' UTR in vivo. If this involves a tagged Hdp1, include controls to show that the tagged protein retains activity in vivo.</p><p>Please also respond to comments made by individual reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors describe several results involving the growth of different strains, e.g. growth rescue of the serB deletion by the three small proteins, and growth of hisB/serA/serC mutants. These data should be shown.</p><p>2. The authors describe random mutagenesis of Hdp1 and Hdp2. A full list of the identified mutations should be included as a table. Were any mutants identified and sequenced that maintained function? If so, these should be included in the table.</p><p>3. The motif shown in Figure 1D may be important, but the evidence supporting this idea is relatively weak. The sequences are somewhat divergent between the three proteins, and the previously reported protein SynSerB3 lacks a match to this motif. Conclusions about the importance of the motif should be softened.</p><p>4. The Hdp1opt L27Q mutant should be tested for its effect in vivo with the reporter assay.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Currently, all growth/fitness data are not presented. Growth curves or spot plate assays for all relevant experiments should be added, among which for Hpd1-3 random proteins, Hpd1-3 versions with premature stop codons or truncations, recoded Hdp ORFs, Hdp1(L27Q), Hdp1-optimized, Hdp1-optimized(L27Q), claim that cells expressing Hdp2 grow slower than cells expressing Hdp1 or Hdp3, experiments in ΔserA, ΔserC, ΔYtjC, Δgph, or ΔhisB backgrounds.</p><p>These experiments should include the following controls: (i) an empty vector, (ii) a SerB complementation on the same vector, and (iii) a HisB complementation on the same vector.</p><p>The fitness of cells expressing Hpd1-3 in medium supplemented with serine should also be included to show their cost/toxicity.</p><p>– The authors are encouraged to clearly state the model for Hdps molecular function before describing the data in figure 2 to help the readers evaluate their findings. If I understand correctly, the model suggests that when histidine-charges tRNA levels are high, there are low transcript levels of the his operon. Expression of Hdps results in increased RNA levels of the his operon, leading to increased protein levels of HisB that compensate for the SerB deletion. To test this model the authors should:</p><p>– Demonstrate that in a medium without histidine and serine, HisB protein levels are high enough to allow the growth of ΔserB cells.</p><p>– Demonstrate that in a medium without histidine both the fitness improvement and the increase in HisB protein levels as a result of Hdps expression are dramatically reduced because HisB levels are already high due to activation of the his operon and the effects of Hdps are partially/completely alleviated.</p><p>– It is unclear if LacZ levels are statistically significant between an empty vector and Hdp2 expression. The authors should clarify this issue and also directly measure HisB protein levels upon Hdp2 expression.

Therefore, any Hdp1 effect might be negligible in this context. The authors should find mutations in the his operator that maintain its functionality on one hand but alleviate Hdp1's function. Because this claim is central to the model presented in the paper, this control is very important.</p><p>– The thr-lacZ construct is not a good control for the experiment in figure 2B because its basal LacZ levels are high in the conditions of the experiment (similar to my previous comment). Yet, this is a critical control, so the authors should find a different operator with a similar structure and function to the his operator and for which LacZ basal levels are low for an empty vector control. If LacZ levels remain low upon Hdp1 expression, that will be an important support for the authors' model.</p><p>– Such an alternative operator control should be used as the control for the EMSA experiments and T1-digestion patterns in figure 3. Without such a control, it is difficult to evaluate the robustness of the data. The T1-cleavage patterns are indeed different between the absence and presence of Hdp1, but the results are messy and inconclusive, as the authors note themselves. This is critical because the majority of the paper's novelty comes from the data in this figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A very clearly written and enjoyable story with clean experiments.

I don't think you need all of it (especially all the random mutagenesis assays), but at least including growth data (e.g. growth curves in liquid minimal media or images of spot assays on minimal media plates) for the Hdp1 L27Q-expressing strain compared to the Hdp1-expressing strain and the and empty vector strain would make it easier for the reader to see that it is suitable as a non-functional control sequence.</p><p>2. A control experiment that expands Sup. Figure 2B to include Hdp1opt L27Q's effects on lacZ reporter expression would support its use as a non-functional variant in the EMSA experiments. Hdp1 and Hdp1opt seem very different in sequence, hydrophobicity, and function. Although EMSA shows that Hdp1opt L27Q binds the his operator with lower affinity than Hdp1opt, data indicating that this result is consistent with Hdp1opt L27Q's behavior in vivo would strengthen the paper.</p><p>3. Although the β-gal assays indicate that Hdp activation is likely specific to the his operon by comparing induction to the trp operon lacZ fusion, a control demonstrating this specificity in vitro would support that Hdp1 is not non-specifically binding mRNA. Using the thr operator sequence or another random section of similarly-sized RNA in an EMSA could demonstrate this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78299.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

If I understand correctly, the model suggests that when histidine-charges tRNA levels are high, there are low transcript levels of the his operon. Expression of Hdps results in increased RNA levels of the his operon, leading to increased protein levels of HisB that compensate for the SerB deletion. To test this model the authors should:</p><p>– Demonstrate that in a medium without histidine and serine, HisB protein levels are high enough to allow the growth of ΔserB cells.</p><p>– Demonstrate that in a medium without histidine both the fitness improvement and the increase in HisB protein levels as a result of Hdps expression are dramatically reduced because HisB levels are already high due to activation of the his operon and the effects of Hdps are partially/completely alleviated.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been previously established (for examples see Patrick, et al. PMID: 17884825, Digianantonio and Hecht PMID: 26884172) that overexpression of HisB restores growth of a Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant on minimal medium. We have now included this control experiment as well, showing overexpression of HisB from pRD2 allows growth (Figure 1—figure supplement 2, 3, 5). It is also known that a Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant is auxotrophic, and does not grow on minimal medium lacking both serine and histidine. If lack of histidine alone would allow growth restoration, the mutant would not classify as auxotrophic on M9 minimal medium, which does not contain serine and histidine. The inability of the <italic>serB</italic> mutant carrying an empty control plasmid to grow on M9 is now shown in Figure 1G. We established that HisB is upregulated upon expression of the Hdps and we have established that HisB is required for growth restoration of a Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant by the Hdps. We believe our current work and data from previous studies clearly show that the mechanistic basis for which Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotrophy is rescued by HisB upregulation is not achieved by histidine starvation alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear if LacZ levels are statistically significant between an empty vector and Hdp2 expression. The authors should clarify this issue and also directly measure HisB protein levels upon Hdp2 expression. This is critical to support the claim that Hdp2 functions similarly to Hdp1 and Hdp3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included total proteome analyses for Hdp1, Hdp2, Hdp3, and the Hdp1 L27Q mutant (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). While Hdp1 and Hdp3 show a specific and significant increase in <italic>his</italic> protein abundance, we were not able to detect a similar increase upon overexpression of Hdp2 in rich medium. This is in agreement with the Β-galactosidase activity assays with the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter fusion, where we only measure a modest, yet statistically significant, increase in Β-galactosidase activity with Hdp2. Notably, the Δ<italic>serB</italic> mutant expressing Hdp2 also exhibits the weakest rescue phenotype/slowest growth on minimal medium. We have included this growth data in Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 2, 3, 5. While it is possible that Hdp2 acts via a completely different mechanism, we believe it is highly unlikely, given Hdp1 and Hdp3, as well as the SynserB3 isolated by Digianantonio and Hecht, all likely act via the mechanism presented in this manuscript. As mentioned above, it is not possible to determine HisB levels under non-permissive conditions because the empty plasmid control does not permit growth (see response to public review). Given its similar characteristics to Hdp1 and Hdp3, it is our opinion that Hdp2 also functions by the same mechanism. However, the upregulation of HisB may be less pronounced, and possibly only significant under non-permissive rescue conditions. Because of its strong rescue phenotype, we have focused our study on Hdp1 as a representative de novo gene rescuing a Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotroph, and we do not believe it is necessary to prove the mechanistic basis of rescue for all 3 variants. The possibility that Hdp2 or Hdp3, albeit very unlikely, act via different pathways does not affect the main objective of our study, namely that we identified a de novo-generated protein that rescues Δ<italic>serB</italic> auxotrophy by upregulating expression via direct RNA-binding interactions. Nevertheless, we do acknowledge that it is theoretically possible that Hdp2 functions via a different mechanism and we have now mention this in the Results (lines 279-280).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– LacZ levels for cells expressing Hdp1(L27Q) seem very similar to LacZ levels for cells expressing Hdp2, however, the authors claim that the former is non-functional and the latter is functional.

As discussed above, we are confident that we have conclusively demonstrated that Hdp1 rescues SerB loss by upregulation of HisB. Thus, the suggested measurements of HisB protein levels for each construct will not add anything with regard to understanding how the proteins act mechanistically. We have amended the text to state an alternative mechanism is theoretically possible, even though highly unlikely, in lines 279-280.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2E does not support the authors' claim because constructs (ii)-(iv) show high basal expression levels.

Because this claim is central to the model presented in the paper, this control is very important.</p></disp-quote><p>It is an interesting and important point that the reviewer raises and it is one that we independently considered. First, it should be noted that the data in Figure 2E, to which the reviewer refers, was only intended to show that the ability of Hdp1 to upregulate expression requires the intact 5’ regulatory region (described in lines 296-302). Thus, it was not it intended to address the exact mechanism with regard to where Hdp1 binds and how it influences the <italic>his</italic> operator RNA. Second, it is not straightforward to perform the actual experiments that the reviewer suggests and identify a specific binding site, since it assumes that such mutations exist (which they might not if, for example, the binding site for Hdp1 involves the terminator structure). Second, if they do exist, they are probably very rare since a majority of the mutations in the operator region are expected to affect functionality (by influencing the different secondary structures). Third, even if we find such mutations, they would not necessarily identify the exact binding site, since the Hdp1 binding site could involve a secondary/tertiary structure and a point mutation could directly/indirectly affect this. Thus, proper execution of this experiment would require extensive in vivo probing of secondary/tertiary mRNA structures of operator mutants (of the type requested by the reviewer, again, assuming they exist) in the absence and presence of Hdp1. In conclusion, even though the idea is valid, we think the experiments required are very extensive and far beyond the objectives of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The thr-lacZ construct is not a good control for the experiment in figure 2B because its basal LacZ levels are high in the conditions of the experiment (similar to my previous comment).

In rich medium, transcription of the threonine operon is repressed. As expected, baseline transcription might vary between different operators and their subsequent operons. However, the fact that the <italic>thr</italic> operator has a higher baseline expression in a repressed state does not have any bearing on the conclusion that Hdp1 does in fact not de-repress expression of the <italic>thr</italic> operon. While we consider this finding to be conclusive by itself, it is further confirmed by the specific and significant upregulation of the <italic>his</italic> operon shown in the whole proteome analysis, where any off target de-repression would be detected (e.g. <italic>thr</italic>-encoded proteins). The newly added <italic>thr</italic> operator RNA control in the EMSAs (Figure 3B,C and Figure 3—figure supplement 3), as well as the pull-down assay (Figure 3A) further confirm the <italic>his</italic>-specific action of Hdp1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Such an alternative operator control should be used as the control for the EMSA experiments and T1-digestion patterns in figure 3.
