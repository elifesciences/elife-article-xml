In this study, we employ quantitative live imaging methods to assess the function of pairs of primary and shadow enhancers in the regulation of key patterning genes-<italic>knirps</italic>, <italic>hunchback</italic>, and <italic>snail</italic>-in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The knirps enhancers exhibit additive, sometimes even super-additive activities, consistent with classical gene fusion studies. In contrast, the <italic>hunchback</italic> enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator, but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly sub-additive behavior is also observed for <italic>snail</italic>, whereby removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. Quantitative modeling of enhancer–promoter interactions suggests that weakly active enhancers function additively while strong enhancers behave sub-additively due to competition with the target promoter.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07956.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07956.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07956.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Only a subset of the genes in a cell is active at any time. Gene activation or ‘transcription’ is controlled by specific DNA sequences called promoters and enhancers. Promoters are found next to genes and recruit the protein machinery needed to transcribe the gene. Enhancers are located further away from genes and interact with the promoter to increase gene transcription.</p><p>Some genes have multiple enhancers with overlapping activities, typically including a primary enhancer and secondary or ‘shadow’ enhancer that is even more distant. Multiple enhancers are used to control gene transcription in different types of cells. For example, shortly after fertilization around 1000 enhancers in the embryo of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> regulate several hundred genes that are important for development. These activities establish which cell type any given cell in the embryo will become. Many of these developmental genes have shadow enhancers, which are thought to make gene activity more precise and reliable. It is not known, however, how several enhancers interact with the same promoter at the same time. For example, do the enhancers' individual effects add together? Or can the combined effects of multiple enhancers be more (or even less) than the sum of their parts?</p><p>Bothma, Garcia et al. have now examined how multiple enhancers regulate the activity of three developmental genes (called <italic>hunchback</italic>, <italic>knirps</italic>, and <italic>snail</italic>) in early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. The experiments showed that the individual effects of the <italic>knirps</italic> enhancers add together as one might expect. On the other hand, the <italic>snail</italic> enhancers interfere with each other, which means that their combined effect on transcription is less than the sum of the two individual effects. Furthermore, other experiments revealed that the combined effect of the <italic>hunchback</italic> enhancers depends upon whether another component that is needed for gene activation is in short supply.</p><p>To understand these observations, Bothma, Garcia et al. then developed a mathematical model. The model proposes that behavior of enhancers depends upon how strongly they interact with the target promoter. Since ‘weak’ enhancers do not interact very often, their effects can easily add together. However, the effects of ‘strong’ enhancers do not add together because they often compete to interact with the promoter. These findings show how multiple enhancers can work in a complex manner to control gene transcription.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07956.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07956.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>biophysics</kwd><kwd>quantitative imaging</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM34431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM071508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gregor</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM097275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gregor</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Hernan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Physics Department, Princeton University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dicke Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>Hernan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Searle Scholar Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10-SSP-274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gregor</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Quantitative live imaging assays reveal that multiple enhancers often fail to work in an additive fashion in the patterning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, and sometimes even interfere with one another.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is emerging evidence that metazoan genes occur in a complex regulatory landscape encompassing numerous enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buecker and Wysocka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levine et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the mouse <italic>Sonic Hedgehog</italic> gene is regulated by at least 20 different enhancers scattered over a distance of ∼1 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeong et al., 2006</xref>). Individual enhancers mediate expression in a variety of different tissues, including the brain, floorplate, and limb buds. Multiple enhancers with overlapping regulatory activities are also used to control gene expression within individual cell types. For example, the transcriptional activation of the gap gene <italic>hunchback (hb)</italic> in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo is mediated by both a proximal enhancer and distal ‘shadow’ enhancer that independently mediate activation in response to high levels of the Bicoid activator gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buecker and Wysocka, 2012</xref>). Despite overwhelming evidence for multiple enhancers regulating the same gene it is unknown whether they simultaneously interact with the same promoter in a given cell. Here, we use a combination of quantitative live imaging and theoretical modeling to investigate the function of multiple enhancers for the regulation of a common target gene within a single cell type.</p><p>The fate map of the adult fly is established by ∼1000 enhancers that regulate several hundred patterning genes during the 1-hr interval between two and three hrs after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nien et al., 2011</xref>). As many as half of these genes contain ‘shadow’ enhancers with overlapping spatiotemporal activities that are thought to improve the precision and reliability of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perry et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the <italic>hb</italic> shadow enhancer helps produce a sharp boundary of activation by the Bicoid gradient, while its <italic>snail (sna)</italic> counterpart helps ensure reliable activation under stressful conditions such as high temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perry et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>). There is emerging evidence that shadow enhancers are used pervasively in a variety of developmental processes, in both invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lagha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The underlying mechanisms by which two enhancers with extensively overlapping regulatory activities produce coordinated patterns of gene expression are uncertain. It is possible that they augment the levels of gene expression above the minimal thresholds required to execute appropriate cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gregor et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is currently only limited experimental evidence for enhancers acting in an additive fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative view is that shadow enhancers suppress transcriptional noise and help foster uniform expression among the different cells of a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buecker and Wysocka, 2012</xref>). To explore these and other potential mechanisms, we examined the timing and levels of gene activity using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) transgenes containing individual enhancers and combinations of primary and shadow enhancers in the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo.</p><p>BAC transgenes containing three key patterning genes, <italic>hb</italic>, <italic>knirps (kni)</italic>, and <italic>sna</italic>, were examined in living precellular embryos. Quantitative analyses suggest that shadow enhancers mediate different mechanisms of transcriptional activity. For <italic>kni</italic>, we observe additive, even super-additive, activities of the primary and shadow enhancer pairs. In contrast, the <italic>hb</italic> enhancers function sub-additively in anterior regions containing saturating levels of the Bicoid activator but function additively in regions where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid gradient. Strikingly, sub-additive behavior is also observed for sna, in that removal of the proximal enhancer causes a significant increase in gene expression. These observations suggest that the levels of enhancer activity determine the switch between additive and non-additive behaviors.</p><p>Using theoretical modeling, we suggest that these behaviors can be understood in the context of enhancers competing or cooperating for access to the promoter. Weak enhancers work additively due to infrequent interactions with the target promoter, whereas strong enhancers are more likely to impede one another due to frequent associations. Our results highlight the potential of combining quantitative live imaging and modeling in order to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for the precision of gene control in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gregor et al., 2014</xref>) and provide a preview into the complex function of multiple enhancers interacting with the same promoter.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Previous live-imaging studies have relied on simple gene fusions containing a single enhancer attached to a reporter gene with MS2 stem loops inserted in either the 5′ or 3′ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lucas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bothma et al., 2014</xref>). Detection depends on the binding of a maternal mRNA-binding fusion protein (MCP::GFP) expressed throughout the early embryo. In order to examine the interplay between multiple enhancers, we created a series of BAC transgenes containing complete regulatory landscapes (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The BAC transgenes contain an MS2-yellow reporter gene in place of the endogenous transcription units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each locus, <italic>hb</italic>, <italic>kni</italic>, and <italic>sna</italic>, we examined a series of three BAC transgenes: containing both primary and shadow enhancers, as well as derivatives lacking individual enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). As expected, the BAC transgenes containing both enhancers produce robust expression of the MS2 reporter gene which recapitulate endogenous patterns previously measured using mRNA FISH and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perry et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1 video2 video3">Videos 1–3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07956.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live-imaging of transcriptional activity of <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> loci lacking different enhancers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General structure of the reporter constructs.

In order to identify more nuanced changes, we quantified the transcriptional activities of the complete series of BAC transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The fluorescence intensities of active transcription foci were measured during nuclear cleavage cycles (nc) 13 and 14 at different positions across the anterior–posterior (AP) axis.

We measured the transcriptional activity of all three <italic>hb</italic> BAC transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F,H</xref>). Contrary to simple expectations suggested by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>), we find that the two <italic>hb</italic> enhancers do not function in an additive fashion in anterior regions (20–40% egg length, EL) of the embryo (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Indeed, the levels produced by the wild-type transgene fall far short of the additive levels predicted by simply summing the levels of expression produced by the transgenes containing either the shadow or primary enhancer alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Moreover, the removal of the shadow enhancer has no effect on the levels of transcription in anterior regions, which is consistent with the original conception of the shadow enhancer as a ‘back-up’ in the event of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hong et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A very different scenario is observed in central regions of the embryo (40–50% EL) where <italic>hb</italic> expression switches from ‘on’ to ‘off’ to form a sharp border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gregor et al., 2007</xref>). In this region, the wild-type transgene produces significantly higher levels of expression than either of the transgenes driven by a single enhancer. In fact, these levels correspond to the values predicted by simply adding the activities of the single-enhancer transgenes. Thus, the two enhancers transition from <italic>sub-additive</italic> to <italic>additive</italic> behavior in the region of the embryo where there are diminishing levels of the Bicoid activator gradient. We therefore suggest that the <italic>hb</italic> enhancers function additively only when they are operating below peak capacity (see below).</p><p>To further explore the activities of multiple enhancers, we examined the <italic>kni</italic> gene, which is regulated by an intronic enhancer and a distal 5′ enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). We focus our analysis on central regions of the abdominal expression pattern since previous studies suggest the occurrence of long-range repressive interactions that establish the borders of the ‘stripe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perry et al., 2011</xref>). During early periods of nc 14, the two enhancers function super-additively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). That is, the wild-type <italic>kni</italic> BAC transgene produces higher levels of expression than the predicted sum of the two transgenes containing either enhancer alone. During later stages of development, there is a twofold reduction in the expression levels of the endogenous gene, and at this time the two enhancers work in a simple additive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Note that the maximum number of elongating polymerase (Pol II) complexes falls short of that seen for <italic>hb</italic> (compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the stark difference in the behaviors of the <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>kni</italic> enhancer pairs necessitates measuring the absolute strengths of the different enhancers. Using absolute counts of mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Little et al., 2013</xref>), we calibrated our live fluorescence intensity traces to determine the average numbers of actively elongating Pol II transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>).

By contrast, individual <italic>kni</italic> enhancers produce an average of only ∼15 elongating Pol II complexes. We propose that the additive and super-additive behaviors of the two <italic>kni</italic> enhancers reflect their inherently ‘weaker’ activities as compared with the ‘stronger’ proximal hb enhancer (see ‘Discussion’). Note that, despite these differences, the overall output of transcripts and the overall rate of transcript production are essentially identical for all gap genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Little et al., 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07956.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Combined effect of multiple enhancers as a function of time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of the mean number of Pol II molecules transcribing per nucleus (N<sub>Pol II</sub>) for the different <italic>hb</italic> BAC transgenes and sum of individual enhancers at 27% EL for the duration of nc13.

Thus, both <italic>sna</italic> enhancers are strong and they exhibit strikingly sub-additive behaviors. In particular, the wild-type transgene displays significantly lower levels of expression than the mutant transgene containing only the shadow enhancer. Thus, strong enhancers not only fail to function additively but also interfere with one another, leading to sub-additive expression levels. This observation is also consistent with an earlier study, which suggested that the weaker proximal enhancer attenuates the activities of the stronger distal shadow enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dunipace et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to understand how multiple enhancers might function additively or sub-additively, we developed a mathematical model for dynamic enhancer–promoter interactions. In this model, a single enhancer interacts with its promoter via a forward rate k<sub>on</sub> and a backward rate k<sub>off</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The relative values of the forward and reverse rates determine the strength of the enhancer–promoter interaction by controlling what fraction of time the two are bound. When the enhancer and promoter interact, the promoter is in the ON state and initiates transcription at a rate r. This rate can be interpreted as the efficiency of enhancer-mediated transcriptional initiation upon enhancer–promoter interaction. Hence, the observable rate of mRNA production depends on the interaction strength given by the ratio k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub>, and the efficiency r with which transcription is initiated upon interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This scheme can be generalized to include two enhancers (A and B) interacting with the same promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’ for details of the mathematical analysis). In this model only one enhancer can interact with the promoter at a given time.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07956.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model of enhancer–promoter interactions and its predictions for mRNA production.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Minimal model of one enhancer engaging a promoter. k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> are the rates of promoter engagement and disengagement, respectively, and determine the interaction strength. r is the rate of mRNA production when the promoter is engaged and is a measure of the transcriptional efficiency.

We found that the removal of the proximal enhancer significantly augments expression, consistent with the occurrence of enhancer interference within the native locus. It is also conceivable that a single strong enhancer (e.g., <italic>hb</italic> proximal or <italic>sna</italic> distal) already mediates maximum binding and release of Pol II at the promoter, and additional enhancers are therefore unable to increase the levels of expression. However, the increase in the levels of <italic>sna</italic> expression upon removal of the primary enhancer is inconsistent with this explanation. Perhaps, the proximity of the proximal enhancer to the <italic>sna</italic> promoter gives it a ‘topological advantage’ in blocking access of the distal enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dunipace et al., 2011</xref>). The proximal enhancer might mediate less efficient transcription than the distal enhancer and thereby reduce the overall levels of expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We do not believe that this proposed difference is due to differential rates of Pol II elongation since published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>) and preliminary studies suggest that different enhancers and promoters lead to similar elongation rates (∼2 kb/min; T Fuyaka and M Levine, unpublished results). A nonexclusive alternative possibility is that deletion of the proximal enhancer removes associated <italic>sna</italic> repression elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">MacArthur et al., 2009</xref>), thereby augmenting the efficiency of the distal enhancer.</p><p>A minimal model of enhancer–promoter associations provides insights into potential mechanisms. In the parameter regime where such interactions are infrequent the two enhancers display additive behavior. However, in the regime of frequent interactions, enhancers compete for access to the promoter resulting in sub-additive behavior. Enhancer–promoter interaction parameters are likely to vary not only between different enhancers but also as the input patterns are modulated in time and space during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rushlow and Shvartsman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kok and Arnosti, 2015</xref>).</p><p>This simple model explains the switch from sub-additive to additive enhancer activities for <italic>hb</italic> and <italic>sna</italic>. However, in order to explain the super-additive behavior of the <italic>kni</italic> enhancers, it would be necessary to incorporate an additional state in the model, whereby both enhancers form an active complex with the same target promoter. Such a complex would have a more potent ability to initiate transcription than individual enhancer–promoter interactions.</p><p>In summary, we propose that enhancers operating at reduced activities (‘weak enhancers’) can function in an additive manner due to relatively infrequent interactions with their target promoters. In contrast, ‘strong’ enhancers might function sub-additively due to competition for the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). For <italic>hb</italic>, this switch between competitive and additive behavior occurs as the levels of Bicoid activator diminish in central regions where the posterior border of the anterior Hb domain is formed. Similarly, stress might reduce the performance of the <italic>sna</italic> enhancers to foster additive behavior under unfavorable conditions such as increases in temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Perry et al., 2010</xref>).

Histone-RFP slices were maximum projected for each time point. Nuclei were segmented using an object detection approach based on the Laplacian of Gaussian filter kernel. The segmented nuclei were then segmented and tracked over multiple nuclear cycles. Spots are detected in 3D and assigned to their respectively closest nucleus. When multiple spots are detected in the vicinity of a nucleus only the brightest one is kept. Spot intensity determination necessitates an estimate of the local fluorescent background for each particle. A 2D Gaussian fit to the peak plane of each particle column determines an offset, which is used as background estimator. The intensity is calculated by integrating the particle fluorescence over a circle with a radius of 6 pixels and then subtracting the estimated background. The imaging error is dominated by the error made in the fluorescent background estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It is possible to measure the average fluorescence per polymerase molecule for the <italic>hunchback enhancer &gt; MS2</italic> transgene with 24 MS2 repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>). The quantitative imaging for the BAC transgenes was conducted under the exact same imaging conditions on the same microscope. The BAC transgenes also possess 24 MS2 repeats. However, the specific sequence of the stem loops is slightly different as these repeats have been further optimized to facilitate molecular biology work with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hocine et al., 2013</xref>). Assuming that the MS2 sites are similarly saturated with MCP::GFP protein in both cases we can then use the average fluorescence per polymerase molecule calculated for the <italic>hunchback&gt;MS2</italic> transgene to calibrate the BAC fluorescent traces in terms of the absolute number of transcribing polymerases per fluorescent spot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mathematical modeling</title><p>We propose a general scheme for enhancer promoter interactions which makes it possible to model the effect of having multiple enhancers activating a single promoter. Here, the enhancer and promoter engage and disengage with one another with characteristic rate constants k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub>, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The ratio between k<sub>on</sub> and k<sub>off</sub> determines the strength of the promoter-enhancer interaction. The system can be found in two states. First, the promoter can be unoccupied. We denote the occupancy of this state with [Enhancer]. Second, the promoter and enhancer can be engaged with an occupancy [Enhancer·Promoter].

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Jim Kadonaga (Senior editor), Robb Krumlauf (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The general consensus of the reviewers is that this is a strong paper, detailing high quality work with wide general relevance and import to current questions in the field of gene regulation. The main conclusion, that enhancers can work together in a variety of ways and that these differences are linked to important factors such as enhancer strength, is a significant one that will likely have an impact on the field. The state-of-the-art technique used here to visualize transcription live in vivo, represents a major advance for the quantitative study of enhancer function and gene expression.</p><p>No major experimental revisions are required but comments and concerns were raised by all three reviewers primarily in two areas: (1) relevant considerations that are not discussed in the text, and (2) limitations of the very simple theoretical model.</p><p>There is real enthusiasm for seeing a revised manuscript that incorporates or rebuts the issues and specific points noted below. The collective view is that this will significantly enhance the general interest of the manuscript.</p><p>The points to consider in revision are:</p><p>1) The authors' interpretations depend on the assumption that 100% of the (relevant) regulatory activity at each gene locus is contained within the identified enhancers, and that flanking sequences left in the loci after deletion of an enhancer have no impact on gene expression. However, it is possible that sequences that flank enhancer A could interact positively with enhancer B when A is deleted, resulting in a “super-additive” outcome. Minimal versions of enhancers are often weaker than longer versions, so it is possible that not all of the 'primary' or 'shadow' enhancer activity has been removed by the deletions. I think that the authors' assumption is a reasonable one, but it might be safer to acknowledge that when they refer to a transgene containing the primary enhancer “alone” (Results, fifth paragraph), the deletion transgene actually contains much more non-coding sequence than that.</p><p>2) The idea that enhancer additivity is a function of enhancer strength is a very interesting and appealing one, and it is central to the paper. Using the existing data, is there a way to plot those two measurements against one another to illustrate this idea more directly?</p><p>3) I understand the theoretical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) as it is described in the text, but the authors make a point of saying that it explains enhancer interference, where “the combined activity of both enhancers is less than the sum of both enhancers” (at the end of Results), and I don't see any evidence of enhancer interference in the graph. Shouldn't the red line (2 enhancers) dip below the green line (1 enhancer), and shouldn't the blue line reach an expression ratio lower than 1?</p><p>4) On a closely related note, it isn't obvious to me how the model described here could ever drive the expression ratio below 1 by increasing enhancer-promoter engagement time, unless one enhancer were better at engaging the promoter but also worse at activating transcription when engaged. Wouldn't another state, such as non-productive enhancer-promoter interaction, need to be added to the model to achieve interference?</p><p>5) In 2011, Perry et al. showed that the knirps intronic enhancer drives an inappropriately wide expression pattern, one that is “normalized” when coupled with the proximal enhancer. This result suggests that the latter element has long-range repression type effects (or acts on the basal promoter in nuclei normally not expressing knirps to silence would-be inputs from the intron element). This data indicates that the authors' modeling of the enhancers as small activating units does not really conform to what we know about these elements. The authors do not discuss this prior finding, but presumably they have seen similar effects in their two photon system? The authors should test how a model involving such negative regulatory inputs would change their predictions. Admittedly this model would be more complex than the simple on/off model presented in this version of the manuscript, but we already know that this simpler presentation is insufficient.</p><p>6) In 2009, MacArthur and colleagues measured transcription factor occupancy in the embryo. In that study, these researchers found that the Snail transcriptional repressor directly binds to the Snail regulatory elements that are tested here. The expression of Snail would thus induce some sort of negative feedback, if the binding measured in that study is indeed active. In light of the findings from this manuscript, where the primary enhancer by itself is weaker, and the shadow enhancer by itself is able to drive gene expression at about wild-type levels, it appears that Snail self-inhibition may be compromising promoter activity to reduce the overall output. Previous studies of the related short-range repressor Knirps have shown that this class of repressor may induce local, heterochromatized-like chromatin status (Li and Arnosti, 2011), thus if Snail is doing the same thing, the activity of this proximal element should be considered as a mix of active “silencer”-like activity with “enhancer”-like action in the classic sense. A similar local silencing action by parts of the knirps proximal element would explain the Perry results.</p><p>7) The authors should address whether differences in elongation rates (which may be unlinked to promoter firing) would affect their estimations of overall enhancer activity. The genes tested here are very similar, but not identical – the lambda DNA filler for knirps or the unique 5' and 3' UTRs may have differential elongation potential. The overall conclusions about enhancer (non) additivity would still hold in any event.</p><p>8) Authors state that hb enhancers do not function in additive fashion in anterior regions of the embryo (are subadditive). It is true, but by looking at the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figure 2A–B and 3A, I</xref> would say that the transcriptional output of the shadow enhancer deletion overlaps pretty well with the wt, suggesting that hb shadow enhancer does not provide much of a contribution to transcription, at least in the anterior part of the embryo, which perhaps could be stated explicitly.</p><p>9) Clearly the theoretical model does not account for the superadditive enhancer behavior, as seen for kni enhancers (which authors acknowledge in the discussion). Nonetheless, existence of the superadditive behavior indicates that a central assumption of the model – that a single enhancer engages the promoter at the time – is probably incorrect at least at a subset of loci. Could authors incorporate an additional state to their model accounting for the possibility of multiple enhancer interactions? How would that affect predictions of their model? What do authors think may determine competitive vs cooperative enhancer engagement with the promoter?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07956.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors' interpretations depend on the assumption that 100% of the (relevant) regulatory activity at each gene locus is contained within the identified enhancers, and that flanking sequences left in the loci after deletion of an enhancer have no impact on gene expression.

We have added a new paragraph in the Results to address this important issue. The enhancer deletions are actually sequence substitutions, as we now describe in the revised Results. Every effort was made to replace all of the critical binding sites identified in previous ChIP-Seq assays. We nonetheless concede the possibility that critical elements are left intact. However, new data are included to show that any such sequences are not sufficient to mediate activation. For example, “deletions” of both the 5’ and intronic enhancers within the kni locus completely abolish expression of the corresponding transgene in the presumptive abdomen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The idea that enhancer additivity is a function of enhancer strength is a very interesting and appealing one, and it is central to the paper.

The revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows how the combined activity of the two enhancers varies as a function of the sum of their individual activities.

Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> was also revised to show how two enhancers are less than the sum of their individual contributions in the regime of high rates of mRNA production.</p><p><italic>4) On a closely related note, it isn't obvious to me how the model described here could ever drive the expression ratio below 1 by increasing enhancer-promoter engagement time, unless one enhancer were better at engaging the promoter but also worse at activating transcription when engaged.

Yes, this is an excellent point. The text has been revised to include this possibility. Moreover, we have plotted how mRNAs levels change with enhancer-promoter engagement times and different enhancer strengths. When one enhancer is weak and the other strong there is decreased mRNA synthesis as the frequency of engagement by the weak enhancer goes up.</p><p>We agree with the referee that this is probably the case for snail, since the shadow enhancer is stronger than the proximal enhancer.

This is a valid point and we have revised the text to consider this possibility and now include the MacArthur et al. 2009 citation.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should address whether differences in elongation rates (which may be unlinked to promoter firing) would affect their estimations of overall enhancer activity. The genes tested here are very similar, but not identical – the lambda DNA filler for knirps or the unique 5' and 3' UTRs may have differential elongation potential. The overall conclusions about enhancer (non) additivity would still hold in any event</italic>.</p><p>We were asked whether different Pol II elongation rates might complicate our interpretations. The text has been revised to address this possibility, and we also cite recent and unpublished evidence that many different enhancer-promoter combinations produce the same rate of elongation, approximately 30 nt/s.</p><p><italic>8) Authors state that hb enhancers do not function in additive fashion in anterior regions of the embryo (are subadditive). It is true, but by looking at the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figure 2A–B and 3A, I</italic></xref> <italic>would say that the transcriptional output of the shadow enhancer deletion overlaps pretty well with the wt, suggesting that hb shadow enhancer does not provide much of a contribution to transcription, at least in the anterior part of the embryo, which perhaps could be stated explicitly</italic>.</p><p>We were asked to clarify that removal of the <italic>hb</italic> shadow enhancer has no effect on the levels of transcription in anterior regions of the embryo. This is now done in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>9) Clearly the theoretical model does not account for the superadditive enhancer behavior, as seen for kni enhancers (which authors acknowledge in the discussion). Nonetheless, existence of the superadditive behavior indicates that a central assumption of the model – that a single enhancer engages the promoter at the time – is probably incorrect at least at a subset of loci. Could authors incorporate an additional state to their model accounting for the possibility of multiple enhancer interactions? How would that affect predictions of their model? What do authors think may determine competitive vs cooperative enhancer engagement with the promoter</italic>?</p><p>It was noted that our model fails to explain the super-additive behavior of the knirps enhancers during early stages of nc 14. We really do not have a good explanation for super-additivity. During the later stages of nc 14, the two enhancers function in a simple additive fashion, and this behavior is captured by our model. At earlier stages it would appear that the interaction of one enhancer facilitates the interaction of the other enhancer. This possibility is clearly stated in the Discussion. However, we do not know enough about this type of enhancer cooperativity to formulate a reasonable model. Any such effort would be wildly speculative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
