results in the novel estimation of the range of iridescent colors from the fossilized melanosome type and organization preserved in the elongate head crest feathers of a new Cretaceous enantiornithine bird. The densely packed rod-like melanosomes are estimated to have yielded from red to deep blue iridescent coloration of the head feathers. The shape and density of these melanosomes also may have further increased the feather’s structural strength. This occurrence on a likely male individual is highly suggestive of both a signaling function of the iridescent crest and a potential behavioral role in adjusting the angle of light incidence to control the display of this iridescent structural coloration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fossil</kwd><kwd>birds</kwd><kwd>feather</kwd><kwd>color</kwd><kwd>crest</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42288201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhonghe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024YFF0807603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>NSFC Fund for Excellent Young Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KZ 37110101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Mao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>42472047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhiheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>37110101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Mao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024YFF0807602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>Yanhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The combination of histological and microscopic techniques, along with the initial application of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling to a fossil feather, has resulted in the first recovery of specific iridescent color patterns.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The recognition and study of melanosomes in fossil feathers of non-avialan dinosaurs and birds has added greater complexity to the pattern of their diversity and macroevolution, demonstrating the intertwined evolution of coloration with feather functions across display, thermoregulation, and other uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terrill and Shultz, 2023</xref>). This linkage among colors, structures, and functions early in feather evolution extends even to convergence in iridescent feathers among non-avialan theropods, and it is highly suggestive of commonalities shared among stem and crown birds in terms of their use of colored pigments for camouflage, structural strength, and display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foth and Rauhut, 2020</xref>). In a comparative setting with the melanosome feather coloration of living birds, workers have endeavored to reconstruct the colors of fossil feathers using quantitative means focused predominantly on melanosome geometry and density, and the results point to the fossilized melanosomes having produced patterns of black, brown, rufous, gray, and other colors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vinther et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peteya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benton et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the specific shape and arrangement of some fossilized feather melanosomes derived from both non-avialan theropod dinosaurs and birds are similar to those required for producing structurally based iridescent feather coloration in living birds, a case of independent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stoddard and Prum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Feathers serve multiple functions in birds from comprising an insulatory epidermal layer to forming aerodynamic flight surfaces, and as structures for the containment and display of various pigments. Living birds exhibit diverse feather morphologies and colors, and the significant diversity of known fossil feathers, along with their preserved pigments, points to their past use for camouflage, as well as display and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Prum, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foth and Rauhut, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terrill and Shultz, 2023</xref>). While the display of most colored feathers is passive and available to any viewer, birds can behaviorally control their signaling through: the erection of feathered ornaments such as the head crest in hoopoes (<italic>Upupa</italic>) or peacock (<italic>Pavo</italic>) tails; the exposure of normally hidden brightly colored crown feathers as in kinglets (<italic>Regulus</italic>); and even the refined control of the black and iridescent coloration in birds such as hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and birds of paradise (Paradisaeidae; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stoddard et al., 2020</xref>). This great variation in structural or iridescent colors results from differences in pigments, their organization, and other structural modifications. For example, the variety of mixed structural colors present in a peacock feather is achieved through changes in the spacing in the keratinous matrix and melanosome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zi et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to the normal range of spectral coloration, hummingbirds can see non-spectral colors as well, and their utility is supported by vision perception experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stoddard et al., 2020</xref>). The interplay of bird of paradise feather coloration and their vision similarly indicates coordination of their mating displays with spectral properties through the avian visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilts et al., 2014</xref>). Individual birds actively control the signaling functions of their feathers with feathers or ornaments hidden/displayed or even the color presented (as dark/black vs. vibrant/iridescent) being consciously restricted or directed to particular viewers such as potential mates or rivals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilts et al., 2014</xref>) .</p><p>Fossilized feathers typically have been evaluated within two-dimensional surface views, limiting the understanding of their overall ultrastructure and perhaps their true coloration. As a step forward in our reconstruction of the structure and function (color display) of early bird feathers, we examined the unique head-crest feathers of a well-preserved specimen (Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, IVPP V26899) of the Early Cretaceous (~120 Ma) enantiornithine <italic>Shangyang</italic> sp. from the Jiufotang Formation of northeastern China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This fossil preserves a diverse feather assemblage across the body with dense contour feathers, flight remiges, and two rachis-dominated tail feathers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among its diverse feather morphologies, this specimen also displays a strikingly enlarged feathered crest on the head that uniquely extends from the caudal end of the skull to a position rostral to the nasal bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For our study, we sampled a long isolated mature feather that is displaced from the caudal part of the crest, as well as three feather fragments extracted from the in-situ position of the head crest.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Digital rendering, photography, and line drawing of the enantiornithine fossil specimen (<italic>Shanyang</italic> sp., IVPP V26899) (<bold>a</bold>), (<bold>c</bold>), (<bold>d</bold>) - dorsal; (<bold>b</bold>) - ventral view showing the major skeletal elements.</title><p>The feather extracted from the crown is labeled as a feather sample (<bold>c</bold>).

Differing from previous statistical reconstructions of fossil color that measured melanosome aspect ratios, our new approach takes the three-dimensional shape and packing patterns of melanosomes, as well as the keratinous matrix, into consideration. With these novel modeling approaches, a more accurate coloration estimation was produced for its crest feather.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the new fossil, head crest feathers were selected from the caudal side of the head and sectioned using ultrathin serial sectioning. The overall shape of the sampled crest feather is well-preserved and comprised of elongate and relatively wide barbs. The dominant barb length is proportionally longer than the feather barb examined from the neck and head region of <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foth, 2012</xref>). The feather is different from the bilaterally symmetric plumulaceous feathers of living birds, and we define it as a barb-dominant feather, since most of the exposed feather tissue is composed of long barbs with a very short and thick calamus. It is estimated to correlate with evolutionary stage II and IIIa of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prum and Brush, 2002</xref>, similar to the intermediate feather type proposed as found in an amber fossil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Perrichot et al., 2008</xref>). The new feather described here is distinct from the amber feather in showing an asymmetric shape, radically diverging toward one side (caudal side), and is much larger in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Perrichot et al., 2008</xref>). There are dense clusters inside the barbs as seen from images of both SEM and TEM.</p><p>Ultrathin histological sectioning and application of SEM and S/TEM imaging of the fossil feather samples (see Appendix  1) resulted in the identification of partially interlinked melanosomes with a derived asymmetric packing pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The long axial crack in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> may represent the surface of the barbs, resembling a crack formed in maturation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Those melanosome clusters are present and concentrated mostly within the barbs rather than in the barbules of extant bird feathers based on similar size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The thickness of the complete feather barb with filled melanosomes (preserved) is around 10 µm, which is much greater than the typical diameter of known barbules, but similar to barbs in extant birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freyer et al., 2021</xref>). The three-dimensionally packed melanosomes were studied in both cross and nearly longitudinal sections within the dark-colored barbs (one in the middle of the barbs and another in the lateral side of the feather block, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>).</p><p>Hooks are commonly observed on the oval-shaped melanosomes in cross-sectional views, with two dominant types identified on the dorsal and ventral sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>, red arrows). These hooks are deflected in opposing directions, linking melanosomes from different arrays (dorsal-ventral) together. The major axis (y) of the oval-shaped melanosomes (mean = 283 nm) is oriented toward the left side in cross-section, while the shorter axis (x) measures approximately 186 nm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). In oblique or near-longitudinal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>), the hooked structures’ connections to the distal and proximal sides of neighboring melanosomes are clearly visible (blue arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). The mean long axis (z) of the melanosomes is approximately 1774 nm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). A similar pattern occurs in two additional regions of interest within the same feather (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although the smaller proximal hooks in these sections are less distinct, this may reflect developmental variation during melanosome formation along the feather barb. Significantly smaller hooks were also observed in cross-sections of in-situ feather barbs from the anterior side of the feather crest sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Based on these observations, we propose that the hooked structures—particularly those on the dorsal, ventral, proximal, and distal sides of the melanosomes—enhance the structural integrity of the barb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). However, these features may be teratological and unique to this individual, as no similar structures have been reported in other species. These hooks may stabilize the stacked melanosome rods and contribute to increased barb dimensions, such as diameter and length. The sections exhibit modified (or asymmetric) hexagonally packed melanosomes with the presence of extra hooked linkages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d and e–f</xref>). The long rod-like melanosomes are different from all other known feather melanosomes from both extant and extinct taxa in having some extra hooks and an oblique ellipse shape in cross and longitudinal sections of individual melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durrer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). The asymmetric packing of the melanosomes (the major axis leans leftward in cross section) played a major role in the reduction of fossilized keratinous matrix within the barbs, which may correspond to a novel structural coloration in this extinct bird. The close-packed hexagonal melanosome pattern found in extant avian feathers yields rounded melanosome outlines in contrast to the oval-shaped melanosomes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, x&lt;y) in the perpendicular section here. The asymmetric compact hexagonal packing (ACHP) of the melanosomes is different from the known pattern of melanosomes formed in the structure of barbules among extant birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliason and Shawkey, 2012</xref>), which has been seen as a regular hexagonal organization. The packing of the melanosomes in an asymmetric pattern, on the microscopic level, might be related to the asymmetrical path of the barb extension direction observed at the macroscopic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).</p><p>In the computational (FDTD) simulation, when light is incident at a small angle (≤30°, both s- and p-polarized) in the X-Y plane, no evident reflection peak was found in the visible spectrum, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> (e.g. when a viewer observes at this angle, the light is almost completely absorbed, and the crest feather would have a darkened appearance). As the incident angle varies from 40° to 70°, the wavelength corresponding to the reflection peak shifts from 687 nm to 475 nm, and the color of the reflection peak gradually changes from red to deep blue (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> clearly shows how the resulting color varies with the angle of incidence). From the perspective of optical modeling, the generation of iridescent color (reflection peaks in the visible spectrum) is caused by the constructive interference between scattered light produced by these uniquely shaped melanosomes that are compactly arranged in the barbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vinther et al., 2010</xref>). Between blue and red, reflection peaks of green and yellow also are present, corresponding to the wavelengths of 512 nm and 578 nm respectively. It is worth noting that in the case of both p- and s-polarized incident light, the positions of the reflection peaks are nearly identical, with only a slight difference in peak reflectance. Therefore, the three-dimensional multilayer nanostructure model is somehow equivalent to one-dimensional multilayer biphotonic crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saranathan et al., 2012</xref>). In summary, the crest feather of the Cretaceous enantiornithine shows a strikingly angle-dependent and iridescent coloration pattern. When we consider the shrinkage effect on melanosomes demonstrated experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>) and various distances between melanosomes resulting from compression effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), our additional FDTD modeling shows a similar reflection spectrum with a narrower bandwidth of the color peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>FDTD modeling results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative multilayer melanosome model; (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic drawing of the reflectance calculation setup of the feather barb.

Using previous conventional approaches alone, we would have classified this feather crest simply as black or close to iridescent based on its melanosome aspect ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nordén et al., 2021</xref>). The recognition of overall iridescence links to a commonly found extant bird color range only known previously from the platelet-shaped dinosaurian melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2018</xref>) and a few fossil feathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nordén et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nordén et al., 2021</xref>). The independent evolution of overall iridescence, similar to that found in living birds, was reconstructed here based on a novel array of melanosomes in a feather barb in an extinct non-crown group bird (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nordén et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yoshioka and Akiyama, 2021</xref>). The occurrence of iridescent structural coloration in an enlarged head crest on this ancient bird is similar to structures present across many living birds that employ iridescence for intimidation, signaling, and particularly for mate attraction or intraspecific territorial defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Terrill and Shultz, 2023</xref>). Given that this individual bird likely was a male based on the occurrence of paired rachis dominant tail feathers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the vibrant coloration on a prominent feathered crest suggests that sexual selection may have long played an important role in avialan (feather) macroevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foth, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The vibrant color and its presence on an enlarged feather crest likely are interlinked and probably indicate an evolutionary and selective relationship among color, feather position, and feather morphology/size.</p><p>Our discovery of new melanosome shapes and networks suggests that birds evolved previously unrecognized patterns of color production outside of the limits present among crown group birds. Additionally, these pigments and their dense organization may have made the foundation of the feather darker and allowed for a more intense or vibrant iridescent coloration, a potential relationship that is understudied among living birds. While the interrelationship between melanin content in feathers and increases in structural strength have long been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burtt, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burtt and Ichida, 2004</xref>), perhaps the increased density of melanosomes in this fossil feather barbs added even more structural strength to the feathered crest of this bird in compromise for its lack of a dominant rachis. Additionally, the interlocking hooks among the melanosomes might have aided individual feather barb in resisting shear forces. The modified closely packed melanosome arrays reconstructed here also are potentially advantageous in increasing barb structural integrity and stability in the long barb ramus and likely affected the visualized spectrum during the display of iridescent coloration. We cannot completely rule out the increased melanosome density in the fossil feather as the result of taphonomy. Size reduction in melanosomes was found previously in a simulation experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>), but such a reduction is very unlikely to result in the highly organized and consistent melanosome packing present here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). To test the potential impact of melanosome shrinkage and potential taphonomic changes to their spacing, we conducted an additional analysis (See Appendix 1), and the results yield similar iridescent spectral peaks as the original setting.</p><p>Since the iridescent coloration of living birds is produced by the accumulation of melanosomes mostly positioned in barbules, the identified fossil barbs filled with melanosomes represent a unique phenotype related to an early feather evolutionary and developmental stage. Given the lack of barbules in most early primitive feather forms (or filamentary structures) in non-avialan dinosaurs and pterosaurs, the positioning of melanosomes in barbs might be a plesiomorphic feature for ornithodirans broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cincotta et al., 2022</xref>). With different destinations of melanosome transport during feather formation, the pattern recovered here suggests fundamental differences in feather pigmentation among Cretaceous stem taxa as compared to crown birds. The melanosome-filled barbs evolved earlier in feather evolution before the later appearance of innovations such as the presence of a stiff rachis and colorful barbules observed across living feathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yu et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>A focus on the two-dimensional examination of fossil feathers has uncovered a large number of black or dark melanosomes across many early birds and feathered theropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). However, our three-dimensional study of a fossilized Jehol feather specimen demonstrates that ultra-histological detail and spatial relationships can be preserved at the microscopic level. Importantly, our discovery suggests that reexamination of previously published ‘black’ pigmented fossil feathers might uncover a wider occurrence of ‘surprising’ iridescence and structural coloration among these early birds and non-avialan taxa. Such discoveries will aid in documenting both independent and convergent evolutionary pathways in the history of birds. This research further demonstrates that Jehol fossil feather tissue can be treated as (microscopically) three-dimensional specimens allowing for the collection of valuable comparative data and application of comparative analytical techniques that facilitate a better understanding of early feather evolution and function.</p><p>Here, we recovered iridescent coloration in fossil bird feathers that was produced by three-dimensional melanosome packing patterns. This discovery dramatically expands the range of fossil bird coloration space, and this diversity in feather coloration in an early bird fits well with its forested environment, as proposed by the coeval fossil plant community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). Tropical forest environments are accompanied by colorful flowering plants and green leaves, and the structural color of this feathered crest is advantageous for bird signaling as well. Forested environments (flowers, leaves, light, and shadow) can be advantageous for birds and their signaling as more colorful feathers are found today in tropical regions as demonstrated among extant vibrant coloration of passeriform birds in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooney et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fossil material</title><p>The referred specimen of the enantiornithine bird <italic>Shangyang</italic> sp.

First, we examined the fossil feathers with light microscopy and SEM prior to the embedding process to make sure the barbs were aligned correctly in the epoxy resin. Meanwhile, the small part of the extracted feather sample was aligned, using the microscope (Leica UC 7), into a proper position during the embedding and stage trimming process. The attention to feather direction was performed to assure that the barb major extension direction was aligned with the long axis of the bullet-shaped mold (embedding capsule). We also checked the position of the feather fragment in the SPI-Pon 812 during embedding and polymerization. The sliced section should be precise enough to acquire the desired images and information after planning and optimization of each step described above, and before the sectioning.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Inan and Marshall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sullivan, 2013</xref>) was used to simulate the visualization of light propagation on the crest feather with regular arrangements of melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The FDTD method allows explicit simulation of light interaction with particular-shaped melanosomes by numerically solving Maxwell’s equation in the time domain. The construction of a three-dimensional nanostructure model is based on our characterized data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>), and detailed modeling steps are included in Appendix 1. The dispersion of the complex refractive index that was applied in our simulation is described and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>. In order to mimic real visual conditions, several variables were considered during the simulation, including angle of light incidence in two orthogonal incident planes (X-Y and Y-Z plane; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and polarization state (s- and p-polarized). Usually, p-polarized light is understood to have an electric field direction parallel to the plane of incidence, and s-polarized light has the electric field oriented perpendicular to the incident plane. Reflectance spectra are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–d</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Caveats about potential taphonomic melanosome changes</title><p>The simulated colors here are robust even when taking potential taphonomic changes into consideration. The chance that the highly organized and anatomically oriented nanoscale pattern formed here is the result of geological compression or pressure during fossilization and diagenesis is quite low, and such structures are absent or unseen among known taphonomic artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). At present, we cannot exclude the possibility that shear stress could result in the observed asymmetric packing of melanosomes. However, that pattern has not been reported in any known experiment or geological process of fossilization including those related to Jehol bird or non-avialan dinosaur fossils. Therefore, we suggest the pattern we obtained here represents original biological structures. Given experimental observations of melanosome shrinkage at high pressures and temperatures (~10% shrinkage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McNamara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), we also completed additional modeling with the fossil melanosomes enlarged (110%, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3 app1table4">Appendix 1—Tables 3 and 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) along with the fossilized keratinous cortex and matrix. This additional modeling resulted in all of the spectral peaks present in the original modeling being recovered. Therefore, our results are robust even when considering known potential taphonomic artifacts, and both approaches produce similar results with the red-to-blue iridescent coloration having been present in the crown feather (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-103628-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are provided in the manuscript and the Appendix.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Yang JM, Ma JB, Wen XL, and Li DS for technical assistance in sampling and ultrathin sectioning and STEM imaging; Hou YM and Yin PF for assistance with micro-CT scanning of the specimen; Gao W for photography; and Xu Y for the artistic reconstruction.

For example, the presence of fused premaxillae along their entire length, a nearly square sternal outline, and the elongate fibula help to diagnose the fossil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang and Zhou, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The intermetacarpal space between the major and minor metacarpals is quite narrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The minor metacarpal is slightly curved and extends distal to the major metacarpal. The main part of the sternum has a square outline, and the lateral trabecula extends caudally, expanding into a large triangular plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The midline projection of the sternum is stout and extends about the same length as the lateral trabecular process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The fibula is long, being over two-thirds of the length of the tibiotarsus.

Those enantiornithine fossils from the Jehol Group preserve a surprising variety of morphological disparity and diversity not only in their skeletons, but also in their striking plumages across their limbs, heads, and tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Zhou, 2017</xref>). Enantiornithine feather assemblages are represented not only by the densely distributed contour and down feathers that covered their whole bodies that functioned largely in insulation, but also by atypical feather morphologies on their heads and other modifications like elongated rectrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foth and Rauhut, 2020</xref>). This morphological diversity across enantiornithine plumages suggests that they played a major role in display, signaling, and sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Those hypothesized functions are reinforced by the preservation of ancient melanosome pigments in the microstructure of the fossil feathers that would have resulted in a variety of colors, demonstrating the long evolutionary history of feather coloration in the clade.</p><p>The well-developed preserved integumental structures of IVPP V26899 are mainly pigmented in a currently black-brown color within the white-gray matrix, distributed surrounding the whole body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This plumage not only includes elongate pennaceous flight feathers associated with its forearm, but also a dense covering of contour feathers (including down feathers) distributed along the forehead, cranium, neck, and caudal vertebral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The feathered crest attached to the forehead and cranium of the new specimen is quite darkly pigmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The erect feather bundles show a striking pattern with gradually increasing shaft (or barb) length towards the caudal end of the skull. The highly projected contour feathers approach the occipital region of the skull, forming a triangular crest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the shallow impressions of the paired rectrices are ribbon-like and associated with the pygostyle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The long pennaceous flight feathers (or remiges) are well developed and articulated with the forelimbs, including long primaries and secondaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The long and well-developed feather crest covers most of the dorsal surface of the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The crown (or crest) feather barbs (or shaft) gradually increase in length and reach their maximum lengths near the caudal part of the skull. The shaft of the longest crest feather is about 2 cm, even longer than the dorsoventral height of the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The overall shape of the crown feathers forms a triangular crest that is projected dorsally and caudally. The rostral end of the feathered tract extends rostrally down the forehead along the premaxillae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The crest feathers on the caudal side are longer than the rostral ones. They are highly projected on the parietal region, and a silt-like fissure appears to be present between the feathered bundles attached to the frontal and the parietal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The long contour feathers extending from the caudal part of the head are composed of multiple slightly curved barbs, shortly branching off from the calamus at its base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Densely packed clusters that comprised elongate oval-shaped melanosomes are visible in the surface and the crack region of the feather barbs when examined with the SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>Description of skeletal anatomy</title><p>The entire specimen (IVPP V26899) was compressed largely dorsoventrally, except for the laterally preserved skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The skull is proportionally long, exceeding the length of the humerus. There are three or four conical-shaped teeth present on the premaxillae, and six teeth on the maxillae. At least eight alveolar pits are recognized on the dentary bone, indicating missing teeth. The dorsal surfaces of premaxillae are straight, and a T-shaped lacrimal bone is present. The external narial opening is silt-like, and the antorbital fenestra has a triangular outline. The frontal bones are crushed laterally, with the left and right sides appearing to be fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>There are at least eight or nine cervical vertebrae, and they are all exposed in ventral view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lateral edge of the coracoid is expanded slightly. The length of the hypocleidium is about the same length as that of the furcular rami. The lateral trabecula of the sternum is caudally expanded into a triangular process. The humerus has a dorsal supracondylar process. The alular metacarpal (cmI) is fused with the major and minor metacarpals proximally, but distally the two longer metacarpals are separate. The proximal part of the left scapula appears to be broken and incompletely fused during healing from a wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The length of the first digit is about half of the length of the carpometacarpus. The total length of the forelimb (humerus +carpometacarpus + manual digit) is shorter than that of the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p><p>The distal end of the fused pubis bears a booted process. The pygostyle is distally tapered, forming a spear shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ilium has a dorsal bulge near its middle portion. The fibula is comparatively longer than that of other enantiornithines, reaching over two-thirds of the tibiotarsus length. Proximally, metatarsals II-IV are fused as in other enantiornithines. Metatarsal III is the longest among metatarsals II-IV, with metatarsal IV slightly shorter than metatarsal II. The ungual (claw) size is large in all four pedal digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the ungual lengths in digits I and II are even longer than those of the respective penultimate phalanges.</p><p>Ground sections were acquired from the right side of the femur to assess the osteo-histological features of the bone and its ontogenetic stage. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, long, flat-shaped lacunae are present widely and densely packed throughout the major part of the bone section. Very few secondary osteocytes are present, and parallel-fibered bone tissue is underdeveloped. The flattened osteocyte lacunae dominate the cellular shape, with observable vascular canals connecting different lacunae. Overall, the osteo-histology indicates that the bird was still in an active growth stage at the time of death, suggesting it was in its sub-adult growth phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13"><title>Microscopic methods and ultrastructural morphology of the feather tissue</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13-1"><title>Ultrathin sections: preparation and results</title><p>We examined two different micron-sized spots for the feather fragment extracted from the new specimen IVPP V26899 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).

All of those slices were picked up consecutively with 3–5 serially numbered copper grids with carbon film.</p><p>High-resolution TEM/STEM (Transmission Electron Microscope/Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy) imaging of the well-selected spots of sampled feathers was used to investigate the ultrastructure regarding melanosome geometry and keratinous tissues in the thin sections in different views. Our new microscopic data strongly suggests that soft tissue can be preserved well, and it was revealed further in TEM examination. The detailed features revealed here indicate an exceptional preservation of three-dimensional soft tissues in the slab fossil. Our measurements of the thickness of the feather tissue measured from the top view of the section block are about 10–30 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (b-d).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13-2"><title>Crest feather samples</title><p>The long crest feather was sectioned in two directions with one series made on the side of a barb longitudinally and another series made across the cross section of the central barb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The three-dimensional (3-D) packing of the melanosomes was discerned in both the cross- and longitudinal views, with full details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The unique asymmetric-hexagonal-packing (AHP) discovered here defines a dense stack of melanosome assemblage array, with additional hooked linkages among the neighboring melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The novel shapes and packing of the melanosomes played a major role in the reduction of air or keratinous space within the barb, and this may correspond to the unique type of structural coloration modeled below. The tiny hooks identified here in some areas, as extra connections, linked the ‘head’ and ‘tail’ portions of the sausage-like melanosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). They may have further increased the abrasion resistance of the barbs. The modified sausage-like melanosomes with novel packing have not been reported from any feathers of extant or extinct birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durrer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Differing from the normal compact hexagonal packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durrer, 1986</xref>), the arrangement of these melanosomes appears to be rotated toward the right-lateral side of the feather barb, major axis of the melanosomes lean leftward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This novel packing could be acquired in the enantiornithine feather through a modification of the simple rodlet-shaped melanosomes previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the middle portion, we sectioned two additional positions from more proximal sides of the feather barbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) to validate the melanosome packing. As expected, very dense melanosomes were observed. The hooked structures are less clearly defined because of their smaller size or developmental immaturity. However, the asymmetric packing is similarly present, with the melanosome on the right side packed over the melanosome on the left (i.e., longer axis leans toward left in cross section view). As we argued in the main text, this structure in melanosome hooks may help increase the dimension of the barb size, allowing it to grow thicker and enhancing the structural integrity of the barb. The same pattern also is observed in the cranial barbs sampled from the anterior crest feather, which has a much shorter length at the front of the head (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13-3"><title>FIB-SEM 3D tomography</title><p>The milled block was extracted from the central portion of the long crest feather sample using a Helios 5 CX Dual-Beam system at the IVPP.

The nanomanipulator (Easylift) attached to the sampled block for lift-out and attached to a TEM copper grid for further imaging. The sample was milled 20 nm for each time along the ‘z’ axis and imaged serially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The major barbs in the middle appear to be slightly larger and thicker in diameter than the neighboring barbs. No evidence of a rachis or barbules was found in the cross section, meaning that the branched barbs are the major components of the feather tissue preserved. The largest diameter of a barb appears to be over 10 µm, exceeding the diameter of most barbules in living feathers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the overall evidence of the morphology and microscopic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig3s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>), we interpret the feather as being an asymmetric downy barb-composed feather, without a stiff central shaft and distal branched barbules.

Additionally, the numerical simulation results related to the angle-, polarization-, and wavelength-dependent reflectance spectrum were obtained. In the simulation, novel hexagonal-packed particular-shaped melanosomes were modeled, and in particular, hexagonally arranged oval-shaped (ellipsoidal) microstructures were employed to simulate the derived arrangement of sausage-like melanosomes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>. The crown feather model consists of multiple layers of particular-shaped melanosomes and keratin wrapped around them (10 layers, each layer contains 10 melanosomes) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>. The lengths of semi-axes of the triaxial ellipsoid are assigned according to the statistics of the SEM images (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>).

Specifically, the ellipsoidal melanosomes are arranged in the simulation region so that some of the adjacent melanosomes were in contact with each other to simulate the hooked linkages as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>. The incident light was set accordingly to the s- and p-polarized of two orthogonal incident planes (X-Y and Y-Z plane), respectively.

They show one specimen of Confuciusornis with short feathers (which appears to be a unique feature of this species, possibly related to the fact it is beaked) but what about the more primitive Eoconfuciusornis, a referred specimen of which superficially has an enormous &quot;crest&quot; (Zheng et al 2017), as does Changchengornis (Ji et al 1999). Regardless, it would make more sense compare this new specimen to other enantiornithines. Although limited by the preservation of body feathers, which is not all that common, the following published enantiornithines also exhibit a &quot;crest&quot;: bohaiornithid indet. (Peteya et al 2017); Brevirostruavis (Li et al 2021); Dapingfangornis (Li et al 2006); Eoenantiornis (Zhou et al 2005); Grabauornis (Dalsatt etal 2014); Junornis (Liu et al 2017); Longirostravis (Hou etal 2004); Monoenantiornis (Hu &amp; O'Connor 2016); Neobohaiornis (Shen etal 2024); Orienantiornis (Liu etal 2019); Parabohaironis (Wang 2023); Parapengornis (Hu etal 2015); Paraprotopteryx (Zheng et al 2007); and every specimen of Protopteryx. In fact, every single published enantiornithine that preserves any feathering on the head has the feathers preserved perpendicular to the bone (in fact, the body feathers on all parts of the bed are splayed at a right angle to the bone due to compression), as shown in the confuciuornis specimen image provided by the authors. Since it is highly improbable they all had crests, the authors have no justification for the interpretation that this new specimen was crested. This does not mean that the feathers were not iridescent or take away from the novel methods these authors have used to explore preserved feathers.</p><p>(2) Yes, this is possible, but see above for the very strong argument against interpretation of these feathers as forming a crest.</p><p>(3) This just further makes the point that the isolated feather is not likely from the head. Since the neck feathers are missing, it is more likely that it is these feathers that have been disarticulated (and sampled) from the neck region rather than from the very complete looking head feathers; this has significant implications with regards to the birds colour pattern.</p><p>(4) Thank you for acknowledging taphonomy.</p><p>(5) An interesting hypothesis and one I look forward to seeing explored in the future.</p><p>(6) Since the compression is in a single direction, in fact it is not reasonable to assume that distortion would be random. One might predict similar distortion, as with the feathers (spread out from the bone at a 90° angle) and bone (crushed), which are all compressed in a single direction. However, I agree that such a consistent discovery suggests it is not an artifact of preservation, and only further studies will elucidate this</p><p>(7) I still fail to detect this hexagonal pattern - could machine learning be used to quantify this pattern? The random arrangement of white arrows does little to clarify the authors interpretations.</p><p>(8) Great to see additional sampling</p><p>(9) Thank you for the explanation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103628.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the original colour of a fossil feather from the crest of a 125-million-year-old enantiornithine bird.

Otherwise, it would seem that a large number of Jehol birds have crests that extend not only along the head but the neck and hindlimb. It is more parsimonious to interpret this as compression as has been demonstrated using actuopaleontology (Foth 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we respectfully acknowledge the reviewer’s interpretation.</p><p>However, the new specimen we report here is distinct as preserved from <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> (Foth 2011), which belongs to a different clade and exhibits a differently preserved feather crest of a different shape compared to the species described in this study. Figure 3a Foth 2011, Paläontologische Zeitschrift；the cervical feather is much longer than feather from head region in the specimen the referee talked about; It is quite incompletely preserved and much shorter in proportional length (relative to the skull) than the specimen we sampled (see picture below).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Our new specimen with well-preserved and the feather crest were interpretated as the originally shaped；the cervical feather is largely absent or very short.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103628-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the new specimen there is a large feather crest that gradually extends from the cranial region of the fossil bird, rather than the cervical region, as observed in the previously proposed <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> crest. The feather crest extends in a consistent direction (caudodistally), and the feathers in the head region of the bird are exceptionally well-preserved, retaining their original shape. The feathers are measured about 1- 2cm at their longest barb. Feathers in the neck are much shorter (see <italic>Confuciusornis</italic> picture above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The primitive morphology of the feather with their long and possibly not interlocking barbs also questions the ability of such feathers to be erected without geologic compression.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the specimen must have undergone some degree of compression during diagenesis and fossilization. Given that the rachis itself is already sufficiently thick (that the ligaments everting a crest would attach to), we conclude that it had the structural integrity to remain erect on the skull.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The feather is not in situ and therefore there is no way to demonstrate unequivocally that it is indeed from the head (it could just as easily be a neck feather)</p></disp-quote><p>We conclude that it belongs to the head based on the similar suture, overall length, and its close position to the caudal part of the head. There are no similar types of feathers nearby, such as those found on the neck or other areas, which is why we reason that it is a head crest feather. Besides, the shape of the feather we sampled is dramatically different from the much softer and shorter ones detected on the neck.</p><p>In addition, we further sampled the crest feather barb from <italic>in situ</italic> preserved feather crest. We also detected a similar pattern to what we originally found regarding the packing of melanosomes. This is now added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Melanosome density may be taphonomic; in fact, in an important paper that is notably not cited here (Pan et al. 2019) the authors note dense melanosome packing and attribute it to taphonomy. This paper describes densely packed (taphonomic) melanosomes in non-avian avialans, specifically stating, &quot;Notably, we propose that the very dense arrangement of melanosomes in the fossil feathers (Fig. 2 B, C, and G-I, yellow arrows) does not reflect in-life distribution, but is, rather, a taphonomic response to postmortem or postburial compression&quot; and if this paper was taken into account it seems the conclusions would have to change drastically. If in this case the density is not taphonomic, this needs to be justified explicitly (although clearly these Jehol and Yanliao fossils are heavily compressed).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a line acknowledging this possibility. We have accounted for the shrinkage effects caused by heat and compression, as detailed in our Appendix file. Even when these changes are considered, they do not alter the main conclusions of our study. Besides given most melanosomes we used for simulation are mostly complete and well preserved，we consider the distortion is rather limited or at least minor compared to changes seen in taxonomic experiment shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Color in modern birds is affected by the outer keratin cortex thickness which is not preserved but the authors note the barbs are much thicker (10um) than extant birds; this surely would have affected color so how can the authors be sure about the color in this feather?</p></disp-quote><p>In extant birds, feather barbs of similar size are primarily composed of air spaces and quasi-ordered keratin structures, largely lacking dense melanosomes. The color-producing barb we have described here does not directly correspond to a feather type in modern birds for comparison. Since there is no direct extant analog to inform the keratin thickness and similar melanosome density, we utilize advanced 3-D FDTD modeling approach to the question of coloration reconstruction, rather than relying on statistical DFA approaches. In additional to packed melanosomes, the external thin keratin cortex layer is also considered for the simulation.</p><p>Additionally, even in the thinner melanosome-packed layers of barbules in living birds, iridescent coloration often is observed (e.g., Rafael Maia J. R. Soc. Interface 2009). This further supports the plausibility of our modeling approach and its relevance to understanding coloration in both extinct and extant species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Authors describe very strange shapes that are not present in extant birds: &quot;...different from all other known feather melanosomes from both extant and extinct taxa in having some extra hooks and an oblique ellipse shape in cross and longitudinal sections of individual melanosome&quot; but again, how can it be determined that this is not the result of taphonomic distortion?</p></disp-quote><p>We consistently observed similar hook-like structures not only in this feather but also in feathers from different positions of the crest. We do not believe that distortion would produce such a regular and consistent pattern; instead, distortion likely would result in random alterations, as demonstrated by prior taphonomic experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors describe the melanosomes as hexagonally packed but this does not appear to be in fact the case, rather appearing quasi-periodic at best, or random. If the authors could provide some figures to justify this hexagonal interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>To further validate the regional hexagonal pattern, we expanded our sampling to additional sites. We observed similar patterns not only in various regions of the same barb but also across different feathers (see added SI Figures below). This extensive sampling supports the validity of the melanosome patterns identified in our original analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) One way to address these concerns would be to sample some additional fossil feathers to see if this is unique or rather due to taphonomy</p></disp-quote><p>We sampled additional areas from the same feather as well as feathers from other regions of the head crest. The packing patterns are generally similar with slight variations in size (figure S6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) On a side, why are the feet absent in the CT scan image? &quot;</p></disp-quote><p>To achieve better image resolution, the field of view was adjusted, resulting in part of the feet being excluded from the CT scan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors reconstructed the three-dimensional organization of melanosomes in fossilized feathers belonging to a spectacular specimen of a stem avialan from China.

The methods are appropriate to support the main conclusions. I particularly appreciate how the authors went beyond the simple morphological inference and interrogated the structural implications of melanosome organization in three dimensions.

I believe this will be a landmark study for the inference of coloration in extinct species and how to interrogate its significance in the future.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for these positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I have a few minor comments.</p><p>Introduction: I would suggest the authors move the paragraph on coloration in modern birds (lines 75-97) before line 64, as this is part of the reasoning behind the study.

As this is one of the major findings of the study, I would suggest the authors include more information regarding the general geometry/morphology of the single melanosomes and their arrangement in three dimensions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion. We elaborated on the details of the melanosomes in the results as follows:</p><p>Hooks are commonly observed on the oval-shaped melanosomes in cross-sectional views, with two dominant types identified on the dorsal and ventral sides (Figure 3c-d, red arrows). These hooks are deflected in opposing directions, linking melanosomes from different arrays (dorsal-ventral) together. The major axis(y) of the oval-shaped melanosomes (mean = 283 nm) is oriented toward the left side in cross-section, while the shorter axis(x) measures approximately 186 nm (Table S2). In oblique or near-longitudinal sections (Figure 3e-f), the hooked structures’ connections to the distal and proximal sides of neighboring melanosomes are clearly visible (blue arrows, Figure 3f). A similar pattern occurs in two additional regions of interest within the same feather (figure S5). Although the smaller proximal hooks in these sections are less distinct, this may reflect developmental variation during melanosome formation along the feather barb. Significantly smaller hooks were also observed in cross-sections of <italic>in-situ</italic> feather barbs from the anterior side of the feather crest (figure S6). The mean long axis (z) of the melanosomes is approximately 1774 nm (Table S2). Based on these observations, we propose that the hooked structures—particularly those on the dorsal, ventral, proximal, and distal sides of the melanosomes—enhance the structural integrity of the barb (figure S7). However, these features may be teratological and unique to this individual, as no similar structures have been reported in other sampled feathers. These hooks may stabilize the stacked melanosome rods and contribute to increased barb dimensions, such as diameter and length. The sections exhibit modified (or asymmetric) hexagonally packed melanosomes with presence of extra hooked linkages (Figure 3c-d and e-f). The long rod-like melanosomes are different from all other known feather melanosomes from both extant and extinct taxa in having some extra hooks and an oblique ellipse shape in cross and longitudinal sections of individual melanosomes (Durrer 1986, Zhang, Kearns et al. 2010). The asymmetric packing of the melanosomes (the major axis leans leftward) played a major role in the reduction of fossilized keratinous matrix within the barbs, which may correspond to a novel structural coloration in this extinct bird. The close packed hexagonal melanosome pattern found in extant avian feathers yield rounded melanosome outlines in contrast to the oval-shaped melanosomes see figure S8, x.</p><p>Added Supplemental figure S5. STEM images of cross-sections taken from three different positions (indicated by white dashed lines in a) demonstrate similar melanosome packing styles. Dashed-lines labeled in (a) indicate where the corresponding position of these sections were taken, black arrows indicate the individual barbs that accumulated together in this long crest father. One distinct feature of these sections is the hooked-link structure that aligns the melanosomes into a modified hexagonal, packed arrangement. White arrows (in c, e, g) indicate the hooked structures observed in the selected melanosomes.</p><p>Added Supplemental figure S6. STEM images showing melanosome structure from three fragments of the feather crest (indicated by dashed lines and white box in a) reveal the hooked linkages between melanosomes and their surrounding melanosomes structures in (b), (c) and (d). Due to the shorter length of these feather barbs, the hook structures are not as well-defined as those in the longer feather samples shown in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Keratin: the authors use such a term pretty often in the text, but how is this inference justified in the fossil? Can the authors extend on this? Previous studies suggested the presence of degradation products deriving from keratin, rather than immaculated keratin per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed to keratinous matrix and material instead.

As shown in figure S2, long, flat-shaped lacunae are widely present and densely packed throughout the major part of the bone section. Very few secondary osteocytes are present, and parallel-fibered bone tissue is underdeveloped. The flattened osteocyte lacunae dominate the cellular shape, with observable vascular canals connecting different lacunae. Overall, the osteo-histology indicates that the bird was still in an active growth stage at the time of death, suggesting it was in its sub-adult growth phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CT scan data: these data should be made freely available upon publication of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We will release our CT scanning on an open server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/kw7sd/">https://osf.io/kw7sd/</ext-link>) along with the final version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper presents an in-depth analysis of the original colour of a fossil feather from the crest of a 125-million-year-old enantiornithine bird. From its shape and location, it would be predicted that such a feather might well have shown some striking colour and pattern. The authors apply sophisticated microscopic and numerical methods to determine that the feather was iridescent and brightly coloured and possibly indicates this was a male bird that used its crest in sexual displays.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The 3D micro-thin-sectioning techniques and the numerical analyses of light transmission are novel and state-of-the-art. The example chosen is a good one, as a crest feather is likely to have carried complex and vivid colours as a warning or for use in sexual display. The authors correctly warn that without such 3D study feather colours might be given simply as black from regular 2D analysis, and the alignment evidence for iridescence could be missed.</p><p>Weaknesses: Trivial.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>In a few places, the paper can be strengthened:</p><p>Dimensionality of study method: In the first paragraph, you set things up (lines 60-62) to say that studies hitherto have been of melanosomes and packing in two dimensions... and I then expect you to say soon after, in the next paragraph, 'Here, we investigate a fossil feather in three dimensions...' or some such, but you don't.</p><p>You come back to Methods at the end of the Introduction (lines 97-101), but again do not say whether you model the feather in three dimensions or not. Yes, you did - I finally learned at line 104 - you did micro serial sectioning. This needs to shift a long forward into the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions, we utilize serial sectioning to get a different view of the microbodies that are proposed to be melanosomes and reconstructed the three-dimensional volume of the melanosomes, as well as the intercalated keratin.</p><p>We restructured the introduction and make clear that the three-dimensional data obtained in this study also was used for modeling and in a more anterior position in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Results, there are not enough references to images. It's not enough to refer generally to 'Figures 3c-f' [line 133] and then go on to rapidly step through some amazing imagery (text lines 133-146) - you need to add an image citation to each observation so readers can know exactly which image is being described each time.</p></disp-quote><p>We elaborated our description of imaging to better describe the melanosomes in our results section. We add the description of the stack of melanosomes as IN Above (reply of Reviewer #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The 3D data in Figures 3 and 4 is great and based on huge technical wizardry. The sketch model in Figure 4a is excellent, but could you not attempt an actual 3D block diagram showing the hexagonal arrangement of clusters of aligned melanosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>We have also tried FIB -SEM in an additional place for validation of our ultrathin sections data. See the SI file.</p><p>Added figure S7. Targeted feather barb block prepared in FIB-SEM, with volume rendering reconstruction based on the acquired sequential cross-sectional images; the volume reconstruction is visualized in the x-y plane (c-cross section view) and in x-z plane (d-sagittal section view).</p><p>Modified Figure S8d shows the 3D model of aligned melanosomes. To show the arrangement more clearly, the schematic XY cross-section of the melanosomes 3D model is shown below (also shown in Supplementary Figure S8d).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>35: delete 'yield'</p></disp-quote><p>Changed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>73: 'feather fell' ? = 'feather that has fallen'</p></disp-quote><p>Changed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>305: excises ? = exercises</p></disp-quote><p>Changed</p></body></sub-article></article>
