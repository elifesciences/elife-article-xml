In the mammalian visual system, individual retinal ganglion cell axons form clustered terminal boutons containing multiple active zones onto relay cell dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. This mature architecture arises through the addition of release sites, which strengthens selected afferents while weaker inputs are pruned. Following eye-opening, spontaneous activity and visual experience promote synaptic refinement and bouton clustering after binocular inputs have segregated. However, anatomical changes in release site addition and spatial patterning during earlier stages of eye-specific competition are not well understood. To investigate this, we examined the spatial organization of eye-specific active zones in wild-type mice and a mutant line with disrupted cholinergic retinal waves. Using volumetric super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy and electron microscopy, we found that individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week. Both eyes generate these ‘multi-active-zone’ (mAZ) inputs throughout refinement, but the dominant eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts, each with more active zones and larger vesicle pools. At the height of competition (postnatal day 4), the non-dominant-eye projection adds many single-active-zone synapses. Mutants with abnormal cholinergic retinal waves still form mAZ inputs but develop fewer synapses overall and show reduced synaptic clustering in projections from both eyes. Together, these findings reveal eye-specific differences in release site addition that correlate with axonal segregation outcomes during retinogeniculate refinement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinogeniculate</kwd><kwd>eye-specific segregation</kwd><kwd>synaptic competition</kwd><kwd>dLGN</kwd><kwd>retinal waves</kwd><kwd>spontaneous activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2MH125812</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Speer</surname><given-names>Colenso M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Eye-specific differences in presynaptic release site addition and clustering correlate with axonal segregation outcomes during retinogeniculate refinement in the mouse.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key mechanism for neuronal signal processing is the formation of spatially clustered synapses that facilitate local computations within individual dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rall, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>).

Concurrently, developing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) boutons add presynaptic release sites such that some mature retinogeniculate terminals contain several dozen active zones (AZs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budisantoso et al., 2012</xref>). The formation of clustered boutons with multiple release sites subserves a critical ‘driver’ function of retinogeniculate input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sherman and Guillery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guillery and Sherman, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Retinogeniculate bouton clustering depends on visual experience, and dark-rearing after eye-opening reduces clustering within individual axon arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hong et al., 2014</xref>). However, less is known about synaptic spatial relationships and activity-dependent release site refinement during eye-specific competition before eye-opening. During early axon ingrowth, individual RGCs extend sparse side branches in the incorrect eye-specific territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sretavan and Shatz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sretavan and Shatz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2011</xref>). These transient branches form synapses that contain fewer presynaptic vesicles than those made by the same axon in the correct eye-specific domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Campbell and Shatz, 1992</xref>). Functional recordings after eye-opening show that while many RGC inputs are pruned, the remaining inputs strengthen by adding release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>). This leads to glutamate spillover and cross-talk between RGC inputs that increases postsynaptic relay neuron excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hauser et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, early eye-specific differences in release site number or spacing may contribute to binocular input refinement prior to eye-opening.</p><p>In a previous study from our laboratory, we used volumetric stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), anterograde tract tracing, and immunohistochemical labeling of synaptic proteins to show that dominant-eye synapses contain more total vesicles and have more vesicles near the AZ (putative docking) compared with non-dominant-eye synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). However, we did not examine whether eye-specific inputs differ in AZ number or AZ spatial proximity (clustering) during synaptic competition. To address this gap, we reanalyzed our published dataset, focusing on eye-specific AZ spatial relationships. We found that projections from each eye form a subset of retinogeniculate inputs in which several (2–4) AZs share a common cluster of presynaptic vesicles. We refer to these synapses as multi-active-zone (mAZ) inputs. All other retinogeniculate inputs contained one single active zone and its associated vesicle cluster, and we term these single-active-zone (sAZ) synapses.</p><p>During eye-specific synaptic competition, the dominant-eye projection formed more mAZ inputs, each with more AZs and a larger presynaptic vesicle pool compared to the non-dominant-eye projection. Similarly, the dominant eye had higher vesicle signal at sAZ inputs. At the peak of synaptic competition midway through the first postnatal week (postnatal day 4), the non-dominant-eye formed numerous sAZ inputs, equalizing the global synapse density between the two eyes. These eye-specific AZ patterns were disrupted in a mutant mouse line with abnormal stage II cholinergic retinal waves and retinogeniculate segregation defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retinogeniculate inputs form multiple active zones during eye-specific competition</title><p>To investigate active zone refinement during eye-specific segregation, we reanalyzed a volumetric super-resolution imaging dataset previously published by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). We used volumetric STORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vatan et al., 2021</xref>) to image the dLGNs of wild-type (WT) mice at three postnatal ages (P2, P4, and P8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We labeled eye-specific inputs by monocular injection of Alexa Fluor-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B tracer (CTB) together with immunostaining for presynaptic Bassoon, postsynaptic Homer1, and presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We collected separate image volumes (~45 K μm<sup>3</sup> each) from three biological replicates at each age. To assess the impact of spontaneous retinal activity on synaptic development across the same time period, we performed identical experiments in β2-knockout (β2KO) mice lacking the beta 2 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a mutation that disrupts spontaneous cholinergic retinal wave activity, eye-specific segregation, and retinogeniculate synapse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dhande et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Muir-Robinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grubb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stafford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bansal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burbridge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Because eye-specific segregation is incomplete until ~P8, we limited our re-analysis to the future contralateral eye-specific region of the dLGN, which is reliably identified across all stages of postnatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see also Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retinogeniculate boutons form multiple active zones (mAZ) during eye-specific competition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

We defined each retinogeniculate input as a single contiguous VGluT2 cluster together with all its associated presynaptic (Bassoon) and postsynaptic (Homer1) paired synaptic labels. Using this definition, inputs that had multiple (2–4) Bassoon AZs were classified as mAZ inputs, while those with a single Bassoon AZ were designated sAZ inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To address this, we used electron microscopy (EM) to image retinogeniculate terminals in the dLGN at P8. We generated a transgenic line expressing mitochondrial matrix-targeted dimeric dAPEX2 reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) in ipsilaterally projecting RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Su et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>), providing unambiguous mitochondrial labeling in ipsiRGC axons. EM images confirmed the presence of individual retinogeniculate boutons with multiple active zones, consistent with our STORM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previous EM reconstructions of retinogeniculate inputs reported no evidence of RGC bouton convergence at the end of the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monavarfeshani et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these results suggest that mAZ inputs in STORM images are single RGC terminals that house several closely spaced release sites. Hereafter, we use the word ‘synapse’ only to refer to each partnered active zone (Bassoon/Homer1 pairs); mAZ inputs contain several synapses, while each sAZ input is one synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Changes in eye-specific input density during synaptic competition</title><p>In our previous analysis, we reported global eye-specific synapse densities that reflected the combined mAZ and sAZ inputs.

Despite their late arrival, these axons competed by forming numerous sAZ inputs, which equalized the overall input density between the eyes in the future contralateral eye domain at postnatal day 4 (P4). Most of these synapses formed nearby other like-eye neighbors and were enriched near mAZ inputs, supporting the idea of release site addition at strong synapses. Neighboring sAZ synapses could ultimately mature into mAZ inputs as release sites are added and vesicle pools expand.</p><p>Distance analysis showed that clustered mAZ boutons were closer together than isolated mAZ boutons, further supporting release site addition near strong neighboring inputs. It remains unknown, however, whether nearby mAZ inputs originate from the same RGC. Nearby mAZ inputs within individual RGC arbors could promote release site addition via intrinsic mechanisms that scale with release site number, such as increased presynaptic calcium entry or surface delivery of synaptogenic molecules via presynaptic release. Boutons with multiple release sites could also trigger non-cell-autonomous signaling mechanisms that stabilize neighboring inputs from the same eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Louail et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kutsarova et al., 2023</xref>).

After eye-specific segregation, spontaneous retinal activity is required for postsynaptic AMPAR insertion, synaptic strengthening, and elimination of weaker inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hooks and Chen, 2006</xref>). Continued maintenance of segregation depends on calcium influx into relay neurons via L-type calcium channels, further implicating postsynaptic signaling in late-stage refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dilger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cork et al., 2001</xref>). Input targeting may also be guided by molecular cues to form non-random, eye-specific connections with postsynaptic targets. Ipsilaterally projecting RGCs have distinct gene expression profiles that specify axon guidance and may further support eye-specific synaptic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández-Nogales et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Spontaneous retinal activity may permit axons to read out molecular regulators of synaptogenesis, as previously shown for RGC axon retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nicol et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Release site addition as a general mechanism underlying synaptic competition</title><p>Early synaptic clustering during retinogeniculate development resembles other circuits where neural activity guides competitive synaptic and axonal remodeling. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), motor neuron terminals compete for control of a postsynaptic muscle fiber; a single motor axon input strengthens while competing axons are eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balice-Gordon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gan and Lichtman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wyatt and Balice-Gordon, 2003</xref>). Competition at the NMJ depends on inter-synaptic distance, with motor axons losing connections located near stronger competing synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balice-Gordon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gan and Lichtman, 1998</xref>). As winning terminals are enlarged, presynaptic release site addition maintains a consistent density of Bassoon clusters (~2–3/μm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Neighboring inputs with weaker synaptic transmission are selectively eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balice-Gordon and Lichtman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buffelli et al., 2003</xref>). Competing motor axons differ in their release probabilities early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kopp et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that presynaptic efficacy triggers local ‘stabilization’ signals in winners and ‘punishment’ signals in losers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>). Presynaptic agrin release stabilizes postsynaptic receptor clusters by counteracting the destabilizing, dispersal effects of acetylcholine release, emphasizing the importance of early presynaptic transmission in postsynaptic stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Misgeld et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, in the developing cerebellum, Purkinje cells initially receive inputs from multiple climbing fibers (CFs) during the first postnatal week. Subsequently, one winning CF emerges and consolidates its synaptic inputs, while losing CFs are pruned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hashimoto and Kano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosman and Konnerth, 2009</xref>). Here again, the winning input strengthens by adding presynaptic release sites, which increases multivesicular release and elevates glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hashimoto and Kano, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nitta et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson et al., 2019</xref>). Postsynaptic ultrastructural and molecular changes occur several days later as dominant CF inputs potentiate and losing CF inputs depress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nitta et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ohtsuki and Hirano, 2008</xref>) through spike-timing-dependent remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lorenzetto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawamura et al., 2013</xref>). Across these models, the earliest distinguishing feature between competing inputs is relative presynaptic transmission strength. Thus, release-site addition may be a conserved mechanism that biases synaptic refinement outcomes across developing neural circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

A circular tissue punch (~500 μm diameter) containing the dLGN was microdissected from each section using a blunt-end needle. A small microknife cut was made at the dorsal edge of the dLGN which, together with the CTB-488 signal, enabled us to identify the dLGN orientation during image acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>We used a serial-section single-molecule localization imaging approach to prepare samples and collect super-resolution fluorescence imaging volumes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). dLGN tissue punches were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Catalogue Number: 017-000-121) with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich Inc) and 0.02% sodium azide (Sigma-Aldrich Inc) diluted in 1X PBS for 2–3 hr at room temperature and then incubated in primary antibodies for ~72 hr at 4°C.

Coverslips were then rinsed with ethanol and dH<sub>2</sub>O. To create fiducial beads for flat-field and chromatic corrections, we mixed 715/755 and 540/560 nm, carboxylate-modified microspheres (Invitrogen, Catalogue Numbers: F8799 and F8809, 1:8 ratio, respectively) to create a high-density fiducial marker and then further diluted the mixture at 1:750 with Dulbecco’s PBS to create a low-density bead solution. Both high- and low-density bead solutions were spotted on the coverslip (~0.7 µl each) for flat-field and chromatic aberration correction, respectively. Excess beads were rinsed away with dH<sub>2</sub>O for 1–2 min. The coverslip was attached to a glass slide with double-sided tape to form an imaging chamber. The chamber was filled with STORM imaging buffer (10% glucose, 17.5 µM glucose oxidase, 708 nM catalase, 10 mM MEA, 10 mM NaCl, and 200 mM Tris) and sealed with epoxy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Imaging setup</title><p>Imaging was performed using a custom single-molecule super-resolution imaging system. The microscope contained low (4x/10x air) and high (60x 1.4NA oil immersion) magnitude objectives mounted on a commercial frame (Nikon Ti-U) with back optics arranged for oblique incident angle illumination. We used continuous-wave lasers at 488 nm (Coherent), 561 nm (MPB), 647 nm (MPB), and 750 nm (MPB) to excite Alexa 488, Cy3B, Alexa 647, and Dy749P1 dyes, respectively. A 405-nm cube laser (Coherent) was used to reactivate Dy749P1 and Alexa647 dye photoswitching. The microscope was fitted with a custom pentaband/pentanotch dichroic filter set and a motorized emission filter wheel. The microscope also contained an IR laser-based focus lock system to maintain optimal focus during automatic image acquisition. Images were collected on 640*640-pixel region of an sCMOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0 V3, Hamamatsu Photonics) with a pixel size of ~155 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Automated image acquisition</title><p>Fiducials and tissue sections on the coverslip were imaged using the low magnification objective (4X) to create a mosaic overview of the specimen. Beads/sections were then imaged at high magnification (60X) to select regions of interest (ROIs) in the Cy3B and Alexa 488 channels. Before final image acquisition, laser intensities and the incident angle were adjusted to optimize photoswitching for STORM imaging and utilize the full dynamic range of the camera for conventional imaging.</p><p>Low-density bead images were taken in 16 partially overlapping ROIs. 715/755 nm beads were excited using 750 nm light and images were collected through Dy749P1 and Alexa 647 emission filters. 540/560 nm beads were excited using a 488-nm laser and images were collected through Alexa 647, Cy3B, and Alexa 488 emission filters. These fiducial images were later used to generate a non-linear warping transform to correct chromatic aberration. Next, ROIs within each tissue section were imaged at conventional (diffraction-limited) resolution in all four-color channels sequentially.</p><p>Following conventional image acquisition, a partially overlapping series of nine images was collected in the high-density bead field for all four channels (Dy749P1, Alexa 647, Cy3B, and Alexa 488). These images were later used to perform a flat-field image correction of non-uniform laser illumination across the ROIs. Another round of bead images was taken as described above in a different ROI of the low-density bead field. These images were later used to confirm the stability of chromatic offsets during imaging. All ROIs within physical sections were then imaged by STORM for Dy749P1 and Alexa 647 channels. Images were acquired using a custom progression of increasing 405 nm laser intensity to control single-molecule switching. 8000 frames of Dy749P1 channel images were collected (60 Hz imaging) followed by 12,000 frames of Alexa 647 channel images (100 Hz). In a second imaging pass, the same ROIs were imaged for Cy3B and Alexa 488 channels, each for 8000 frames (60 Hz).</p><p>We imaged the ipsilateral and contralateral ROIs separately in each physical section of the dLGN. For consistency of ROI selection across biological replicates at each age, we identified the dorsal–ventral (DV) axis of the dLGN and selected ROIs within the center (core region) at 2/5 (ipsilateral ROI) and 4/5 (contralateral ROI) of the full DV length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image processing</title><p>Single-molecule localization was performed using a previously described DAOSTORM algorithm modified for use with sCMOS cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babcock et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babcock et al., 2019</xref>). Molecule lists were rendered as 8-bit images with 15.5 nm pixel size where each molecule is plotted as an intensity distribution with an area reflecting its localization precision. Low-density fiducial images were used for chromatic aberration correction. We localized 715/755 beads in Dy749P1 and Alexa 647 channels, and 540/560 beads in Alexa 647, Cy3B, and Alexa 488 channels. A third-order polynomial transform map was generated by matching the positions of each bead in all channels to the Alexa 647 channel. The average residual error of bead matching was &lt;15 nm for all channels. The transform maps were applied to both four-color conventional and STORM images. Conventional images were upscaled (by 10X) to match the STORM image size. The method to align serial sections was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). STORM images were first aligned to their corresponding conventional images by image correlation. To generate an aligned 3D image stack from serial sections, we normalized the intensity of all Alexa 488 images and used these normalized images to generate both rigid and elastic transformation matrices for all four-color channels of both STORM and conventional data. The final image stack was then rotated and cropped to exclude incompletely imaged edge areas. To further confirm that the processed region corresponds to the contralateral dLGN, conventional CTB(+) signals of the labeled contralateral projection were thresholded to create a polygonal mask (a convex hull analysis linking the outermost CTB signals in the image volume). The mask was then applied to STORM images to exclude peripheral areas where CTB signals were absent or faint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell body filter</title><p>The aligned STORM images had non-specific labeling of cell bodies in Dy749P1 and Alexa 647 channels corresponding to Homer1 and Bassoon immunolabels. To limit synaptic cluster identification to the neuropil region, we identified cell bodies based on their Dy749P1 signal and excluded these regions from further image processing. STORM images were convolved with a Gaussian function (<italic>σ</italic> = 140 nm) and then binarized using the lower threshold of a two-level Otsu threshold method. We located connected components in the thresholded images and generated a mask based on components larger than e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Monavarfeshani et al., 2018</xref>) voxels. Because cell body clusters were orders of magnitude larger than synaptic clusters, the cell body filter algorithm was robust to a range of size thresholds. The mask was applied to images of all channels to exclude cell body areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Eye-specific synapse identification and quantification</title><p>To correct for minor variance in image intensity across physical sections, we normalized the pixel intensity histogram of each section to the average histogram of all sections. Image histograms were rescaled to make full use of the 8-bit range. Using a two-level Otsu threshold method, the conventional images were thresholded into three classes: a low-intensity background, low-intensity signals above the background representing non-synaptic labeling, and high-intensity signals representing synaptic structures. The conventional images were binarized by the lower two-level Otsu threshold, generating a mask for STORM images to filter out background signals. STORM images were convolved with a Gaussian function (<italic>σ</italic> = 77.5 nm) and thresholded using the higher two-level Otsu threshold. Following thresholding, connected components were identified in three dimensions using MATLAB ‘conncomp’ function. A watershedding approach was applied to split large clusters that were improperly connected. Clusters were kept for further analysis only if they contained aligned image information across two or more physical sections. We also removed all edge synapses from our analysis by excluding synapses that did not have blank image data on all adjacent sides.</p><p>To distinguish non-specific immunolabeling from true synaptic signals, we quantified two parameters for each cluster: cluster volume and cluster signal density calculated by the ratio of within-cluster pixels with positive signal intensity in the raw STORM images. Two separate populations were identified in 2D histograms plotted from these two parameters. We manually selected the population with higher volumes and signal densities representing synaptic structures. To test the robustness of the manual selection, we performed multiple repeated measurements of the same data and discovered a between-measurement variance of &lt;1% (data not shown).</p><p>To identify paired pre- and postsynaptic clusters, we first measured the centroid–centroid distance of each cluster in the Dy749P1 (Homer1) and Alexa 647 (Bassoon) channels to the closest cluster in the other channel. We next quantified the signal intensity of each opposing synaptic channel within a 140-nm shell surrounding each cluster. A 2D histogram was plotted based on the measured centroid–centroid distances and opposing channel signal densities of each cluster. Paired clusters with closely positioned centroids and high intensities of apposed channel signal were identified using the OPTICS algorithm. Retinogeniculate synapses were identified by pairing Bassoon (Alexa 647) clusters with VGluT2 (Cy3B) clusters using the same method as pre/postsynaptic pairing. Synapses from the right eye were identified by pairing VGluT2 clusters with CTB (Alexa 488) clusters. The volume of each cluster reflected the total voxel volume of all connected voxels, and the total signal intensity was a sum of voxel intensity within the volume of the connected voxels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Multi-AZ synapse identification and quantification</title><p>To determine whether an eye-specific VGluT2 cluster is a mAZ synapse or a sAZ synapse, we measured the number of active zones (defined by individual Bassoon clusters) associated with each VGluT2 cluster in the dataset. A 3D shell was extended 140 nm from the surface voxels of each VGluT2 cluster, and any Bassoon clusters that fell within the shell were considered to be associated with the target VGluT2 cluster. The number of AZs associated with each VGluT2 cluster was then measured. VGluT2 clusters associated with more than one AZ were defined as mAZ synapses, while those associated with only one AZ were defined as sAZ synapses.</p><p>Quantification of mAZ and sAZ synapse VGluT2 cluster volume was performed using the ‘regionprops’ function in MATLAB, which provided the voxel size and weighted centroid of each VGluT2 cluster. The search for sAZ synapses adjacent to mAZ synapses (synaptic clustering analysis) was conducted using a similar search approach as for associated Bassoon clusters, with expansion shell sizes ranging from 1 to 4 μm from the surface voxels of each mAZ synapse. The main figures in the study utilized an expansion distance of 1.5 μm. An eye-specific sAZ synapse was considered to be near an mAZ synapse if its weighted centroid fell within the expanded volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.

For all measurements in this paper, we analyzed <italic>N</italic> = 3 biological replicates (individual mice) for each genotype (WT and β2KO) at each age (P2, P4, and P8). Cluster densities, synapse AZ number, average VGluT2 cluster volume, and all fractional measurements were presented as mean ± SEM values in paired bar graphs, and statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed paired <italic>T</italic>-tests. Nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used in all cumulative histogram comparisons. We used a linear mixed model to compare VGluT2 cluster volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and distance measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For VGluT2 cluster volume comparisons, the age or eye-of-origin was the fixed main factor and biological replicate IDs were nested random factors. In distance measurement comparisons, the mAZ synapse AZ number was the fixed main factor and biological replicate IDs were nested random factors. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d for parametric tests and epsilon squared for nonparametric tests. To address multiple testing, we applied FDR correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method with <italic>α</italic> = 0.05 separately within each experimental condition (P2-WT, P2-β2KO, P4-WT, P4-β2KO, P8-WT, and P8-β2KO). 20–34 measurements (varying by age and genotype) were corrected within each of the six experimental conditions, resulting in condition-specific FDR-adjusted p-values presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. In violin plots, each violin showed the distribution of grouped data from all biological replicates from the same condition. Each black dot represents the median value of each biological replicate, and the horizontal black line represents the group median. Black lines connect measurements of CTB(+) and CTB(−) populations from the same biological replicate. Asterisks in all figures indicate statistical significance after FDR correction: *p(adj) &lt; 0.05. For VGluT2 volume comparisons, we calculated 5/95% confidence intervals based on the linear mixed model. 5/95% confidence intervals in synapse densities, AZ numbers, and distances were calculated for paired or unpaired data comparisons using SPSS.

While these changes address some prior concerns, the underlying issues remain. The previous review emphasized that the reported effect sizes were small and therefore hard to link to biological relevance. The authors argue that the effect sizes are large. Given the lack of a biological argument for this effect size, this point is really semantic. We would like to point out that the effect size measurement the authors used is likely a standard effect size calculation (the difference between groups is divided by the standard deviation of the groups). With only three experiments and irregular variance, it is likely that their estimates of standard deviation-and therefore effect size-are unreliable. Overall, the revisions improve presentation but do not substantively resolve the difficulty in drawing strong conclusions from the data set raised earlier.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91431.5.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Chenghang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, College Park</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vatan</surname><given-names>Tarlan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Speer</surname><given-names>Colenso</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, College Park</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors previously published a study of RGC boutons in the dLGN in developing wild-type mice and developing mutant mice with disrupted spontaneous activity. In the current manuscript, they have broken down their analysis of RGC boutons according to the number of Homer/Bassoon puncta associated with each vGlut3 cluster.</p><p>The authors find that, in the first post-natal week, RGC boutons with multiple active zones (mAZs) are about a third as common as boutons with a single active zone (sAZ). The size of the vGluT2 cluster associated with each bouton was proportional to the number of active zones present in each bouton. Within the author's ability to estimate these values (n=3 per group, 95% of results expected to be within ~2.5 standard deviations), these results are consistent across groups: (1) dominant eye vs. nondominant eye, (2) wild-type mice vs. mice with activity blocked, and at (3) ages P2, P4, and P8.

Rather, the authors perform a large number of tests for statistical significance and cite the presence or absence of statistical significance as evidence that &quot;Eye-specific active zone clustering underlies synaptic competition in the developing visual system (title)&quot;. I don't believe this conclusion is supported by the evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the title to be descriptive: &quot;Eye-specific differences in active zone addition during synaptic competition in the developing visual system.&quot; While our correlative approach does not establish direct causality, our findings provide important structural evidence that complements existing functional studies of activity-dependent synaptic refinement. We have carefully revised the text throughout to avoid causal language, focusing instead on the developmental patterns we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths</p><p>The source dataset is high resolution data showing the colocalization of multiple synaptic proteins across development. Added to this data is labeling that distinguishes axons from the right eye from axons from the left eye. The first order analysis of this data showing changes in synapse density and in the occurrence of multi-active zone synapses is useful information about the development of an important model for activity dependent synaptic remodeling.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>In my previous review I argued that it was not possible to determine, from their analysis, whether the differences they were reporting between groups was important to the biology of the system. The authors have made some changes to their statistics (paired t-tests) and use some less derived measures of clustering. However, they still fail to present a meaningfully quantitative argument that the observed group differences are important. The authors base most of their claims on small differences between groups. There are two big problems with this practice. First, the differences between groups appear too small to be biologically important. Second, the differences between groups that are used as evidence for how the biology works are generally smaller than the precision of the author's sampling. That is, the differences are as likely to be false positives as true positives.</p><p>(1) Effect size. The title claims: &quot;Eye-specific active zone clustering underlies synaptic competition in the developing visual system&quot;. Such a claim might be supported if the authors found that mAZs are only found in dominant-eye RGCs and that eye-specific segregation doesn't begin until some threshold of mAZ frequency is reached. Instead, the behavior of mAZs is roughly the same across all conditions. For example, the clear trend in Figure 4C and D is that measures of clustering between mAZ and sAZ are as similar as could reasonably be expected by the experimental design. However, some of the comparisons of very similar values produced p-values &lt; 0.05. The authors use this fact to argue that the negligible differences between mAZ and sAZs explain the development of the dramatic differences in the distribution of ipsilateral and contralateral RGCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to avoid implying a causal relationship between clustering and eye-specific segregation. Our key findings in Figures 4C and 4D demonstrate effect sizes &gt;2.0 with high statistical power (Supplemental Table S2). While the absolute magnitude of differences is modest (5-7%), these high effect sizes combined with low inter-animal variability demonstrate consistent, reproducible biological phenomena. During development, small differences during critical periods can have profound downstream consequences for synaptic refinement outcomes.</p><p>We acknowledge that significance in Figure 4 arises due to low variance between biological replicates rather than large mean differences. We have revised the text to describe these as &quot;slight&quot; differences and that &quot;WT mice show a tendency toward forming more synapses near mAZ inputs,&quot; reflecting appropriate caution in our interpretation while maintaining the statistical robustness of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Sample size. Performing a large number of significance tests and comparing pvalues is not hypothesis testing and is not descriptive science. At best, with large sample sizes and controls for multiple tests, this approach could be considered exploratory. With n=3 for each group, many comparisons of many derived measures, among many groups, and no control for multiple testing, this approach constitutes a random result generator.</p><p>The authors argue that n=3 is a large sample size for the type of high resolution / large volume data being used. It is true that many electron microscopy studies with n=1 are used to reveal the patterns of organization that are possible within an individual. However, such studies cannot control individual variation and are, therefore, not appropriate for identifying subtle differences between groups.</p><p>In response to previous critiques along these lines, the authors argue they have dealt with this issue by limiting their analysis to within-individual paired comparisons. There are several problems with their thinking in this approach. The main problem is that they did not change the logic of their arguments, only which direction they pointed the t-tests. Instead of claiming that two groups are different because p &lt; 0.05, they say that two groups are different because one produced p &lt; 0.05 and the other produced p &gt; 0.05. These arguments are not statistically valid or biologically meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have implemented rigorous statistical controls, applying false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (α = 0.05) within each experimental condition (age × genotype combination). This correction strategy treats each condition as addressing a distinct experimental question: “What synaptic properties differ between left eye and right eye inputs in this specific developmental stage and genotype?” The approach appropriately controls for multiple testing while preserving power to detect biologically meaningful differences. We applied FDR correction separately to the ~20-34 measurements (varying by age and genotype) within each of the six experimental conditions, resulting in condition-specific adjusted p-values reported in updated Supplemental Table S2. This correction confirmed the robustness of our key findings. We do not base conclusions solely on comparing p-values across conditions. Our interpretations focus on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and consistent patterns within each condition, with statistical significance providing supporting evidence rather than the primary basis for biological conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To the best of my understanding, the results are consistent with the following model:</p><p>RGCs form mAZs at large boutons (known)</p><p>About a quarter of week-one RGC boutons are mAZs (new observation)</p><p>Vesicle clustering is proportional to active zone number (~new observation)</p><p>RGC synapse density increases during the first post-week (known)</p><p>Blocking activity reduces synapse density (known)</p><p>Contralateral eye RGCs for more and larger synapses in the lateral dLGN (known)</p></disp-quote><p>While mAZ formation is known in adult and juvenile dLGN, the formation of mAZ boutons during eye-specific competition represents new information with important functional implications. Synapses with multiple release sites should be stronger than single-active-zone synapses, suggesting a structural correlate for competitive advantage during refinement.</p><p>We demonstrate distinct developmental patterns for sAZ versus mAZ contacts during the first postnatal week. Multi-active zone density favors the dominant eye, while single active-zone synapse density from the competing eye increases from P2-P4 to match dominant-eye levels. This reveals that newly formed synapses from the competing eye predominantly contain single release sites, marking P4-P8 as a critical window for understanding molecular mechanisms driving synaptic elimination.</p><p>Our results show that altered retinal activity patterns (β2KO mice) reduce synapse density during eye-specific competition. We relied on β2 knockout mice, which retain retinal waves and spontaneous spike activity but with disrupted patterns and output levels compared to controls. We make no claims about complete activity blockade. Previous studies using different activity manipulations (epibatidine, TTX) have examined terminal morphology, but effects on synapse density during competition remain largely unknown. Achieving complete retinal activity blockade is technically challenging, making it of interest to revisit the role of activity using more precise manipulations to control spike output and relative timing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With n=3 and effect sizes smaller than 1 standard deviation, a statistically significant result is about as likely to be a false positive as a true positive.</p><p>A true-positive statistically significant result does is not evidence of a meaningful deviation from a biological model.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusions are based on results with effect sizes substantially larger than 1. Key findings demonstrate effect sizes exceeding 2.0. These large effect sizes, combined with rigorous FDR correction and low inter-animal variability, provide evidence against false positive results. During critical developmental periods, consistent structural differences, even those modest in absolute magnitude, can reflect important regulatory mechanisms that influence refinement outcomes. All statistical results, effect sizes, and power analyses are reported in Supplementary Tables S2, with confidence intervals in Supplementary Table S3. We have revised the text in several places where small differences are presented to reflect appropriate caution in our interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Providing plots that show the number of active zones present in boutons across these various conditions is useful. However, I could find no compelling deviation from the above default predictions that would influence how I see the role of mAZs in activity dependent eye-specific segregation.</p><p>Below are critiques of most of the claims of the manuscript.</p><p>Claim (abstract): individual retinogeniculate boutons begin forming multiple nearby presynaptic active zones during the first postnatal week.</p><p>Confirmed by data.</p><p>Claim (abstract): the dominant-eye forms more numerous mAZ contacts,</p><p>Misleading: The dominant-eye (by definition) forms more contacts than the nondominant eye. That includes mAZ.</p></disp-quote><p>While the dominant eye forms more total contacts, the pattern depends critically on contact type and developmental stage. The dominant eye forms more mAZ contacts across all ages (Figures 2 and S1). However, for sAZ contacts, the two eyes form similar numbers at P4, with the non-dominant eye showing increased sAZ formation during this critical period.

Twelve differences were measured with an n of 3, 3 each time. The biggest difference of the group was cited. No analysis is provided for the range of uncertainty about this measure (2.5 standard deviations) as an individual sample or as one of twelve comparisons.</p><p>Claim (line 174): &quot;In the middle of eye-specific competition at P4 in WT mice, the median VGluT2 cluster volume in dominant-eye mAZ inputs was 3.72 fold larger than that of non-dominant-eye inputs (Fig. 3A, left). In contrast, β2KO mice showed a smaller 1.1 fold difference at the same age (Fig. 3A, right panel). For sAZ synapses at P4, the magnitudes of eye-specific differences in VGluT2 volume were smaller: 1.35-fold in WT (Fig. 3B, left) and 0.41-fold in β2KO mice (Fig. 3B, right). Thus, both mAZ and sAZ input size favors the dominant eye, with larger eye-specific differences seen in WT mice (see Table S3).&quot;</p><p>No way to judge the reliability of the analysis and trivial conclusion: To analyze effect size the authors choose the median value of three measures (whatever the middle value is). They then make four comparisons at the time point where they observed the biggest difference in favor of their hypothesis. There is no way to determine how much we should trust these numbers besides spending time with the mislabeled scatter plots. The authors then claim that this analysis provides evidence that there is a difference in vGluT2 cluster volume between dominant and non-dominant RGCs and that that difference is activity dependent. The conclusion that dominant axons have bigger boutons and that mutants that lack the property that would drive segregation would show less of a difference is very consistent with the literature. Moreover, there is no context provided about what 1.35 or 1.1 fold difference means for the biology of the system.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on P4 for biological reasons rather than post-hoc selection. P4 represents the established peak of synaptic competition when eye-specific synapse densities are globally equivalent. This is a timepoint consistently highlighted throughout our manuscript and supported by previous literature. We have modified our presentation from fold changes to measured eye-specific differences in volume (mean ± standard error) and added confidence intervals in Supplemental Table S3. The effect sizes for eye-specific differences in VGluT2 volume at P4 are robust: ~2.3 and ~1.5 for mAZ and sAZ measurements in WT mice, and ~2.5 and ~1.8 in β2KO mice, with all analyses well-powered (Supplemental Table S2).</p><p>We were unable to identify any mislabeled scatter plots and believe all figures are correctly labeled. While dominant-eye advantage in bouton size is consistent with previous literature, our study provides the first detailed analysis of how this develops specifically during the critical period of competition, with distinct patterns for single versus multi-active zone contacts. Our data show that dominant-eye inputs have larger vesicle pools that scale with active zone number. While this suggests enhanced transmission capacity, we make no direct physiological claims based on structural data alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim (189): &quot;This shows that vesicle docking at release sites favors the dominant-eye as we previously reported but is similar for like eye type inputs regardless of AZ number.&quot;</p><p>Contradicts core claim of manuscript: Consistent with previous literature, there is an activity dependent relative increase in vGlut2 clustering of dominant eye RGCs. The new information is that that activity dependence is more or less the same in sAZ and mAZ. The only plausible alternative is that vGlut2 scaling only increases in mAZ which would be consistent with the claims of their paper. That is not what they found. To the extent that the analysis presented in this manuscript tests a hypothesis, this is it. The claim of the title has been refuted by figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We report the volume of docked vesicle signal (VGluT2) nearby each active zone, finding this is greater for dominant-eye synapses. Within each eye-specific synapse population, vesicle signal per active zone is similar regardless of whether these are part of single- or multi-active zone contacts. This is consistent with a modular program of active zone assembly and maintenance: core molecular programs facilitate docking at each AZ similarly regardless of how many AZs are nearby.</p><p>This finding does not contradict our main conclusions but rather provides insight into how synaptic advantages are structured. The dominant eye's advantage may arise in part from forming more multi-AZ contacts (which have proportionally more docked vesicles) rather than from enhanced vesicle loading per individual active zone. This organization may reflect how developmental competition operates through contact number and active zone addition rather than fundamental changes to individual release site properties.</p><p>We have changed the title to be descriptive rather than mechanistic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim (line 235): &quot;For the non-dominant eye projection, however, clustered mAZ inputs outnumbered clustered sAZ inputs at P4 (Fig. 4C, bottom left panel), the age when this eye adds sAZ synapses (Fig. 2C).&quot;</p><p>Misleading: The overwhelming trend across 24 comparisons is that the sAZ clustering looks like mAZ clustering.

The authors use STORM microscopy and immunostain presynaptic (VGluT2, Bassoon) and postsynaptic (Homer) proteins to identify synaptic release sites. Activity-dependent changes of this spatial organization are identified by comparing the β2KO mice to WT mice. They describe two types of synapses based on Bassoon clustering: the multiple active zone (mAZ) synapse and single active zone (sAZ) synapse. In this revision, the authors have added EM data to support the idea that mAZ synapses represent boutons with multiple release sites. They have also reanalyzed their data set with different statistical approaches.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data presented is of good quality and provides an unprecedented view at high resolution of the presynaptic components of the retinogeniculate synapse during active developmental remodeling. This approach offers an advance to the previous mouse EM studies of this synapse because of the CTB label allows identification of the eye from which the presynaptic terminal arises.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the interpretation of this data set is much more grounded in this second revised submission, some of the authors' conclusions/statements still lack convincing supporting evidence. In particular, the data does not support the title: &quot;Eye-specific active zone clustering underlies synaptic competition in the developing visual system&quot;. The data show that there are fewer synapses made for both contra- and ipsi- inputs in the β2KO mice-- this fact alone can account for the differences in clustering. There is no evidence linking clustering to synaptic competition. Moreover, the findings of differences in AZ# or distance between AZs that the authors report are quite small and it is not clear whether they are functionally meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful suggestions that improved the manuscript in this revision. We have changed the title to remove the reference to “clustering” and to avoid implying any causal relationships. The new title is descriptive: “Eye-specific differences in active zone addition during synaptic competition in the developing visual system”.</p><p>To further address the reviewers comments, we have removed the remaining references to activity-dependent effects on synaptic development (line 36, line 96, line 415). We have also modified the text in lines 411-413 to state that “The failure to add synapses could explain the observation that synaptic clustering was reduced and more inputs formed in isolation in the mutants compared to controls.”</p><p>We have also updated our presentation of results for Figure 4 to ensure that we do not causally link clustering to synaptic competition. In Figures 4C and 4D we report significant results with high effect sizes (effect sizes all greater than 2; see Supplemental Table S2). The mean differences are modest (5-7%) and significance arises due to low variance between biological replicates. We acknowledge that clustering patterns are generally similar between mAZ and sAZ inputs across most conditions.

Specifically, they use anti-Vglut2 label to determine the size of the presynaptic structure (which they describe as the vesicle pool size), anti-Bassoon to label active zones with the resolution to count them, and anti-Homer to identify postsynaptic densities. Their previous study compared the detailed synaptic structure across the development of synapses made with contraprojecting vs. ipsi-projecting RGCs and compared this developmental profile with a mouse model with reduced retinal waves. In this study, they produce a new detailed analysis on the same data set in which they classify synapses into &quot;multi-active zone&quot; vs. &quot;single-active zone&quot; synapses and assess the number and spacing of these synapses. The authors use measurements to make conclusions about the role of retinal waves in the generation of same-eye synaptic clusters. The authors interpret these results as providing insight into how neural activity drives synapse maturation, the strength of their conclusions is not directly tested by their analysis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a fantastic data set for describing the structural details of synapse development in a part of the brain undergoing activity-dependent synaptic rearrangements. The fact that they can differentiate the eye of origin is what makes this data set unique over previous structural work. The addition of example images from the EM dataset provides confidence in their categorization scheme.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Though the descriptions of single vs multi-active zone synapses are important and represent a significant advance, the authors continue to make unsupported conclusions regarding the biological processes driving these changes. Although this revision includes additional information about the populations tested and the tests conducted, the authors do not address the issue raised by previous reviews. Specifically, they provide no assessment of what effect size represents a biologically meaningful result. For example, a more appropriate title is &quot;The distribution of eye-specific single vs multiactive zone is altered in mice with reduced spontaneous activity&quot; rather than concluding that this difference in clustering is somehow related to synaptic competition. Of course, the authors are free to speculate, but many of the conclusions of the paper are not supported by their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s helpful critique. We have changed the title to be descriptive and avoid implying causal relationships.</p><p>We have applied false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method with α = 0.05 within each experimental condition (age × genotype combination). The FDR correction treats each condition as addressing a distinct experimental question: 'What synaptic properties differ between left eye and right eye inputs in this specific developmental stage and genotype?'</p><p>This correction strategy is appropriate because: (1) we focus our statistical comparisons within each age/genotype; (2) each age-genotype combination represents a separate biological context where different synaptic properties between eye-of-origin may be relevant; and (3) this approach controls for multiple testing within each experimental question while maintaining statistical power to detect meaningful biological differences.</p><p>We applied FDR correction separately to the ~20-34 measurements (varying with age and genotype) within each of the six experimental conditions (P2-WT, P2-ß2, P4-WT, P4-ß2, P8-WT, P8-ß2), resulting in condition-specific adjusted p-values. These are reported in the updated Supplemental Table S2. Figures have been also been updated to reflect the FDR-adjusted values. Selected between-genotype comparisons are presented descriptively using 5/95% confidence intervals. This correction confirmed the robustness of our key findings.</p><p>With regard to the biological significance of effect sizes, our key findings demonstrate effect sizes &gt;2.0, indicating robust effects. During critical developmental periods, consistent structural differences, even those modest in absolute magnitude, can reflect important regulatory mechanisms that influence refinement outcomes. The differences in synaptic organization we observe occur during the first postnatal week when eyespecific competition is active, suggesting these patterns may be relevant to understanding how structural advantages emerge during synaptic refinement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have tried to understand the analysis and biology of this manuscript as best I can. I believe the analytical approach taken is not reliable and I have explained why in my public comments. I don't believe this manuscript is unique in taking this approach. I have recently published a paper on how common this approach is and why it doesn't work. I don't want to give the impression that the problem with the analysis was that it was not computationally sophisticated enough or that you did not jump through a specific statistical hoop. If I strip out the arguments that depend on misinterpretations of p-values and -instead- look at the scatterplots, I come up with a very different view of the data than what is described in the paper.</p><p>The information in the plots could be translated into a rigorous statistical analysis of estimated differences between groups given the uncertainties of the experimental design.

I don't see evidence of an additional effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s helpful comments throughout the review process.
