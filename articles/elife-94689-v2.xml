While current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, non-adherent cells remain challenging. In this study, we addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI(CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and we tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells regularly grow and divide through a process called the cell cycle. It includes rest periods where no growth or division occurs. When the cells are ready to divide, they duplicate their DNA, so each new cell gets a complete set of instructions. Finally, the cell splits into two new cells through a process called cytokinesis. This whole process can take hours or days to complete, depending on the cell type. Many things can go wrong during these processes, impairing healing or causing tumor formation. Learning more about these processes could help scientists better understand healing and diseases like cancer.</p><p>Emerging imaging and data analysis tools allow scientists to observe cell-growth processes and watch errors as they occur. But, doing so requires sophisticated equipment and can be time and labor-intensive. Especially, if scientists are trying to track the cell cycle in a large number of cells. It can also be challenging to track free-moving cells, like blood or immune cells. New tools and techniques are needed to help scientists overcome these challenges.</p><p>Hayatigolkhatmi, Soriani, Soda et al. developed a method in which a sticky surface is used to grow blood cancer cells that allows them to observe the cell cycle in large numbers of the cells at the same time. In the experiments, blood cancer cells were grown on a nano-material-coated surface that kept the usually free-floating cells still. The team compared gene expression in the cells before and after raising them on the surface to confirm that confining the cells did not alter their gene expression or disrupt their normal life cycle. Then, the researchers developed machine learning software that monitors the cell cycle in hundreds of individual cells, quantifies cell cycle phases and analyzes data with minimal human intervention. Usually, it would take a scientist 40-50 hours to oversee the cell cycle in a single experimental condition. This time was reduced to approximately 2 hours for a complete experiment using their pipeline. Finally, they validated their tools by monitoring different types of cancer cells under various treatment conditions.</p><p>The tools developed by Hayatigolkhatmi, Soriani, Soda et al. provide researchers with a fast, easy and cost-effective tool for studying the cell cycle. It could help scientists study early development and how cells differentiate, grow or age. It could also be helpful for scientists studying cancer and how to treat it or scientists studying the healing process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>live-cell imaging</kwd><kwd>non-adherent cells</kwd><kwd>cell tracking</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>AML</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minucci</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro ETS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>28467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayatigolkhatmi</surname><given-names>Kourosh</given-names></name><name><surname>Minucci</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/813327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hayatigolkhatmi</surname><given-names>Kourosh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione AIRC per la ricerca sul cancro ETS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IG20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minucci</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The automated workflow significantly enhances the precision and scalability of cell cycle analysis, enabling high-throughput studies in both non-adherent and adherent cells for advanced cancer research and drug development.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell cycle dynamics coordinate cellular division and proliferation through regulating the different cell cycle phases. Dysregulation in these processes is a hallmark of malignancies such as human cancer, where aberrant activities in cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), cyclins, and CDK inhibitors often drive uncontrolled proliferation. Consequently, targeting cell cycle components has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy, especially crucial in preclinical drug evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Khan and Wang, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Traditional methods for assessing cell cycle dynamics have been largely dependent on the quantification of DNA content through flow or image cytometry, providing a static snapshot of cell populations in various cycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Furia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ligasová et al., 2023</xref>). Although valuable, these techniques fall short in capturing intra-population variability and require additional protein markers for precise phase determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ligasová et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rieger, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Methods utilizing cells expressing fluorescently labeled reporters and time-lapse microscopy can discriminate cell cycle phases at the level of individual cells, thereby offering valuable insights into the variability of cell cycle and cell cycle phase durations within the overall cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hiratsuka and Komatsu, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. Technologies like the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) have been employed for this, effectively demarcating cell cycle phases through color-coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>). FUCCI(CA)2 express the hCdt1(1/100) fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and hGem(1/110) fused to mVenus, generating a clear and distinct tricolor demarcation, separating G1 (red), S (green), and G2/M phases (yellow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This dynamic insight is particularly crucial in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where chromosomal translocations generate fusion genes that disrupt cellular differentiation programs and drive proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcalay et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The described experimental setup utilizes nanostructured titanium oxide-coated multiwell plates relying on the technology used in the commercially available Smart BioSurface (SBS) slides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krol et al., 2021</xref>). Such technology should hypothetically enable us to immobilize non-adherent cells for extended imaging durations. To overcome the limitations of manual data analysis, we introduce an automated image analysis pipeline for time-lapse videos of AML cell lines, exploiting a FUCCI-based probe for visualization. Our data analysis approach combines custom image processing, TrackMate-based cell tracking, and machine learning-based track filtering, thereby automating the entire data analysis workflow.</p><p>In summary, we present a comprehensive, experimental protocol for cell cycle analysis in adherent and non-adherent cells (summarized in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref>). The approach leverages routine imaging technologies and advanced data analyses, enhancing the precision and efficiency of drug screening protocols in oncological research.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental and analysis workflow.</title></caption><p><bold>Sample preparation (in-suspension cells):</bold></p><p>The cells of interest should be at optimum viability and physiological conditions prior to the mounting process on the SBS-multiwell plates.

Cells often exhibit a brief gap in fluorescence during this transition, as illustrated in the first image categorized as S phase in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S1. This apparent lack of fluorescence occurs because mCherry fluorescence rapidly decreases to near zero at the start of the S phase, while mVenus fluorescence begins to increase slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although seemingly non-fluorescent, this initial S phase is marked by the coexistence of both mCherry and mVenus fluorescence, producing a yellow hue in the scale before the S phase, labeled as the G1 to S transition (G1/S) by the refinement step in our model. Due to the lower intensities of mCherry and mVenus during this transitional phase, compared to other cell cycle phases, the yellow fluorescence is barely visible in fluorescence images where brightness and contrast settings are dominated by the bright G1 red and S green fluorescence.</p><p>To evaluate the relative expression of the two fluorescent probes during this transition, we conducted flow cytometry and confocal experiments on Kasumi-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the FUCCI(CA)2 probes. In these experiments, the S phase was labeled by a pulse of EdU and the DNA by DAPI or Hoechst 33342 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows cell cycle profiling based on EdU vs. DAPI can successfully discriminate G1, S, and G2/M phases, with the S phase being subdivided into early, mid, and late S phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The proportion of cells in each phase is comparable to the cell cycle profiling of the same cells by FUCCI(CA)2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, the temporal transition through the S phase discovered by EdU correlates with the mVenus emission levels detected by FUCCI(CA)2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is evident by the accumulation of the EdU-early S phase cells on the left side of FUCCI(CA)2 S phase cells (low mVenus emission). On the contrary, the EdU-late S phase cells tend to accumulate on the right side of the FUCCI(CA)2 S phase cells (high mVenus emission) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This finding is in line with the earlier observation of the relatively rapid loss of mCherry at late G1 and the gradual increase in mVenus emission throughout the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These observations suggest the possibility that FUCCI(CA)2 alone can discriminate early vs. late S phase cells.

The complete experimental workflow is explained in <xref ref-type="box" rid="box1">Box 1</xref> and illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. It was applied to the analysis of the cell cycle phases of two different AML cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have different durations. Hence, detecting this difference was a reliable initial verification strategy for the protocol’s efficiency. As a second quality check step, we decided to treat the relatively fast-cycling NB4 cells with suboptimal concentrations of three different CDK inhibitors (palbociclib, PF-06873600, and ribociclib). These CDK inhibitors have different inhibitory impact on various CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freeman-Cook et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fassl et al., 2022</xref>). The effect of the three CDK inhibitors on the cell cycle duration of NB4 cells was evaluated. Up to about 400 cells in one single experimental condition were quantified, for up to 12 different conditions in a single experiment. This entire analysis process took approximately 2 hr of human involvement, for a total execution time that ranges from 12 to 48 hr, depending on dataset size, that is commissioned to a machine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It should be taken into consideration that the manual correction of incorrect tracks takes approximately 2 hr per field of view (FOV). Hence, in the reported experiments of this study, the analysis of a single well would take about 40–50 hr of manual work. This amount of time would make such analysis unfeasible. Not only the suggested protocol makes these experiments doable, but also the experimental set-up can be scaled up according to the experimental needs. We successfully emphasized alterations of few hours in the duration of cell cycle phases when NB4 cells were subjected to exceedingly low concentrations of inhibitors. Moreover, the set-up pipeline makes possible the quantification of potentially thousands of cells in an automated fashion relying on the crucial contribution of a machine learning algorithm.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Experimental and analysis workflow.</title><p>Summary of the entire experimental workflow, from cell seeding to the calculation of cell cycle phases.

These range from creating custom supports to confine cell movement within a restricted region enabling extended imaging periods of up to 40 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Day et al., 2009</xref>), to partially immobilizing cells using substances like gelatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ritter, 2020</xref>) or low-melting-point agarose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strong and Daniels, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The capability to track non-adherent cells for up to 72 hr (almost equivalent to three complete cell cycles in NB4 cells) was achieved by employing SBS-coated glass in combination with the addition of MC to the culture medium. MC was necessary to limit the movement of single cells or cell clusters after more than 24 hr of observation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). We deduce that this seeding protocol has the potential to be effectively employed with various non-adherent cell types. This is based on the principle that cell adhesion on SBS is facilitated by the nanostructure’s ability to engage with integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulte et al., 2016</xref>), which are widely expressed in diverse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Floren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ogana et al., 2024</xref>). The seeding protocol could also certainly be extended to other types of live-cell imaging experiments, especially when the fluorescence intensity can be monitored for shorter durations, thereby circumventing the need for the addition of MC. Moreover, the image and data analysis pipelines can be easily applied to adherent cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-94689-video5.mp4" id="video5"><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Representative video of NB4 cells seeded on Smart BioSurface (SBS) without methylcellulose (MC).</title></caption></media><p>The presented image and data analysis workflows rely on two different software, Fiji and R, widely used by the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts were made publicly available, enabling customization to tailor the workflow according to specific requirements. This not only streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI(CA)2 indicator, but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge.</p><p>In conclusion, we confirm the efficiency of the optimized conditions in immobilizing the non-adherent cells for long time periods, without affecting their predicted response upon different environmental circumstances. The described work allows researchers in the field to analyze thousands of (non-)adherent cells per each experimental condition by using the image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing, cell tracking, filtering of incorrect tracks, and cell cycle phases identification and characterization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NB4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DSMZ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACC 207</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kasumi-1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DSMZ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACC 220</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MDA-MB-231</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-26</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Palbociclib</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Selleckchem</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S4482</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ribociclib</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Selleckchem</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S7440</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PF-06873600</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Selleckchem</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S8816</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">tFUCCI(CA)2/pCSII-EF</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RIKEN BRC through the National BioResource Project of the MEXT, Japan (Cat# RDB15446);<break/>Sakaue-Sawano, et al., Mol.

RNA-seq was performed according to the True-seq Low sample protocol selecting only polyadenylated transcripts. In brief, before starting mRNA isolation and library preparations, the integrity of the total RNA was evaluated by running samples on a Bioanalyzer instrument by picoRNA Chip (Agilent), then converted into libraries of double-stranded cDNA appropriate for next-generation sequencing on the Illumina platform. The Illumina TruSeq v.2 RNA Sample Preparation Kit was used following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, 0.1–1 μg of total RNA were subjected to two rounds of mRNA purification by denaturing and letting the RNA bind to Poly‐T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Then fragmentation was performed exploiting divalent cations contained in the Illumina fragmentation buffer and high temperature. First- and second-strand cDNA is reverse transcribed from fragmented RNA using random hexamers. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript II (Invitrogen) reverse transcriptase and random primers and second-strand cDNA synthesized by DNA polymerase I and Rnase H. The subsequent isolation of the cDNA was achieved by using AMPure XP beads (depending on the concentration used, these beads can efficiently recover PCR products of different sizes). The product recovered contained overhanging strands of various lengths due to the fragmentation procedure. The 5′ and 3′ ends of cDNA are repaired by the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity and the polymerase activity and adenylated at 3′ extremities before ligating specific Illumina oligonucleotides adapters followed by 15 cycles of PCR reaction using proprietary Illumina primers mix to enrich the DNA fragments.

For non-adherent cells, images were acquired with LAS X software (Leica Microsystems, version 3.7.5.24914) using a 20×/0.75NA air objective and a binning 2 × 2 was applied to increase the SNR. The mCherry and mVenus signals were detected respectively with 540–580 nm and 460–500 nm excitation filters, 585 and 505 nm dichroic mirrors, and 592–668 nm and 512–542 nm emission filters. The brightfield channel was also acquired for representation purposes. We imaged 20–25 FOVs per well and focal points were manually set in each position before starting the acquisition and kept constant during the whole time lapse thanks to the Adaptive Focus Control (AFC, Leica Microsystems).

Briefly, the pipeline executed a flat-field correction on the fluorescence channels with the plugin Basic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peng et al., 2017</xref>), then applied a Gaussian blur (sigma = 1 px), a Top Hat filter (radius = 20 px), and a background subtraction to enhance the cells’ signal; duplicated images of red and green channels were merged in a multichannel stack and brightness and contrast values were adjusted, according to each experiment, within the range of 0 to the maximum gray value of the stack’s histogram; the multichannel images were then converted into RGBs for each frame, and finally into an HSB stack from which the brightness channel and the hue channel were kept respectively for tracking and cell-phase profiling purposes; the final processed image was saved for further analysis and was composed of four channels: the red and green channels, the brightness channel, and the hue channel.</p><p>The tracking analysis was realized through TrackMate (version 7.10.2). We automatized the execution of TrackMate over all the FOVs acquired in the experiment by adapting a Jython script, freely available on the website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/scripting/scripting">https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/scripting/scripting</ext-link>). As the shape of our cells was approximately round, the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) detector was selected as the cell identifier on the brightness channel, and the Linear Assignment Problem Tracker algorithm was utilized for linking phase, adjusting the Max Linking distance parameter for each experiment. Gap closing was enabled for up to three frames, considering the significant decrease in fluorescence intensity during mitosis and the transition between G1 and S phase, that can eventually affect the detection of a cell, due to the rapid decrease of the red signal and the relatively slow increase of the green one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2017</xref>). Identified tracks were filtered for total duration, track displacement, and starting frame of the track. Specifically, the duration filter maximized the chances to follow at least one cell cycle (track duration &gt; 25 hr), while the cutoff on total displacement assures the deletion of dead cells that are usually motionless (track displacement &gt; 10 px). Tracks that start after the first 10 hr were discarded to avoid tracker errors that may give rise to unreliable cell cycle quantification as the cells tend to form clusters above 24–30 hr of experiment (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The specific values of parameters of the LoG cells’ detector (i.e., spot radius, quality threshold) were preliminarily checked on images via the TrackMate GUI, as well as the linking and gap closing max distances and the final filters on tracks’ duration, displacement and starting frame. The parameters selected manually were then inserted in the script for the batch execution. As an output, we automatically saved a table of spots for each FOV, corresponding to cells in identified tracks, with the selected TrackMate features (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Model creation</title><p>To assess the traceability of each track in a fast, efficient, and scalable manner, we employed a machine learning approach.

The dataset was divided into training and test sets, with 1855 tracks (~80%) allocated for training and 464 tracks (~20%) reserved for testing while also stratifying for the outcome variable.

Subsequently, an additional round of training was conducted using the selected hyperparameters, this time employing the entire training set. The trained model was then evaluated on an independent test set to assess its performance.

These values were comparable to those obtained from the resampling folds, indicating the absence of overfitting.</p><p>Given the relatively small size of the manually annotated training set, we performed an additional and final round of training using the pseudo-labeling framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee, 2013</xref>). The original model was used to predict unlabeled data, any predicted probability exceeding 0.5 was considered indicative of confidence in the prediction. A new semi-supervised random forest model was trained on this augmented dataset, employing the same hyperparameters as determined previously. This final model achieved an improved AUC of 0.975 on the test set, indicating enhanced track trackability assessment. The schematics of the pipeline, implemented in R (v. 4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>) using Tidymodels (v. 1.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuhn and Wickham, 2020</xref>) and Tidyverse (v.2.0.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>), can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Time-series analysis</title><p>To generate time-series-like information, we utilized the abovementioned Fiji pipeline, which provided a table containing intensity values for the red, green, and hue channels. To address missing frames resulting from tracking gaps, an EWMA was fitted to impute these frames.</p><p>To further refine the track curves, we applied a two-step smoothing process. Initially, a simple moving average (SMA) was applied, followed by fitting a fixed lambda smoothing spline with λ = 0.0001. Finally, min-max scaling is used to normalize the tracks within the range of [0, 1] to make the red and green intensity comparable.</p><p>To tackle tracking errors introduced by the Fiji pipeline, we applied the aforementioned random forest model to assess the traceability of each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>On the tracks classified as trackable, a manual threshold on the hue intensity is employed to determine the cell cycle phases (G1, S, and G2/M). Furthermore, to quantify the cell cycle at the single-cell level, track splitting to isolate individual cell components and perform phase assignment into G1, G1/S, S, and G2/M is performed using a custom R function.</p><p>The resulting single-cell tracks enabled the quantification of individual phase durations for each cell. As an example, the cell phase quantification for five different conditions can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Model deployment</title><p>The resulting model was saved as an .rds file to facilitate practical implementation. Moreover, we encapsulated the model as an API in a Docker container using Vetiver (v. 0.2.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Silge, 2023</xref>), enabling easy deployment and usage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>EdU incorporation and assessment with flow cytometry and imaging</title><p>A 2-hr EdU pulse was performed by replacing half of the total media volume of the cells with 2× concentrated EdU in the corresponding growth medium, followed by subsequent fixation. Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (CN: C10419, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Kit for Imaging, Alexa Fluor 647 dye (CN: C10340, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used for flow cytometry and imaging, respectively. The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols for the mentioned kits.</p><p>DNA staining with DAPI using 500 μl of 5 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 10<sup>6</sup> cells, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C, was additionally performed for cell cycle profiling by flow cytometry. Alternatively, 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to stain DNA for imaging purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Confocal imaging and image analysis</title><p>The confocal images were captured using the Eclipse Ti2 microscope (Nikon Europe B.V.) combined with the X-Light V3 spinning disk (CrestOptics S.p.A.), solid-state lasers from the Lumencor Celesta light engine, a multiband dichroic mirror, single-band emission filters, and an sCMOS camera (Kinetix, Teledyne Photometrics). A total of 144 and 464 FOVs were acquired using a PLAN APO λD 60 × 1.42/NA oil immersion objective lens (pixel size of 116 × 116 nm) for the Alexa647 (labeling EdU), mCherry, mVenus, and DAPI signals in Kasumi-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively.</p><p>To assess the mean intensity of each signal within the nuclei, a custom Python-based image segmentation pipeline utilizing the Stardist deep learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt, 2018</xref>) was employed. The Hoechst 33342 intensity corresponding to the 2N DNA amount was calculated, and cells in the initial S phase were selected based on being EdU positive, having mVenus and mCherry intensities above background, and a DNA content smaller than 1.15 * 2N. All data analysis was conducted using RStudio software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94689-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>TrackMate features.</title><p>This is the table of the spots that is generated after the execution of the tracking script, that automatize TrackMate plugin.

The one potentially novel finding is that they can identify cells which are at the G1-S transition by the change in color as one protein starts to go up and the other one goes down, similar to change seen as cells enter G2/M. They have provided detailed data in the resubmission, demonstrating how this can be done in different cell lines and that the resolution of the brief time is about (about 1 hr) when the cells are determined to be in the transition from G1 to S. They further showed how one can explore this period using EDU labeling in conjunction with FUCCI how one can determine whether cells have entered S-phase. This nicely addressed a weakness identified in the previous review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94689.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hayatigolkhatmi</surname><given-names>Kourosh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Soriani</surname><given-names>Chiara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Soda</surname><given-names>Emanuel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ceccacci</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>El Menna</surname><given-names>Oualid</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peri</surname><given-names>Sebastiano</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Negrelli</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tethis S.p.A.</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bertolini</surname><given-names>Giacomo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tethis S.p.A.</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Franchi</surname><given-names>Gian Martino</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tethis S.p.A.</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Carbone</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tethis S.p.A.</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Minucci</surname><given-names>Saverio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rodighiero</surname><given-names>Simona</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>European Institute of Oncology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Milan</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>Comment 1 and 2: “The pipeline relies on a large number of hard-coded conditions: size of Gaussian blur (Gaussian should be written in uppercase), values of contrast, size of filters, levels of intensity, etc. Presumably, the authors followed a heuristic approach and tried values of these and concluded that the ones proposed were optimal. A proper sensitivity analysis should be performed. That is, select a range of values of the variables and measure the effect on the output.”</p><p>“Linked to the previous comments. Other researchers that want to follow the pipeline would have either to have exactly the same acquisition conditions as the manuscript or start playing with values and try to compensate for any difference in their data (cell diameter, fluorescent intensity, etc.) to see if they can match the results of the manuscript.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his insightful comments. We have modified the “Usage” section of the GitHub page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ieoresearch/cellcycle-image-analysis">https://github.com/ieoresearch/cellcycle-image-analysis</ext-link>) to include, for each step of the image processing, a paragraph explaining the significance of the operation and a paragraph named “Suggested Values Range” where tips for optimal parameter settings are given and examples with different parameter settings are shown. We believe that these new paragraphs help researchers easily customize the pipeline to their own data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>Comment 1: “It would be useful to include frames from the movie showing a G1/S cell in Figures 1 and S1 with some indication of how long that cell is present. From Figure S4 it looks like it is substantially less than an hour.</p><p>It would definitely be nice to validate this observation. A brief pulse of EdU together with the FUCCI colors could allow you to do that in a culture of cycling cells. It appears that the green color as cells enter S-phase develops slowly (and maybe gets brighter continuously) as does the red color as cells progress through G1. It would be nice to validate what the color the cells are when they actually initiate DNA replication.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the opportunity to further investigate our results and clarify points that were unclear in the first version of the manuscript. As suggested, we have included all acquired frames depicting the G1 to S transition/early S phase of three cells: the Kasumi-1 untreated cell and the PF-06873600 treated NB4 cell shown in Fig. 1A, and the MDA-MB-231 cell shown in Fig. S1; they are shown in panels D of Fig. 4 and S5, respectively.</p><p>For the Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells, the G1 to S transition/early S phase, defined in the pipeline refinement step as a yellow phase appearing before the S phase, is visible at the 12-hour frame. Conversely, the MDA-MB-231 cell shown in Fig. S5D does not exhibit the G1 to S or early S phase, yellow; it transitions abruptly from red to green within our acquisition timeframe (30 min in this case), producing a green early S phase. This observation supports the Reviewer's suggestion that the G1 to S yellow transition is often shorter than one hour and it is not identifiable in all cells.</p><p>To further investigate this point, we also conducted the EdU experiments kindly suggested by the Reviewer. Kasumi-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells expressing the FUCCI(CA)2 probes were exposed to a pulse of EdU, and subsequently analyzed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. A new paragraph titled “The workflow allows the identification of the G1 to S phase transition” has been added to the Results section, with the corresponding data presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. S5 for Kasumi-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. The Methods section has also been updated describing the new experiments.</p><p>Additionally, in BOX1 under the 'Cell phase assignment' paragraph, point (III), we have removed point 'a. Re-assign the G2/M frames to G1'. Although theoretically possible according to the pipeline, this reassignment is incorrect in practice because mVenus fluorescence indicates that the cells are starting or have already initiated DNA replication.</p><p>All the modifications we made in the text and Figure captions are highlighted in red. We would be thankful if the co-first authorship of Kourosh Hayatigolkhatmi, Chiara Soriani and Emanuel Soda is acknowledged in the final published version of the article.</p><p>We believe that the revisions have strengthened our manuscript, and we hope that it now meets the reviewers' suggestions for greater clarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
