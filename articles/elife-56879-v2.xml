subsets linked to continuous clinical outcomes to generate new therapeutic and biomarker hypotheses. We introduce a machine learning algorithm, Risk Assessment Population IDentification (RAPID), that is unsupervised and automated, identifies phenotypically distinct cell populations, and determines whether these populations stratify patient survival. With a pilot mass cytometry dataset of 2 million cells from 28 glioblastomas, RAPID identified tumor cells whose abundance independently and continuously stratified patient survival. Statistical validation within the workflow included repeated runs of stochastic steps and cell subsampling. Biological validation used an orthogonal platform, immunohistochemistry, and a larger cohort of 73 glioblastoma patients to confirm the findings from the pilot cohort. RAPID was also validated to find known risk stratifying cells and features using published data from blood cancer. Thus, RAPID provides an automated, unsupervised approach for finding statistically and biologically significant cells using cytometry data from patient samples.</p></abstract><kwd-group

quantitative analysis of single cell data in human cancers is to move beyond human-driven identification of cell types using known markers (expert gating) to machine learning tools that can reveal and characterize novel and abnormal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diggins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenplate et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Irish, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saeys et al., 2016</xref>). Citrus, an automated analysis tool based on assignment of samples to binary categories (e.g. ‘healthy’ and ‘disease’) before testing whether cell populations are associated with these categories, was designed with this purpose in mind (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruggner et al., 2014</xref>). However, many important clinical features of patient tissue samples are reported as continuous variables, such as time to progression, overall survival, or percentage of immune infiltrate, which can be challenging to convert to arbitrary binary categories and may not be driven by a single unified cellular phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Good et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, known, healthy cell populations from different stages of development or differentiation may be required for some approaches, such as developmentally dependent predictor of relapse (DDPR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Good et al., 2018</xref>), and are not always available or fully represented for all datasets. This is especially acute for some tissues, such as brain, which may be quiescent in adults and not routinely sampled in clinical care or research. Tools are needed that can take into account continuous clinical variables that may be censored, such as overall survival or progression free survival (PFS), and which operate in an unsupervised manner. Ultimately, tools that work with high dimensional data should help users to translate findings from an algorithmic machine learning tool to common practice by identifying lower dimensional correlates that can be used to validate signatures using a complementary, clinically tractable approach. This transparency was a focus of the tool design and validation strategy used here. A computational workflow constructed for this purpose should also be validated via repeated subsampling of data to ensure the phenotypes identified are robust, by testing of different dimensionality reduction tools, by testing across multiple datasets, and by validation of prognostic signatures using complementary approaches. Finally, a practical challenge of modern single cell discovery projects is that they may often be at a project point where they are working with a smaller initial cohort (around 25 patients).

The first was a new data set of 28 glioblastoma patient samples and is described in detail below. Central findings from this first dataset were then validated using 73 additional samples analyzed using a different technology. The second was a previously published data set of 54 bone marrow samples from B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Good et al., 2018</xref>). This study was chosen as an example of a dataset in which prognostic features had already been independently identified, and so validation was assessed by whether known features were revealed by RAPID.</p><p>When applied to single cell cytometry data from human tumors, as shown here, the aim of RAPID was to reveal and characterize populations of risk stratifying cells. For this goal, glioblastoma, the cancer type in the first dataset, represents an excellent challenge, since glioblastoma is a highly heterogeneous solid tumor that is amenable to single cell approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doxie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenplate et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leelatian et al., 2017a</xref>) and where there is a great opportunity for molecular prognostic features to have an impact on new treatments and clinical care. Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is highly aggressive, and is known to contain cells with diverse genomic and transcriptomic features reflecting abnormal neural lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leelatian et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ostrom et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2016</xref>).

While differing subclasses of glioblastomas were proposed a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verhaak et al., 2010</xref>), these categories do not correspond to large differences in prognosis and are not always reflected by individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). Mosaic amplifications of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes are commonly observed in subsets of cells within a single glioblastoma tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snuderl et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that single cell analysis of glioblastoma should include signaling measurements. In other cancer types, phospho-protein signaling has repeatedly revealed cancer cell subsets that are closely linked to patient clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Good et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irish et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irish et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kotecha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that a protein-level approach in a small pilot cohort may reveal phenotypically distinct cancer cell subsets whose abundance provides new ways to stratify glioblastoma outcomes. While it is known that upstream regulators of pro-growth and pro-survival signaling are altered in brain tumors, little is known about the activation states of signaling effector proteins in single glioblastoma cells, as these features are inaccessible to sequencing modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mistry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snuderl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spitzer and Nolan, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another challenge that the RAPID algorithm was designed to address was the need to work with heterogeneous cell phenotypes and populations that might be rare and variable across patients. Cytometry data are a good match for this type of algorithm, as a large number of cells are collected from each tumor sample, the data have an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and support quantitative comparisons, and cytometry enables direct measurement of signaling pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irish et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kotecha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mistry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Myklebust et al., 2017</xref>). When glioblastoma mass cytometry data were analyzed by RAPID, both negative- and positive-prognostic phenotypes were identified, with protein-level phenotypes not described by prior studies. Statistical description of prognostic phenotypes within the RAPID algorithm then enabled the design of a simple workflow using traditional IHC, which stratified outcome in a separate set of 73 glioblastoma patient tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RAPID identifies stratifying cell subsets in an automatic and unsupervised manner</title><p>The RAPID algorithm workflow is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> using results from Dataset 1.

The first decision was the automation of the number of target clusters sought at the clustering step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, middle). This was achieved through repeated analysis with the chosen clustering tool, in this case FlowSOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van Gassen et al., 2015</xref>), followed by statistical analysis. RAPID iteratively tested a range (cluster number 5–50) of unsupervised self-organizing maps from FlowSOM to identify an appropriate number of stable clusters containing phenotypically homogenous cells. The minimum number of clusters that minimized intra-cluster variance for each feature was calculated after all iterations were completed and set as the optimized target cluster number (see Materials and methods). Clustering with other tools, such as DBSCAN, or clustering on untransformed axes, was both slower and less accurate in identifying stable, phenotypically distinct clusters, consistent with published observations (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weber and Robinson, 2016</xref>). The second decision was in assessing cluster abundance in patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, right). RAPID assigned patients to high or low abundance for each automatically identified cluster based on a statistical cut point, set as the interquartile range of the population abundance across the samples (see Materials and methods). These two decisions resulted in automation of steps that are typically manual in cytometry analysis.</p><p>After finding clusters in an unsupervised manner and determining which patients’ tumors contained a high level of each cluster, the last step in a run of RAPID was to test whether each cluster stratified risk of death. For this last test, RAPID applied a univariate Cox survival analysis to determine the correlation between the abundance of tumor cells in each cluster and patient survival outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Clusters were identified as prognostic by assessing the hazard ratio (HR) of death in patients who had either high or low abundance of the cell cluster. Negative and positive prognostic clusters were colored red or blue, respectively, if they were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with an HR that was &gt;1 (negative, red) or &lt;1 (positive, blue). The RAPID algorithm used statistical analysis of the common t-SNE, feature variance, and population abundance to automatically set all computational analysis parameters, independent of clinical outcomes.</p><p>The output of RAPID includes a PDF containing a color-coded, 2D t-SNE plot depicting all FlowSOM clusters, a 2D t-SNE plot colored by clusters which were significantly associated with patient outcome, and Kaplan-Meier survival plots of patients for each subset (additional files described in Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). To compactly report and depict the phenotype of algorithmically identified cell subsets, RAPID used Marker Enrichment Modeling (MEM) labels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diggins et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, feature enrichment was reported on a +10 to −10 scale, where +10 indicated that the feature was especially enriched in those cells and −10 indicated that the feature was specifically excluded from those cells, relative to all other cells in other clusters. The MEM label here was thus an objective description of what made each population distinct from the other clusters identified by RAPID. In summary, RAPID provided an unsupervised, automated, statistical approach to revealing and characterizing clinically significant cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of risk stratifying glioblastoma cells in Dataset 1</title><p>RAPID was designed for datasets like Dataset 1, a pilot glioblastoma mass cytometry dataset including cells collected from 28 patients with <italic>isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)</italic> wild-type glioblastoma at the time of primary surgical resection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Resected tissues were immediately dissociated into single cell suspensions as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leelatian et al., 2017b</xref>) and the resulting cells were stained with a customized antibody panel, which was designed to capture the expression of known cell surface proteins, intracellular proteins, and phospho-signaling events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

In the example case of tumor LC26, abnormal phenotypes in glioblastoma cells included co-expression of astrocytic S100B and stem-like CD133 or co-expression of markers associated with different molecular subtypes of glioblastoma, such as mesenchymal (CD44) and classical (EGFR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verhaak et al., 2010</xref>). These results with protein confirmed the existence of non-canonical cell types that had previously been observed in single-cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). The abnormal co-expression of identity proteins seen here, as well as previously reported single cell studies relying on inferred DNA alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>), indicate that the large majority of the CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> cells were likely cancer lineage cells.</p><p>Using an equal number of subsampled glioblastoma cells from each patient (see Materials and methods), a single, common t-SNE map was created to represent glioblastoma cell protein phenotypes across all patients (N = 131,880 cells; 4,710 cells x 28 patients, using 24 measured features). The RAPID algorithm, using the pooled data from all patients, identified 43 phenotypically distinct cell clusters, and then determined for each tumor whether a patient was high or low for a particular cluster using the interquartile range of abundance for that cluster. For example, for glioblastoma cluster 24, the interquartile range was 0.67% to 3.36%, resulting in a cut point of 2.69%. Those patients with ≤2.69% were designated ‘low’ for cluster 24 while those with &gt;2.69% were assigned to the ‘high’ group. Additional cut points, based on splitting populations into quartiles or tertiles, were tested and resulted in consistent prognostic phenotypes (the average F-measure of patients being consistently assigned to the high, low, or neither categories identified below was 0.86).

Most notably, the signaling features p-S6, p-SYK, and p-4EBP1, which were important features positively associated with relapse in the DDPR model, were enriched in the negative prognostic populations identified by RAPID.

For the tumors studied here, the number of live glioblastoma cells ranged from 4,710 to 330,000 cells per patient.

Similarly, a 1% increase in GPP cells was associated with an approximately 7% decrease in mortality rate (OS HR = 0.93 [0.87–1.0], p=0.05) and an approximately 4% increase in time to tumor progression, as compared to baseline (PFS HR = 0.96 [0.93–0.998], p=0.04).

Ultimately, the RAPID algorithm was tested using numerous statistical approaches, validated with two datasets, and validated as revealing biologically robust cells detectable on other platforms in a larger follow up cohort with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Prior workflows and algorithms were developed to identify cell populations of interest in cancer samples and emphasized supervised modeling, as with Citrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruggner et al., 2014</xref>) and Cytofast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beyrend et al., 2018</xref>), or comparison to known subsets, as with DDPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Good et al., 2018</xref>) and Phenograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine et al., 2015</xref>). These approaches could not be used with Dataset 1, either because they required a level of prior knowledge about non-malignant adult human brain cells which was not available, or because they required supervision using categorical outcomes, which are not always clearly delineated for continuous variables. Another advantage of RAPID is that it does not require a target cluster number, which is important when it is not known how many phenotypically distinct subsets will be observed in a given cancer type. Cell subsets in tumors can be challenging to manually annotate as they may reasonably be assigned to multiple known cell types, as was apparent here and in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). RAPID is unsupervised, provides a quantitative label of features enriched in each cluster, and is modular, such that a variety of dimensionality reduction and clustering tools can be used. Currently, a user inputs raw data files (e.g., FCS files from cytometry platforms or equivalent data types from other platforms) and annotated patient survival data. The recommended use of RAPID is to run the full algorithm at least 10 times to seek consensus populations that are stable in phenotype and risk stratification. Both single-run implementation for discovery and a version using these best practices are included as R markdown scripts on the RAPID Github page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cytolab/RAPID">https://github.com/cytolab/RAPID</ext-link>). RAPID outputs quantitatively described cell clusters and their significance with respect to patient outcome. While the focus of this study was cytometry data, the design is suitable to other single cell data types where clinical outcomes or similar continuous variables have been scored for pilot cohorts, typically at least 25 individuals. Published datasets were not available for single-cell RNA-seq that matched the criteria for RAPID, including having thousands of cells per sample, more than 25 individuals with annotated clinical outcomes, and multiple features scored consistently for every cell. As single cell RNA-seq and imaging cytometry technologies advance, we anticipate RAPID will be useful for such datasets, especially given how widespread t-SNE, UMAP, and related approaches are within these fields.</p><p>The utility of RAPID includes its ability to identify stable, robust clusters that are independent of known prognosticators, provide users with opportunities to customize the workflow with a variety of tools, and inform subsequent studies on validation datasets or using different technologies. Here, RAPID was extensively probed for its performance in each of these areas. By repeated subsampling of each tumor and iterative FlowSOM analyses, clusters with consistent cell content and phenotypes observed in the majority of subsamplings were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, these clusters were independently associated with continuous clinical variables - patient overall survival and PFS. A subsequent, low dimensional decision tree applied to both mass cytometry data and a new set of patient samples stained via IHC was also able to stratify patients, suggesting that the biology learned from the high dimensional approach could be used to inform complementary approaches. Critically, RAPID was also used to analyze a dataset from different tissue in a different disease collected at a different institution, Dataset 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Good et al., 2018</xref>). In this application of RAPID, features previously identified by the original authors to be associated with time to relapse were re-captured, identifying cellular phenotypes concordant with prior results without requiring the normal developmental trajectory reference used in the original analysis.</p><p>Within Dataset 1 analyzing 28 <italic>IDH</italic> wild-type pre-therapy glioblastoma patient samples, the RAPID workflow automatically uncovered two prognostic phenotypic signatures which were independent of other known predictors of outcome. Glioblastoma Negative Prognostic (GNP) cells, characterized by enrichment for S100B, SOX2, p-STAT3, and p-STAT5, were associated with decreased overall survival, while Glioblastoma Positive Prognostic (GPP) cells, characterized by co-enrichment of EGFR and CD44 proteins, were associated with longer overall survival. Once revealed in high-dimensional data, a simple gating scheme using S100B and EGFR could be used to stratify outcome in a separate, expanded set of samples using traditional pathological approaches. High-dimensional cytometry and RAPID were critical to revealing novel prognostic cells in glioblastoma data in two ways. First, assessment of a large number of cells per tumor – over 2 million viable single cells, with at least 4,710 glioblastoma cells from each patient - enabled the use of an unsupervised approach in the identification of rare, novel cell subsets across patients. Second, per-cell quantification of phosphorylated signaling effector proteins revealed potential mechanisms of tumor cell regulation that are not readily apparent in bulk tumor data, genomic analyses, or lower dimensional approaches such as one- to four-color imaging.

RAPID also uncovered a connection between p-STAT5 and glioblastoma outcome previously unidentified in primary patient samples. STAT5 signaling is required in development of many tissues to block apoptosis and drive cell cycle entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Irish et al., 2006</xref>) for example, p-STAT5 is an essential feature of negative prognostic acute myeloid leukemia signaling profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irish et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine et al., 2015</xref>). The signaling events of the negative and positive prognostic cells can now be studied in glioblastoma research models, such as patient xenografts and glioblastoma organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhaduri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hubert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacob et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ogawa et al., 2018</xref>), using new combinations of targeted therapies, such as JAK inhibitors that target molecules upstream of STAT5 and STAT3, in combination with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors, which will target molecules upstream of AKT and S6 signaling. In this way, new combinations of existing therapies may prove useful in targeting the signaling that defines the negative prognostic cells seen here.</p><p>Recent work using single cell gene expression has described the existence of multiple cellular states in glioblastoma tumors and the ability of cells to transition between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neftel et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to most transcript-based studies, RAPID analyses were performed on cells collected at a single timepoint, precluding a direct investigation of the ability of GNP or GPP cells to transition to other phenotypes; however, it is possible that phosphorylated, active STAT3, STAT5, and S6 may enable transition between progenitor-like states as they do in earlier development, and thus influence patient outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rushing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoshimatsu et al., 2006</xref>). Another key research question for the future will be whether the signature features of the risk stratifying cells seen here will also be seen in other types of intractable human malignancies. Intriguingly, p-STAT5, p-ERK, and p-STAT3 signaling profiles reminiscent of the negative prognostic cells from glioblastoma have been seen in leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Irish et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kotecha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine et al., 2015</xref>) and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gonzalez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The GPP signature, in contrast, was defined by EGFR and CD44 co-enrichment, diminished evidence of proliferation, and specific lack of STAT5 phosphorylation. GPP cells were further associated with higher proportions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. This result suggests an understanding of prognostic cell content or biomarkers may be relevant for immunotherapy research in glioblastoma. Previous DNA and RNA-driven molecular subtyping predicts EGFR expression in the classical subset of glioblastoma tumors and CD44 expression in mesenchymal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verhaak et al., 2010</xref>). As these categories were primarily based on bulk tumor data, cells co-expressing EGFR and CD44 (classified as GPP cells in this study) may have previously been missed, although single glioma cells have been shown to simultaneously amplify sequence or co-express transcripts for important signaling regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snuderl et al., 2011</xref>). EGFR has been extensively studied as a driver of gliomas in the past (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saadeh et al., 2018</xref>), and the association of this gene and transcript with outcome has been a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saadeh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). This study finds that expression of EGFR protein is associated with better overall survival. One reason for the difference between this study and other reports may be that EGFR protein levels were measured in individual cells rather than copy number analysis or transcript levels in bulk tumor samples; our own analyses and others’ have indicated that copy number or transcript level are not necessarily predictive of protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brennan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakravarty et al., 2017</xref>). Although antibody-based methods for protein detection, like those used here, depend on the specificity of each selected clone, it is important to note that two different, rigorously validated antibodies (mass cytometry, clone AY13; TMA, clone A-10) gave the same results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). S100B has been explored as a serum biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holla et al., 2016</xref>), and S100B is known for its impact on macrophages, including microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). These features of negative and positive prognostic cells extend the single cell phospho-specific flow cytometry approach to a new solid tumor that is in urgent need of new biological insights and targets.</p><p>When applied to a new glioblastoma dataset as well as a previously published study of blood cancer, RAPID reliably identified cells whose abundance was predictive of good or poor outcome. Cellular identification was robust, stable, and reproducible, and independent of the specific dimensionality reduction tools used. Critically, the discoveries from RAPID were able to inform a scoring system for detection of GNP-like and GPP-like phenotypes in IHC data that stratified patient outcome in 73 patient samples. RAPID also led to the development of a lower-dimensional cytometry pipeline which could be optimized for clinical stratification. There is now the exciting potential to extend the hypotheses suggested by RAPID into clinical research studies using either traditional flow cytometry or IHC on widely available formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, as in the biological validation here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, techniques accessible to clinical research, such as IHC, could be informed by the results from RAPID and envisioned as a way to assign glioblastoma patients to treatment groups in early phase clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Rhodium viability stain and cleaved caspase-3 antibody were included in staining to exclude non-viable and apoptotic cells, respectively. Detection of total histone H3 was used to identify intact, nucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leelatian et al., 2017a</xref>). A 34-dimensional mass cytometry antibody panel was used to analyze over 2 million viable cells from 28 tumors (ranging from 4860 to 336,284 cells per tumor). Data were normalized with MATLAB-based normalization software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finck et al., 2013</xref>), and were arcsinh transformed (cofactor 5), prior to analysis using the Cytobank platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kotecha et al., 2010</xref>). Positively identified cells were defined by having signal above 10 on any channel on which an antibody was used to detect antigen. A patient-specific t-SNE view was generated, using 26 of the measured markers for all tumor and stromal cells from each patient’s tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Immune (CD45<sup>+</sup>) and endothelial cells (CD31<sup>+</sup>) were computationally excluded from each individual patient prior to subsequent downstream analysis. Remaining CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> cells were included in a common t-SNE analysis, generated using 24 of 34 measured markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Distribution of each of the 28 patients’ cells on the common t-SNE axes and mass intensity for each marker are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>.

Cell subset identification was performed using the previously published FlowSOM R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van Gassen et al., 2015</xref>). t-SNE values (t-SNE1_glioblastoma and t-SNE2_glioblastoma) from t-SNE (or UMAP values from UMAP) analysis of CD45<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup> glioblastoma cells from 28 patients were used as parameters for cell subset clustering. Within the RAPID workflow, the optimal number of clusters was determined by first identifying, for each feature, the smallest number of clusters that minimizes the intra-cluster signal variance for that feature. Then, the optimal cluster number of the data set was determined by taking the median of the optimal numbers for each individual feature. Once the cluster number was determined, the abundance of cell subsets and their clinical significance was assessed using outcome-guided analysis. Patients were divided into Low and High groups, based on the distribution (interquartile variance, IQR) of the abundance of a given cell subset across the cohort. A univariate Cox regression analysis was then used to estimate the effect size (hazard ratio, HR, of death) on survival and quantify its statistical significance with a p-value. The RAPID program output included: 1) a PDF containing two color coded, 2D t-SNE (or UMAP) plots (.png), one depicting all FlowSOM clusters and one depicting prognostic status and p-value, Kaplan-Meier survival plots of patients for each subset; 2) MEM outputs including a PDF of the MEM heatmap as well as. txt files of MEM and Median values for each feature, enrichment scores, and IQR values; 3) a .txt file of the FlowSOM cluster value for prognostic subsets, a .txt file of survival statistics for each FlowSOM cluster, and a .csv file with subset abundance information per patient;and 4) new FCS files with added columns for cluster and prognostic status for each cell. In this study, abundance of Glioblastoma Negative Prognostic (GNP) and Glioblastoma Positive Prognostic (GPP) cells in each tumor was quantified as percentages per total glioblastoma cells (i.e. immune and endothelial cells were already excluded). Total GNP and GPP cell abundance was determined for each patient by adding the events in all GNP (or GPP subsets, respectively) together. GNP high patients were identified as containing more GNP cells than the IQR of total GNP abundance (3.1%). GPP high patients were defined in the same manner (total GPP cell abundance IQR = 8.58%). MEM analysis was performed in R, using the previously published R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diggins et al., 2017</xref>). In short, MEM captured and quantified cell subset-specific feature enrichment by scaling the magnitude (median) differences between clusters, depending on the spread (IQR) of the data. These values were then computed in comparison to the remaining cells in a given dataset. MEM values were interpreted as either being positively enriched (▲, UP positive values) or negatively enriched (▼, DN negative values). The variation of a given cellular feature across GNP or GPP cell subsets was quantified as ± standard deviations (SD). For the primary data set used in this study (131,880 cells), RAPID ran in 15 min from start to finish after dimensionality reduction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Cluster stability testing</title><p>Ten independent t-SNE analyses were performed on equal numbers of randomly sampled cells from each patient (4,710 cells per patient, 131,880 total cells). RAPID was used to analyze each of these ten t-SNE runs. For each sub-sampling of cells and the respective t-SNE, an additional 99 FlowSOM clusterings were performed without setting a seed for reproducible results. After each analysis, an F-measure was calculated per cluster, measuring both the precision and recall of cell assignment. After 100 total FlowSOM runs, each of the original clusters had an average F-measure, interpreted here as a measure of cluster stability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Survival and statistical analysis</title><p>Time from surgical resection to death (overall survival, OS) and time from surgical resection to the initial radiographic recurrence or death before radiographic assessment (PFS) were depicted using right-censored Kaplan-Meier curves and analyzed in R.

The data were fit using R software, version 3.5 (R foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The proportional-hazards assumption was tested in all multivariate models and supported by a non-significant relationship between Schoenfeld residuals and time for each covariate included in the model (p &gt; 0.38; degree of freedom = 1) and the overall model (p = 0.96; degrees of freedom = 6 and 7). Statistical significance α was set at 0.05 for all statistical analyses, one- or two-tailed noted in figure legends.</p><p>An F-measure was used to quantify the level of agreement between classifications of patients or cells between alternative analysis strategies as wells as multiple RAPID iterations. The F-measure is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall given by the equation F = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) where Precision = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive) and Recall = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative). An F-measure of 1 indicates perfect agreement between two different strategies or iterations as opposed to an F-measure of 0 which would mean no agreement between classifications of patients or cells from two strategies or iterations. Patients could be classified as GNP high, GNP and GPP low, or GPP high, while cells were classified as GNP, GPP, or neither. None of the patients in this study were classified as both GNP high and GPP high. To calculate the F-measure of patient categorization, the classification of the 28 patients into the three prognostic groups from the t-SNE implementation of RAPID was used as the reference point from which to compare patient classification resulting from the UMAP implementation of RAPID. Similarly, the stability of the RAPID workflow in assigning cells to GNP, GPP, or non-significant clusters was tested by using the t-SNE implementation of RAPID (FlowSOM seed 38) as the reference from which to compare 100 iterations of RAPID (random FlowSOM seed per iteration). Calculation of the F-measure was implemented using R software, version 3.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Computer specifications</title><p>R was downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/">https://cran.r-project.org/bin/</ext-link> and implemented using the R Studio GUI <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</ext-link>.

pipelines that can couple these experiments to clinical outcome and other variables in an unsupervised manner, and that can provide functional hypotheses that can be later tested in other cohorts in a simplified manner. Here, the authors have built RAPID, an algorithm that can take single-cell cytometry data as input and have extensively tested it in two cancer datasets, identifying populations of risk-stratifying cells. We envision that in years to come, RAPID will be able to identify markers correlated with important clinical characteristics, and that the functional relationships it finds and are confirmed will be useful for clinical practice.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;High risk glioblastoma cells revealed by machine learning and single cell signaling profiles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers, whose assessments are included below, agreed that RAPID is potentially interesting and useful to the scientific community but the lack of access to the code to test it prevents further assessment. In discussion, they agreed it is necessary for code and data to be accessible before publication for reviewers' perusal. Additionally, they considered the claim that biological findings &quot;could be immediately used to guide clinical design&quot; misguided, as an extensive comparison with existing literature has not been undertaken and extrapolates from results in a very small number of patients. Another suggestion for improving the work include analysing a larger validation cohort to establish the performance of RAPID in different datasets and under different conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, Leelatian and collaborators study a set of 28 resected glioblastoma tissues from as many patients through single-cell technologies assessing 34 phospho-proteins, transcription factors and lineage proteins. They develop 2 technologies: 1) a set of 34 antibodies for single cell mass cytometry and 2) an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called RAPID – which is able to identify phenotypically similar cells (&quot;clusters&quot;) and their association to survival variables.</p><p>I think the scale of the work is impressive (the study analyses &gt;2 million cells) and the methodology seems very useful. However, there are a few issues that I think would need to be addressed before this manuscript is published.</p><p>1) I believe the software to be the main contribution of this manuscript, as the two proteins discovered at the end of the single-cell RAPID analysis have been studied in the context of glioblastoma/glioma and survival before (more of this below, but e.g., PMIDs 9445288, 28693199, 28885661, 27401156, 23719262). The data needs to be made publicly available, the same as the software. It says in the manuscript that it will be done so upon publication, but it absolutely needs to be released by the time the manuscript is published. At the moment it is impossible for me to assess whether RAPID may be easy to use, what variables it needs as input, and how easy it may be to install. Also, I do not know if the authors plan to release a detailed user manual, something that would be essential for publishing a piece of software.</p><p>2) I believe that the validation of the software needs to be done on more than one existing single-cell dataset, if possible. The fact that running different iterations of RAPID resulted in highly variable results in the same dataset (18 to 48 clusters identified), and that only one cluster overlapped in the OS vs PFS analyses calls, in my opinion, for more extensive testing. It's interesting that only 7 out of the 43 clusters identified when all cells were put together were considered &quot;universal&quot;. Does this mean that this technique is highly susceptible to the number of tumours tested? Hopefully the software is easy to run and answers to these questions can be achieved relatively easily.</p><p>3) How do the authors reconcile their results with the observations by other studies that EGFR overexpression is associated with poor prognosis glioblastoma, seemingly contrary to the results in this study? (e.g. PMIDs 29445288, 28693199, 28885661). Linked to this point, I believe that the results are overhyped at times. For example, the phrase &quot;These findings could be used immediately to guide clinical trial design&quot; should be either removed or rewritten in a more measured way. Which population did the authors study, only European-descent (i.e. white) patients? Also, the number of samples is quite small for such a claim. Generalising in this way would be hurtful to global clinical practice.</p><p>4) About the classification of tumours into high/low for distinct markers. Two tumours may be highly similar and classified in different groups (in the example given in the text, tumours with 2.68% of cells in the cluster were classified as “low” but those with 2.7% as “high”). Would the conclusions be maintained if the high group was defined as those above the 75th percentile and the low group below the 25th percentile? How important is this definition to the results of the RAPID workflow?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a potentially interesting manuscript that seeks to profile glioblastoma samples by mass cytometry to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity at the protein level. The authors profile a large number of cells in 28 samples using 34 markers (retaining 26 markers in final set). They then use this information (with various filtering steps) to identify modules of variability within tumors and then use some of those modules/signatures to stratify patients’ outcome with a machine learning approach. They suggest that their findings can be &quot;immediately&quot; used to inform clinical trial design.</p><p>The study suffers from intrinsic limitations that are hard to overcome and that would be acceptable if the authors had not jumped to conclusions, they do not have the power to support. First, the analysis relies on 26 measured proteins, which is a rather limited set of parameters; any analysis that relies on protein measurement is also only as good as the antibody used and one should keep in mind that some of the clusters inferred might be technical; hence any major statement would require some form of validation by other approaches which is mostly lacking in this manuscript. But all that would be addressable/ok, if the authors had been more reasonable in their conclusions.</p><p>By far the main limitation and major caveat this reviewer sees is that the authors draw major conclusions on stratifying GBM patients for their outcome based on a cohort of 28 patients. This is massively underpowered to address patient stratification. The markers they home on are nothing very new (EGFR, SOX2, S100 etc) that have been interrogated in much larger cohorts (TCGA has &gt;400 samples) and have not yielded as valuable information as claimed by the authors.</p><p>This study would only be useful if the 28 samples were a discovery cohort and their findings were validated in hundreds of patients’ samples. If EGFR was that good at predicting outcome of GBM, we would know by now. So unfortunately, underpowered study for the claims on outcome. The mass cytometry profile/data would be of interest if followed-up, but not for survival analysis given limited dataset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Leelatian, Sinnaeve et al. describes a single-cell mass cytometry data-set measuring 34 proteins and phospho-proteins across 28 glioblastoma patients. This represents a rich data-set which the authors take advantage to develop a novel computational tool, RAPID, to identify cell type clusters that inform on patient survival. This approach identified 9 cell clusters that stratified patients according to their overall survival, and these can be classified into negative and positive prognostic using S100B and EGFR protein abundance.</p><p>Although further work would be required to confirm the robustness and utility of these findings to the clinic, this study presents novel insights, tools and data-sets that will be of interest to the scientific community.</p><p>1) The separation and classification of the 43 cell clusters (Figure 1B) is not very clear. Consistently, these varied extensively across the 10 down-sample analyses with 18-48 optimal clusters. Have the authors tried multiple configurations of the tSNE parameters (e.g. perplexity, learning rate)? Clustering could also be compared to current state-of-the-art pipelines (PMID: 31217225), for example running Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a pre-processing step before the non-linear tSNE.</p><p>2) Several clusters of glioblastoma cell types exist (Figure 2A), in particular a subset (lower left) seems to have a heterogeneous expression of Nestin and strong phosphorylation of AKT. Is this a common observation across other patient samples? If so, what is the percentage of cells this represents and could there be an impact on the analysis if this population, like the other cell types, were removed? Additionally, p-AKT is enriched in GNP cluster 37 and GPP cluster 41. Specifically, GPP cluster 41 is the only cluster enriched in 2 patients (LC03 and LC09) which are classified as GNP. To me this is counterintuitive, and might indicate some unique variation, either true biological or artefact, of this cell type.</p><p>3) The potential translation into the clinic seems to be one of the main messages of the manuscript and is indeed particularly interesting. Specifically, the fact that only S100B and EGFR expression is enough to stratify patient overall survival. Could the observations gained from the single-cell experiments be used to re-analyse bulk patient genomic and proteomic data-sets to support further the clinical relevance of these findings? For example, what is the percentage of glioblastoma <italic>IDH1</italic> wild type patients with S100B and EGFR high or low?</p><p>4) The availability of RAPID as a tool to the community is important and a positive aspect of this work. Thus, I believe the source should have been made accessible prior to publication.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Unsupervised machine learning reveals risk stratifying glioblastoma tumor cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Julie Laffy (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus, the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, Leelatian, Sinnaeve and collaborators introduce the RAPID algorithm for identifying clusters of cells relevant for stratification of patient survival in single-cell datasets, especially mass cytometry datasets including more than 25 patients. In this new version, they have tested RAPID with two datasets from different cancer types, one generated by them and another one already published, and have performed extensive statistical validation both technical and biological.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>Please address the following points raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1) Clustering is performed across all tumours combined, so the authors should distinguish inter-tumour effects from the intra-tumour effects that they describe. Could they show for example that the cluster phenotypes are derivable from a significant number of individual tumours? Inter-tumour effects would imply some different conclusions to the ones the authors draw, depending on the patient specificities of these effects. Assuming no patient specificity, one potentially interesting and even complementary conclusion would be that basal levels of certain proteins in a tumour are indicative of patient outcome (indiscriminately of any particular cellular subpopulation). Do the authors see that EGFR, S100B and other enriched proteins vary primarily within, or between, tumours? To check for patient specificity, the authors should state in the text i) which, if any, clusters were largely tumour-specific and ii) how many tumours contributed to each of the clusters. Without these figures, the biological relevance of each of the clusters (namely the NP and PP subsets) is difficult to assess. It might also be useful to add tSNE plots coloured by patient alongside the existing plots (Figures 1B, 2A, 4A). If there are indeed clusters dominated by individual tumours, I would think that they should be removed early on in the RAPID pipeline. If there are many such cases, then perhaps the authors would have to consider an alternative clustering approach.</p><p>2) Do any of the cell subsets identified (Figure 1B, C) reflect a proneural population? This is a known component of glioblastomas and has moreover been postulated to be associated with better prognosis because it is the dominant component in lower-grade gliomas (e.g. Verhaak et al., 2010). How do the authors reconcile this with their own findings? Or, if a proneural phenotype is lacking, could the authors comment on why that might be? One reason could be technical: simply that proneural markers were not sufficiently represented in the panel. If that is the case, the authors should acknowledge this in the text and take care not to overstate their results pertaining to the phenotypes of NP and PP subsets in GBM.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56879.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The results from this test were last in the original Supplemental Figure 6 and have now been moved into the main text (Figure 2) and emphasized in the Results to highlight this important validation. We sought additional test datasets, but there were not published, annotated, single cell datasets that met the criteria for this study.

Note that we believe it is an advantage of RAPID to aim to be independent of user input and bias. Thus, we prefer to avoid having the user specify a target number of clusters, although it is possible to use the RAPID code in a way where the user can specify this number (and set a seed to achieve deterministic, invariable results). The additional statistical testing includes iterative FlowSOM runs, multiple runs of t-SNE, and comparison of subset features across many such runs to identify stable clusters and phenotypes. These results are now included as main Figure 3 and are graphically summarized in new panels in Figure 1C. Critically, while different absolute numbers of clusters were identified, the cellular phenotypes identified by RAPID from these clusters were consistent across runs and cell subsampling (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How do the authors reconcile their results with the observations by other studies that EGFR overexpression is associated with poor prognosis glioblastoma, seemingly contrary to the results in this study?

Patient samples are reflective of the general demographics of patients at our institution (27 Caucasian patients and 1 African American patient).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) About the classification of tumours into high/low for distinct markers. Two tumours may be highly similar and classified in different groups (in the example given in the text, tumours with 2.68% of cells in the cluster were classified as “low” but those with 2.7% as “high”). Would the conclusions be maintained if the high group was defined as those above the 75th percentile and the low group below the 25th percentile? How important is this definition to the results of the RAPID workflow?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point about the cutoff potentially being arbitrary and have address this directly in two ways. 1) In the revised manuscript we tried several cutpoints, including the 25%/75% approach suggested above, and found that the f-measure for patients falling into the same group is 0.86. 2) We also complemented the cutpoint version of the analysis with a continuous analysis using a multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model analysis that assessed GNP and GPP content as continuous features instead of using a cutpoint (now reported in the results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a potentially interesting manuscript that seeks to profile glioblastoma samples by mass cytometry to assess intra-tumoral heterogeneity at the protein level. The authors profile a large number of cells in 28 samples using 34 markers (retaining 26 markers in final set). They then use this information (with various filtering steps) to identify modules of variability within tumors and then use some of those modules/signatures to stratify patients’ outcome with a machine learning approach. They suggest that their findings can be &quot;immediately&quot; used to inform clinical trial design.</p><p>The study suffers from intrinsic limitations that are hard to overcome and that would be acceptable if the authors had not jumped to conclusions, they do not have the power to support.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern that our wording was too strong for the data that we present. We have tempered our language throughout the manuscript to avoid over-stating conclusions and to focus on the utility of RAPID as a discovery tool that can generate hypotheses for further clinical research with other techniques (as in the IHC validation example included for Dataset 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, the analysis relies on 26 measured proteins, which is a rather limited set of parameters; any analysis that relies on protein measurement is also only as good as the antibody used and one should keep in mind that some of the clusters inferred might be technical; hence any major statement would require some form of validation by other approaches which is mostly lacking in this manuscript. But all that would be addressable/ok, if the authors had been more reasonable in their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out that the validity of mass cytometry data, like other antibody-based approaches, is dependent on the quality of antibodies used for detection of features of interest. Our antibodies were rigorously validated and titrated on known controls prior to use on patient samples, and many of these antibodies have been published previously (Leelatian et al., 2017 and the companion protocol, Leelatian et al., 2017). We used IHC with different, validated antibody clones used routinely in our tissue pathology core to confirm the major findings (S100B v EGFR) in additional patient samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By far the main limitation and major caveat this reviewer sees is that the authors draw major conclusions on stratifying GBM patients for their outcome based on a cohort of 28 patients. This is massively underpowered to address patient stratification.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern; for this reason, we included a tissue microarray with 73 cases for validation of the key biological features identified in the 28 dissociated samples used for mass cytometry analysis (Figure 5). In this case, the effect size of GNP/GPP prevalence is large relative to other studies reporting outcome stratification, and we were able to validate this stratification in an independent cohort.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The markers they home on are nothing very new (EGFR, SOX2, S100 etc) that have been interrogated in much larger cohorts (TCGA has &gt;400 samples) and have not yielded as valuable information as claimed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly notes that EGFR, SOX2, and S100B have been investigated in GBM studies previously. The surprising finding in our work is not the specific features, all of which were included in our panel based on prior results, but that the abnormal co-expression of them at the protein level reveals new, previously unappreciated subsets, which also have distinct signaling phenotypes. The vast majority of GBM studies are based on measuring DNA and RNA, especially in bulk tumor samples, cell lines, or ex vivo conditions. We expect that transcript levels may give different results from protein measurements, especially when considered coordinately with other features rather than as a single variable. By combining primary patient samples from resected tumors and protein measurements, we sought to add to the field. We would note that the unexpected finding regarding EGFR revealing a subset of cells correlated with better outcomes, which was validated using traditional IHC, indicates how we can find unexpected and useful results with well-studied markers when assessing them at the single cell level using unsupervised analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study would only be useful if the 28 samples were a discovery cohort and their findings were validated in hundreds of patients’ samples. If EGFR was that good at predicting outcome of GBM, we would know by now. So unfortunately, underpowered study for the claims on outcome. The mass cytometry profile/data would be of interest if followed-up, but not for survival analysis given limited dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding a pilot cohort size of N=28. For this reason, we tested whether the features most enriched on stable, risk-stratifying clusters found in our mass cytometry dataset could then stratify outcome in a separate, immunohistochemical analysis of N=73 glioblastoma cases. We agree that testing of the mass cytometry approach in a very large cohort would also be an exciting cancer biology advance, but it is beyond the scope of the present study focused on the RAPID algorithm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The separation and classification of the 43 cell clusters (Figure 1B) is not very clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and have expanded both graphical depictions of our analysis (in Figure 1) and explanations in the text. In brief, RAPID employs a clustering algorithm called FlowSOM that builds self-organizing maps, based on t-SNE values, then groups nodes together based on similarity and the number of clusters input by the user. To avoid user bias in determining a cluster number, RAPID iteratively performed FlowSOM analyses from 5 to 50 clusters and chose a number that minimized intra-cluster variance for each feature. In Figure 1B, the clusters are projected back onto the t-SNE plot. We have also amended the Materials and methods to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Consistently, these varied extensively across the 10 down-sample analyses with 18-48 optimal clusters. Have the authors tried multiple configurations of the tSNE parameters (e.g. perplexity, learning rate)?</p></disp-quote><p>This question was addressed above in the reply to reviewer 1. Briefly, we have included a section on cell subsampling to directly address this concern.</p><p>Work in our own labs, as well as that by others (PMID: 31780669) suggest that increasing perplexity in t-SNE beyond optimized values, like those used here, does not significantly alter the results. We have tried different t-SNE parameters, run RAPID without using t-SNE, and run RAPID with UMAP (Figure 4), and the main results of the study are consistently observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clustering could also be compared to current state-of-the-art pipelines (PMID: 31217225), for example running Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a pre-processing step before the non-linear tSNE.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. PCA is routinely used as a pre-processing step in RNA-seq analysis prior to t-SNE implementation, due to the large number of genes measured, lack of dynamic range relative to noise, and preponderance of zero values (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html). As a result of using targeted measurements and ionizing mass spectrometry, mass cytometry data do not have these issues (multiple log dynamic range, no zero / drop out, and a smaller number of highly impactful features measure). PCA analysis does not significantly reduce the dimensionality of mass cytometry data, as most of the measured features are non-redundant. Thus, PCA is not needed prior to t-SNE and, when used, does not significantly alter the resulting embedding. Notably, UMAP, which focuses more on global structure (more like PCA), returned similar results to the locally-oriented t-SNE analysis. Our workflow is otherwise comparable to the cited workflow, beginning with data clean up (which differs for sequencing data and cytometry data) followed by dimensionality reduction and clustering, (original modular workflow PMID: 25979346, reviewed in PMID: 27320317, updated regularly).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Several clusters of glioblastoma cell types exist (Figure 2A), in particular a subset (lower left) seems to have a heterogeneous expression of Nestin and strong phosphorylation of AKT. Is this a common observation across other patient samples? If so, what is the percentage of cells this represents and could there be an impact on the analysis if this population, like the other cell types, were removed?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s observation that several clusters of GBM cells exist is excellent and part of what inspired the development of RAPID to interrogate these clusters. The RAPID analysis will be impacted by which cells are included or excluded. To address this concern, we ran ten separate t-SNE analyses, subsampling cells each time (Statistical validation 2, Figure 3). In this revised manuscript, we have also included additional testing to assess how stable particular clusters and phenotypes are across multiple runs of t-SNE and FlowSOM. These improvements are highlighted in Figure 3.</p><p>In the specific case of Nestin/p-AKT, additional tumors in the cohort also have cells with this phenotype, though none as abundantly as LC26. The population is 7.61% of the LC26 tumor cells (9,220 cells out of 30,091). We also included patient-specific t-SNE maps with heat for all antigens, and % abundance for all clusters, as supplemental data (currently available as a PDF at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/632208v3.supplementary-material).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, p-AKT is enriched in GNP cluster 37 and GPP cluster 41. Specifically, GPP cluster 41 is the only cluster enriched in 2 patients (LC03 and LC09) which are classified as GNP. To me this is counterintuitive, and might indicate some unique variation, either true biological or artefact, of this cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in pointing out that p-AKT is enriched in GNP cluster 37 and GPP cluster 41. In our revised manuscript, cluster 41, while highly distinct when present, was not stable across multiple iterations of cell subsampling and therefore was removed from analyses of GNP/GPP. Relative to the other patients, LC03 and LC09 are enriched for cluster 41, but relative to their own tumor cell content, they have more GNP cells. We report that GNP cell content is the primary predictor of overall survival, suggesting that it is the balance of GNP and GPP cells that is indicative of a patient’s prognosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The potential translation into the clinic seems to be one of the main messages of the manuscript and is indeed particularly interesting. Specifically, the fact that only S100B and EGFR expression is enough to stratify patient overall survival. Could the observations gained from the single-cell experiments be used to re-analyse bulk patient genomic and proteomic data-sets to support further the clinical relevance of these findings? For example, what is the percentage of glioblastoma IDH1 wild type patients with S100B and EGFR high or low?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s enthusiasm for applying our findings and envision the results being widely applied to current or future GBM data sets and in clinical research. However, bulk analysis techniques which aggregate signals from all cells may lack resolution needed to observe key findings, especially in tumors with large proportions of infiltrating immune cells. Currently, there are many fewer samples in TCGA (N=50) for which bulk proteomic data and outcome are available – notably, fewer than the number included in the validation set here (N=73).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The availability of RAPID as a tool to the community is important and a positive aspect of this work. Thus, I believe the source should have been made accessible prior to publication.</p></disp-quote><p>All data and code were available to reviewers during the prior review at https://flowrepository.org/id/RvFrKN2ctDJmmVNE4ZnMJrAZeVraXbwvrhjx3YaBZIV6nWIanMrbhrVBx7yvODtX. We have updated the manuscript in several places to clarify how to access data. RAPID code and cytometry files from the BCP-ALL example are publicly available on Github. The other FCS files from the glioblastoma study are available on FlowRepository using the above link.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>Please address the following points raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1) Clustering is performed across all tumours combined, so the authors should distinguish inter-tumour effects from the intra-tumour effects that they describe. Could they show for example that the cluster phenotypes are derivable from a significant number of individual tumours?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have highlighted two key results: 1) cell clusters were observed in multiple tumors and 2) multiple tumors contributed to cell clusters (the reviewer’s question). Thus, there were not specificity relationships between clusters and patients. In this analysis, there were not “private” clusters containing cells from only one tumor.</p><p>First, Row 36 of Supplementary file 2 indicates the number of tumors contributing at least 1% of that tumor’s cells to a cluster. For example, 14 tumors had more than 1% of their events assigned to GPP clusters and 13 tumors had more than 1% of events assigned to GNP clusters.</p><p>Second, a new Supplementary file 5 has been added to address the reviewer’s question directly by showing the percent of each cluster that was derived from each tumor. Row 32 indicates the number of tumors contributing at least 1% of that cluster’s cells. Notably, the observed clusters were all derived from multiple tumors (at least 4 and a median of 12 tumors contributed to clusters).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Inter-tumour effects would imply some different conclusions to the ones the authors draw, depending on the patient specificities of these effects. Assuming no patient specificity, one potentially interesting and even complementary conclusion would be that basal levels of certain proteins in a tumour are indicative of patient outcome (indiscriminately of any particular cellular subpopulation). Do the authors see that EGFR, S100B and other enriched proteins vary primarily within, or between, tumours?</p></disp-quote><p>EGFR and S100B, and many of the features measured, vary both within individual tumors and between patients. Notably, the single cell study design allows the reader to see that these variations are driven by distinct cell types in which proteins were co-expressed (or simultaneously absent). The comparison of the single cell cytometry and imaging makes it clear that this tracking of cell subsets revealed by multiple markers is more sensitive than tracking the markers as separate features, but that the signal from the cells is strong enough that the traditional unimodal analysis can provide a rough surrogate once the key features are known. The variation from patient to patient can also be seen in Supplementary file 6, which shows cell event distribution and “heat” for each patient and parameter on a common (all 28 patients) t-SNE plot, and in our tissue microarray analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To check for patient specificity, the authors should state in the text i) which, if any, clusters were largely tumour-specific and ii) how many tumours contributed to each of the clusters. Without these figures, the biological relevance of each of the clusters (namely the NP and PP subsets) is difficult to assess.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have added Supplementary file 5 and highlighted Supplementary file 2, which together indicate no specificity relationships. We have added the following sentences to the manuscript to highlight this point (found in the Results section titled: Identification of risk stratifying glioblastoma cells in Dataset 1):</p><p>“The number of tumors that contributed to each cluster varied between the 43 clusters, but a median of 8 tumors contained cells in each cluster (Supplemental file 2, Supplementary file 6). Furthermore, each cluster contained cells from at least 4 tumors and, at the median, contained cells from 12 tumors (Supplemental file 5, Supplementary file 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It might also be useful to add tSNE plots coloured by patient alongside the existing plots (Figures 1B, 2A, 4A). If there are indeed clusters dominated by individual tumours, I would think that they should be removed early on in the RAPID pipeline. If there are many such cases, then perhaps the authors would have to consider an alternative clustering approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The 28-page Supplementary file 6 was included to help address the point the reviewer is raising. This supplement shows the requested data in a per-patient view (one page per patient). Along with Supplemental file 2 and the added Supplemental file 5, we believe the reviewer’s concern is well addressed: specificity relationships between clusters and patients were not observed and clusters were not “private” to a specific tumor. Notably, coloring cells in the combined t-SNE by patient results in a view where the 131,880 cell dots outnumber the pixels and obscure each other, making it difficult to see where a given patient falls on the t-SNE axes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do any of the cell subsets identified (Figure 1B, C) reflect a proneural population? This is a known component of glioblastomas and has moreover been postulated to be associated with better prognosis because it is the dominant component in lower-grade gliomas (e.g. Verhaak et al., 2010). How do the authors reconcile this with their own findings? Or, if a proneural phenotype is lacking, could the authors comment on why that might be? One reason could be technical: simply that proneural markers were not sufficiently represented in the panel. If that is the case, the authors should acknowledge this in the text and take care not to overstate their results pertaining to the phenotypes of NP and PP subsets in GBM.</p></disp-quote><p>The proneural, mesenchymal, and classical subtypes are largely defined by DNA alterations or transcript expression, while this paper is focused on per-cell measurements at the protein level. We did include measurements of proteins which might be expected to be enriched in each of these subclasses, including PDGFRA and SOX2 (expected to be found in proneural tumors, as described by Verhaak et al., 2010). We observed many cell subpopulations with SOX2 protein expression, including several GNP subsets, but did not observe co-enrichment of PDGFRA protein in these cells. Within the Discussion, we explore potential reasons why protein-level data may reveal different features than studies of DNA or expressed RNA transcripts. It is also important to note that the referenced classification has been updated; when IDH-mutant tumors are excluded, as in our study, proneural tumors are similar to other subclasses in outcome (Wang et al., Cancer Cell 2017).</p></body></sub-article></article>
