Here, we demonstrate engineering of electrically and chemically responsive, contractile human muscle tissues (‘myobundles’) using primary myogenic cells. These biomimetic constructs exhibit aligned architecture, multinucleated and striated myofibers, and a Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell pool. They contract spontaneously and respond to electrical stimuli with twitch and tetanic contractions. Positive correlation between contractile force and GCaMP6-reported calcium responses enables non-invasive tracking of myobundle function and drug response. During culture, myobundles maintain functional acetylcholine receptors and structurally and functionally mature, evidenced by increased myofiber diameter and improved calcium handling and contractile strength. In response to diversely acting drugs, myobundles undergo dose-dependent hypertrophy or toxic myopathy similar to clinical outcomes. Human myobundles provide an enabling platform for predictive drug and toxicology screening and development of novel therapeutics for muscle-related disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04885.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04885.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04885.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Scientists have developed realistic models of the human liver, lung, and heart that allow them to observe living tissue in the laboratory. These models have helped us to better understand how these organs work and what goes wrong in diseases that affect these organs. The models can also be used to test how new drugs may affect a particular organ without the risk of exposing patients to the drug.</p><p>Efforts to develop a realistic laboratory model of human muscle tissues that can contract like real muscles have not been as successful to date. This shortcoming has potentially hindered the development of drugs to treat numerous disorders that affect muscles and movement in humans—such as muscular dystrophies, which are diseases in which people progressively lose muscle strength.</p><p>Some important drugs, like cholesterol-lowering statins, have detrimental effects on muscle tissue; one statin was so harmful to muscles that it had to be withdrawn from the market. As such, it would be useful to have experimental models that would allow scientists to test whether potential drugs damage or treat muscle tissue.</p><p>Madden et al. have now bioengineered a three-dimensional laboratory model of living muscle tissue made of cells taken from biopsies of several different human patients. These tissues were grown into bundles of muscle fibers on special polymer frames in the laboratory. The bioengineered muscle bundles respond to electrical and chemical signals and contract just like normal muscle. They also exhibit the same structure and signaling as healthy muscle tissue in humans.</p><p>Madden et al. exposed the muscle tissue bundles to three drugs known to affect muscles to determine if the model could be used to test whether drugs have harmful effects. This revealed that the bundles had weaker contractions in response to statins and the malaria drug chloroquine, just like normal muscles do—and that this effect worsened if more of each drug was used. Madden et al. also found that a drug that strengthens muscle contractions at low doses and damages muscle at high doses in humans has similar effects in the model.</p><p>As well as this model being used to screen for harmful effects of drugs before clinical trials, the technique used to create the model could be used to grow muscle tissue from patients with muscle diseases. This would help researchers and doctors to better understand the patient's condition and potentially develop more efficient therapies. Also, the technique could be eventually developed to grow healthy muscle tissue to implant in patients who have been injured.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04885.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04885.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>human skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>contractile force</kwd><kwd>muscle physiology</kwd><kwd>drug testing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR055226 and R01AR065873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bursac</surname><given-names>Nenad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UH2TR000505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Truskey</surname><given-names>George A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel bioengineered human skeletal muscle model with accurate physiological and pharmacological responses may provide a useful tool for preclinical testing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of human in vitro systems for basic biological studies and drug discovery is motivated by the need to improve outcomes in human patients and alleviate ethical considerations demanding a reduction in the use of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dambach and Uppal, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatia and Ingber, 2014</xref>). While significant progress has been made towards predictive in vitro models for liver, lung, and cardiac tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatia and Ingber, 2014</xref>), a functional model of human skeletal muscle has not been described. This is of particular concern as there are a wide range of metabolic, neuromuscular, and dystrophic disorders involving skeletal muscle that are under investigation and still lacking therapies. Skeletal muscle is also central to diseases with high societal impact and those that do not have adequate animal models, including diabetes, obesity, and different dystrophies. Furthermore, through secretion of contraction-dependent myokines, skeletal muscle has been strongly implicated in organ–organ interactions including processes as diverse as cognition, inflammation, cancer, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>). The need for an accurate preclinical model of human skeletal muscle was exemplified by the market withdrawal of cerivastatin that was well tolerated in mice but caused fatal rhabdomyolysis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">von Keutz and Schluter, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Expansion of primary human myoblasts and formation of myotubes in two-dimensional (2D) systems is well known, however, these cultures are difficult to maintain over long times, lack the architecture of native muscle, and require complex media components to initiate spontaneous contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blau and Webster, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eberli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).

Conditions for primary myogenic cell expansion and 3D tissue formation were optimized to reproducibly obtain contractile myobundles consisting of aligned, cross-striated myofibers and a pool of cells expressing the satellite cell marker Pax7. In response to electrical and pharmacological stimuli, myobundles exhibited forceful contractions and calcium transients which could be non-invasively measured to track physiological responses and functional maturation over time. Reproducible functional characteristics were obtained using cells from nine different donors and one commercial source. Similar to clinical outcomes in humans, when pharmaceutically challenged, myobundles experienced enhanced contractile performance in response to a steroid-like substance, underwent autophagic myopathy following administration of an anti-malarial agent, and exhibited statin-induced weakness and lipid accumulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure and composition of myobundles</title><p>Myogenic cells were isolated from human muscle biopsies and expanded for 3–5 passages, when they contained a significant fraction of muscle precursors positive for desmin and MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Following hydrogel compaction for 3–5 days, low serum media was applied to induce myofiber formation and differentiation. After an additional 3–5 days, the myobundles began to spontaneously twitch (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), which was previously reported only in rodent 3D muscle constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dennis and Kosnik, 2000</xref>).

Compared to previous 3D culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Powell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mudera et al., 2010</xref>), a relatively high cell density, specific hydrogel and media compositions, and dynamic culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Juhas and Bursac, 2014</xref>) used in our system may have all contributed to the robust formation of functional human engineered muscle. Under these conditions, the ability to generate large numbers (&gt;1000) of contractile myobundles from a single donor biopsy allowed us to perform traditional physiological and biochemical measurements in both acute and chronic settings and for multiple testing compounds and conditions. Electrically induced calcium transients and contractions (twitch and tetanus) as well as physiological responses to increase in muscle length and stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rassier et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>) were reproducibly recorded in myobundles from ten donors. The specific blockade of acetylcholine-induced but not electrically-induced calcium release by the muscle relaxant and acetylcholine receptor blocker tubocurarine mimicked responses seen in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Secher et al., 1982</xref>). Along with dose-dependent increase in calcium transient amplitude by caffeine, these experiments demonstrate that myofibers formed within the 3D myobundle culture environment exhibited intact excitation-contraction coupling and physiological responsiveness to both chemical and electrical stimuli. While repeated non-invasive interrogation of myobundle function was limited to calcium imaging, integration of smaller size myobundles with high-throughput force testing assays should be feasible as demonstrated for mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vandenburgh et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The utility of myobundles as a preclinical drug testing platform was evaluated by measuring contractile and biochemical responses to statins, chloroquine, and clenbuterol. Statin myopathy is a common side effect that has been reported for all currently available statins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). Similar to clinical reports, human myobundles showed higher sensitivity to cerivastatin than lovastatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shitara and Sugiyama, 2006</xref>) and at excessive statin concentrations displayed progressive weakness and lipid accumulation, suggestive of equivalent mechanisms of action in vitro and in vivo. The use of myobundles allowed direct comparison of similar pharmaceuticals on the same patient or cohort, previously recommended for but unavailable for statins due to the variations among clinical trials and underreporting of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobkin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). In response to an anti-malarial agent, chloroquine, myobundles showed induction of autophagic myopathy also observed in native muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shintani and Klionsky, 2004</xref>), thus providing a potential functional screen for non-toxic modulators of autophagy. We also tested the acute and chronic responses of myobundles to β2-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol and observed myofiber hypertrophy and increased contractile strength at low clenbuterol doses followed by muscle weakness at higher doses, consistent with previous animal and human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ryall and Lynch, 2008</xref>). Currently, binding affinity to β2-adrenergic receptors is one of the standard tests for drug specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowes et al., 2012</xref>) and is also a potential target for therapies in muscle wasting disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ryall and Lynch, 2008</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that myobundles closely mimic the functional responses of native human muscle through multiple signaling pathways and could provide a pre-clinical assay for predictive screening of novel therapeutics for a broad range of muscle-related disorders.</p><p>Our in vitro model of human skeletal muscle provides a tool for improved predictive pharmacological testing and a potential alternative to costly animal studies. Non-destructive, real-time measurement of function such as calcium handling shown here could be combined with other optically-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kleinstreuer et al., 2014</xref>) to elucidate mechanisms of drug action. The ability to measure and quantify functional endpoints in myobundles in a population- or patient-specific manner allows construction of pharmacological time- and dose–response curves previously not available for human skeletal muscle. The myobundles may be integrated with other established human micro-organ systems such as liver or heart for more predictive body-on-chip toxicology studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatia and Ingber, 2014</xref>). Functional acetylcholine receptors within myobundles are integral to studies involving the neuromuscular junctions and necessary for potential implantation of such tissues to repair muscle dysfunction or loss. Eventual applications of myobundle platform using patient-derived cells to model functional deficits observed in different muscle pathologies may allow development of more efficacious therapies and safe translation to clinics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of myogenic cells</title><p>Human skeletal muscle samples were obtained through standard needle biopsy or surgical waste under Duke University IRB approved protocols. Nine donor samples were expanded by outgrowth similar to methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blau and Webster, 1981</xref>). Briefly, muscle samples were minced, washed in PBS, and enzymatically digested in 0.05% trypsin for 30 min. Muscle was collected by centrifugation, pre-plated for 2 hr, and transferred to a matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) coated flask for attachment. Cells were expanded in skeletal muscle growth media containing low glucose DMEM (Gibco Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplements purchased from Lonza, Basel, CH (EGF, fetuin, dexamethasone, and gentamicin without insulin), and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). A second growth media containing 5 ng/ml bFGF and 20% fetal calf serum was used during optimization as it was previously shown to improve expansion of myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ham et al., 1988</xref>). Myogenic cells were either cryopreserved in 90% growth medium with 5% fetal calf serum and 5% DMSO at passage 1 or 2 then used at passage 3–5 for the generation of myobundles or staining. A sample of primary human skeletal myoblasts from additional donor was purchased from Lonza for comparison.</p><p>For calcium imaging studies, expanded myogenic cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding the fluorescent calcium reporter GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) driven by a myosin heavy chain-creatine kinase promoter MHCK7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salva et al., 2007</xref>) for muscle specific expression.</p><p>For the measurements of myofiber length and nuclei number, 5% of myogenic cells used for myobundle formation were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding MHCK7 driven GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2011</xref>). This allowed the visualization and measurement of individual GFP<sup>+</sup> myotubes within myobundles using immunostaining and confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fabrication of human myobundles</title><p>Myobundles were formed by modifying our previously published methods for engineered rodent muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinds et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Juhas et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Expanded myogenic cells were dissociated in 0.025% trypsin-EDTA to a single cell suspension and encapsulated in a fibrinogen (Akron, Boca Raton, FL) and matrigel solution on laser cut Cerex frames (9.2 × 9.5 mm outer dimensions, 6.8 × 8.3 mm inner dimensions) within PDMS molds (cast from Teflon masters and pretreated with pluronic) at 15 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml (7.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per myobundle). Specifically, a cell solution (7.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 17.2 µl media per bundle + 2 µl of 50 unit/ml thrombin in 0.1% BSA in PBS [Sigma, St. Louis, MO]) and a gelling solution (11 µl media + 10 µl Matrigel + 10 µl of 20 mg/ml Fibrinogen in DMEM) were prepared in separate vials on ice for up to six myobundles per vial. Gelling solution was added to the cell solution and mixed thoroughly then each bundle was individual pipetted within the PDMS mold and onto the frame. The cell/hydrogel mixture was polymerized for 30 min at 37°C followed by incubation in growth media containing 1.5 mg/ml 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA, Sigma). Myobundles were kept in growth media during gel compaction (3–5 days) and then switched to low glucose DMEM with 2% horse serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mg/ml ACA and 10 µg/ml insulin (Sigma). Frames were removed from molds at the time of switch to low serum medium and cultured dynamically in suspension for an additional 1–4 weeks. Starting from a 50 mg donor biopsy, typical cell expansion for 5 passages can allow generation of at least 1000 myobundles with a total mass of &gt;5 g, representing a &gt;100-fold amplification of muscle mass when going from native to engineered tissue system.</p><p>All drugs were purchased from Sigma. Clenbuterol hydrochloride, chloroquine phosphate, and cerivastatin sodium salt hydrate were prepared at 1000× stock solutions in PBS (control) and sterile-filtered for use. Lovastatin was prepared as a 10,000× stock solution in DMSO in which case DMSO was used as vehicle control. Drugs studies in myobundles or 2D cultures were initiated after 1 week of differentiation. Myobundles were replenished with fresh media and drug each day to maintain drug concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measurement of contractile force</title><p>Electrically or chemically stimulated contractile force generation in myobundles was measured using a custom force measurement set-up as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinds et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Juhas et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, single myobundles on a frame were transferred to the bath of the force measurement set-up, maintained at 37°C. One end of the bundle was secured by a pin to an immobile PDMS block and the other end was attached to a PDMS float connected to the force transducer mounted on a computer-controlled motorized linear actuator (Thor Labs, Newton, NJ). The sides of the frame were cut to allow myobundle stretch by the actuator and isometric measurement of contractile force. Initially, the myobundle was set to its baseline length using the motorized linear actuator. To assess the force-length relationship, myobundle was stretched by 2% of its culture length then stimulated by a 40 V/cm, 10 ms electrical pulse using a pair of platinum electrodes and the twitch force was recorded. At 12% stretch, 1 s long stimulations at 5, 10, and 20 Hz were applied and the subsequent contractile force was recorded to assess the force-frequency relationship. Contractile force traces were analyzed for peak twitch or tetanus force, time to peak twitch, and half relaxation time using a custom MATLAB program (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>). For studies with acetylcholine, 60 µl of drug solution was added to the 6 ml bath at t = 5 s of recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging of calcium transients</title><p>Myobundles expressing the MHCK7-GcaMP6 reporter were non-destructively monitored for calcium transients following differentiation. A live imaging chamber with heated enclosure was used to maintain cells in physiological conditions during recording.

Video-images were acquired using an Andor iXon camera affixed to a Nikon microscope with a FITC filter and either 4× or 10× objective. During studies with caffeine and acetylcholine, 60 µl of drug solution was added to the bath at t = 5 s of recording. Video was analyzed using Andor Solis software and relative changes in fluorescence signal were calculated by ΔF/F = (Peak-Trough)/(Trough-Background) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Juhas et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and myobundles were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor), Amy Wagers (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers found your work to be novel, interesting and important. They were particularly impressed with your success in developing a robust, physiologically relevant 3D model of human skeletal muscle that shows electrical responsiveness, and with the rigor of your analyses, using multiple patient biopsies instead of cell lines, and validating with three different drugs. Overall, it was felt that your results are likely to be highly influential, particularly in the growing areas of tissue engineering and patient-specific drug screening, and provide a significant advance for the field.</p><p>That said, there were a few issues that surfaced during review and discussion, which we would like you to address in a revised version. These essential revision requirements are outlined in the numbered list below. Following this list, we have included some additional, minor comments that you may wish to address as well. We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p>1) A key determinant of the long-term impact of this work will be the degree to which other groups are able to adopt your system for drug screening and analysis. To this end, it will be essential to ensure that the methodologies are clearly and completely explained. Currently, there are important details missing (e.g., regarding the fabrication procedure, how force is measured, how and when growth factors were added, hydrogel formulation, etc.). Please provide additional necessary detail, and consider inclusion of schematic diagrams, to enable others to replicate this system.</p><p>2) Related to point 1, while you demonstrate beautifully that the myobundle system phenocopies clinical responses to drugs, to convince researchers to convert from the 'user-friendly' 2D model to your system it will be necessary to include data comparing these systems side-by-side. Certainly, as you already point out, twitch and tetanus measurements are only possible in 3D, but it is important also to include data that compares some of the other metrics you assayed to indicate drug response (e.g., myofiber diameter, autophagy, lipid accumulation, etc.) in 2D vs. 3D, for at least one of the drug treatments analyzed.</p><p>3) Your report of spontaneous contraction of human myofibers and pacing in response to electrical stimulation is a first in the field, as human myofibers notoriously fail to respond to electrical stimulation. The findings would be more impactful, however, if you could offer explanation as to why your system supports human myofiber contraction while another quite similar 3D human skeletal muscle system published by the Vandenburgh lab did not demonstrate similar success. Do you also see spontaneous twitching in 2D cultures? If yes, perhaps it has something to do with isolation and culture media formulations? If not, then what is different from the prior unsuccessful reports?</p><p>4) From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref>, it appears that fibers are well aligned in the core of the tissue, but splaying outwards in the outer edges. Fibers also seem quite short and do not contain many myonuclei/fibers. Together these observations cast a bit of doubt on the functional force measurements. Quantification of these parameters is needed to support the conclusions.</p><p>5) Some reviewers were concerned that the paper may overstate the relevance of this model to testing drugs in disease relevant models of skeletal muscle disease, as only healthy muscle was evaluated. Please revise the text to avoid the implication that the system is validated for studies of diseased muscle. (Please note that we are <italic>not</italic> asking for new experiments with diseased muscle to be included, just for a clarification of the text and conclusions.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04885.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) A key determinant of the long-term impact of this work will be the degree to which other groups are able to adopt your system for drug screening and analysis.

Specifically, we described in more detail the cell expansion and exact contents of the growth media:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Human skeletal muscle samples were obtained through standard needle biopsy or surgical waste under Duke University IRB approved protocols. Nine donor samples were expanded by outgrowth similar to methods previously described (Blau and Webster, 1981). Briefly, muscle samples were minced, washed in PBS, and enzymatically digested in 0.05% trypsin for 30 minutes. Muscle was collected by centrifugation, pre-plated for 2 hours, and transferred to a matrigel (BD) coated flask for attachment. Cells were expanded in skeletal muscle growth media containing low glucose DMEM, supplements purchased from Lonza (EGF, fetuin, dexamethasone, and gentamicin without insulin), and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as previously described (Cheng et al., 2014). A second growth media containing 5 ng/mL bFGF and 20% fetal calf serum was used during optimization as it was previously shown to improve expansion of myogenic cells (Ham et al., 1988). Myogenic cells were either cryopreserved in 90% growth medium with 5% fetal calf serum and 5% DMSO at passage 1 or 2 then used at passage 3-5 for the generation of myobundles or staining. A sample of primary human skeletal myoblasts from additional donor was purchased from Lonza for comparison.”</p><p>We added a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>) with the schematic of myobundle fabrication procedure and with images showing the appearance of myobundles at different stages of culture. Furthermore, we described fabrication of myobundles in more detail, as follows, in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Myobundles were formed by modifying our previously published methods for engineered rodent muscle tissues (Hinds et al., 2011; Juhas et al., 2014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). Expanded myogenic cells were dissociated in 0.025% trypsin-EDTA to a single cell suspension and encapsulated in a fibrinogen (Akron) and matrigel (BD Biosciences) solution on laser cut Cerex® frames (9.2 x 9.5 mm outer dimensions, 6.8 x 8.3 mm inner dimensions) within PDMS molds (cast from Teflon masters and pretreated with pluronic) at 15x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL (7.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells per myobundle). Specifically, a cell solution (7.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells in 17.2 µL media per bundle + 2 µL of 50 unit/mL thrombin in 0.1% BSA in PBS (Sigma)) and a gelling solution (11 µL media + 10 µL Matrigel + 10 µL of 20 mg/mL Fibrinogen in DMEM) were prepared in separate vials on ice for up to six myobundles per vial. Gelling solution was added to the cell solution and mixed thoroughly then each bundle was individual pipetted within the PDMS mold and onto the frame. The cell/hydrogel mixture was polymerized for 30 min at 37°C followed by incubation in growth media containing 1.5 mg/mL 6-aminocaproic acid (ACA, Sigma). Myobundles were kept in growth media during gel compaction (3-5 days) and then switched to low glucose DMEM (Gibco) with 2% horse serum (Hyclone), 2 mg/mL ACA and 10 µg/mL insulin (Sigma). Frames were removed from molds at the time of switch to low serum medium and cultured dynamically in suspension for an additional 1–4 weeks.”</p><p>Additional text on the details of force measurement was added as well to the same section:</p><p>“Electrically or chemically stimulated contractile force generation in myobundles was measured using a custom force measurement set-up as previously described (Hinds et al., 2011; Juhas et al., 2014). Briefly, single myobundles on a frame were transferred to the bath of the force measurement set-up, maintained at 37°C. One end of the bundle was secured by a pin to an immobile PDMS block and the other end was attached to a PDMS float connected to the force transducer mounted on a computer-controlled motorized linear actuator (Thor Labs). The sides of the frame were cut to allow myobundle stretch by the actuator and isometric measurement of contractile force. Initially, the myobundle was set to its baseline length using the motorized linear actuator. To assess the force-length relationship, myobundle was stretched by 2% of its culture length then stimulated by a 40V/cm, 10 ms electrical pulse using a pair of platinum electrodes and the twitch force was recorded. At 12% stretch, 1 second long stimulations at 5, 10, and 20 Hz were applied and the subsequent contractile force was recorded to assess the force-frequency relationship. Contractile force traces were analyzed for peak twitch or tetanus force, time to peak twitch, and half relaxation time using a custom MATLAB program. For studies with acetylcholine, 60 µL of drug solution was added to the 6 mL bath at t = 5 sec of recording.”</p><p>We also added a line, in the same section of the text, to indicate the timing of drug additions:</p><p>“Drugs studies in myobundles or 2D cultures were initiated after one week of differentiation. Myobundles were replenished with fresh media and drug each day to maintain drug concentration.”</p><p><italic>2) Related to point 1, while you demonstrate beautifully that the myobundle system phenocopies clinical responses to drugs, to convince researchers to convert from the 'user-friendly' 2D model to your system it will be necessary to include data comparing these systems side-by-side. Certainly, as you already point out, twitch and tetanus measurements are only possible in 3D, but it is important also to include data that compares some of the other metrics you assayed to indicate drug response (e.g., myofiber diameter, autophagy, lipid accumulation, etc.) in 2D vs. 3D, for at least one of the drug treatments analyzed</italic>.</p><p>To address this comment, we performed additional experiments to directly compare drug responses in 2D and 3D cultures. Specifically, cells from the same donor were seeded on 2D Matrigel coated dishes or formed into 3D myobundles. The preparations were differentiated for one week and then treated for one week with different doses of chloroquine, as in our original 3D experiments. Western blot analysis showed a similar, dose-dependent increase in expression of LC3B-II and decrease in expression of contractile proteins sarcomeric α-actinin (SAA) and myosin heavy chain (MYH) in 2D and 3D cultures. Overall, while we expectedly found similar biochemical effects of chloroquine on autophagic buildup in myofibers cultured either in a 2D or 3D environment, the 3D myobundles allowed additional functional studies compared to 2D that can correlate the biochemical findings to a functional output. These results are now shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> and described in the revised Results section as follows:</p><p>“Similar biochemical responses to chloroquine including accumulation of LC3B-II and reduction of contractile proteins was also observed in 2D cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Your report of spontaneous contraction of human myofibers and pacing in response to electrical stimulation is a first in the field, as human myofibers notoriously fail to respond to electrical stimulation.

Do you also see spontaneous twitching in 2D cultures? If yes</italic>, <italic>perhaps it has something to do with isolation and culture media formulations? If not, then what is different from the prior unsuccessful reports?</italic></p><p>We did not observe spontaneous twitching of myofibers in our 2D human cultures, whereas others have shown that sporadic spontaneous twitches in 2D cultures can be observed in more complex differentiation media (Guo et al., 2014). Compared to our myobundle fabrication protocol, other 3D human muscle systems utilized collagen I-based rather than fibrin-based matrix and employed lower cell densities (5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL (Powell et al., 2002; Powell et al., 1999), 4-8 x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL (Mudera et al., 2010)). Furthermore, a recent study with fibrin-based human muscle model has utilized a much higher (&gt;10x) fibrinogen concentration (200 mg/mL stock solution, 57 mg/mL final concentration (Martin et al., 2013) compared to our study.</p><p>Previously, we showed that fibrinogen and matrigel concentrations are important determinants of contractile function of our 3D engineered rat muscles (Hinds et al., 2011) and that the use of fibrin gel outperformed use of collagen I gel with respect to engineered muscle function and long-term stability (Hinds et al., 2011; Bian and Bursac, 2009). In optimizing human 3D muscle system, we relied on our significant experience with 3D rat system. We tested multiple fibrinogen concentrations and starting cell densities in human system and found that 4 mg/ml fibrinogen concentration and 15x10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL cell density allowed both development of robust contractile activity as well as long term stability of the engineered muscle. Myobundles made using low fibrinogen concentrations thinned quickly and were unstable. Higher fibrinogen concentrations decreased myobundle compaction rates and cell fusion leading to a reduced contractile force generation.</p><p>With regards to culture media, previous reports of 3D human muscle utilized high glucose medium for both differentiation and maintenance of cells. We used low glucose media and supplemented the differentiation media with 10 μg/mL insulin. While insulin supplementation was not completely necessary, it significantly enhanced force production (&gt;2 fold) compared to differentiation without insulin. While adding various growth factors (e.g. IGF-1) could further improve function of myobundles, we chose to limit the cost and complexity of our differentiation media to what could be readily affordable and reproducible by others. Finally, for our myobundles, we utilized dynamic instead of static culture conditions. Similar to our recently published study in rat 3D muscle system (Juhas and Bursac; 2014), dynamic conditions additionally enhanced force producing capacity of our human engineered muscle.</p><p>Taken together, while we cannot know every detail of cell expansion and culture conditions explored by others, we believe that particular combination of high cell density, fibrinogen concentration, media formulation, and dynamic culture conditions used in our study resulted in robust contractile response of our 3D human myobundles.</p><p>These, to our belief, important differences from previous 3D studies have been now emphasized in the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Compared to previous 3D culture studies (Powell et al., 2002; Mudera et al., 2010), a relatively high cell density, specific hydrogel and media compositions, and dynamic culture conditions (Juhas and Bursac, 2014) used in our system may have all contributed to the robust formation of functional human engineered muscle.”</p><p><italic>4) From</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</italic></xref><italic>, it appears that fibers are well aligned in the core of the tissue, but splaying outwards in the outer edges. Fibers also seem quite short and do not contain many myonuclei/fibers. Together these observations cast a bit of doubt on the functional force measurements. Quantification of these parameters is needed to support the conclusions</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge that original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A</xref> could leave such an impression. We have thus reexamined similar immunostainings from different myobundles and established that apparently splayed fibers in that panel have been an artifact of imaging. We have replaced this panel with a more representative composite confocal image showing the uniform fiber alignment throughout the myobundle. Uniform fiber alignment is also evident from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3B,C</xref>. In addition, we have performed new and non-trivial experiments to quantify fiber length and number of myonuclei per fiber. Specifically, to be able to evaluate length of individual fibers within the intact myobundles, we have applied a low concentration of a lentivirus driving the GFP expression under an MHCK7 promoter to transduce 5% of myogenic cells before encapsulating them in hydrogel. This low level of GFP labeling resulted in appearance of clearly distinguishable individual GFP+ fibers within myobundles. These fibers were imaged by confocal microscopy and their length and number of myonuclei were evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-differentiation. New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> shows the representative images of the labeled fibers and corresponding average lengths and myonuclei numbers. The measured fiber length in human myobundles is consistent with the only previous report of the fiber length in engineered muscle tissues (made of primary mouse myoblasts) that we could find (Li et al., 2011).</p><p>These data shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> are now described in the revised Results section as follows:</p><p>“…while myofiber length and myonuclei number (524±70 and 7±3.6, respectively, at 3 weeks of differentiation) remained relatively steady with time of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref>).”</p><p>The methods to assess myofiber length and myonuclei number are described in the revised Methods section as follows:</p><p>“For the measurements of myofiber length and nuclei number, 5% of myogenic cells used for myobundle formation were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding MHCK7 driven GFP (Li et al., 2011). This allowed the visualization and measurement of individual GFP<sup>+</sup> myotubes within myobundles using immunostaining and confocal microscopy.”</p><p><italic>5) Some reviewers were concerned that the paper may overstate the relevance of this model to testing drugs in disease relevant models of skeletal muscle disease, as only healthy muscle was evaluated.
