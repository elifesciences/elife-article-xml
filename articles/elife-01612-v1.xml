<p>Damaged mitochondria can be selectively eliminated by mitophagy. Although two gene products mutated in Parkinson’s disease, PINK1, and Parkin have been found to play a central role in triggering mitophagy in mammals, how the pre-autophagosomal isolation membrane selectively and accurately engulfs damaged mitochondria remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that TBC1D15, a mitochondrial Rab GTPase-activating protein (Rab-GAP), governs autophagosome biogenesis and morphology downstream of Parkin activation. To constrain autophagosome morphogenesis to that of the cargo, TBC1D15 inhibits Rab7 activity and associates with both the mitochondria through binding Fis1 and the isolation membrane through the interactions with LC3/GABARAP family members. Another TBC family member TBC1D17, also participates in mitophagy and forms homodimers and heterodimers with TBC1D15. These results demonstrate that TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 mediate proper autophagic encapsulation of mitochondria by regulating Rab7 activity at the interface between mitochondria and isolation membranes.</p>

<p>Parkinson disease is a common degenerative brain disorder that causes tremors, muscle stiffening, and slowing down of movement. Scientists believe that these symptoms are caused by a progressive loss of brain cells called dopaminergic neurons, which help regulate movement. Most cases have no obvious genetic cause, but around 15% of people with the disease have a close relative who also has the disease, and mutations in the genes encoding two proteins—PINK1 and Parkin—have been identified as prime suspects in familial Parkinson disease.</p>
<p>These proteins help to eliminate damaged mitochondria from cells. In addition to producing the energy that cells need to function, mitochondria also help to trigger cell death. Pesticides and other chemicals linked to non-familial cases of Parkinson disease also damage mitochondria. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the accumulation of damaged mitochondria may contribute to the excessive loss of dopaminergic neurons that is seen in both forms of the disease.</p>
<p>Yamano et al. provide new details on the ways that autophagosomes—structures that help cells to recycle nutrients and remove debris—destroy mitochondria. Previous studies have shown that when a mitochondrion is damaged, PINK1 sends a signal to Parkin, which then helps to recruit the proteins that are needed to form an autophagosome around the damaged mitochondrion. However, the identity of the proteins that guide the formation of the autophagosome remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Yamano et al. have now identified two of these proteins and helped to explain their specific roles in the assembly of autophagosomes. The two proteins, which are called TBC1D15 and TBC1D17, are both GAP proteins, which are well known for their role in deactivating enzymes called RAB GTPases. Yamano et al. show that TBC1D15 binds to the damaged mitochondrion and also to the autophagosome as it grows around the mitochondrion. TBC1D15 also inhibits the action of an enzyme called Rab7 to prevent excessive growth of the autophagosome. TBC1D17 has a similar role.</p>
<p>The work of Yamano et al. indicates that Parkin activates Rab7, perhaps by placing chains of a protein called ubiquitin on mitochondria, which would mean that an unexpected new step in this pathway remains to be discovered. Understanding how Parkin activates Rab7 could help identify new targets for drugs that might treat Parkinson disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autophagosomes enclose seemingly random portions of the cytoplasm to supply nutrients during starvation or they can specifically engulf cellular debris to maintain quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizushima et al., 2011</xref>). Although these two pathways share a number of core biochemical steps, the morphology of the isolation membranes can differ greatly. Cup-shaped isolation membranes surround cytosol and organelles upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baba et al., 1994</xref>). However, when large aggregates of debris accumulate or during xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kageyama et al., 2011</xref>), autophagosomes form locally on the surface of the substrate and grow in contour with the often irregularly shaped structures that can be much larger than the membrane cups formed during starvation. Furthermore, for large aggregates of mitochondria, several autophagosomes may form simultaneously on different sides of the cargo and fuse together to engulf them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshii et al., 2011</xref>). Ubiquitinated protein aggregates may be tagged by LIR (LC3-interacting region) domain-containing proteins that bind LC3 family proteins on isolation membranes to help recruit autophagosomes to the debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>). However, what links isolation membrane expansion to cargo size is unknown.</p>
<p>We examined autophagosome morphogenesis during Parkin-mediated mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>) where multiple mitochondria can be engulfed in large aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narendra et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshii et al., 2011</xref>). A broad range of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins become ubiquitinated by Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>), which appears to trigger the recruitment of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins to mitochondria and activate autophagosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itakura et al., 2012</xref>). Although mitophagy is accomplished in part by canonical autophagy gene products, how autophagosomes selectively recognize and assemble around damaged mitochondria remains unclear. So far, no mitochondrial proteins have been identified to mediate mitophagy downstream of Parkin.</p>
<p>TBC1D15 has been shown to bind mitochondria through Fis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>), to bind the Atg8 family member GABARAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>), and has been found in a screen of Parkin substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>). TBC1D15 is one of the TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) family proteins that function as Rab GTPase-activating proteins (Rab-GAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukuda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frasa et al., 2012</xref>). The membrane trafficking activity of Rab proteins is increased by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which accelerate the exchange of GDP for GTP and is decreased by GAPs, which facilitate the Rab GTPase activity.</p>
<p>Fis1, conserved from yeast to mammals, is C-terminally anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mozdy et al., 2000</xref>) with an N-terminal tetratricopeptide-repeat (TPR) domain exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>). Although mammalian Fis1 had been thought to be a mitochondrial fission factor in the same way as yeast Fis1, Fis1 knock out mammalian cells do not display a defect in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera et al., 2010</xref>). Also in contrast to yeast, mammalian Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria requires Mff, MIEF1/MiD51, and/or MiD49 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the Fis1 null worm and Fis1 knock out mammalian cells have excessive LC3 accumulation following stress induced by mitochondrial inhibitors such as antimycin A in a PINK1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting Fis1 may have a role in mitophagy.</p>
<p>In this study, we show that TBC1D15 and Fis1 act in concert to control autophagosome morphology during Parkin-mediated mitophagy but not during starvation-induced autophagy. This step is dependent on the small GTPase Rab7. We also demonstrate that TBC1D15 must bind LC3 homologue proteins as well as Fis1 to coordinate Rab7 activity to shape the nascent autophagosome isolation membrane providing mechanistic insight into autophagosome morphogenesis during mitophagy.</p>

<title>Characterization of <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells</title>
<p>We recently found that Fis1 null <italic>C.elegans</italic> and mammalian cells display aberrant LC3 accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the association between LC3 accumulation and the loss of Fis1 remains unclear. As TBC1D15 binds to Fis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>) and is a Rab-GAP potentially involved in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>), we made a <italic>TBC1D15</italic> gene knock out (KO) cell line using TALENs (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gaj et al., 2013</xref>]) and compared the LC3 accumulation phenotype with that of <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells. We designed TALEN binding pairs that target exon 9 of the <italic>TBC1D15</italic> gene because it is shared by all conceivable TBC1D15 splicing isoforms. One <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> clone harbors a 14-bp deletion in one allele and a large deletion in the other allele, both of which are frame-shifting and would cause mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We confirmed the knock out of TBC1D15 expression by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As TBC1D15 was previously reported to mediate mitochondrial fission and bind to Fis1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>), we checked the expression level of several proteins that have been previously linked to mitochondrial fission pathways in the <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells as well as in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic>, <italic>MFF−/−</italic>, <italic>DRP1−/−</italic> and the corresponding WT HCT116 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although each KO cell line has complete deletion of the target protein, expression and/or stability of the other fission-related proteins was not affected; <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells possess normal levels of TBC1D15 and Fis1, respectively.<fig-group>

<p>It has been reported that several mitochondrial fission components such as Mff, Drp1, and Fis1 are localized not only on mitochondrial membranes but also on peroxisomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Gould, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koch and Brocard, 2012</xref>). We compared the mitochondrial and peroxisomal morphology of <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells with that of <italic>FIS1−/−</italic>, <italic>MFF−/−</italic>, and <italic>DRP−/−</italic> cells. In agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera et al., 2010</xref>), mitochondrial morphology, as well as peroxisomal morphology in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells, was similar to that of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to moderately elongated mitochondria in <italic>TBC1D15</italic> siRNA-treated cells reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>), complete depletion of TBC1D15 by knock out resulted in no obvious mitochondrial morphology changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Furthermore, peroxisome shape in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells was also indistinguishable from that of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In sharp contrast, <italic>MFF−/−</italic> and <italic>DRP−/−</italic> cells display elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that Mff and Drp1 play important roles in regulating both mitochondria and peroxisome morphology, consistent with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gandre-Babbe and van der Bliek, 2008</xref>). Quantification of mitochondrial morphology demonstrated that the fission defect in <italic>MFF−/−</italic> cells is similar to, but not as strong as, that caused by <italic>DRP1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, it appears that both TBC1D15 and Fis1 are dispensable for mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission in human cells.</p>

<title>LC3 accumulation is induced excessively in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells during Parkin-mediated mitophagy</title>
<p>
<italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells accumulate LC3 during Parkin-mediated mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). To assess autophagosomes in the absence of TBC1D15, we made stable cell lines expressing YFP-LC3 and mCherry-Parkin and treated the cells with valinomycin, a potassium ionophore that dissipates mitochondrial inner membrane potential, to trigger Parkin-mediated mitophagy. 3 hr of valinomycin treatment to depolarize mitochondria-stimulated Parkin translocation onto mitochondria with similar efficiencies in all cell lines tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). WT cells have several small dots, crescent-shaped, or spherical YFP-LC3 puncta representing isolation membranes and autophagosomes, respectively, that were observed on or near fragmented mitochondria, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>). However, upon mitophagy induction in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells, YFP-LC3 accumulates excessively in foci, which often appears interconnected with one another, localized on or near mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells display expanded LC3-labeled structures very similar to those in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells suggesting that Fis1 and TBC1D15 are involved at the same step in autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This phenotype requires both Parkin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and PINK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>) expression and the loss of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), indicating that it occurs upon mitophagy induction downstream of PINK1-induced Parkin translocation to mitochondria. Expression of N-terminally 3×FLAG-tagged Fis1 rescued the LC3 accumulation in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), confirming the effect was caused by the loss of Fis1.

<p>To clarify the nature of LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells in more detail, we conducted immunoelectron microscopy. Valinomycin treatment for 3 hr caused the formation of preautophagomes with closely apposed membranes that were labeled with gold particles attached to YFP-LC3 near mitochondria in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Although <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells also have similar cup-shaped membrane structures, many of them displayed much thicker lumens than those in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, panel a and b). In addition, larger membrane capsules that contain mitochondria and possibly other membrane organelles were observed only in <italic>TBC1D15 −/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, panel c and d). Furthermore, some LC3 was associated with small diameter membrane structures that localize very close to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, panel e) and may have out of plane contiguity to preautophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, panel e and f). These results strongly suggest that the LC3-labeled structures seen in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells are not simply LC3 protein aggregates, but express LC3 associated along membrane bilayers.</p>
<p>We compared the localization of other preautophagosomal marker proteins and proteins involved in autophagy induction among WT, <italic>FIS1−/−</italic>, and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells during mitophagy. GFP-ULK1 that functions in the most upstream ATG1/ULK kinase complex and GFP-Atg14 that is an autophagy specific subunit of the class III PI3K complex formed dots and/or cup-shaped structures around mitochondria following valinomycin treatment, although the number of dots did not further increase upon the loss of Fis1 or TBC1D15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Moreover, we analyzed the recruitment of endogenous Atg16L1 that is only present on the preautophagosome membrane and GFP-DFCP1 that can serve as an omegasome marker. Although valinomycin induced the formation of both Atg16L1 and DFCP1 dots on mitochondria, neither of them increased further in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> or <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, Fis1 and TBC1D15 seem to regulate LC3 accumulation downstream of autophagy initiation.</p>

<title>LC3-labeled tubule expansion in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells occurs along microtubules</title>
<p>To observe autophagosomal structures in thicker optical slices, we reconstructed z-stacked confocal microscopic images comprising six sequential optical x-y sections taken at 0.8 μm z-intervals of cells stably expressing YFP-LC3 and mCherry-Parkin after 3 hr treatment with valinomycin. WT cells treated with valinomycin display perinuclear-clustered fragmented mitochondria and many YFP-LC3 puncta associated with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In sharp contrast, upon Parkin-induced mitophagy, <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells display more expanded LC3 accumulation than WT cells and also generate thin LC3-labeled tubular structures interconnected to one another, which are very similar to that seen in <italic>FIS1 −/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These tubular structures were frequently observed near the cell cortex.

<p>Although these LC3-labeled tubules were not associated with ER or actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), a portion of them tightly colocalized with microtubules stained for Tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To examine whether microtubules are important for generating LC3 tubular structures in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells, we added nocodazole, which interferes with the polymerization of microtubules, together with valinomycin to cells for 3 hr. Although WT cells have similar LC3 puncta with or without nocodazole treatment, LC3-labeled tubular structures and LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells completely disappeared upon nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Thus, intact microtubules are essential for LC3-labeled membrane expansion in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells, a step upstream of autophagosome fusion with lysosomes where previous work indicated dynein-facilitated autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). Although some late endosomes/lysosomes colocalize with LC3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) consistent with the results of immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, panel f), the morphologies of lysosomes and the Golgi apparatus were similar between WT and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p>
<p>As the excessive LC3 accumulation in the absence of TBC1D15 indicates either an augmentation in autophagy induction or a defect in autophagosomal flux, we asked whether the loss of TBC1D15 alters the rate of Parkin-mediated mitophagy. For this purpose, YFP-Parkin stably expressing cells were treated with valinomycin for various times and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. More endogenous lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) accumulated in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells as compared to that of WT cells as also seen in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is consistent with the greater appearance of YFP-LC3 accumulation by microscopic observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although Mfn1, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, was completely degraded within 2 hr in WT, <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells, ubiquitination of TOMM20, another outer membrane protein was retarded in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; TOMM20 asterisk). In WT cells, PINK1 is barely detectable under normal growing conditions because of the degradation through N-end rule pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamano and Youle, 2013</xref>), whereas it accumulates on the outer membrane upon addition of valinomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) as seen also with CCCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Narendra et al., 2010b</xref>). The accumulated PINK1 starts to decrease after 8 hr of valinomycin likely as mitochondria are eliminated by Parkin-mediated mitophagy. On the other hand, accumulated PINK1 in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> or <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> was retained longer than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting, in conjunction with the delayed TOMM20 degradation, that autophagic clearance and/or proteasomal degradation is delayed in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> or <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells. The rate of degradation of TOMM20, TIMM23, and mitochondrial HSP60 in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> or <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells, however, was not different as compared to that of WT cells at the 8-hr time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). On the other hand, when cells were treated with valinomycin for longer times up to 40 hr, most of the TOMM20 was degraded and protein levels of the matrix HSP60 and the mitochondrial DNA-encoded COXII (MT-COXII) decreased in WT cells, whereas they were retained in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). These results indicate that the Fis1-TBC1D15 pair is not essential for mitophagy but the deletion of either impedes clearance of damaged mitochondria, despite the greater magnitude of LC3 accumulation following Parkin translocation. We also found that, although Fis1 is degraded during mitophagy, TBC1D15 escapes the degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float">

<title>Role of mitochondrial fission and starvation on autophagosome formation induced by the absence of Fis1 or TBC1D15</title>
<p>Mitochondrial fission has been reported to be involved in mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Twig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we assessed if fission defects generally cause LC3 accumulation. The excessively long mitochondria found in <italic>MFF−/−</italic> or <italic>DRP−/−</italic> cells are converted from an elongated tubular network to larger, more rounded, or bubble-like structures relative to WT cells upon 3 hr valinomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, Parkin translocation and mitochondrial colocalization with YFP-LC3 in <italic>MFF−/−</italic> and <italic>DRP1−/−</italic> cells were similar to those in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>) without the LC3 accumulation and/or tubulation seen in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results suggest that LC3 accumulation is a unique feature following the loss of Fis1 or TBC1D15 and is not caused by defects in mitochondrial fission, consistent with the finding that Fis1 and TBC1D15 do not appear to regulate mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float">

<p>We also investigated the effect of loss of Fis1 or TBC1D15 on starvation-induced autophagy by incubating cells in media lacking amino acids. Upon starvation, the number of YFP-LC3 puncta greatly increased, but indistinguishably between WT, <italic>FIS1−/−</italic>, and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Additionally, immunoblotting of endogenous LC3 demonstrated that although more of the lipidated LC3 was generated upon starvation, the amount was not further increased by the depletion of Fis1 or TBC1D15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Therefore, TBC1D15 and Fis1, which form a complex on mitochondria, seem to govern autophagosome biogenesis specifically during mitophagy.</p>

<title>Identification of TBC1D17 as a Fis1 and TBC1D15 interacting protein</title>
<p>To investigate whether the Fis1 binding of TBC1D15 is important for LC3 accumulation, we introduced into <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells HA-tagged TBC1D15 lacking amino acids 221-250 (HA-TBC1D15 Δ221-250), which was reported to be deficient in Fis1 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>). Unexpectedly, mitochondrial localization of TBC1D15 Δ221-250 was observed under normal growing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and HA-TBC1D15 Δ221-250 could rescue LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells during mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). However, TBC1D15 appears to bind Fis1 as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>) because in a <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> background, TBC1D15 localizes to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, Fis1 overexpression can recruit overexpressed cytosolic WT TBC1D15, but not TBC1D15 Δ221-250, to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results raise the possibility that there is another protein that can facilitate TBC1D15 Δ221-250 binding to Fis1.<fig-group>

<p>The human genome encodes at least 40 different TBC domain-containing proteins. According to phylogenetic and domain analysis of human and mouse TBC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itoh et al., 2006</xref>), TBC1D17 has a high similarity to the primary protein sequence of TBC1D15. Specifically, the region outside the TBC domain comprising 193-312 aa of TBC1D17 is 35% identical (55% positive) to the 201-333 aa region of TBC1D15 that contains the Fis1-interacting region (data not shown), suggesting that TBC1D17 may also interact with Fis1. To test this idea, we expressed HA-tagged TBC1D17 (HA-TBC1D17) with or without Fis1 overexpression in HeLa cells. Overexpressed HA-TBC1D17 alone was cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, after co-overexpression with Fis1, HA-TBC1D17 localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that like TBC1D15, TBC1D17 has an ability to bind Fis1. Similar results were obtained by co-immunoprecipitation with YFP-Fis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Although we were unable to detect endogenous TBC1D17 because no antibody is available, these results suggest that TBC1D17 may also be targeted to mitochondria via an interaction with Fis1. By co-immunoprecipitation, we found that TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 can form homo- and hetero-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, the TBC1D15 Δ221-250 mutant that lacks a Fis1-binding region translocates to mitochondria when co-overexpressed with Fis1 and WT TBC1D15 or WT TBC1D17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), indicating that TBC1D17 can recruit the mutant TBC1D15 to Fis1 through dimerization. These results are also interesting in light of evidence that Fis1 also forms dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jofuku et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lees et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting a new model of Fis1/TBC topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the functional importance of TBC1D17 in mitophagy, we generated <italic>TBC1D17</italic> single KO and <italic>TBC1D15/TBC1D17</italic> double KO (DKO) HCT116 cells by the TALEN methodology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mitochondrial and peroxisomal morphologies in these cells were indistinguishable from those in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). <italic>TBC1D17−/−</italic> cells displayed LC3 accumulation during mitophagy similar to, but less severe than that of <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). However, the degree of LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D15/TBC1D17</italic> DKO cells was not further increased as compared to that of <italic>TBC1D15</italic> single KO. Therefore, in HCT116 cells, TBC1D15 appears to be dominant for contouring autophagosome morphogenesis. TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 may have different cell type expression profiles or different regulatory mechanisms. Overexpression of either TBC1D15 or TBC1D17 can rescue the LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D15/17DKO</italic> cells, whereas the TBC1D15 Δ221-250 mutant cannot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Thus, Fis1 binding is required for TBC1D15 to govern isolation membrane biogenesis during mitophagy.</p>

<title>TBC1D15 binds Atg8 family proteins</title>
<p>The absence of TBC1D15 causes the accumulation and/or tubulation of the autophagosome marker, LC3 upon Parkin activation of mitophagy. This would be consistent with Rab-GAP activity of TBC1D15 switching a Rab protein to an inactive form to counterbalance Parkin-induced Rab activation. We hypothesized that the localization of such a Rab-GAP to mitochondria could inhibit Rab activity on one side of the isolation membrane to help contour the membrane expansion to surround the cargo. TBC1D15 may coordinate mitochondrial attachment to pre-autophagosomal membranes with asymmetric inhibition of Rab proteins to guide autophagosomes to tightly engulf mitochondria. Consistent with this hypothesis, several TBC family proteins such as TBC1D25/OATL1 and TBC1D2B have been reported to directly bind Atg8 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itoh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Popovic et al., 2012</xref>) and TBC1D15 was identified by proteomics to bind Atg8 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrends et al., 2010</xref>). To test this model, we assessed Atg8 family protein interaction with TBC1D15 and sought to identify novel LC3-interacting region (LIR) motifs. In mammals, there are at least six different ATG8 homologues including LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2. Both LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies are found on autophagosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kabeya et al., 2004</xref>). Similar to YFP-LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), YFP-GABARAPL1 also forms massively expanded structures in <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> and in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells after Parkin translocation induced by valinomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We prepared recombinant GST-tagged Atg8 family proteins and subjected them to in vitro binding assays with cell extracts overexpressing YFP-TBC1D15. While GST alone does not bind YFP-TBC1D15, LC3, and GABARAP subfamily members bind in moderate and high amounts to YFP-TBC1D15, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Fis1 cannot bind GABARAPL1, confirming that the binding between TBC1D15 and GABARAPL1 is not mediated indirectly through Fis1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). In general, Atg8 homologues bind through their LDS (LIR docking site) to an LIR motif of a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noda et al., 2008</xref>). We performed more detailed analyses of the mechanism of GABARAPL1 binding to TBC1D15 because the GABARAP subfamily proteins display greater binding than LC3 subfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We made a GABARAPL1 LDS mutant by replacing Y49 and L50 with alanines. Although equal amounts of GST-tagged GABARAPL1 WT and LDS mutant were expressed and immunoprecipitated, the LDS mutant failed to bind YFP-TBC1D15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that the binding occurs through LIR–LDS interactions. This result was confirmed in binding assays of HA-TBC1D15 and YFP-GABARAPL1 expressed in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).<fig-group>

<p>To explore the LDS–LIR interactions in more detail, we assessed potential LIR motifs in TBC1D15. The core of the LIR motif consists of the sequence (W/F/Y)XX(L/I/V), where X is any amino acid and with acidic amino acid residues often found near the LIR motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alemu et al., 2012</xref>). Based on this consensus motif, we identified 20 different LIR candidates in the TBC1D15 protein sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To narrow down candidates, we made and tested TBC1D15 truncations by in vitro binding assays using GST-tagged GABARAPL1. TBC1D15 was first divided into four parts according to the domain structure; the N-terminus (1–200), a region including the Fis1-interacting site (201-333), the TBC domain (334–557), and a C-terminal region (558–674), all of which were tagged with YFP at the N-terminus for detection by immunoblotting. Transiently overexpressed TBC1D15 domains in HEK293 cells subjected to in vitro binding assays revealed that only the 201–333 region retained the affinity for GABARAPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Similar results were obtained when we made longer constructs containing this region also indicating that polypeptides within the 201–333 aa region could efficiently bind GABARAPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Five different LIR candidates were found in the 201–333 aa region. By mutating the aromatic amino acid in each of these five LIR candidates to alanine, we identified <sup>280</sup>FEVI<sup>283</sup> of TBC1D15 as the LIR motif responsible for full length TBC1D15 binding to GABARAPL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). A summary of TBC1D15 binding to GABARAPL1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>.</p>
<p>To examine whether Atg8 binding to TBC1D15 is required to orchestrate autophagosome formation, the TBC1D15 F280A mutant was introduced into <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells. The F280A mutation resides outside the Fis1-binding region (221–250 aa of TBC1D15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Onoue et al., 2013</xref>) and does not affect the mitochondrial targeting of TBC1D15 (data not shown). The LC3 membrane accumulation phenotype of the <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells was only partially rescued by the TBC1D15 F280A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J,K</xref>) relative to the complete rescue seen with WT TBC1D15, indicating that the interaction between TBC1D15 and Atg8 family proteins is important for autophagosome morphogenesis during Parkin-mediated mitophagy.</p>
<p>Interestingly, amino acids 261–264 of TBC1D17 are identical to the sequence of the LIR motif in TBC1D15 (FEVI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To test whether TBC1D17 also has the ability to bind Atg8 family proteins, in vitro binding assays were performed. Both LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies pulled down YFP-TBC1D17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and this interaction was mediated by the LDS domain of ATG8 family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>) with less discrimination between GABARAP and LC3 subfamily members than TBC1D15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Furthermore, the LIR mutation F261A prevented binding of TBC1D17 to GST-LC3B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These results indicate that both TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 have the ability to bind ATG8 family proteins via a LIR–LDS interaction.</p>

<p>As Rab-GAPs, TBC family proteins play important roles by inactivating Rab proteins and different Rab proteins are thought to be regulated by different TBC family members. Although little is known about the pairing between various Rab proteins and TBC proteins, in vitro GTPase assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>) and pull-down assays in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peralta et al., 2010</xref>) suggest that TBC1D15 may function as a Rab-GAP for Rab7. Rab7 is required for endosome maturation and transport from the late endosome to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bento et al., 2013</xref>). However, Rab7 also has been reported to be involved in the biogenesis of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jager et al., 2004</xref>). We hypothesized that if TBC1D15 bound to Fis1 on mitochondria normally inhibits Rab7 during mitophagy through Rab-GAP activity, the excessive LC3-labeled tubulation observed in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (as well as <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells) might be a consequence of excessive or unregulated Rab7 activity. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down Rab7 by siRNA. We found 2 of 4 different siRNAs tested could knock down endogenous Rab7 expression efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These two Rab7 siRNAs were able to completely suppress the abnormal LC3 accumulation and tubulation in both <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> or <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref> and data not shown). We investigated Rab7 localization in WT and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells with or without valinomycin treatment. As we could not detect endogenous Rab7 by immunofluoresence microscopy, we utilized N-terminally 2HA- or YFP-tagged Rab7. In WT or <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells stably expressing YFP-LC3, mCherry-Parkin and 2HA-Rab7, Rab7 predominantly localizes on lysosomes with a weak ER signal both in WT and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, after 3 hr valinomycin treatment of WT cells, 2HA-Rab7 colocalized with some of the YFP-LC3 in WT cells in dot or crescent-shaped structures that represent isolation membranes, indicating that Rab7 is targeted to isolation membranes upon stimulation of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, WT valinomycin). Interestingly, Rab7 was also found on YFP-LC3 positive tubules in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> valinomycin), strongly supporting the hypothesis that Rab7 functions in isolation membrane expansion during mitophagy.<fig-group>

<p>We next asked whether the activity of TBC1D15 was dependent on Rab-GAP activity. The mutant HA-tagged TBC1D15 D397A, which lacks TBC domain GAP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rak et al., 2000</xref>), was compared with WT TBC1D15 for the ability to rescue <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells from excessive LC3 accumulation during Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Although HA-TBC1D15 D397A localizes on mitochondria (data not shown), it fails to rescue the accumulation of LC3 in <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells as WT TBC1D15 does (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of TBC1D17 catalytic mutant R381A could not rescue the LC3 accumulation in the <italic>TBC1D15/TBC1D17</italic> DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Although many different Rab proteins such as Rab5, Rab8, Rab21 and Rab35 have been suggested to be the targets of TBC1D17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Itoh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaibhava et al., 2012</xref>), Rab7 siRNA could suppress YFP-LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D17−/−</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). These results support the model that Rab-GAP activity inhibits Rab7 to mitigate excessive autophagosome membrane expansion during mitophagy and, through Fis1 binding to mitochondria and LC3 family member binding on isolation membranes, tailors the autophagosomal membrane expansion to its cargo.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identify Rab7, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17, and Fis1 as mitophagy effectors functioning downstream of Parkin to regulate autophagosome morphogenesis. Mitochondrial damage is initially signaled to Parkin through the kinase PINK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>). As PINK1 accumulates on the outer membrane of depolarized mitochondria, it recruits Parkin and activates Parkin ubiquitin ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Iguchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng and Hunter, 2013</xref>). Parkin then modifies numerous mitochondrial outer membrane proteins with K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains. This ubiquitin signal appears to recruit ULK1, Atg9 and LC3 to the mitochondrion independently of one another to induce mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Itakura et al., 2012</xref>). Our results also indicate that Rab7 is likely activated by a Rab GEF to promote autophagosomal membrane growth and microtubule associated trafficking and that TBC1D15/17 Rab GAP activity is required to temper Rab7 activity to tailor autophagosomal membrane expansion to surround mitochondrial aggregates. Without TBC1D15, or with TBC1D15 lacking Rab GAP activity, LC3/GABARAP-labeled isolation membranes accumulate excessively and without cargo orientation sending long tubules away from mitochondria along microtubule tracks. This suggests that Rab GAP activity localized on the cargo—facing only one side of the expanding LC3 positive isolation membranes—may inhibit Rab7 activity and thereby inhibit membrane expansion proximal to the cargo forcing the growing membrane to tightly wrap odd shaped cargo. Alternatively, perhaps LC3-decorated preautophagosomal structures traffic along microtubules toward Parkin-ubiquitinated mitochondria and fuse together around mitochondrial aggregates where TBC1D15 bound to mitochondria inhibits Rab7 to mediate the release of LC3-bound membranes from microtubules as they contact the mitochondrial cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankiv et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells display normal LC3 accumulation during starvation suggesting that these membrane expansion steps are specific for mitophagy or other forms of selective autophagy. Xenophagy, for example, also requires Rab proteins for sequestering invading bacteria in autophagosome-like vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamaguchi et al., 2009</xref>), consistent with the idea that isolation membrane expansion is mediated by Rab activity. Parkin also may activate Rab proteins as a step in xenophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manzanillo et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We identify an LIR domain in TBC1D15, conserved in TBC1D17, that is also required to restrain isolation membrane biogenesis to the surface of the mitochondria. Proteins that contain both an LIR domain and a ubiquitin-associated domain such as p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjorkoy et al., 2005</xref>), optineurin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wild et al., 2011</xref>), NBR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirkin et al., 2009</xref>), and NDP52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thurston et al., 2009</xref>) can bind to LC3 and to polyubiquitin chains to recruit ubiquitinated cargo into nascent isolation membranes. TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 are also LIR domain-containing LC3/GABARAP-binding proteins. However, in contrast to the ubiquitin-binding LIR domain proteins, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 appear to constitutively bind to mitochondria through Fis1 and thus, unless somehow regulated, would not appear to initiate the recruitment of LC3 to mitochondria. More likely, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 use LC3/GABARAP binding in the context of Rab GAP activity to orient growing isolation membranes to the surface of the cargo. Interestingly, TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 appear to heterodimerize and homodimerize, which may increase their affinity for LC3/GABARAP by multivalent binding. Fis1 also forms dimers consistent with its role as the TBC1D15/17 receptor. The self association of TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 is shared by other ubiquitin-binding LIR domain proteins such as p62 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birgisdottir et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously reported that <italic>FIS1−/−</italic> cells display no detectable mitochondrial morphology phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is well established that yeast Fis1 binds Dnm1 through Mdv1/Caf4 and regulates mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okamoto and Shaw, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, Fis1 loss in <italic>C. elegans</italic> causes LC3 accumulation and has been linked to stress-induced mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, Dnm1 activity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2013</xref>), and Drp1 activity in mammalian cells is required for mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Twig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frank et al., 2012</xref>) suggesting a link with Fis1 in mitophagy. In contrast to human Fis1, yeast Fis1 has an N-terminal extension that folds back into a pocket used by other tetratricopeptide motif proteins to bind ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2005</xref>). It will be important to determine how TBC1D15 interacts with human Fis1 and if the Rab GAP-binding activity of human Fis1 is conserved in yeast. Fis1 also localizes to peroxisomes and would be predicted to recruit TBC1D15/17 to peroxisomes as well, suggesting that Fis1 and TBC1D15/17 may also play a role in pexophagy.</p>

After transfer to PVDF membrane, blocking and incubation with primary antibodies, proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and ECL Plus or ECL Prime western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).</p>

<p>GST alone or GST-tagged Atg8 family proteins were overexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) from the plasmids, which were a gift from Dr Terje Johansen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pankiv et al., 2007</xref>). Transformants were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37°C and the protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-<sub>D</sub>-thiogalactopyranoside for 24 hr at 16°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and kept at −80°C before use. The cell pellets were lysed with B-PER bacterial extraction reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) supplemented with 100 μg/ml lysozyme and 5 units/ml DNaseI and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After sonication, the cell debris and insoluble fraction were removed by centrifugation (20,000×<italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4°C). The resulting supernatant was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with PBS for 1 hr at 4°C. GST-bound sepharose was washed three times with PBS-containing 500 mM NaCl. YFP-tagged TBC1D15 and its derivatives were overexpressed in HEK293 cells grown in a six-well plate. The cells were washed with PBS twice, and solubilized with 0.5% TX-100 buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 8% [vol/vol] glycerol, 25 mM NaF, 0.5 [vol/vol] Triton X-100, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) for 20 min on ice. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation (20,000×<italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4°C). The resulting supernatants were mixed with GST protein-bound sepharose in TBC-binding buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 8% [vol/vol] glycerol, 25 mM NaF) for 3 hr at 4°C. The sepharose slurry was washed with 0.1% TX-100 buffer three times and proteins were eluted with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 80 mM dithiothreitol.</p>
<p>The in vitro binding assay using GFP-Trap was performed as follows. YFP-tagged proteins and interacting candidates were co-overexpressed in HEK293 cells grown in six-well plates by transient transfection with Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). After 24 hr of transfection, the cells were washed with PBS twice and solubilized with 0.5% TX-100 buffer for 20 min on ice. The resulting lysates were clarified by centrifugation and mixed with equilibrated GFP-Trap resin (Chromotek, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany) in TBC-binding buffer for 1 hr at 4°C. Proteins were washed with 0.1% TX-100 buffer three times before elution with LDS sample buffer containing 80 mM dithiothreitol.</p>

<p>HCT116 WT and <italic>TBC1D15−/−</italic> cells stably expressing YFP-LC3 and mCherry-Parkin were treated with Valinomycin for 3 hr and fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. The fixed cells were washed four times with PBS, followed by permeabilization for 40 min with 0.1% Saponin and 5% goat serum in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 1 hr with mouse anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen clone 3E6), followed by 1 hr with nanogold-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Nanoprobes) and further processing as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanner et al., 1996</xref>). Thin sections (∼80 nm) were counter stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were examined with a JEOL 200 CX transmission electron microscope. Images were collected with a digital CCD camera (AMT XR-100; Danvers, MA).</p>

<p>eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p>
</boxed-text>
<p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Mitochondrial Rab GAPs govern autophagosome biogenesis during mitophagy” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p>
<p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
<p>The present manuscript by Yamano et al. reports interesting results to suggest a role for the mitochondrial Rab GAPs TBC1D15 and TBC1D17 in mitophagy. More specifically, TBC1D15 binds to Fis1 located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and to LC3/GABARAP protein(s) on the phagophore while restraining (inhibiting) Rab7 activity at the interface between mitochondria and the phagophore.</p>
<p>This report provides a novel mechanism how damaged mitochondria are recognized by autophagy. Overall, the manuscript is well written and the results are mostly convincing. However, there are some criticisms/concerns that need to be addressed before publication.</p>
<p>1) The authors use the term “expansion” in several ways, such as “isolation membrane expansion”, “autophagosomal expansion”, and “LC3 membrane expansion”. However, the nature of this process is unclear. It is possible that the expansion represent dynein-dependent transport of the abnormal mitochondria–autophagosome complex (LC3-positive mitochondria) or its clusters rather than elongation of the isolation membranes. It is even possible that these LC3-positive structures are aggregates/aggresomes of the LC3 protein, which can be formed in a microtubule-dependent manner. To address these issues, (1) the author should observe and compare isolation membrane marker proteins during mitophagy in control, <italic>FIS1</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells, and <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells, and (2) perform electron microcopy to clarify the nature of the expanded LC3 structures.</p>
<p>2) The effect of deletion of FIS1 or TBC1D15 on mitophagy is modest. The authors only show that the level of TOMM20 is higher in <italic>FIS1</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> and <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells compared to wild-type cells at 40 h after valinomycin treatment. As this is one of the main conclusions of this study, it should be more vigorously investigated, for example by quantification of mtDNA and other protein markers.</p>
<p>3) The role of Rab7 in mitophagy is also not convincing. Although there seems to be a significant difference in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> do not convincingly support this quantification results. In particular, at which step mitophagosome formation is blocked is not clearly demonstrated. Again, electron microscopy can distinguish whether membrane formation or fusion is inhibited at an early or late step, or recognition of mitochondria by autophagic membranes is impaired.</p>
<p>4) The order of figures is not well structured and not easy to follow throughout the manuscript. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is referred prior to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, and parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are discussed later in the manuscript after <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Please consider rearranging the figure to fit with the order of description in the text.</p>
<p>5) The authors need to describe how they define each group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig2s2 fig2s3 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig7">Figure 1C, 1E, 2B, 2C, 2E, 2S2B, 2S3B, 3D, 4B, 4C, 5B, 5D, and 7C</xref>. Especially, the criteria how the authors count diffuse, punctate, and aggregated LC3 should be clearly stated. The authors also need to state how many cells they counted for the statistical analyses.</p>

<italic>1) The authors use the term “expansion” in several ways, such as “isolation membrane expansion”, “autophagosomal expansion”, and “LC3 membrane expansion”. However, the nature of this process is unclear. It is possible that the expansion represent dynein-dependent transport of the abnormal mitochondria-autophagosome complex (LC3-positive mitochondria) or its clusters rather than elongation of the isolation membranes. It is even possible that these LC3-positive structures are aggregates/aggresomes of the LC3 protein, which can be formed in a microtubule-dependent manner. To address these issues, (1) the author should observe and compare isolation membrane marker proteins during mitophagy in control,</italic> FIS1<sup>−/−</sup> <italic>cells, and</italic> TBC1D15<sup>−/−</sup> <italic>cells, and (2) perform electron microcopy to clarify the nature of the expanded LC3 structures</italic>.</p>
<p>We agree that we should use the term “expansion” more carefully. We also agree that the expansion may result from excessive dynein-dependent transport and have added more discussion of that to the manuscript. Based on our new electron microscopy data where we see LC3 associated with membranes and not in protein aggregates, we now consistently use the term “LC3 accumulation” when fluorescence microscopy and/or Western blotting shows higher levels of YFP-LC3. When we discuss the tubulation, we say “LC3-labeled tubules” instead of the term “membrane expansion” because we currently do not know the nature of the LC3-labeled tubules other than that they appear membranous (see new Figure 3B).</p>
<p>To address the nature of LC3 in more detail, we observed and compared isolation membrane marker proteins and upstream autophagy-related proteins by fluorescence microscopy as suggested. We made HCT116 WT, <italic>FIS1</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> and <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells stably expressing GFP-mouseULK1 (the most upstream ATG1/ULK kinase complex), GFP-mouseDFCP1 (PI3P-binding protein that can be used as an omegasome marker), and GFP-Atg14 (one of the subunits of Class III PI3K complex) and examined their accumulation during valinomycin-induced Parkin-mediated mitophagy. We also detected endogenous Atg16L1 that is associated with Atg12-Atg5 complex and serves as an isolation membrane marker. All of these labeled proteins were recruited adjacent to mitochondria by valinomycin treatment, but the number of dots or signals was similar among WT, <italic>FIS1</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup>, and <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells. These data are now presented as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5 fig2s6">Figure 2–figure supplement 5 and 6</xref>. These data suggest that in <italic>FIS1</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> or in <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells, only or primarily Atg8 family proteins accumulate during mitophagy. This is consistent with Itakura et al<italic>.</italic> (2012) J Cell Sci 125: 1488-99 showing that recruitment of upstream autophagy regulators such as ULK1, Atg14, DFCP1 and Atg16L1 and recruitment of LC3 are independent events during Parkin-mediated mitophagy and reveals that Fis1 and TBC1D15 function downstream of these steps. This is consistent with our model in which TBC1D15 and Rab7 function after Parkin translocation more proximal to isolation membrane expansion or trafficking.</p>
<p>To clarify the YFP-LC3 labeled structures both in WT and <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells, we also performed immunoelectron microscopy. Valinomycin (3 hrs treatment) induced closely apposed preautophagosome membranes that are labeled with gold particles attached to YFP-LC3 in mCherry-Parkin stably expressing WT cells. <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells also have similar cup-shaped preautophagosomal membranes, but many of them displayed much thicker lumens than those in WT cells. In addition, we saw more alternate types of LC3-labeled membranes in <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells. Frequently, larger LC3-labeled membrane capsules were found that contained mitochondria and membrane structures that were not identifiable - these may be partially degraded mitochondria, compacted autophagosomal membranes or tubules or other structures. Moreover, YFP-LC3 in <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells sometimes associates with small diameter membrane structures such as late endosomes localized very close to mitochondria. However, these may connect to isolation membranes out of plane of the EM section. We think the LC3-label seen by fluorescence microscopy is derived from all these different types of LC3-labeled membranes. Of note, immunoelectron microscopy data indicates that LC3-positive structures in <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells are not aggregates or aggresomes of LC3 protein. We added these electron microscopy data to new Figure 2F and G and Figure 3B.</p>

As this is one of the main conclusions of this study, it should be more vigorously investigated, for example by quantification of mtDNA and other protein markers</italic>.</p>
<p>Using YFP-Parkin stably expressing cells, we could detect and quantify the mtDNA-encoded protein COXII by immunoblotting. We also quantified the decrease of the outer membrane protein TOMM20 and the matrix protein HSP60. After 40 hrs valinomycin treatment, degradation of not only TOMM20 but also HSP60 and COXII was retarded in <italic>FIS1</italic>

<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> and <italic>TBC1D15</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> when compared to that in WT cells. Although this is not a major conclusion of our paper, these results indicate that loss of Fis1 or TBC1D15 affect the efficient clearance of damaged mitochondria by Parkin/PINK1 mediated mitophagy. We separated these mitophagy data (original Figure 2F and G) from the original Figure 2 and made a new Figure 4 (the original Figure 4 is now Figure 5).</p>

<italic>3) The role of Rab7 in mitophagy is also not convincing. Although there seems to be a significant difference in Figure 7C, the images in Figure 7B do not convincingly support this quantification results. In particular, at which step mitophagosome formation is blocked is not clearly demonstrated. Again, electron microscopy can distinguish whether membrane formation or fusion is inhibited at an early or late step, or recognition of mitochondria by autophagic membranes is impaired</italic>.</p>
<p>We now provide low magnification images with 10-20 cells per field that show Rab7 knock down erases LC3-labeled accumulation and/or tubulation. The lower magnification images display a significant and clear difference of LC3 accumulation in <italic>TBC1D15</italic>

<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells (and also <italic>FIS1</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> cells) dependent on Rab7 knock down. These data are now presented as new Figure 8–figure—figure supplement 1A. We hope that these data adequately support the quantification results in Figure 8C.</p>
<p>Although several published papers have reported that Rab7 is involved in fusion between lysosome and autophagosome, we see a more upstream activity of Rab7 function in mitophagy such as the relation of Rab7 to microtube-dependent movement that is not detected during starvation induced autophagy. We have revised the Discussion to make this more clear.</p>

<italic>4) The order of figures is not well structured and not easy to follow throughout the manuscript. For example,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">
<italic>Figure 5</italic>
</xref> <italic>is referred prior to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">
<italic>Figure 1D and E</italic>
</xref>
<italic>, and parts of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">
<italic>Figure 2</italic>
</xref> <italic>are discussed later in the manuscript after</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">

<italic>. Please consider rearranging the figure to fit with the order of description in the text</italic>.</p>
<p>We have separated the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref> (mitophagy assays) from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and moved them to a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with new data (the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> became now a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also moved the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref> (mitochondrial morphology of <italic>TBC1D17</italic>
<sup>
<italic>-/-</italic>
</sup> and <italic>TBC1D15/17 DKO</italic> cells) to a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>–figure—figure supplement 2. We also separated the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>, with part moving into the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

<italic>5) The authors need to describe how they define each group in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig2s2 fig2s3 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig7">
<italic>Figure 1C, 1E, 2B, 2C, 2E, 2S2B, 2S3B, 3D, 4B, 4C, 5B, 5D, and 7C</italic>

<italic>. Especially, the criteria how the authors count diffuse, punctate, and aggregated LC3 should be clearly stated. The authors also need to state how many cells they counted for the statistical analyses</italic>.</p>
<p>As the reviewers requested, we have now described the criteria of mitochondrial morphology and Parkin translocation in the figure legends. For the criteria of LC3 morphology, we made a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) with specific image examples of diffuse, puntate and accumulated LC3. We counted over 100 cells in each of triplicate wells for LC3 morphology and over 50 cells each in triplicate wells for the other statistical analyses including mitochondrial morphology, starvation-induced autophagy, and rescue experiments. This information is now added to the figure legends.</p>
