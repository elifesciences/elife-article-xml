self-replicators are considered to develop into diverse, complex living organisms. The appearance of parasitic replicators is believed inevitable in this process. However, the role of parasitic replicators in prebiotic evolution remains elusive. Here, we demonstrated experimental coevolution of RNA self-replicators (host RNAs) and emerging parasitic replicators (parasitic RNAs) using an RNA-protein replication system we developed. During a long-term replication experiment, a clonal population of the host RNA turned into an evolving host-parasite ecosystem through the continuous emergence of new types of host and parasitic RNAs produced by replication errors. The host and parasitic RNAs diversified into at least two and three different lineages, respectively, and they exhibited evolutionary arms-race dynamics. The parasitic RNA accumulated unique mutations, thus adding a new genetic variation to the whole replicator ensemble. These results provide the first experimental evidence that the coevolutionary interplay between host-parasite molecules plays a key role in generating diversity and complexity in prebiotic molecular evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>artificial cell</kwd><kwd>RNA replication system</kwd><kwd>self-replication system</kwd><kwd>in vitro evolution</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd><kwd>molecular parasite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15KT0080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichihashi</surname><given-names>Norikazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15H04407</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichihashi</surname><given-names>Norikazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17J01023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furubayashi</surname><given-names>Taro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012020</institution-id><institution>Sekisui Chemical</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Innovations Inspired by Nature Research Support Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichihashi</surname><given-names>Norikazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006321</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Natural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Astrobiology Center Program AB021005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichihashi</surname><given-names>Norikazu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In an in vitro RNA replication system, an RNA spontaneously diversifies and continuously evolves through coevolution with parasitic entities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host-parasite coevolution is at the center of the entire course of biological evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Claverie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forterre and Prangishvili, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koonin and Dolja, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014</xref>).

In this system, the artificial genomic RNA (host RNA) replicates through the translation of the self-encoded replicase subunit. During replication, a deletion mutant of the host RNA (parasitic RNA), which lost the encoded replicase subunit gene, spontaneously appears and replicates by freeriding the replicase provided by the host RNA. Through serial nutrient supply and dilution, the host and parasitic RNAs in water-in-oil droplets undergo repeated error-prone replication and natural selection processes, thatÂ is Darwinian evolution.</p><p>In a subsequent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>), we performed a serial transfer replication experiment of the aforementioned RNA replication system to study the evolutionary process of the host and parasitic RNA replicators. We reported that the host and parasitic RNAs showed oscillating population dynamics and that the host RNA acquired a certain level of parasite-resistance in the final rounds of the replication experiment (43 rounds, 215 hr). However, we did not observe counter-adaptative evolution of the parasitic RNA to the host RNA, and the coevolutionary process of the host and parasitic RNAs remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we reasoned that a much longer time may be necessary for coevolution of the host and parasitic RNA replicators; hence, we extended the replication experiment by an additional 77 rounds (385 hr). To understand their evolutionary dynamics during the replication experiment, we performed sequence analysis of the host and parasitic RNAs. We also conducted competitive replication assays using evolved host and parasitic RNA clones to confirm the coevolution of the host and parasitic RNAs. Moreover, we fully reanalyzed the host-parasite RNA population (up to 43 rounds) partially reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>). In this paper, we present an analysis of 120 rounds (600 hr) of a longer term replication experiment, incorporating new data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA replication system</title><p>The RNA replication system used in this study consists of two classes of single-stranded RNAs (host and parasitic RNAs) and a reconstituted translation system of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimizu et al., 2001</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A distinctive feature of the host and parasitic RNAs is the capability of providing an RNA replicase (QÎ² replicase). The host RNA provides the catalytic Î²-subunit of the replicase (via translation), which forms active replicase by associating with EF-Tu and EF-Ts subunits in the translation system, whereas the parasitic RNA lacks the intact gene. The host RNA replicates using the self-provided replicase, whereas the parasitic RNA relies on the host-provided replicase. We used a clone from round 128 in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ichihashi et al., 2013</xref>) as the original host RNA because it replicates fast and had been characterized in detail.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Host and parasitic RNA replication system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Replication scheme of the host and parasitic RNAs.

The parasitic RNAs reported previously have similar sizes (~200 nt). We refer to parasitic RNA of this size as âparasite-Î±'. Parasite-Î± replicates much faster than the original host RNA (~2040 nt), owing to its smaller size, and thus inhibits the host replication through competition for the replicase. The replication with QÎ² replicase is error-prone, approximately 1.0Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â5</sup> per base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GarcÃ­a-Villada and Drake, 2012</xref>), and mutations are randomly introduced into the host and parasitic RNAs during the replication reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Long-term replication experiment</title><p>We performed a long-term replication experiment of the host and parasitic RNAs.

A single round of the experiment consisted of four steps: 1) incubation, 2) partial removal, 3) dilution, and 4) mixing. In the incubation process, the water-in-oil droplets were incubated at 37Â°C for 5 hr to induce internal translation and RNA replication reactions. We started with a clonal population of the host RNA (1 nM,Â ~6Â ÃÂ 10<sup>9</sup> molecules) without parasite-Î±, which was, however, detected within two rounds. In the partial removal process, we removed 80% of the water-in-oil droplets. In the dilution process, we substituted them with new water-in-oil droplets containing the cell-free translation system (i.e. five-fold dilution). In the mixing process, droplets were vigorously mixed with a homogenizer to induce fusion and division among the droplets and allow the mixing of RNAs and other components. This replication-dilution cycle does not require manual mutagenesis, selection procedures, and control of the RNA copy number in the droplets, allowing easy implementation of long-term in vitro molecular evolution.

In the early stage (rounds one toÂ ~35), the host RNA and parasite-Î± showed a relatively regular oscillation pattern caused by competition between the host and parasitic RNAs in compartments. In this regime, the concentrations of parasite-Î± were higher than those of the host RNA. In the middle stage (roundsÂ ~Â 35 to~75), the concentrations of the host RNA increased, and the oscillation pattern became irregular. The elevation of the host RNA concentration can be attributed to less replication inhibition by parasite-Î±. We have previously reported that some nonsynonymous mutations in QÎ² replicase encoded by the host RNA in round 43 selectively reduce the replication efficiency of parasite-Î± (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>). The prevalence of these mutations probably allows the host RNA population to maintain higher concentrations than that in the early stage. In the later stage (roundsÂ ~Â 95 to~116), the concentrations of the host and parasite-Î± further increased, and the oscillation pattern became more unclear. In this regime, we observed the appearance of new parasitic RNA species of different sizes and classified them as parasite-Î² (~1000 nt, green squares) and parasite-Î³ (~500 nt, purple diamonds) according to their sizes. We termed these new RNAs âparasitesâ because each clone of these RNAs did not replicate alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Such continuously changing population dynamics can be caused by successive adaptation processes between host and parasitic RNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of host-parasite RNA populations at the sequence level, we recovered RNA mixtures from 17 points (rounds 13, 24, 33, 39, 43, 50, 53, 60, 65, 72, 86, 91, 94, 99, 104, 110, and 115), and subjected them to reverse transcription followed by deep sequencing with PacBio RS II for the host, parasite-Î², and parasite-Î³ and MiSeq for parasite-Î±. With PacBio RS II sequencing, we obtained 365â4143 reads for each class of RNA in the sequenced rounds.

The sequences of all the classes of parasitic RNA shared a high degree of similarity with those of the host RNAs but lacked a large part of the replicase subunit gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The parasite-Î± sequence class lacks the entire gene. The parasite-Î² sequence class lacks approximately the 3â half of the gene, and parasite-Î³ sequence class further lacksÂ ~25% of the remaining 5â region of the gene. Both parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³ retain a part of the M-site sequence, one of the recognition sites for QÎ² replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schuppli et al., 1998</xref>), in the middle of the gene.</p><p>We then determined the dominant genotypes of all the classes of RNA (host, parasite-Î±, parasite-Î², and parasite-Î³). Although the RNA replication by QÎ² replicase is error-prone and introduces many random mutations that produced quasi-species for each genotype, we focused on the consensus sequences that consist of mutations commonly found in the RNA population. We first identified 74 dominant mutations that were present in more than 10% of the population of each class of RNA in a sequenced round. The dominant mutations consisted of 60 base substitutions, four insertions, and 10 deletions in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Then, we measured the frequencies of all the genotypes composed of the combination of these 74 dominant mutations in every sequenced round for each class of RNA.

From round 0 to round 43, sequences diversified around the original genotype. Then, until round 72, most of the genotypes moved toward the upper-right branches. However, in round 86, a certain fraction of the genotypes shifted to the left branch and dominated until round 99. In round 104, most of the genotypes moved back to the right branch again and stayed there until round 115.

Parasite-Î± did not show clear directionality throughout the long-term replication experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, we identified 18 unique mutations specific to parasite-Î± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), which were not found in the corresponding region of the host sequence. The persistence of the unique mutations of parasite-Î± and the differences in the mutational patterns of parasite-Î± and the coevolving hosts indicate that many of the new parasite-Î± genotypes were not newly generated from evolving host RNAs, and that parasite-Î± maintained its own lineage and evolved independently of the host RNA. We also observed the appearance of new parasite-Î± species from the evolved host RNAs owing to deletion. For example, a parasite-Î± genotype that appeared in round 94 perfectly matched with a host genotype in round 94 (connected with a red broken line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), except for a large internal deletion, suggesting that this parasite was generated from the evolving host through a deletion event. Note that we could not obtain the sequence data of parasite-Î± in rounds 39, 50, and 65 because the cDNA could not be recovered.</p><p>The populations of parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³ formed distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and most of the genotypes were closely related within each class (connected with one Hamming distance lines). Sequences of some parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³ perfectly matched with some dominant host RNAs coexisting in the same rounds as those connected with green or purple broken lines each, suggesting that these parasitic RNAs originated from the host RNAs. Unlike parasite-Î±, we found only 2 and 1 unique mutations for parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To understand the relationship between the host and parasite lineages, we performed phylogenic analysis of the top three most frequent genotypes of the host and parasite RNAs in all the sequenced rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The phylogenic tree contains two large branches: branch P (colored in red) contains most parasite-Î± and branch H (colored in blue) contains all the other RNAs. This result confirmed that parasite-Î± evolved independently. Branch H further contains two sub-branches: branch H1 contains all parasite-Î² and host RNAs in rounds 60â99, and branch H2 contains all parasite-Î³ and host RNAs during the early (until 65â86) and later (104-115) rounds. This result support that there are two lineages in the host RNAs, corresponding to the population rounds, Host-99 and Host-115, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, and that parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³ are their respective descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We could not find a clear trend in transition for parasite-Î± (i.e. in branch P). The earliest parasite-Î± in round 13 (indicated with red asterisks) were already distributed into different sub-branches, and those at later rounds existed within or around the sub-branches. This result indicates that many of the mutations that characterized parasite-Î± appeared and were fixed by round 13, and then parasite-Î± wandered around in the sequence space. It is also notable that a parasite-Î± genotype (Alpha 094R Rank2 with a green tick) are located within host clusters, indicating that it emerged from the evolved host in a later round.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Competitive replication assay of host and parasitic RNAs</title><p>The diversification of host genotypes and the appearance of novel parasite classes can be a consequence of the coevolution between the hosts and parasites to adapt to each other. To test this possibility, we performed a series of competitive replication assays using three representative host and parasitic RNAs. We chose the most dominant host genotypes in rounds 0, 99, and 115 (Host-0, Host-99, and Host-115, respectively). For parasite-Î±, parasite-Î², and parasite-Î³, we chose the most dominant genotypes in rounds 13, 99, and 115 (Parasite-Î±13, Parasite-Î²99, and Parasite-Î³115), respectively (sequences are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We mixed a pair of these host and parasitic RNA clones, according to their order of appearance, at an equivalent molarity, and performed competitive replication. The concentrations of replicated RNAs were measured by sequence-specific RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). RT-qPCR of parasites was possible in this experiment because we designed primers very specific to each parasite clone, which was not possible for the evolving RNA mixture containing various mutations. In the first pair (Host-0 vs Parasite-Î±13), Host-0 hardly replicated (less than 2-fold) and Parasite-Î±13 predominantly replicated (~200 fold), indicating that Parasite-Î±13 severely inhibits the original host replication, whereas in the second pair (Host-99 vs Parasite-Î±13), Host-99 efficiently replicated (~700 fold) with negligible replication of Parasite-Î±13, indicating that Host-99 acquired resistance to Parasite-Î±13. In the third pair (Host-99 vs Parasite-Î²99), Host-99 replicated efficiently (~1000 fold), but Parasite-Î²99 also replicated up toÂ ~20 fold, indicating that Parasite-Î²99 acquired the ability to co-replicate with Host-99. In the fourth pair (Host-115 vs Parasite-Î²99), Host-115 repressed the replication of Parasite-Î²99 to less than twofold, indicating that Host-115 acquired the ability to evade co-replication of Parasite-Î²99. In the final pair (Host-115 vs Parasite-Î³115), Parasite-Î³115 acquired the ability to replicate up toÂ ~20 fold with Host-115. These results demonstrated that successive counter-adaptive evolution (i.e. evolutionary arms races) occurred among the host and parasitic RNAs, as schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

In this study, we investigated the Darwinian evolution process of an RNA replication system and demonstrated the emergence of a host-parasite ecosystem in which new types of host and parasitic RNAs appeared successively and exhibited antagonistic coevolutionary dynamics. Notably, all the host and parasite RNAs that appeared in the long-term replication experiment are descendants of the single host RNA. Throughout the replication experiment, the host RNA continued to evolve and diverge into distinct evolutionary branches in a sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>), which stands in sharp contrast to the previously reported unidirectional and rapidly slowing evolution of the host RNA in the absence of frequent interactions with parasitic RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ichihashi et al., 2013</xref>). The diversification of parasitic RNAs into three distinct parasite classes is also a new phenomenon that was not observed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>). The dynamic change of the host-parasite genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2CâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) indicates that evolving parasites could have driven the diversification of the host RNA by providing varying selection pressure. In fact, the diverged host RNAs (Host-99 and Host-115) had very different mutational patterns, with only a few shared mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>), supporting the possibility that parasites with different phenotypes promoted the evolution of different strategies of host RNAs, as discussed below. This coevolution-driven diversification is consistent with the consequence of natural host-parasite coevolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohannan and Lenski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckling and Rainey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thompson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woolhouse et al., 2002</xref>) and simulated in silico evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takeuchi and Hogeweg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zaman et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, evolutionary arms races between host-parasite molecules may have been an important mechanism to generate and maintain diversity in molecular ecosystems before the origin of life.</p><p>High-resolution sequence tracking of RNA populations allowed the observation of reciprocal host-parasite mutational dynamics underlying evolutionary arms-race history. In the first sequenced round (round 13), parasite-Î± had already accumulated as many as seven mutations, whereas the host did not have fixed beneficial mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Six out of these seven mutations are unique mutations of parasite-Î± and five of them continued to exist until the final round (round 115), implying that parasite-Î±, which appeared in the early stage of evolution, maintained continuous lineage and persisted throughout the long-term replication experiment. A clear sign of adaptive evolution of the host first appeared in round 39, consistent with the elevation of host RNA concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Nonsynonymous mutations (Lys208Asp, Leu448Arg, and Gln459Arg) in QÎ² replicase that occurred in this round were found responsible for the resistance against parasite-Î± in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, between rounds 50 and 72, many mutations appeared and disappeared in both the host and parasitic RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), and both genotypes wandered around the sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that a co-evolutionary event had occurred. For example, the parasite-Î± RNA concentration suddenly recovered in round 53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and quick accumulation of the C1986U mutation might have been beneficial. Thereafter, the host accumulated two non-synonymous mutations (A452G and A626G), and the C1986U mutation disappeared from parasite-Î± in round 65. From round 86, the host accumulated as many as 11 mutations simultaneously, and the population rapidly converged toward the left branch, including Host-99, in the sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In round 104, coincident with the rise of parasite-Î², all the 11 mutations that characterizes the left-branch hosts almost disappeared from the population. Instead, eight new mutations accumulated in the host, and the population quickly moved toward the right branch, including Host-115. The genotype of parasite-Î± also drastically changed in round 104, suggesting its adaptive evolution to the hosts in the right branch. Upon the invasion of parasite-Î³ in round 115, some mutations (e.g. C72U, C259U, U501C, and A851G) appeared and disappeared in the host population. These host-parasite mutational dynamics exhibit how coevolution progressed during the replication experiment. Finally, we mention that we searched for possible recombination events in the host and parasite sequences throughout the replication experiment, using the RDP4 program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al., 2015</xref>), but did not detect a recombination signal.</p><p>The mutational patterns of the host and parasitic RNAs in this study suggest an interesting possibility that parasites could bring about new information in a molecular population. Parasite-Î± accumulated nine dominant mutations in the 3â-UTR, whereas the host RNA never accumulated dominant mutations during long-term evolution in the region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This result suggests that mutations in the 3â-UTR of the host RNA are severely limited (constraint imposed by translation efficiency). Evolving and persistent parasitic molecules with less mutational constraints may add genetic novelties to the whole molecular ensemble and play a role in the evolution of complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adami et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>It is generally believed that evolution progresses toward more complexity in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petrov, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharov, 2006</xref>); however, genome reduction is also a popular mode of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albalat and CaÃ±estro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolf and Koonin, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the condition in which genomic information expands and reduces is a fundamental question. Especially in the prebiotic molecular evolution context, the benefit of genome reduction is obvious because shorter molecules can replicate faster. In fact, in previous in vitro Darwinian evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ichihashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills et al., 1967</xref>), evolution favored shorter genomes for faster replication; selection for longer genomes has not been reported. A remarkable phenomenon in our study is that longer parasites with a long RNA genome appeared after long-term evolution (after 94 rounds). The new parasites, parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³, became longer because they retained a part of the M-site sequence, a recognition site for QÎ² replicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schuppli et al., 1998</xref>), which did not exist in parasite-Î±. A plausible scenario for the appearance of these parasites is as follows: (1) parasite-Î± first invaded the system, taking advantage of its short genome for faster replication; (2) the host RNA evolved the specificity of QÎ² replicase to host-specific sequences (including the M-site) to circumvent parasite-Î±; and (3) the new parasites invaded the system because they retained evolved M-sites that were recognized by evolved QÎ² replicases when they appeared from the evolved hosts. According to this scenario, the new parasites appeared to be expanding the genomic information to cope with the evolved strategy of the host RNA, which may be consistent with recent theoretical studies that suggest that host-parasite antagonistic coevolution is an effective mechanism to increase the complexity of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seoane and SolÃ©, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaman et al., 2014</xref>). The next important question would be whether further long-term coevolution can lead to genome expansion of the host RNA.</p><p>A typical phenomenon in host-parasite coevolution is Red Queen dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rabajante et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Valen, 1973</xref>), in which host and parasite populations oscillate due to persistent replacement of dominant hosts and parasites. The host-parasite RNA population in our replication experiment exhibited Red Queen dynamics with a remarkable feature of damping fluctuations. One possible reason for the damped oscillation is simply the elevation of the average parasite resistance against parasite-Î± in the evolved host RNA population, which may be partly supported by the weakened inhibition of the host replication by the parasitic RNAs in later rounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Another possibility is that increased diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2CâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) allows competition among various types of host and parasitic RNAs to average the population dynamics. A study on <italic>Daphnia</italic> and its parasite also reported damped long-term host-parasite Red Queen coevolutionary dynamics and suggested that the increased host diversity as a consequence of coevolution could decrease fluctuations in host-parasite Red Queen dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decaestecker et al., 2013</xref>). Theoretical studies also suggest that intra-species phenotypic divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van der Laan and Hogeweg, 1995</xref>) and mutation rate elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko and Ikegami, 1992</xref>) can lead to stable host-parasite (or prey-predator) coexistence with small-amplitude oscillation. Our simple and fast-evolving host-parasite RNA replication system may offer a useful platform to investigate these tendencies of ecological and evolutionary dynamics of hosts and parasites and further pursue an exciting evolution scenario, such as the emergence of cooperation between host-parasite replicators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Long-term replication experiment</title><p>In this study, we performed an additional 77 rounds of replication using the RNA population of round 43 of a previous experiment, using the same method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>).

The average diameter of the water-in-oil droplets wasÂ ~2 Î¼m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>), and the number of droplets wasÂ ~2Â ÃÂ 10<sup>9</sup>. After the incubation step in each round, RNA concentrations were measured as described below. The composition of the translation system has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Measurement of host RNA concentrations</title><p>After the incubation step, the water-in-oil droplets were diluted 10,000-fold with 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and subjected to RT-qPCR (PrimeScript One Step RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa)) with primers 1 and 2 after heating at 95Â°C for 5 min. These primers specifically bind to the host RNA. To draw a standard curve in RT-qPCR, dilution series of the water-in-oil droplets containing the original host RNA diluted 10,000-fold with 1 mM EDTA were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Measurement of parasitic RNA concentrations</title><p>To determine the concentrations of the parasitic RNAs that appeared during the long-term replication experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed, followed by quantification of the fluorescence intensities of the parasitic RNA bands using ImageJ. The water phases were collected from the water-in-oil droplets after the incubation step at each round, and RNAs were purified with spin columns (RNeasy, QIAGEN). The purified RNA samples and dilution series of the standard parasitic RNA (S222 RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hosoda et al., 2007</xref>]) were subjected to 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 0.1% SDS in TBE buffer (pH 8.4) containing tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (100 mM), boric acid (90 mM), and EDTA (1 mM), followed by staining with SYBR Green II (Takara). The fluorescence intensities of the parasitic RNA bands were quantified, and the concentrations were determined based on the standard curve drawn with the dilution series of the standard parasitic RNA bands.</p><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bansho et al., 2016</xref>), we determined the parasitic RNA concentration from the replication kinetics using a purified QÎ² replicase, and the detection limit was lower than that of this study. This method could not be employed in this study because it was unable to distinguish the different classes of parasitic RNAs that appeared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>The RNA mixtures of rounds 13, 24, 33, 39, 43, 50, 53, 60, 65, 72, 86, 91, 94, 99, 104, 110, and 115 in the long-term replication experiment were purified with spin columns (RNeasy, QIAGEN). The purified RNAs were reverse-transcribed using PrimeScript reverse transcriptase (Takara) and primer three and then PCR-amplified using primers 3 and 4. The PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands corresponding to the host and parasitic cDNA were separately extracted using E-gel CloneWell (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The host, parasite-Î², and parasite-Î³ were sequenced using PacBio RS II with C4/P6 chemistry (Pacific Biosciences), and parasite-Î± was sequenced using MiSeq (Illumina). To reduce read errors in the PacBio RS II sequencing, we used circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads comprising at least five and ten reads for the host and parasites, respectively, to eliminate sequence errors. The read numbers in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> indicates those of CCS. All the sequence reads were subjected to sequence alignment with a reference sequence (the original host sequence) for each molecular species (i.e. the host, parasite-Î±, parasite-Î², and parasite-Î³), using MAFFT v7.294b with the FFT-NS-2 algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katoh et al., 2002</xref>). The sequence data after alignment was provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>. Frequencies of mutations were calculated for each sample, and 74 dominant mutations that were present in more than 10% of the population of each class of RNA in a sequenced round were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). These mutations were located in 72 sites (i.e. a few mutations were introduced in the same sites). In the subsequent analysis, we focused on only the genotypes associated with these 72 mutation sites. Focusing only on these dominant mutation sites minimizes the influence of remaining sequencing errors and non-dominant mutations in the other sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mapping dominant genotypes in two-dimensional space</title><p>Among the genotypes associated with the 72 mutation sites, the top 90 most dominant genotypes were identified for each host and parasitic species in each round.

This exciting paper uses the simplest possible system to investigate the emergence of a parasite and subsequent co-evolution with the host: A self-replicating RNA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: EÃ¶rs SzathmÃ¡ry (Reviewer #1); Paulien Hogeweg (Reviewer #2); Erik Hom (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an exciting and very relevant study about molecular in vitro co-evolution of host and parasite RNA species. The generated data are interesting and provide a nice avenue for understanding coevolutionary dynamics in an experimentally tractable way. Although, as such experiments tend to do, they stop at the moment that tantalizing new dynamics starts, the authors clearly demonstrate co-evolution of the RNA coding for the replicase-Î² subunit (called host) and the immediately arising parasites (lacking this) in a few competition experiments. This work (and indeed, the elegance of this particular system) sets the stage for obtaining mechanistic insights into how mutations lead to compensatory fitness increases in host and parasite along Red Queen trajectories.</p><p>The agreement was that additional data analysis would enhance the work. Specific suggestions are for a deeper analysis of lineage tracking and diversification emergence (as suggested by the title), analysis of potential recombination events, clarifications of methods, and broader contextualization of the findings with ideas in the literature about host-parasite coevolution.</p><p>There are also a couple of suggestions for additional sequencing data, but we recognize that it might currently be difficult to obtain such data. If that is the case, please provide other explanations and/or adjust your claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The idea of an arms race in this system is attractive, but it raises questions about the role of homologous copy-choice recombination in the host RNA population. Under such conditions of directional selection (exerted by the parasites) recombination should be advantageous. Is there a signal of this process in the sequences of the host population?</p><p>2) It is confusing that different measurements of density for host (replicase) as well as the different parasites are used. Please explain.</p><p>3) The population dynamics first shows strong oscillation, which later dampen till t~75. Competition is only shown for parasite t-13 and host t=0 and parasite t=13 and host t=99 (after one more deep oscillation). What happens in between? How can the replicase sustain such high densities of host and parasite RNA, while that is initially not the case?</p><p>4) Is the Î±-parasite after t=90 offspring of the older Î± parasite or a newly evolved from the host by a large deletion?</p><p>5) The Î² and Î³ parasites are clearly offspring of the later hosts, each of one of the evolved 'subspecies' of the host. The Î² parasites appear to strongly diminish the ancestor subspecies, but not the other host subspecies. If possible, it would be good to further elucidate that by sequencing the competition experiments; also with respect to the Î³ parasite. If additional sequencing experiments are not possible, can you provide other explanations?</p><p>6) While more clarity in these processes could be obtained by more competition experiments between Î± parasites and hosts at different timepoints, but better representation of the data should help.</p><p>7) The evolutionary arms race experiments of Figure 3 are a nice demonstration that there are &quot;alternating&quot; fitness improvements in subsequent host/parasites when challenged with a prior parasite/host partner. However, in light of the complete sequencing record outlined in Figure 2, one would want to know and see more specifically how distinct parasite/host lineages arose over the course of the coevolution experiment, especially since this seems to be a beautiful advantage of this RNA ecosystem. For example, can one draw a lineage map for parasite lineages over time based on the specific rounds that the authors focused on for RNA sequencing (13, 24, 33, 39,.â¦99, 104, 110)? It would seem that clusters with common mutations could be derived at each of these snapshots. We would like to see phylogenetic analyses of sequences as a function of time (especially at particularly key time points of population transition, e.g., between rounds 99 and 115).</p><p>You highlight 3 dominant groups of parasites, Î±, Î², and Î³, but what can you say about finer-grained lineage clustering and &quot;transitions&quot; that occur within these 3 dominant groups (e.g., parasite-Î±13 and parasite-Î±24 seem to be different transitional forms (Figure 2A)-what exactly distinguishes these sub-strains at the genetic level? Instead of the mutation index tables in Supplementary Figure 4 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 43, please report how strains are delineated by sets of mutations (instead of focusing on summarizing each individual mutation and which strains had them). The Hamming distance metric/analysis by itself is not very satisfying for displaying/characterizing strain clusters or distinguishing genotype centroids in Figure 2; including time/round information may help resolve lineages.</p><p>8) What specific reciprocal mutational changes in host and parasite occur over the course of the evolution experiment? Figure 3 demonstrates clear fitness benefit changes of host and parasite, but it would be good to highlight the underlying adaptive genetic changes responsible for the evolutionary arms race. This could provide fertile ground for follow-on mechanistic studies for how host or parasite fitness improves in response to the other.</p><p>9) You suggest, as alluded to in the title, that coevolution drives diversification (Discussion, first paragraph), but it was not clear what you mean by this. There was little discussion of strain or mutational diversity: what do the authors precisely mean by &quot;diversity&quot; as it relates to the results of the present study. I imagine one would need at least one (if not several) metrics of diversity, and apply it either to the diversity of lineages in the population and/or the distribution/spectra of mutations that are accrued in host or parasite (or ecosystem) as a function of time. The emergence of diversity/diversification is suggested in the title, but this theme does not seem to be adequately addressed in the discussion of results. In the third paragraph of the Discussion, it is pointed out that antagonistic host-parasite coevolution could increase the complexity of individuals, but this idea also does not seem to be addressed in this study. The results from this work seem to recapitulate a well-known and accepted idea that parasites undergo genome reduction, but I feel the authors need to discuss more of the implications of their findings in relation to the literature on gene loss/genome reduction (e.g., Wolf and Koonin, 2013 and Albalat and CaÃ±estro, 2016. What new insight(s) on this topic is revealed by the authors' new results? I found it intriguing that after drastic genome reduction early on, late parasite lineages had genome expansion, which goes counter to a naÃ¯ve view that the genomes of parasites &quot;just get smaller&quot;-perhaps the authors' results tell us something deeper about the conditions for genome reduction in parasites?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Emergence and diversification of a host-parasite RNA ecosystem through Darwinian evolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I would like, however, to ask you to accommodate the suggestions by reviewer #2, and consider more fully meeting the specific concern of reviewer #3, who said that while Figure 2âfigure supplement 5 is appreciated, this analysis does not quite reveal how the different parasite lineages arise or are related to one another in time. Please consider adding a joint temporal-sequence correlation analysis beyond a single phylogenetic tree of lineages (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper has been duly revised and it will be a valuable contribution to the field of experimental molecular coevolution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I like to congratulate the authors on their improved manuscript, which is a really nice and valuable addition to our knowledge on RNA evolution.</p><p>I just have 2 suggestions:</p><p>1) Rooting of phylogenetic tree. In this case a &quot;real&quot; root is known: the initial host sequence. I would suggest to reroot the tree accordingly (and indeed add the initial host)</p><p>2) In the discussion about complexity generation (Discussion) the wording suggest that the parasite evolved more complexity by adding, whereas, as is now very clear from the rest of the manuscript is arose as close mutant of the current dominant host, by deletion, but retaining mor of the host genome. Please make that clear also in this discussion, also emphasizing its co-occurence with the Î± parasite lineage.</p><p>Finally, I missed what the mutation index means in the mutation table, which, by the way is very nicely improved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is much improved. I am satisfied with most of the responses and the changes that the authors' made in addressing the reviewer comments. I feel the key points of novelty and insight for the current work are much better presented, including incorporating nuances raised in responses to Essential revision comments #5 and #9, making this an exciting contribution.</p><p>The response to Essential revision comment #7, however, remains somewhat wanting in my opinion. The authors did improve their argument for &quot;reciprocal host-parasite mutational dynamics underlying armed-race history&quot; through refinements in text and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, and the inclusion of the phylogenetic tree for top 3 host and parasite lineages in Figure 2âfigure supplement 5. However, it still feels like there is a missed opportunity to really describe the co-evolutionary dynamics of this system in (1) time, and (2) that the takes into account the specific sequence relationships between the different host and parasite quasi-species. The uniqueness of this RNA system and the described study is that (nearly) all the lineages of host and parasite have been sequenced over the course of coevolution. Thus, it would seem like a lineage map (in time) could be constructed (even if there were only snapshots of specific rounds from the experiment); but it doesn't seem like the sequence data time series is being mined for the fullest insights. While Figure 2âfigure supplement 5 is an improvement in showing the phylogenetic relatedness of parasite vs. host lineages, this analysis doesn't really reveal how the different parasite lineages arise or are related to one another in time (E.g., how does parasite-Î² or parasite-Î³ actually arise in response to the sequences (both host and parasite) that exist leading up to their emergence in the population (e.g., in round 104)?) Although I've not spent enough time thinking about how best to do such an analysis, I imagine it might involve some joint temporal-sequence correlation analysis beyond a single phylogenetic tree of lineages (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5). The color-coding of Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 is definitely an improvement from the previous version of the manuscript and does capture some of this temporal-sequence information-but I still find the figure hard to parse towards understanding how mutations in different parasite size classes (Î±/Î²/Î³) relate to one another and hosts over the course of coevolution. The second paragraph of the Discussion does a good job explaining an example of apparent reciprocal sequence changes between parasite-Î± and host, but one cannot distil this from the main figures (Figure 2A shows oscillations in concentration, but this is unrelated to reciprocal mutation changes) and it is quite cumbersome to distil this from Figure 2âfigure supplement 2. Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 is a sensible mapping of mutations to gene body sequence position but this is only one view of the data: e.g., grouping this data according to parasite class (Î±/Î²/Î³) (or even similarity of persistence profile over time) might be alternatively illuminating to get at or synthesize what I feel is missing in the analysis presented (as mentioned above). The Hamming distance plots as a function of time in Figure 2âfigure supplement 4 get at this, but might be better presented as an animation rather than a frame series; it also only focuses on a subset of host and parasite-Î± sequences. I recommend the authors work to reduce salient points from Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 into an additional main figure that highlights the reciprocal sequence changes that occur and supports the claims of reciprocal coevolution broadly, not focused merely on parasite-Î± but showing the relevant coevolutionary dynamic of all parasite size classes.</p><p>The other main suggested edit is to include a discussion in the Sequence Analysis section in either the Materials and methods or Results for how sequence errors were handled in relation to singleton reads. In the Supplementary file 1 (which is very helpful), many reads are listed with a genotype frequency of 1. In the Materials and methods section (subsection âSequence analysisâ), it is stated that circular consensus sequencing for at least 5-10 reads was performed. It is not clear how these two things relate, nor how the singleton sequences of Supplementary file 1 were incorporated into the main analyses described: were singletons included in all analyses? If so, should one really include them? What thresholds were applied to reject sequences that might be erroneous? Clarification of these points in the manuscript would be very helpful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56038.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The idea of an arms race in this system is attractive, but it raises questions about the role of homologous copy-choice recombination in the host RNA population.

We examined this possibility by using a recombination detection program RDP4 (Martin et al., 2015). We extracted top-50 most frequent host and also parasite sequences for every sequenced round from the aligned cDNA data set (we provide this data upon the request from reviewer #2) and exerted exploratory recombination scan with all the available algorithms, but unfortunately, no recombination signal was detected. In fact, as we report in Figure 3âsource data 1, two diverged host lineages (Host-99 and Host-115) share only a few dominant mutations that accumulated before the divergence and then underwent very distinct evolutionary pathways without any âjumping inâ of shared mutations into each other. Therefore, while further long-term evolution might lead to beneficial recombination events in the future, we have no clear evidence that it has happened so far. We briefly mention that we did not detect a signal of recombination in the second paragraph of Discussion as follows.</p><p>âFinally, we would like to mention that we searched for possible recombination events in the host and parasite sequences throughout the replication experiment, using the RDP4 program (Martin et al., 2015), but did not detect a recombination signal.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is confusing that different measurements of density for host (replicase) as well as the different parasites are used. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for this confusion. In Figure 2A, we measured the host and parasitic RNAs by different methods, quantitative PCR after reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) and by quantification of band intensity after gel electrophoresis, respectively. That is because RT-qPCR was not applicable to the parasitic RNA population, the mixture of deletion mutants sharing the highly similar sequences as those of host RNAs. Therefore, we could not design a primer set for RT-qPCR that specifically detects the parasitic RNAs that appeared during evolution. In Figure 3A, on the other hand, we knew the specific sequence of parasite RNA âclonesâ, thus we were able to design primers including unique mutations that are not shared among different RNA species. To clarify this point, we changed manuscripts in Results section as following:</p><p>In the subsection âPopulation dynamics of host and parasitic RNAsâ</p><p>âThe parasitic RNA was measured using the band intensity after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1) because these parasites were deletion mutants of the host RNA and could not be uniquely targeted by RT-qPCR. In some rounds (7-12, 16-22, and 75-84), the parasitic RNAs were under the detection limit (less than ~30 nM) and not visible due to the lower sensitivity of gel analysis compared to that of RT-qPCR.â</p><p>In the subsection âCompetitive replication assay of host and parasitic RNAsâ</p><p>âRT-qPCR of parasites was possible in this experiment because we designed primers very specific to each parasite clone, which was not possible for the evolving RNA mixture (Figure 2A) containing various mutations.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The population dynamics first shows strong oscillation, which later dampen till t~75. Competition is only shown for parasite t-13 and host t=0 and parasite t=13 and host t=99 (after one more deep oscillation). What happens in between? How can the replicase sustain such high densities of host and parasite RNA, while that is initially not the case?</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial stage (t = 0 â 25), the host RNA was not able to replicate in the same compartment with the parasite-Î± and thus a clear oscillation pattern appeared, as reported in our previous study (Bansho et al., 2016). In the paper, we also showed that the host RNA at t=43 acquired partial resistance against parasite-Î±, which probably allowed the co-replication of hosts and parasites at higher concentrations exhibiting clear contrast to the initial clear oscillation. We clarified this point by adding the following statements in the Results section (in the subsection âPopulation dynamics of host and parasitic RNAsâ).</p><p>âThe elevation of the host RNA concentration can be attributed to less replication inhibition by parasite-Î±. [â¦] The prevalence of these mutations probably allows the host RNA population to maintain higher concentrations than that in the early stage.â</p><p>We further discussed population dynamics between t=13~99 in the new second paragraph in the Discussion section (see also Essential revision comment #6).</p><p>âHigh-resolution sequence tracking of RNA populations allowed the observation of reciprocal host-parasite mutational dynamics underlying evolutionary arms-race history. [â¦] Upon the invasion of parasite-Î³ in round 115, some mutations (e.g., C72U, C259U, U501C, and A851G) appeared and disappeared in the host population. These host-parasite mutational dynamics exhibit how coevolution had progressed during the replication experiment.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is the Î±-parasite after t=90 offspring of the older Î± parasite or a newly evolved from the host by a large deletion?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the sequence similarity, the parasite-Î± after t=90 is the mixture of offsprings of the older ones at t=13 and deletion mutants of the evolved hosts in later rounds. We added the explanation of this point in the Results section (in the subsection âSequence analysisâ):</p><p>âWe also observed the appearance of new parasite-Î± species from the evolved host RNAs owing to deletion.

If additional sequencing experiments are not possible, can you provide other explanations?</p></disp-quote><p>If our understanding is correct, the reviewer is asking whether parasite-Î² or -Î³ specifically diminish each ancestor host RNA, Host-99 or Host-115, respectively. That is an interesting question and such specificity would be reasonable if each of the parasites appeared from each of the host RNA through adaptive evolution. To answer this question, competition experiments all four combinations of Hosts-99 and -115 with parasite-Î² and -Î³. Since three of the experiments (Host-99 vs. parasite-Î²99, Host-115 vs. parasite-Î²99, and Host-115 vs. parasite-Î³115) has been already performed (Figure 3), we newly conducted the remaining competition experiment (Host-99 vs. Parasite-Î³115) and confirmed that Parasite-Î³115 is hardly replicated by Host-99 (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). This result indicates that the parasite-Î² and -Î³ selectively âinfectâ each of their ancestors, Host-99 and Host-115, respectively. We added the explanation of this result in the Results section as follows.</p><p>âWe also examined the Host-99 vs. Parasite-Î³115 relationship and found that Parasite-Î³115 was hardly replicated by Host-99 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1), indicating that parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³ are specifically parasitic to Host-99 and Host-115, respectively.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) While more clarity in these processes could be obtained by more competition experiments between Î± parasites and hosts at different timepoints, but better representation of the data should help.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for the useful suggestion. We agreed that the evolution of parasite-Î± is another interesting theme, and thus we would like to address it in the next study. Instead of the additional experiments, we added a new paragraph in the Discussion section as shown in the response to Essential revision comment #3 above to describe host-parasite evolutionary processes in detail, including the arms race between the host and the parasite-Î± (indicated with underlines).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The evolutionary arms race experiments of Figure 3 are a nice demonstration that there are &quot;alternating&quot; fitness improvements in subsequent host/parasites when challenged with a prior parasite/host partner. However, in light of the complete sequencing record outlined in Figure 2, one would want to know and see more specifically how distinct parasite/host lineages arose over the course of the coevolution experiment, especially since this seems to be a beautiful advantage of this RNA ecosystem. For example, can one draw a lineage map for parasite lineages over time based on the specific rounds that the authors focused on for RNA sequencing (13, 24, 33, 39,.â¦99, 104, 110)? It would seem that clusters with common mutations could be derived at each of these snapshots. We would like to see phylogenetic analyses of sequences as a function of time (especially at particularly key time points of population transition, e.g., between rounds 99 and 115).</p><p>You highlight 3 dominant groups of parasites, Î±, Î², and Î³, but what can you say about finer-grained lineage clustering and &quot;transitions&quot; that occur within these 3 dominant groups (e.g., parasite-Î±13 and parasite-Î±24 seem to be different transitional forms (Figure 2A)-what exactly distinguishes these sub-strains at the genetic level? Instead of the mutation index tables in Supplementary Figure 4 and Figure 3, please report how strains are delineated by sets of mutations (instead of focusing on summarizing each individual mutation and which strains had them). The Hamming distance metric/analysis by itself is not very satisfying for displaying/characterizing strain clusters or distinguishing genotype centroids in Figure 2; including time/round information may help resolve lineages.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon this comment, we newly added phylogenic analysis of the top 3 most frequent of host and parasite sequences in all the sequenced rounds (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5). The explanation of this analysis is included in the Results section in the revised manuscript as follows.</p><p>âTo understand the relationship between the host and parasite lineages, we performed phylogenic analysis of the top 3 most frequent genotypes of the host and parasite RNAs in all the sequenced rounds (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5). [â¦] It is also notable that some parasite-Î± genotypes are located within host clusters (Î 072R Rank2, Î 094R Rank2, and Î 099 Rank1 in Figure 2âfigure supplement 5 with green ticks), indicating that they emerged from the evolved hosts in later rounds.â</p><p>We also improved Figure 2âfigure supplement 3 with heatmaps of mutation fixation dynamics for all the RNA species to easily grasp transitions of major sequences and existing mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) What specific reciprocal mutational changes in host and parasite occur over the course of the evolution experiment? Figure 3 demonstrates clear fitness benefit changes of host and parasite, but it would be good to highlight the underlying adaptive genetic changes responsible for the evolutionary arms race. This could provide fertile ground for follow-on mechanistic studies for how host or parasite fitness improves in response to the other.</p></disp-quote><p>We detailed how host-parasite coevolution has progressed with reciprocal mutational changes in a newly added paragraph in Discussion (please see response to Essential revisions comment #3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) You suggest, as alluded to in the title, that coevolution drives diversification (Discussion, first paragraph), but it was not clear what you mean by this. There was little discussion of strain or mutational diversity: what do the authors precisely mean by &quot;diversity&quot; as it relates to the results of the present study. I imagine one would need at least one (if not several) metrics of diversity, and apply it either to the diversity of lineages in the population and/or the distribution/spectra of mutations that are accrued in host or parasite (or ecosystem) as a function of time. The emergence of diversity/diversification is suggested in the title, but this theme does not seem to be adequately addressed in the discussion of results.</p></disp-quote><p>As you and reviewer #3 point out, we agree that we should more clearly state what is diversity in the Discussion section. By the word âdiversityâ, we mean that there are two or three distinct lineages (or branches) in both host and parasite RNAs. To clarify this point, we changed a sentence in the Abstract and also largely modified the first paragraph of the Discussion section as shown below.</p><p>Abstract</p><p>âIn prebiotic evolution, molecular self-replicators are considered to develop into diverse, complex living organisms. [â¦] These results provide the first experimental evidence that the coevolutionary interplay between host-parasite molecules plays a key role in generating diversity and complexity in prebiotic molecular evolution.â</p><p>Discussion section</p><p>âCoevolution of host and parasitic replicators is a major driver in the evolution of life. In this study, we investigated the Darwinian evolution process of an RNA replication system and demonstrated the emergence of a host-parasite ecosystem in which new types of host and parasitic RNAs appeared successively and exhibited antagonistic coevolutionary dynamics. [â¦] Therefore, evolutionary arms races between host-parasite molecules may have been an important mechanism to generate and maintain diversity in molecular ecosystems before the origin of life.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the third paragraph of the Discussion, it is pointed out that antagonistic host-parasite coevolution could increase the complexity of individuals, but this idea also does not seem to be addressed in this study. The results from this work seem to recapitulate a well-known and accepted idea that parasites undergo genome reduction, but I feel the authors need to discuss more of the implications of their findings in relation to the literature on gene loss/genome reduction (e.g., Wolf and Koonin, 2013 and Albalat and CaÃ±estro, 2016. What new insight(s) on this topic is revealed by the authors' new results? I found it intriguing that after drastic genome reduction early on, late parasite lineages had genome expansion, which goes counter to a naÃ¯ve view that the genomes of parasites &quot;just get smaller&quot; â perhaps the authors' results tell us something deeper about the conditions for genome reduction in parasites?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important suggestion. Regarding the complexity of individuals, as the reviewer pointed out, our message was that late parasites (-Î² and -Î³) had expanded genome compared to the early parasite (-Î±), which may have been caused by coevolution. This genome expansion of parasites has never been observed at least in QÎ² RNA-based molecular evolution studies (there are not many other artificial replication systems available yet) and also seems to be against the trend of reductive evolution observed in nature (Wolf and Koonin, 2013, Morris, Lenski and Zinser, 2012). To clarify the implication of our results in a reductive evolution context, we largely modified the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section as follows.</p><p>âIt is generally believed that evolution progresses toward more complexity in nature (Petrov, 2001; Sharov, 2006); however, genome reduction is also a popular mode of evolution (Albalat and CaÃ±estro, 2016; Morris et al., 2012; Wolf and Koonin, 2013). [â¦] The next important question would be whether further long-term coevolution can lead to genome expansion of the host RNA.â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will see, the reviewers greatly appreciated your efforts to revise the work, and based on their advice, I am happy in principle to accept the submission for publication. I would like, however, to ask you to accommodate the suggestions by reviewer #2, and consider more fully meeting the specific concern of reviewer #3, who said that while Figure 2âfigure supplement 5 is appreciated, this analysis does not quite reveal how the different parasite lineages arise or are related to one another in time. Please consider adding a joint temporal-sequence correlation analysis beyond a single phylogenetic tree of lineages (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their effort to read and comments on our manuscript, which improved our manuscript significantly. In accordance with the reviewersâ advice, we have changed some figures and revised our manuscript. We believe that the reviewersâ comments have now been addressed in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I like to congratulate the authors on their improved manuscript, which is a really nice and valuable addition to our knowledge on RNA evolution.</p><p>I just have 2 suggestions:</p><p>1) Rooting of phylogenetic tree. In this case a &quot;real&quot; root is known: the initial host sequence. I would suggest to reroot the tree accordingly (and indeed add the initial host)</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we added the initial host (Ancester host, indicated with the blue asterisk) in the phylogenic three (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the discussion about complexity generation (Discussion) the wording suggest that the parasite evolved more complexity by adding, whereas, as is now very clear from the rest of the manuscript is arose as close mutant of the current dominant host, by deletion, but retaining mor of the host genome. Please make that clear also in this discussion, also emphasizing its co-occurence with the Î± parasite lineage.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that the previous description was misleading. We rewrote the corresponding part as follows to clarify that the new parasites appeared from the evolved host through deletion.</p><p>âThe new parasites, parasite-Î² and parasite-Î³, became longer because they retained a part of the M-site sequence, a recognition site for QÎ² replicase (Meyer et al., 1981; Schuppli et al., 1998), which did not exist in parasite-Î±. [â¦] According to this scenario, the new parasites appear to be expanding the genomic information to cope with the evolved strategy of the host RNA, which may be consistent with recent theoretical studies that suggest that host-parasite antagonistic coevolution is an effective mechanism to increase the complexity of individuals (Seoane and SolÃ©, 2019; Zaman et al., 2014).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript is much improved. I am satisfied with most of the responses and the changes that the authors' made in addressing the reviewer comments. I feel the key points of novelty and insight for the current work are much better presented, including incorporating nuances raised in responses to Essential revision comments #5 and #9, making this an exciting contribution.</p><p>The response to Essential revision comment #7, however, remains somewhat wanting in my opinion. [â¦] I recommend the authors work to reduce salient points from Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 into an additional main figure that highlights the reciprocal sequence changes that occur and supports the claims of reciprocal coevolution broadly, not focused merely on parasite-Î± but showing the relevant coevolutionary dynamic of all parasite size classes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that the reciprocal evolutionary progress of the host and the parasites was difficult to grasp from our previous figures. According to the reviewerâs recommendation, we refined Figure 2âfigure supplement 4 (Round-by-round 2D mapping of top genotypes) to include parasites-Î² and -Î³ and moved to a main figure (new Figure 3). We also included an animation of the same data (new Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). We hope that these figures help readers to grasp the co-evolutionary dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other main suggested edit is to include a discussion in the Sequence Analysis section in either the Materials and methods or Results for how sequence errors were handled in relation to singleton reads. In the Supplementary file 1 (which is very helpful), many reads are listed with a genotype frequency of 1. In the Materials and methods section (subsection âSequence analysisâ), it is stated that circular consensus sequencing for at least 5-10 reads was performed. It is not clear how these two things relate, nor how the singleton sequences of Supplementary file 1 were incorporated into the main analyses described: were singletons included in all analyses? If so, should one really include them? What thresholds were applied to reject sequences that might be erroneous? Clarification of these points in the manuscript would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, all sequences were read more than 5 times to minimize the effect of sequence error and the resultant circular consensus sequences (CCS) were used for analyses. The read number in the Supplementary file 1 is those of the CCS that are obtained from at least 5-10 reads. This point was not clearly written in the previous manuscript. Then, we rewrote the corresponding parts and added a short explanation about the method to minimize sequencing errors in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>âSequence analysis</p><p>The RNA mixtures of rounds 13, 24, 33, 39, 43, 50, 53, 60, 65, 72, 86, 91, 94, 99, 104, 110, and 115 in the long-term replication experiment were purified with spin columns (RNeasy, QIAGEN). [â¦] In the subsequent analysis, we focused on only the genotypes associated with these 72 mutation sites. Focusing only on these dominant mutation sites minimizes the influence of remaining sequencing errors and non-dominant mutations in the other sites.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
