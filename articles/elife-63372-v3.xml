There are extensive anatomical connections between the various parts of the MFC and OFC in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabbott et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barreiros et al., 2020</xref>), and the regions are part of the medial frontal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Öngür and Price, 2000</xref>). The MFC and OFC are thought to have specific roles in the control of behavior and specific homologies with medial and orbital regions of the primate frontal cortex (MFC: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Laubach et al., 2018</xref>; OFC: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Izquierdo, 2017</xref>). The extensive interconnections between MFC and OFC suggest that the two regions work together to control value-guided decisions. Unfortunately, few, if any, studies have examined concurrent neural processing in these regions of the rodent brain as animals perform behavioral tasks that depend on the two cortical regions.</p><p>In standard laboratory tasks, the action selection and outcome evaluation phases of value-guided decisions are commonly conceived as separate processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>). MFC and OFC may contribute independently to these processes or interact concurrently across them. Though there is some variation across published studies, most argue for MFC having a role in action-outcome processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Brown, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2015</xref>) and OFC having a role in stimulus-outcome (stimulus-reward) processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallagher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoenbaum and Roesch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Simon et al., 2015</xref>). The present study directly compared neural activity in the MFC and OFC of rats as they performed a simple consummatory task, called the shifting values licking task, or SVLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parent et al., 2015a</xref>). Importantly, the task depends on the ability of animals to guide their consummatory behavior based on the value of available rewards, and performance of these kinds of tasks depends on both the MFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parent et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parent et al., 2015b</xref>) and OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kesner and Gilbert, 2007</xref>). The goal of the study was to use the SVLT to determine if the MFC and OFC have distinct roles in processing reward information, for example, varying with action (licking) in MFC and the sensory properties of the rewards in OFC.</p><p>Most published studies on reward processing used operant designs with distinct actions preceding different outcomes. For example, a rat might respond in one of two choice ports to produce a highly valued reward, delivered from a separate reward port. To collect the reward, the rat has to travel across an operant chamber and then collect a food pellet or initiate licking on a spout to collect the reward. In such tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pratt and Mizumori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Duuren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Wingerden et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Riceberg and Shapiro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jarovi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siniscalchi et al., 2019</xref>), neural activity during the period of consumption might reflect the properties of the reward, how the animal consumes it, and/or the behaviors that precede reward collection (e.g. locomotion). As such, it is difficult to isolate reward specific activity using such operant designs.</p><p>Several published studies have used simpler consummatory and Pavlovian designs, and found neural activity in the MFC is selectively modulated during active consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petykó et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horst and Laubach, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petykó et al., 2015</xref>). None of these tasks used fluids with different reward values. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>, was the first study to examine if similar neural activity was associated with animals consuming different magnitudes of reward. The study used the SVLT and presented rats with rewards that differed in terms of the concentration of sucrose contained in the rewarding fluids. The study found that neural activity in the MFC is entrained to the animals’ lick cycle and the strength of entrainment varies with the value of the rewarding fluid, that is, stronger entrainment with higher value reward. The study also used reversible inactivation methods to demonstrate that licking entrainment depends on the MFC.</p><p>In the present study, we used the SVLT, and several variations on the basic task design, to study consumption-related activity in MFC and OFC. Spectral analyses were used to account for the extent to which neural activity in each area was entrained to licking and if there was evidence for directionality of lick entrainment among sites in the MFC and OFC. A custom-designed syringe pump was used to deliver different volumes of fluid over a common time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amarante et al., 2019</xref>). This device allowed us to directly compare neural activity associated with differences in sucrose concentration and fluid volume. We further manipulated the predictability of changes in reward magnitude to assess how predictable and unpredictable rewards are processed and used a third, intermediate level of reward to assess if reward magnitudes are encoded in a relative or absolute manner. Our findings suggest that both areas encode the value of consumed fluids and that the MFC may have a top-down role in coordinating reward processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SVLT: effects of reward magnitude on consummatory behavior</title><p>The SVLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) was used to assess reward encoding across the MFC and OFC as 12 rats experienced shifts in reward value defined by differences in sucrose concentration or fluid volume.

Notably, the magnitude of the coherence was no more than 0.2, suggesting a potential weak influence of MFC on the timing of fluctuations in OFC. The magnitude of the coherences was variable over electrodes, and plots of the measures onto the anatomical arrangement of the recording arrays revealed a gradient of directed coherence, with most rostral sites in MFC having larger coherence values compared to caudal sites (an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the role of spatial location on directed coherence, we denoted the locations of the recordings along the arrays as rostral or caudal (i.e. for each linear array with eight electrodes, the four most rostral electrodes were denoted as rostral and the rest as caudal). An example of directed coherence over frequencies up to 30 Hz for the rostral and caudal sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>. Directed coherence was larger for the direction MFC → OFC for most rostral electrode in the MFC and both the rostral and caudal electrodes in the OFC. The caudal electrode in the MFC had larger directed coherence for the direction MFC → OFC for the caudal, but not the rostral, electrode in OFC. A group summary of these findings, at the licking frequency, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>. Here, the locations of the electrodes was further split as medial and lateral, and differences in directed coherence were apparent for rostral and caudal sites in the MFC and medial sites in the OFC (right half of the plot). Directed coherence was equivocal for rostral and caudal sites in the MFC and lateral sites in the OFC (left half of the plot). Based on anatomical mapping of the arrays, the medial and lateral sites in the OFC were associated with the deep and superficial layers of the cortex, respectively. These findings suggest cross-laminar differences in the timing of the LFP fluctuations, with the rostral part of the MFC ‘driving’ fluctuations in the deep layers of the OFC, and possibly serving as feedback from the MFC to the OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabbott et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SVLT: lick entrainment in MFC and OFC tracks reward magnitude</title><p>We next aimed to determine if there were electrophysiological differences in MFC and OFC during access to the different types of rewards. Lick-field coherence (using methods originally developed for spike-field coherence in the Neurospec library for MATLAB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halliday et al., 1995</xref>). LFPs from both areas were coherent with licks at the licking frequency, and not at higher harmonic frequencies of licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Coherence levels were higher for licks that delivered high-value fluid (concentration and volume) compared to low-value fluid in MFC (paired t-test; concentration: t(95)=39.972, p &lt; 0.001; volume: t(95)=11.643, p &lt; 0.001) and OFC (paired t-test: concentration: t(91)=17.386, p &lt; 0.001; volume: t(91)=18.970, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a, b</xref>).

Lick rate was also re-analyzed including block 3 high-value licks, but lick rate for low-value (4%) licks could not be analyzed due to a low number of licks not passing criteria. Lick rate for block 3 high-value licks were not significantly different from block 2 high-value licks (p = 0.99), nor from block 2 intermediate licks (p = 0.83). Statistics for MFC: block 3 high-value inter-trial coherences (ITCs) (95% CI: 0.716, 0.757) were not significantly different from block 2 high-value ITCs (p = 0.113) (95% CI: 0.671, 0.715). Block 3 high-value ITCs were significantly increased from both intermediate (8%) value ITCs in block 1 (95% CI: 0.619, 0.672) and block 2 (95% CI: 0.610, 0.658) (p &lt; 0.001 for both). These findings support the hypothesis of MFC possibly encoding reward value in an absolute manner. Statistics for OFC: block 3 high-value ITCs (95% CI: 0.540, 0.611) were not significantly different from block 2 high-value ITCs (p = 0.789) (95% CI: 0.497, 0.580). Block 3 high-value ITCs were significantly increased from block 2 intermediate-value ITCs (p = 0.025) (95% CI for intermediate block 2: 0.450, 0.535), but block 3 high-value ITCs were not significantly different from block 1 intermediate ITCs (block 1 intermediate 95% CI: 0.505, 0.584). The other comparisons (block 2 intermediate versus block 2 high value) were not significant (p = 0.339).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63372-fig10-figsupp2-v3.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>The encoding of value was less clear based on ITC measures from the OFC.

Instead, the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref> indicate that OFC might instead encode reward value in a mixed absolute/relative manner (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, these findings should be interpreted in the light of uneven sampling between areas, with fewer recordings done in the OFC. It is therefore possible that our results are underpowered for the OFC and new experiments could reveal an alternative interpretation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated the role of MFC and OFC in processing reward information as rats participated in various consummatory licking tasks. Rats process and express changes in reward size in roughly the same manner as with reward concentration, both behaviorally and electrophysiologically. LFP activity in both MFC and OFC is sensitive to changes in reward type (both volume and concentration). Our results reveal context-dependent value signals in both regions through randomly presented rewards and by introducing a third reward in the task. Behaviorally, rats show evidence for a relative expression of rewards, while neural activity in MFC and OFC did not reflect relative encoding of reward. Together, our findings suggest that rats sample rewards and commit to consuming a given reward when they are able to predict its value, and this behavior is coupled to neural activity in MFC and OFC that encode both the value of the reward and the animal’s consummatory strategy. The subtle differences between the two regions follow the hypothesis that these areas provide different roles during consummatory behavior. We additionally provide evidence for MFC representing action-outcome relationships, as MFC ITC activity is more strongly correlated to the action of licking and may signal information about the ‘value of the action’.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Rhythmic activity and reward processing</title><p>Similar to our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horst and Laubach, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>), neural activity was entrained to the lick cycle across all tasks in both MFC and OFC. Entrainment was strongest for the high-value reward (either of size or sweetness) and varied with the animals consummatory strategy (persistently lick a highly preferred option or sample fluid and wait for better option). Previous studies have viewed this rhythmic activity as being driven by the act of licking, as rats naturally lick at 6–7 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Travers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weijnen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horst and Laubach, 2013</xref>). However, the activity cannot be explained solely by licking, as there are instances where phase locking and behavior do not show the same pattern (e.g. the blocked-interleaved experiment), and the variety of studies reported here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>, suggest a higher order role for rhythmic activity in the control of consummatory behavior.</p><p>Indeed, a major question for our study might be the extent to which lick-entrained oscillations in MFC and OFC can be dissociated from the act of licking. We adapted methods for spike-field coherence to examine this question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that the coherence between licks and rhythmic LFP signals in the licking frequency range was no larger than 0.5 (with lick-field coherence ranging between 0 and 1), was stronger for the MFC recordings compared to the OFC recordings, and varied with the reward value of the consumed fluid. These findings suggest that the LFP oscillations are not simply driven by licking.</p><p>Furthermore, using directed coherence to examine directional influences of recordings in the two cortical areas, we found evidence for a weak directionality at the licking frequency such that the phase of the signals in MFC lead those in OFC. This result was especially apparent for the most rostral recording sites in the MFC, located in the medial orbital area and the adjacent frontal agranular area. Notably, these recording sites are immediately adjacent to a region of the frontal cortex where oral movements can be generated by electrical stimulation at low current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>). As such, the field recordings in the rostral part of the MFC might reflect activity from the adjacent oral motor cortex or could be locally generated. Resolving this matter will require new experiments, likely using optogenetic stimulation to avoid stimulation of fibers of passage.</p><p>We propose a functional interpretation of these signals based on findings on ‘medial frontal theta’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavanagh and Frank, 2014</xref>) in other types of behavioral tasks. There have been several proposals for the role of frontal theta in information processing. One idea is that the rhythm acts to break up sensory information into temporal chunks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>), and is related to the notion of a global oscillatory signal to synchronize neural activity across multiple brain structures throughout the taste-reward circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutierrez and Simon, 2013</xref>). Another idea is that frontal theta acts as an action monitoring signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavanagh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narayanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laubach et al., 2015</xref>), which can be generated through simple recurrent spiking network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bekolay et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, instead representing a specific function, frontal theta may act as a convenient ‘language’ for distant brain regions to exchange information with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Womelsdorf et al., 2010</xref>). Our general findings contribute to this literature by suggesting that frontal theta acts as a value signal to guide consummatory behavior, which is the ultimate consequence of many goal-directed actions in natural environments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A common code for reward magnitude</title><p>A major finding in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) was the similar electrophysiological signals in MFC and OFC are associated with the consumption of high and low concentration liquid sucrose rewards and large and small volume rewards. Although other studies have found either decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2001</xref>) or increases in behavior with increases in concentration and volume rewards in the same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hulse et al., 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collier and Myers, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collier and Willis, 1961</xref>), these studies did not investigate the electrophysiological correlates of consuming rewards. Our study is the first to show a generalized ‘value signal’ in the frontal cortex that scales with increased size and increased concentration of liquid sucrose. These signals might underlie the computation of a common currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Montague and Berns, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levy and Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Strait et al., 2014</xref>) for the amount of nutrient available in a given food item and contribute to value-guided control of consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evidence for the contextual control of consumption</title><p>In the blocked-interleaved task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), rats who licked more, longer, and faster for the high concentration reward when rewards were blocked did not continue to do so during interleaved portion of the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Instead, they licked nearly equally for the high and low concentration solutions, a result that is suggestive of the loss of positive contrast effects for the higher value fluid that is commonly found in the blocked design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parent et al., 2015a</xref>). Despite these differences in behavior, the rats’ LFPs in MFC and OFC showed high levels of lick-entrained activity, essentially equal to that found during consumption of the higher value fluid in the blocked part of the session.</p><p>This finding is hard to reconcile with enhanced lick entrainment reflecting reward contrast effects. If positive contrast engenders entrainment, then LFPs should have shown reduced phase locking to the lick cycle in the interleaved portion of the task. Instead, the results might suggest that LFPs in MFC and OFC are entrained to licking when rats engage in persistent licking, as was found in the periods with high concentration access in the blocked part of the sessions and across the entire interleaved part of the session, and entrainment is reduced when rats switch to sampling the fluid during periods with low-value access in the blocked part of the session. By this view, LFP entrainment to the lick cycle could serve as a contextual marker for reward state and the behavioral strategy deployed by the rat to sample and wait or persistently consume the liquid sucrose. This contextual information would depend on knowledge of the temporal structure of the reward deliveries. That is, when reward values are blocked, the rats have learned to expect alternative access to higher and lower reward values over extended periods of time (30 s). By contrast, when reward values are interleaved, the changes in values occur rapidly and are unpredictable. The reduction in lick entrainment might therefore reflect the animal’s sampling strategy.</p><p>Contextual coding of reward value was also apparent in the three reward task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>), where lick entrainment was stronger when the higher value option was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In this case, the strength of engagement, for MFC but not OFC, tracked reward value in manner suggestive of an absolute reward encoding, with entrainment being higher for the 16% sucrose solution compared to the 8% solution when both were the ‘best’ option (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D</xref>). These electrophysiological results were notably distinct from behavioral measures such as total licking output and lick rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>), which provided evidence for relative value comparisons.</p><p>Our electrophysiological results support theories of absolute reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hull, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spence, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flaherty, 1982</xref>), as opposed to theories of relative reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crespi, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Black, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Webber et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings might also fit with the neuro-economics idea of menu invariance versus menu-dependent goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>), both of which have been supported by electrophysiological studies on OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tremblay and Schultz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Notably, in several instances we found a mismatch of behavioral output and corresponding magnitude of neural activity. This was evident in the blocked-interleaved task, where MFC and OFC ITCs did not reflect total licks emitted, as well as in the three reward task where MFC and OFC ITCs did not reflect total licks or lick rate. This is in opposition to the SVLT, where MFC and OFC activity directly matched behavioral output of licks, lick rate, and bout duration. These findings reveal the importance of recording careful behavioral output with electrophysiological recordings, and it remains an open discussion on the mechanisms behind correlative behavior versus diverging behavioral output from neural activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional interpretations of phase entrainment</title><p>The original observation that suggested phase locking of licks to MFC field potentials was reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horst and Laubach, 2013</xref>. Peri-event plots of LFPs around the times of licks revealed ERPs. The nature of ERPs has been researched extensively in the EEG literature. A leading view is that ERPs arise from a synchronization of the phase of an ongoing rhythm and/or from the superposition of inputs to the region of cortex near the electrode (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sauseng et al., 2007</xref>). Evidence for phase locking near the licking frequency can be found in Figures 1 and 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>, with some exceptions being at slightly higher frequencies, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> in that study. By contrast, LFP power is typically tonic in the range of delta (&lt;4 Hz) and the animals’ licking frequency mostly showed only minor changes in power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>Figure 1 and 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in another experiment with periodic reinforcement, we reported that phase but not power varied reinforcement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that phase, not power, has a relationship with reinforced licking behavior, and the same determinants for phase locking likely apply to the results reported here.</p><p>Our data suggest that the act of licking synchronizes the phase of ongoing rhythms in the MFC and OFC and that this synchronization occurs during periods of sustained increases in delta band power. Computational models of LFP rhythmicity suggest that information flow is controlled by the interplay between different functional rhythms, with activity at higher frequencies nested within the periods of lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kopell et al., 2010</xref>). Brain slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carracedo et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that theta-range rhythmicity may be nested within cycles of the lower frequency delta rhythm. For our studies, as shown in Figure 3 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>, the duration of elevated phase synchronization was roughly twice as long as the median inter-lick interval, and the inverse of this interval would indicate a frequency of ~3.5 Hz, that is, delta. The same mechanisms are likely to apply to the present study. A possible source for the delta rhythm is the animal’s respiratory cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lockmann and Tort, 2018</xref>), which must be regulated during periods of sustained licking when high-value fluid is available.</p><p>Our finding of zero-lag correlation across frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) further suggests that a source of common variance to MFC and OFC modulates the timing of processing, and leads to a slight advance in the phase angles of the rhythm in MFC relative to OFC (directed coherence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). The strength of this input would seem to vary between areas, being stronger in MFC compared to OFC and strongest in the rostral MFC (medial orbital cortex) overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These patterns of directional influences presumably vary with the extent of lick-field coherence and thereby with the value of the consumed fluid.</p><p>It is not clear from our studies if the reduction in entrainment when low-value rewards are available is an active or passive process. For example, it is possible that some active input to the MFC and OFC denotes the temporal context (e.g. dopamine, hippocampus), enhancing entrainment when the higher value option is available. Alternatively, signals from sensorimotor regions of the frontal cortex, which sit in between the MFC and OFC, the oral sensory and motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), might be reduced during periods with less intense licking, leading to a passive reduction in overall frontal lick entrainment. Future studies are needed to address these neural mechanisms of licking-related synchrony in the rodent frontal cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Differences in reward signaling between MFC and OFC</title><p>The electrophysiological results from the blocked-interleaved task and three reward task suggest that MFC and OFC, while showing similar results overall, may be contributing to processing reward information in different ways. It is important to note that due to a smaller sample size of OFC recordings, the less clear findings in OFC may indeed require further future experiments. However, our findings do follow previous work on subtle differences of these areas. In accord with a previous theory on proposed MFC and OFC functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balleine and Dickinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schoenbaum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sul et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Passingham and Wise, 2012</xref>), MFC activity may be acting to maintain and optimize licking behavior in an action-centric manner, as reflected in measures such as the licking rate, a measure associated with vigor and sensitive to inactivation of the same cortical area in a progressive ratio licking task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Swanson et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, OFC activity generally reflected differences in reward value, perhaps due to the different sensory properties of the fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gutierrez et al., 2006</xref>), and was not sensitive to licking rate (vigor) or task engagement (total licks).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sprague-Dawley, Long-Evans</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River, Envigo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rat (male)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Precision Syringe Pump Controller</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0240-19.2019">https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0240-19.2019</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_021493</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Med-PC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MedAssociates</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_012156</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GNU Octave</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_014398</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R Project for Statistical Computing</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_001905</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NeuroExplorer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neuroexplorer.com/">https://www.neuroexplorer.com/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_001818</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MatPlotLib</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://matplotlib.org/">https://matplotlib.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_008624</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IPython</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ipython.org/">https://ipython.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_001658</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jupyter</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://jupyter.org/">https://jupyter.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_018416</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Seaborn</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">https://seaborn.pydata.org/</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_018132</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mathworks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_001622</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EEGLab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php">https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCR_007292</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All procedures carried out in this set of experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at American University (Washington, DC).

Stereotaxic surgery was performed using standard methods. Briefly, animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% for ~2 min), and were then injected intraperitoneally with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and dexdomitor (0.25 mg/kg) to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia. The skull was exposed, and craniotomies were made above the implant locations. Microwire arrays were lowered into MFC (coordinates from bregma AP: +3.2 mm; ML: +1.0 mm; DV: –1.2 mm from the surface of the brain, at a 12-degree posterior angle; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paxinos and Watson, 2013</xref>) or into OFC (AP: +3.2 mm, ML: +4.0 mm, DV: –4.0 mm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paxinos and Watson, 2013</xref>).

Four skull screws were placed along the edges of the skull and a ground wire was secured in the intracranial space above the posterior cerebral cortex.

Craniotomies were sealed using cyanocrylate (Slo-Zap) and an accelerator (Zip Kicker), and methyl methacrylate dental cement (AM Systems) was applied and affixed to the skull via the skull screws. Animals were given a reversal agent for dexdomitor (Antisedan, 0.25 mg/mL, s.c.), and Carprofen (5 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered for postoperative analgesia.

Tygon tubing connected to the back of the drinking spout administered the fluid from a 60 cc syringe hooked up to either a PHM-100 pump (Med Associates) for standard experiments or to a customized open-source syringe pump controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amarante et al., 2019</xref>) that is programmed by a teensy microcontroller to deliver different volumes of fluid with the same delivery time from one central syringe pump. A ‘light-pipe’ lickometer (Med Associates) detected licks via an LED photobeam, and each lick triggered the pump to deliver roughly 30 μL per 0.5 s. Behavioral protocols were run though Med-PC version IV (Med Associates), and behavioral data was sent via TTL pulses from the Med-PC software to the Plexon recording system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Shifting values licking task</title><p>The operant licking task used here is similar to those previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parent et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parent et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarante et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, rats were placed in the operant chamber for 30 min, where they were solely required to lick at the drinking spout to obtain a liquid sucrose reward. Licks to the light-pipe lickometer would trigger the syringe pump to deliver liquid sucrose over 0.5 s. In other words, the first lick to the spout triggers the pump and reward is then delivered for 0.5 s, where any lick within that 0.5 s window would also be rewarded. The next lick after 0.5 s would subsequently trigger the pump to turn on again for 0.5 s. Every 30 s, the reward alternated between high (16% wt/vol) and low (4% wt/vol) concentrations of liquid sucrose, delivered in a volume of 30 μL. In volume manipulation sessions, the reward alternated between a large (27.85 μL) and small volume (9.28 μL) of 16% liquid sucrose. Rewards were delivered over a period of 0.5 s for all levels of concentration and volume using a custom-made syringe pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amarante et al., 2019</xref>). The animal’s licking behavior was constantly recorded throughout the test sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Blocked versus randomly interleaved licking task</title><p>The SVLT was altered to allow for comparison of blocked versus interleaved presentations of reward values. The first 3 min of the task consisted of the standard SVLT, with 30 s blocks of either the high or low concentration sucrose rewards delivered exclusively during the block. After 3 min, the rewards were presented in a pseudo-random order (e.g. high, high, low, high, low, low, high) for the rest of the test session. With rewards interleaved, rats were unaware of which reward would be delivered next. Behavioral and neural data were only analyzed from the first 6 min of each test session. We focused on manipulating sucrose concentration, and not fluid volume, in this task variation, as concentration differences provided the most effects of reward value on licking behavior (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Three reward licking task</title><p>The SVLT was modified, using a third intermediate concentration of sucrose (8% wt/vol) to assess if reward value influenced behavior and neuronal activity in a relative or absolute manner. In the first 3 min of each session, rats received either the intermediate (8%) or low (4%) concentration of sucrose, with the two rewards delivered over alternating 30 s periods as in the SVLT. After 3 min, the rewards switched to the high (16%) and intermediate (8%) concentrations, and alternated between those concentrations for the rest of the session. Behavioral and neural data were only analyzed from the first 6 min of each test session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were made using a Plexon Multichannel Acquisition Processor (MAP; Plexon; Dallas, TX). LFPs were sampled on all electrodes and recorded continuously throughout the behavioral testing sessions using the Plexon system via National Instruments A/D card (PCI-DIO-32HS). The sampling rate was 1 kHz. The head-stage filters (Plexon) were at 0.5 Hz and 5.9 kHz. Electrodes with unstable signals or prominent peaks at 60 Hz in plots of power spectral density were excluded from quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>After all experiments were completed, rats were deeply anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of Euthasol (100 mg/kg) and then transcardially perfused using 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Brains were cryoprotected with a 20% sucrose and 10% glycerol mixture and then sectioned horizontally on a freezing microtome. The slices were mounted on gelatin-subbed slides and stained for Nissl substance with thionin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis: software and statistics</title><p>All data were analyzed using GNU Octave (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/</ext-link>), Python (Anaconda distribution: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.continuum.io/">https://www.continuum.io/</ext-link>), and R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). Analyses were run as Jupyter notebooks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jupyter.org/">http://jupyter.org/</ext-link>). Computer code used in this study is available upon request from the corresponding author.</p><p>Statistical testing was performed in R. Paired t-tests were used throughout the study and one- or two-way ANOVA (with the error term due to subject) were used to compare data for both behavior and electrophysiological measures (maximum power and maximum ITC) for high- and low-value licks, blocked versus interleaved licks, and high-intermediate-low licks. For significant ANOVAs, the error term was removed and Tukey’s post hoc tests were performed on significant interaction terms for multiple comparisons. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean ± SEM, unless noted otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis: behavior</title><p>All rats were first run for at least five standard sessions in the standard SVLT with differences in concentration (16% and 4% wt/vol). Rats have been shown to acquire incentive contrast effects in the SVLT after this duration of training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parent et al., 2015a</xref>). For the blocked-interleaved and three reward tasks, rats were tested after extensive experience in the SVLT and after two ‘training’ sessions with the blocked-interleaved and three reward designs. The electrophysiological recordings reported here were from the animals’ third session in each task.</p><p>Behavioral measures included total licks across the session, the duration and number of licking bouts, and the median inter-lick intervals (inverse of licking frequency). Bouts of licks were defined as having at least three licks within 300 ms and with an inter-bout interval of 0.5 s or longer. Bouts were not analyzed in the blocked-interleaved task; due to the unique structure of the task, bouts were all shortened by default due to a constantly changing reward in the interleaved phase of the task. While bouts of licks were reported in most tasks, electrophysiological correlates around bouts were not analyzed because there were often too few bouts (specifically for the low-lick conditions) in each session to deduce any electrophysiological effects of reward value on bout-related activity.</p><p>For analyzing lick rate, inter-lick intervals during the different types of rewards were obtained, and then the inverse of the median inter-lick interval provided the average lick rate in Hertz. Any inter-lick interval greater than 1 s or less than 0.09 s was excluded from the analysis. For licks during the randomly interleaved portion of the blocked-interleaved task, more than two licks in a row were needed to calculate lick rate. To analyze behavioral variability of licks, we used coefficient of variation (ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) on high- and low-value inter-lick intervals that occurred within bouts.</p><p>In some experiments, imbalances were apparent in measures of total licks and lick rate. This was due in part to our only calculating inter-lick intervals that were less than 1 s and consisted of runs of at least two consecutive licks. As a result, some licks that were detected were not included in the quantitative measures of lick rate (e.g. two licks that occur 15 s apart from each other). Isolated licks occur in the behavioral design used in our studies when rats sample fluid from the spout during periods when low-value fluid is available and then do not engage in persistent licking.</p><p>Total licks and lick rate are therefore distinct measures and will not always be coupled, especially because licks occur in bursts. Rats strongly engage when the higher value fluid is available in the blocked condition and alternatively will lick more sporadically and will default to sampling the fluid and not maintain engagement when the low-value fluid is available. However, the rate of the licks, in said bouts or bursts, was higher overall during the interleaved parts of the tests sessions. Why this happened is not clear, but one interpretation is that rats are not suppressing or sampling the options anymore in the interleaved portion but are instead maintaining engagement in the task during the interleaved portion of the task when reward identity is unpredictable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis: LFPs</title><p>Electrophysiological data were first analyzed in NeuroExplorer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuroexplorer.com/">http://www.neuroexplorer.com/</ext-link>), to check for artifacts and spectral integrity. Subsequent processing was done using signal processing routines in GNU Octave. Analysis of LFPs used functions from the EEGLab toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delorme and Makeig, 2004</xref>) (ERSP and ITC) and the signal processing toolbox in GNU Octave (the peak-to-peak function was used to measure event-related amplitude). Circular statistics were calculated using the circular library for R. Graphical plots of data were made using the matplotlib and seaborn library for Python. Analyses were typically conducted in Jupyter notebooks, and interactions between Python, R, and Octave were implemented using the rpy2 and oct2py libraries for Python.</p><p>To measure the amplitude and phase of LFP in the frequency range of licking, LFPs were bandpass-filtered using eeglab’s eegfilt function, with a fir1 filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Widmann and Schröger, 2012</xref>), centered at the rat’s licking frequency (licking frequency+ inter-quartile range; typically around 4–9 Hz), and were subsequently z-scored.</p><p>Lick-field coherence used routines (e.g. sp2a_m) from the Neurospec 2.0 library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neurospec.org/">http://www.neurospec.org/</ext-link>) for MATLAB and GNU Octave. LFPs were low-pass filtered (100 Hz) using eegfilt.m from EEGLab. Directed coherence also used routines (e.g. sp2a2_R2.m) from Neurospec 2.0. LFPs were low-pass filtered (100 Hz) using eegfilt.m from EEGLab. The following parameters were used for lick-field coherence and directed coherence: segment power = 10 (1024 points, frequency resolution: 0.977 Hz), Hanning filtering with 50% tapering, and line noise removal for the LFPs at 60 Hz. Analyses focused on frequencies below 30 Hz based assessments of power spectra computed by the Neurospec library as part of this analysis.</p><p>For ITC and ERSP, LFP data was preprocessed using eeglab’s eegfilt function with a fir1 filter and was bandpass-filtered from 0 to 100 Hz. For group summaries, ITC and ERSP matrices were z-scored for that given rat after bandpass-filtering the data. Peri-lick matrices were then formed by using a pre/post window of 2 s on each side, and the newtimef function from the eeglab toolbox was used to generate the time-frequency matrices for ITC and ERSP up to 30 Hz.</p><p>Since most of the lick counts from the SVLT are generally imbalanced (with a greater number of licks for high- versus low-value rewards), we used permutation testing to perform analyses on amplitude and phase-locking in these studies. Licks were typically downsampled to match the lower number of licks; 80% of the number of lower value licks were randomly chosen from each session. For example, if a rat emitted 400 licks for the high concentration sucrose and 200 licks for the low concentration sucrose, then 160 licks would be randomly chosen from each of data type to compare the same number of licks for each lick type. This permutation of taking 80% of the licks was re-sampled 25 times and spectral values were recalculated for each permutation. The maximum ITC value was obtained through calculating the absolute value of ITC values between 2 and 12 Hz within a ~ 150 ms window (+1 inter-lick interval) around each lick. The maximum ERSP value was also taken around the same frequency and time window. Then, the average maximum ITC or ERSP value (of the 25× resampled values) for each LFP channel for each rat was saved in a data frame, and each electrode’s maximum ITC and ERSP value for each type of lick (high-value or low-value lick) were used in the ANOVAs for group summaries. Group summary for the peak-to-peak ERP size recorded the average difference between the maximum and minimum ERP amplitude across all frequencies, using +1 inter-lick interval window around each lick. The mean ERP size for each electrode for each rat was used in the ANOVAs for group summaries. These analyses were performed for all behavioral variations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures carried out in this set of experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at American University (Washington, DC).

Using in vivo electrophysiology, they recorded local field potentials in awake behaving rats performing a shifting values licking task, in which the delivery of fluid reward was triggered by licking the delivery spout. Reward values (sucrose concentration or fluid volume) varied in either block-wise or interleaved fashion to determine the effects of shifting values on behavior and neural activity. The main results show that theta phase alignments time-locked to licks reflected differences in reward expectancies. Under the simplest conditions, when rewards magnitudes are easy to anticipate, theta phase alignment in MFC and OFC show largely similar entrainment to licking behavior, increasing on blocks where more valuable outcomes were expected. However, when three levels of reward were introduced, so that the intermediate was the best in some sessions and the worst in others, lick rates reflected the relative value of the rewards whereas theta oscillations in MFC were more closely aligned with absolute reward values and those in OFC reflected reward changes in a manner that was less clearly interpretable. These results are interpreted as evidence that MFC theta coherence relates to response vigor.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that the study was well designed and carefully executed. However, there were a number of methodological points that require clarification, and there were concerns about the interpretation of some results. Specific points under each of these categories are elaborated below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. First, there were questions about the methods used to analyze behavior on the interleaved blocks. It appears that the rodents made nearly twice as many licks in the blocked versus interleaved context, yet the lick rates are largely equivalent, with the timing of the task conditions fixed to 3 minutes (i.e. Figure 5A vs. B). This suggests there must be some differences in timing that lead to this result. Please clarify.</p><p>Because the behavior in these blocks was not analyzed in more detail, it's unclear what processes the LFPs recorded in either region might reflect. A stronger attempt to define what happens in the interleaved blocks would be helpful here. Specifically, could the lack of effects in OFC be due to unaccounted for fluctuations in the lick rates on interleaved blocks or at the beginning of the 3-reward task? For instance, OFC might be tracking a learning process that changes more dynamically than block-by-block. It may be fruitful to split the block analyses in terms of a moving average, or early versus late portions, that reflect the expected value of licking at different points in the block. Other possibilities include assessing whether the overall behavior is consistent with matching, so there are trials where behavior looks like they anticipate a high reward and some where they anticipate a low reward, versus whether all trials look like the relatively low-reward state? Or if there are previous trial effects that look like evidence of learning, even though the outcomes are randomized?</p><p>2. Second, it appears that the frequencies included in the LFP bandpass varied, but it isn't clear whether this varied by rat or by block type. Please clarify this as well. If the latter is the case, this is a potential confound with differences in lick rates across blocks that needs to be addressed.</p><p>3. Regarding the absolute encoding of reward value, to determine whether this is encoded all combinations of contrasts would ideally be examined within the same session. The illustration of &quot;absolute encoding&quot; in Supp. Figure 3, like Figure 7, compares 8% to 4% and then to 16% sucrose in different blocks. However, 16% is not compared to 4% within the same session. What if, in the same session, 16% was compared to 4%, and the resulting MFC ITC values were more similar as they were to the SVLT task (16% = ~7.25 vs. 4% = ~6) or the Blocked-Interleaved task (16% = ~6.25 vs. 4% = ~5.5)? Without including them as a block within the same session, it is difficult to make assumptions about absolute encoding if not all contrasts are available to the animal.</p><p>4. In some instances, the OFC data demonstrate similar trends to the MFC data but are not statistically significant (e.g., Figure 7C vs. Figure 7F, etc.). However, there are more MFC electrodes (n = 160 from 10 rats) than OFC electrodes (n = 96 from 6 rats). Can the authors comment as to whether the OFC is under-powered? Or more variable (e.g., SEM in Figure 7C vs. Figure 7F)?</p><p>Regarding interpretation:</p><p>5. One of the more interesting results of the paper is that ITC does not follow with the overall pattern of lick rate across trials/blocks. That is, MFC signals are described as reflecting absolute value, whereas lick rates are more consistent with relative value. However, the interpretation is described as MFC coding response vigor. If response vigor is operationally defined by lick rate, how does this interpretation follow? In addition, please explain the operational definitions and differences between task engagement and response vigor, as they do not necessarily seem to be independent of one another.</p><p>6. Are the putative lick-entrained oscillations, particularly in MFC, fully dissociated from the licks themselves? The discussion notes that licking can be rhythmic with a similar frequency as the neural rhythms analyzed here. The authors suggest that the lick-entrained theta should not be interpreted as relating directly to the execution of a lick because the patterns across trials/blocks don't match those of lick rates. Therefore, they emphasize indirect comparisons between patterns of behavior across trial types and patterns of LFP activity across trial types, when a more direct measure would be more compelling. Can the authors relate the two types of measures in another way? For instance, further analyses might assess whether lick frequency is strongly correlated (e.g., Pearson's) with lick-coupled ITC across trials in any of the behavioral tasks for the MFC or the OFC. From another perspective, the total licks in a session or number of lick bouts are measures that are pooled over time, and it's possible that they don't quite capture the pattern of licks occurring in the peri-lick window in which the neural data were analyzed. To address this, licking could be aligned to the same lick times that the neural data were aligned to, and show whether there continues to be subtle divergence between behavior and neural activity.</p><p>7. Results reveal that theta oscillation phase, but not power, has a relationship to licking behavior. Can the authors describe the functional significance of phase coordination vs. power changes in these cortical networks? And speculate on why phase alignment appears to be a more important measure than differences in power? Relatedly, are these oscillations thought to be locally generated within the MFC or OFC networks?</p><p>8.

First, there were questions about the methods used to analyze behavior on the interleaved blocks. It appears that the rodents made nearly twice as many licks in the blocked versus interleaved context, yet the lick rates are largely equivalent, with the timing of the task conditions fixed to 3 minutes (i.e. Figure 5A vs. B). This suggests there must be some differences in timing that lead to this result. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>In some experiments, imbalances were apparent in measures of total licks and lick rate. This was due in part to our only calculating inter-lick intervals that were less than 1 second and consisted of runs of at least 2 consecutive licks. As a result, some licks that were detected were not included in the quantitative measures of lick rate (e.g. two licks that occur 15 seconds apart from each other). Isolated licks occur in the behavioral design used in our studies when rats sample fluid from the spout during periods when low value fluid is available and then do not engage in persistent licking.</p><p>“Total licks and lick rate are therefore distinct measures and will not always be coupled, especially because licks occur in bursts. Rats strongly engage when the higher value fluid is available in the blocked condition and alternatively will lick more sporadically and will default to sampling the fluid and not maintain engagement when the low value fluid is available. […] Why this happened is not clear, but one interpretation is that rats are not suppressing or sampling the options anymore in the interleaved portion but are instead maintaining engagement in the task during the interleaved portion of the task when reward identity is unpredictable.”</p><p>The text above was added to the Methods section on page 33 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the behavior in these blocks was not analyzed in more detail, it's unclear what processes the LFPs recorded in either region might reflect. A stronger attempt to define what happens in the interleaved blocks would be helpful here. Specifically, could the lack of effects in OFC be due to unaccounted for fluctuations in the lick rates on interleaved blocks or at the beginning of the 3-reward task? For instance, OFC might be tracking a learning process that changes more dynamically than block-by-block. It may be fruitful to split the block analyses in terms of a moving average, or early versus late portions, that reflect the expected value of licking at different points in the block. Other possibilities include assessing whether the overall behavior is consistent with matching, so there are trials where behavior looks like they anticipate a high reward and some where they anticipate a low reward, versus whether all trials look like the relatively low-reward state? Or if there are previous trial effects that look like evidence of learning, even though the outcomes are randomized?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. Data analysis is challenging in this simple behavioral procedure, which lacks trial structure and by its nature encourages rats to suppress licking when the lower value option is available. Nevertheless, we tried a number of session wide splits, moving windows, and sequential analyses to better understand results from the blocked-interleaved sessions. Most analyses were of limited utility, especially those that examined sequential effects of value on licks, due to the low number of low-value licks.</p><p>“Sessions were split into sequential 30 sec windows and the various measures of licking behavior were plotted. […] Licks for the lower value fluid increased starting from the onset of the interleaved part of the session.”</p><p>The text above has been added to the manuscript as well as Supplementary Figure 3, and noted in the text on page 11. If the reviewers and editors would like more extensive summaries for the moving window analysis, we can easily add them to the manuscript.</p><p>As reported in our 2017 paper on LFP fluctuations in the MFC in the base version of the task, there were no effects of two- or three-way session splits on the behavioral or neural measures. Rats licked in a similar manner across the portion of the session with interleaved rewards and various measures of LFC activity (power, phase locking) were stable over those periods of the sessions. Plots can be added as supplemental figures to document these negative findings, if the reviewers and editors would like to have them in the manuscript.</p><p>Sequential analyses of licks were also attempted. These included evaluating behavioral (inter-lick intervals) and neural measures (lick-field coherence) for licks that were preceded by the same or other value lick. No results were significant from these analyses, and this was likely due to a major imbalance in the number of high and low value licks. There were fewer low value licks overall and so many fewer sequences of low-high (last lick low and current lick high) and high-low licks compared to high-high licks. These results were examined using traditional statistics and also estimation statistics, and were generally underwhelming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Second, it appears that the frequencies included in the LFP bandpass varied, but it isn't clear whether this varied by rat or by block type. Please clarify this as well. If the latter is the case, this is a potential confound with differences in lick rates across blocks that needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>All LFPs were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz for all analyses. The only analysis that used rat-specific time windows was the peak-to-peak analysis, which constricted the data analysis window to be within +/- 1 median inter-lick interval (calculated for each rat’s licking data).</p><p>Indeed, given that we used each rat’s median ILI as a range for the analysis windows in the peak-to-peak analysis, there will naturally be a slight variation in each rat’s analysis window. The intent was to use each individual rat’s behavior to drive the analysis windows instead of one standard window over all rats. To confirm that there is minimal spread of this data analysis window and that the analysis window of +/- 1 ILI was appropriate across rats, we calculated each animal’s ILI range from the MFC shifting values concentration sessions (all rats used in Figure 1D for concentration sessions in dark blue). The median inter-lick interval of all rats is 150.03 msec. There is only a 30.675 msec difference in the maximum to the minimum inter-lick interval across all rats (maximum=170.03 msec; minimum ILI = 139.35 msec).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding the absolute encoding of reward value, to determine whether this is encoded all combinations of contrasts would ideally be examined within the same session. The illustration of &quot;absolute encoding&quot; in Supp. Figure 3, like Figure 7, compares 8% to 4% and then to 16% sucrose in different blocks. However, 16% is not compared to 4% within the same session. What if, in the same session, 16% was compared to 4%, and the resulting MFC ITC values were more similar as they were to the SVLT task (16% = ~7.25 vs. 4% = ~6) or the Blocked-Interleaved task (16% = ~6.25 vs. 4% = ~5.5)? Without including them as a block within the same session, it is difficult to make assumptions about absolute encoding if not all contrasts are available to the animal.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been difficult to make conclusions about absolute encoding with using across-session data. The three-reward task actually was initially designed to have all combinations of reward presented to the animal, as Block 1: 8/4%; Block 2: 16/8%; Block 3: 16/4%. We opted to not include the third Block in our original analyses due finding that rats emitted lower numbers of licks, specifically for the 4% sucrose. Typically, we aimed for at least ~50 licks for electrophysiological analyses, and all of the low lick counts were under 50 licks in the block (and a few rats only emitted one or two licks total, meaning we could not perform electrophysiological analysis). This could be due to satiety in the task, although all but three rats emitted many (over 50, upwards of 300+) licks for the Block 3 16% sucrose reward.</p><p>However, it may be fruitful to include this data, such that at least the Block 3 16% data can be compared with the Block 2 16% data. We went back and included Block 3 behavior measures (total licks and lick rate) and electrophysiological data for the high-value (16%) licks, which is shown in the attached figure.</p><p>In comparing lick counts, there was a significant effect of lick type on the total number of licks emitted (F(5,51)=28.49, p&lt;0.001). Post-hoc testing revealed a significant decrease in the total number of licks emitted for the high value (16%) sucrose in Block 3 as opposed to licks for high value sucrose in Block 2 (p&lt;0.001), although Block 3 high value lick counts were not significantly different from the Intermediate (8%) Block 2 lick counts (p=0.88). There was a significant difference in licks emitted for Block 2 versus Block 3 high value sucrose (p&lt;0.005). Additionally, lick counts were quite low for Block 3 low value sucrose and therefore were omitted from subsequent electrophysiological analyses. Lick rate was also re-analyzed including Block 3 high value licks, but lick rate for low value (4%) licks could not be analyzed due to a low number of licks not passing criteria. Lick rate for Block 3 high value licks were not significantly different from Block 2 high value licks (p=0.99), nor from Block 2 intermediate licks (p=0.83).</p><p>In MFC, Block 3 High value ITC values [95% CI: 0.716, 0.757] were not significantly different from Block 2 High value ITCs (p=0.113) [95% CI: 0.671, 0.715]. Block 3 High value ITCs were significantly increased from both intermediate (8%) value ITCs in Block 1 [95% CI: 0.619, 0.672] and Block 2 [95% CI: 0.610, 0.658] (p&lt;0.001 for both).</p><p>In OFC, using the same criteria of &gt;50 licks, one rat was excluded. In the remaining animals, Block 3 High value ITCs [95% CI: 0.540, 0.611] were not significantly different from Block 2 High value ITCs (p=0.789) [95% CI: 0.497, 0.580]. Block 3 High value ITCs were significantly increased from Block 2 Intermediate value ITCs (p=0.025) [95% CI for intermediate Block 2: 0.450, 0.535], but Block 3 high value ITCs were not significantly different from Block 1 intermediate ITCs [Block 1 intermediate 95% CI: 0.505, 0.584]. The other comparisons (Block 2 intermediate versus Block 2 high value) were not significant (p=0.339).</p><p>We added new Supplementary Figure 5. We have also emphasized in the text (page 17, and also Supplementary Figure 4) that our “standard” / operational definition for absolute value is that there would be no significant difference between the same value reward across blocks, as suggested in our hypotheses in the supplement as well. We also changed the previous section labeled “Three Reward Task: Neural evidence for effects of absolute, not relative, reward value” to “Three Reward Task: Neural activity does not reflect relative reward value encoding”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In some instances, the OFC data demonstrate similar trends to the MFC data but are not statistically significant (e.g., Figure 7C vs. Figure 7F, etc.). However, there are more MFC electrodes (n = 160 from 10 rats) than OFC electrodes (n = 96 from 6 rats). Can the authors comment as to whether the OFC is under-powered? Or more variable (e.g., SEM in Figure 7C vs. Figure 7F)?</p></disp-quote><p>Comparisons between MFC and OFC, especially for the data in the original Figure 7, were challenging for two reasons. First, there were differences in total sampling due to the project originally focusing on MFC and moving to OFC as the work progressed. The difference in total number of recordings and fewer animals with data from OFC does suggest an underpowered analysis. Second, the MFC areas are somewhat less complex anatomically, with most recordings in the rostral prelimbic and medial orbital regions, which are generally similar in terms of inputs and outputs, and mostly from the deep layers of the cortex. By contrast, the OFC recordings came from three distinct orbital regions (AId, LO, DLO) and were more scattered over layers.</p><p>Quantitatively, we re-ran the analyses for the RRV sessions and the ITC measure from MFC and OFC (original Figure 7C vs 7F). Since there was a lower <italic>n</italic> in the OFC groups, we downsampled the data to 90% of the <italic>n</italic> in the OFC group and calculated statistical measures for 1000 randomly resamples. Downsampling resulted in equivocal results for ITC differences in both MFC and OFC. For this reason, we have revised our summary of findings associated with the original Figure 7 to emphasize results from MFC and we now state that results on OFC were equivocal, possibly due to having undersampled the region in the RRV experiment. We modified the text to state: “However, these findings should be interpreted in the light of uneven sampling between areas, with fewer recordings done in the OFC. It is therefore possible that our results are underpowered for the OFC and new experiments could reveal an alternative interpretation.” (page 17).</p><p>We also changed the subtitle for the section reporting results from the Blocked-Interleaved experiment to “Blocked-Interleaved Task: MFC rhythmicity tracks response vigor.” The revised subtitle does not comment on unclear findings from the OFC.</p><p>Importantly, the uneven sampling between areas should not discount the observation that MFC tracks lick rate (vigor) in the Blocked-Interleaved experiment or the absolute value of the rewarding fluids in the Relative Reward Value experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding interpretation:</p><p>5. One of the more interesting results of the paper is that ITC does not follow with the overall pattern of lick rate across trials/blocks. That is, MFC signals are described as reflecting absolute value, whereas lick rates are more consistent with relative value. However, the interpretation is described as MFC coding response vigor. If response vigor is operationally defined by lick rate, how does this interpretation follow? In addition, please explain the operational definitions and differences between task engagement and response vigor, as they do not necessarily seem to be independent of one another.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretations were based on operationally defining response vigor as lick rate (measured as the reciprocal of the inter-lick interval) and engagement as total licks per session. Fast licking is vigorous. A rat could lick vigorously and be either consistently or inconsistently engaged in the task. For example, the rat could emit licks in briefer bouts or with longer inter-bout intervals, leading to less time spent licking and thus reduced engagement. An engaged rat would spend more time licking over the test session than a less engaged rat, and could lick more or less vigorously.</p><p>Interpretational statements were added for lick counts as a proxy for engagement and lick rate as a proxy for vigor (last paragraph on page 33 and Figure 5). Furthermore, to support the idea that lick counts and licking rate are generally independent measures, we used Spearman rank correlation to examine the relationship between lick rate and total licks. The correlation statistic was 0.44242 (p=0.20042). This finding was added to the revised manuscript on page 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Are the putative lick-entrained oscillations, particularly in MFC, fully dissociated from the licks themselves?

We considered the methods that were suggested. None of them address the correlation between licks and LFC fluctuations as time series, and this seems to be the most direct way to answer the question.</p><p>Given this feedback and our previous experiences analyzing data from spike trains and LFPs, we realized that methods used for spike-field coherence could be used to address these issues, treating licks as spikes. Such lick-field coherence (LFC) estimates phase synchrony as a function of frequency. If licks fully drive LFP fluctuations at the licking frequency, then LFC should be near 1. If licks and LFP fluctuations are fully dissociated, then LFC should be near 0. For our data, we found the extent of coupling between MFC and OFC rhythmic activity was typically between 0 and 0.5, was larger for high value licks (high concentration and large volume) compared to low value licks, and was larger for sites in MFC compared to OFC (see the new Figure 3). These results suggest that the LFP oscillations near the licking frequency are partially dissociated from licking. These new results are very helpful for understanding the impact of licking on LFPs in MFC and OFC, and will be useful in discussing our results going forward. We have asked about the extent of dissociation between licks and LFPs before, and did not have a clear answer to these questions. Thanks to your comments and these new analyses, we feel that we can now confidently answer these questions.</p><p>In working through the new analyses, we also realized that more could be said about how the fluctuations in MFC and OFC related to one another, and so using other measures spectral methods (directed coherence), we have included new results that suggest that the licking-related rhythms in MFC lead those in OFC (Figure 2). Furthermore, when we plotted coherence values anatomically, we observed that the strongest coherence levels were located in the rostral MFC (Figure 2F). These new results suggest a rostral-to-caudal gradient in the influences of MFC over OFC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Results reveal that theta oscillation phase, but not power, has a relationship to licking behavior. Can the authors describe the functional significance of phase coordination vs. power changes in these cortical networks? And speculate on why phase alignment appears to be a more important measure than differences in power? Relatedly, are these oscillations thought to be locally generated within the MFC or OFC networks?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that was not covered adequately in the previous version of our manuscript. These issues were addressed in a previous paper from our group (Amarante et al., 2017). The revised manuscript now includes an extensive discussion of these issues, on pages 23-24. In brief, the data reported in the present manuscript and published studies from our group and others suggest that the act of licking synchronizes the phase of ongoing rhythms in the MFC and OFC and that this synchronization occurs during periods of sustained increases in δ band power. Δ power varies with respiration (Lockmann and Tort, 2018), and respiration is regulated to enable sustained fluid consumption. The MFC and OFC regions that we studied are separated by a frontal agranular region that is known to control jaw opening in rats (Yoshida et al., 2009), and maybe be homologous to an area called ALM (Anterior Lateral Motor cortex) in mice.</p><p>Regarding your question about the local generation of the oscillatory activity, our 2017 study also examined this issue, for the MFC. Rats were implanted with a guide cannula in one hemisphere and an electrode array in the other, and the guide cannula was used to deliver muscimol to one hemisphere. Rats were then tested in the Shifting Values Licking task, and the neural recordings showed reductions in both event-related power and phase (Figure 8 in Amarante et al., 2018). This study demonstrates that synchronization of MFC LFP to the lick cycle depends on the MFC. Combined with the new findings added to the current manuscript, using directed coherence analysis and multivariate spectral methods, we can further suggest that the MFC leads the OFC in the timing of the licking-coupled rhythms, and might even drive processing in OFC in phase with incoming sensory information generated by licking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Pp. 27, lines 479-481: Please explicitly describe the ways in which the present data support the hypothesis that the MFC represents action-outcome relationships, while the OFC represents stimulus-outcome relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>In the discussion, we previously had stated: “The subtle differences between the two regions follow the hypothesis that MFC represents action-outcome relationships and OFC represents stimulus-outcome relationships. MFC activity may provide the “value of the action” information to OFC, while OFC may evaluate the reward and provide feedback to MFC”.”</p><p>Our present data support this general hypothesis with MFC activity largely tracking more of the action given each respective reward, since MFC ITCs strongly reflect the expected reward value. We have reduced the statement such that at this time we cannot directly provide evidence for OFC in stimulus-outcome relationships, only that OFC does not as closely reflect the action of licking (reflected in lick rate and correlations of ITC values to licks and lick rate).</p><p>We have changed the statement to read: “The subtle differences between the two regions follow the hypothesis that these areas provide different roles during consummatory behavior. We additionally provide evidence for MFC representing action-outcome relationships, as MFC ITC activity is more strongly correlated to the action of licking and may signal information about the “value of the action.” (page 18 in the revised manuscript).</p></body></sub-article></article>
