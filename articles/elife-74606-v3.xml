mitochondria remains elusive. We recorded changes in the fluorescence of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators in cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons in mouse brain slices while evoking pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Postsynaptic spike firing elicited fast mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that were about threefold larger in the somas and apical dendrites than in basal dendrites and axons. The amplitude of these responses and metabolic activity were extremely sensitive to the firing frequency. Furthermore, while an EPSP alone caused no detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in the dendritic mitochondria, the coincidence of EPSP with a backpropagating spike produced prominent, highly localized mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots. Our results indicate that mitochondria decode the spike firing frequency and the Hebbian temporal coincidences into the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which are further translated into the metabolic output and most probably lead to long-term changes in synaptic efficacy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cortical pyramidal neuron</kwd><kwd>spike-timing-dependent plasticity</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ signaling</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1384/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleidervish</surname><given-names>Ilya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1310/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gitler</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 AG065628</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sekler</surname><given-names>Israel</given-names></name><name><surname>Stutzmann</surname><given-names>Grace</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1763/21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sekler</surname><given-names>Israel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optical recordings from L5 cortical pyramidal neurons expressing mitochondria-targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, mitoGCaMP6m, reveal compartment-specific mitochondrial responses to spike firing and synaptic activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For the neuronal circuit to function properly, the energy demand in all compartments of the individual neurons needs to be precisely matched by local, primarily mitochondrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Celsi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>), ATP production. During periods of enhanced neuronal activity, mitochondria accelerate ATP production by allowing the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations to propagate into the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashrafi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Díaz-García et al., 2021</xref>). When cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> rises, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, powered by the steep mitochondrial membrane potential, flow into the mitochondrial matrix via the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter MCU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baughman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Stefani et al., 2011</xref>), and are then extruded back into the cytosol by the mitochondrial Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> antiporter NCLX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palty et al., 2010</xref>). The mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation increases ATP production by activating at least three Krebs cycle enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Stefani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wescott et al., 2019</xref>). When Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is disrupted, mitochondria in presynaptic terminals fail to maintain the stable ATP concentration during enhanced activity periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashrafi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giorgio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glancy and Balaban, 2012</xref>).

Thus, local inhibition of the mitochondria by a phototoxic protein abolishes the synaptic plasticity in the affected dendritic segment. Under physiological conditions, the plastic changes in synaptic efficacy are believed to be controlled by the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials (APs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi and Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>). Spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) relies on activation of the postsynaptic NMDA receptors, which are Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeable and require both glutamate and depolarization to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nowak et al., 1984</xref>). Mitochondrial handling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions is known to have a significant effect on cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rizzuto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Szabadkai and Duchen, 2008</xref>). The mitochondrial depletion, however, had no effect on glutamate evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that these organelles play a yet unexplored downstream role in the cascade of reactions leading to STDP.</p><p>Here, using whole-cell electrical recordings from Layer 5 pyramidal neurons in cortical slices and fluorescence imaging of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, we show that single or few spikes trigger rapidly rising and decaying mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in all neuronal compartments, with kinetics similar to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Our evidence indicates that the mitochondria’s Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and metabolic rate depend critically on spike firing frequency. We further report that, in dendrites, the coincidence of unitary EPSP and a backpropagating action potential produces a localized [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> transient, which, in addition to enhancing local ATP synthesis, could play a role in STDP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spike-elicited mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients</title><p>To determine how neuronal electrical activity affects mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, we performed somatic whole-cell recordings from L5 pyramidal neurons expressing the mitochondria-targeted, neuron-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, mitoGCaMP6m. The intracellular solution was supplemented with the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Fura-2, that could be excited separately from mitoGCaMP6m. Series of thin, high-resolution optical sections over the vertical extent of the neuron, representing Fura-2 and mitoGCaMP6m fluorescence elicited by two-photon excitation at 760 and 960 nm, respectively, were used to reconstruct the morphology of the neuron and to reveal the position of the individual mitochondria within its soma and processes. To improve the temporal resolution of the optical signals, dynamic fluorescence measurements were obtained from the smaller regions of interest in soma, axon, and dendrites. In a typical experiment, two APs elicited by the injection of two brief current pulses via the patch pipette caused cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the soma of an L5 cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Although the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals had relatively even intensity, the change in mitoGCaMP6m fluorescence occurred at ‘hotspots’, each representing an individual mitochondrion. The mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations began with a short delay after the beginning of the spike train, and they were observed only in the electrically active neurons. At the same time, the fluorescence of the nearby mitoGCaMP6m expressing mitochondria belonging to the non-active cells did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trains of action potentials elicit mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in soma and processes of L5 pyramidal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Changes in mitoGCaMP6m and Fura-2 fluorescence elicited by a train of two APs in a representative L5 pyramidal cell. <italic>Left,</italic> The image obtained by merging two optical sections through part of a L5 neuron at excitation wavelengths of 760 and 960 nm, eliciting the Fura-2 and mitoGCaMP6m fluorescence, respectively. <italic>Right,</italic> Somatic mitoGCaMP6m (red) and Fura-2 (green) ΔF/F transients elicited by a train of two APs.

While the amplitude and time course of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in all these compartments were similar, the magnitude of mitochondrial signals was remarkably polar. The amplitude of the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in apical dendrite was as prominent as in the soma. In contrast, in the AIS and thin basal dendrites, the mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were dramatically smaller.</p><p>We next sought to evaluate the relationship between the number of APs and the mean peak amplitude of the mitoGCaMP6m transients in the soma, AIS, apical and basal dendrites of 29 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The steepness of this relationship was greater in soma and apical dendrites (1.3% and 1.1% ΔF/F per spike, respectively) compared with AIS and basal dendrites (0.4% and 0.3% ΔF/F per spike, respectively). The compartmental differences in mitochondrial signals were not due to a different magnitude of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. The pattern of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> during the neuronal activity is known to be complex. However, the differences in peak cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were subtle, and they poorly correlated with the magnitude of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. For example, the peak ΔF/F amplitude of Fura-2 transients elicited by twenty spikes was 26% ± 3.6% (n = 22) for soma, 37% ± 4% (n = 13) for apical dendrite, 38% ± 4% (n = 13) for basal dendrites, and 25% ± 4% in the AIS (n = 7). The compartmental differences in magnitude of the mitoGCaMP6m transients could, at least partially, be explained by the lower expression level of fluorescence probe in the mitochondria localized within the thinner neuronal processes. This seems to be unlikely, however, since, in all neuronal compartments, maximal mitoGCaMP6m fluorescence of the individual mitochondria following prolonged depolarization of the neuronal membrane was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).

Whole-cell recording from a single pyramidal neuron within the region of interest was obtained to tune the stimuli intensity such that each stimulus would elicit only one AP. In cortical neurons, NAD(P)H signals primarily reflect changes in mitochondrial NAD(P)H pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Díaz-García et al., 2021</xref>). In response to electrical stimulation, we observed a negative deflection in the NAD(P)H autofluorescence (‘dip’) which indicates an increased rate of electron transfer reflected in NAD(P)H oxidation, followed by a positive transient (‘overshoot’) which indicates Krebs-cycle-dependent replenishment of NAD(P)H pool. At higher stimulation frequency, the magnitude of both dip and overshoot of the NAD(P)H signals were enhanced, consistent with the previous reports that the rates of NAD(P)H oxidation and synthesis are dependent on the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Díaz-García et al., 2021</xref>). Spatio-temporal analysis of the NAD(P)H autofluorescence dynamics at two stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) revealed that the changes in the fluorescence were spatially restricted to Layer 5 of a single cortical column and that the frequency-dependent amplification of both dip and overshoot amplitude was relatively uniform within the stimulated region.

After filling the cell for ~20 min to allow the diffusion of Fura-2 into the dendrites, we positioned the bipolar electrode close to an apical or basal dendrite. Delivery of a single brief stimulus (0.1ms), with its amplitude adjusted to keep the subsequent EPSP below the threshold for postsynaptic spike generation produced no detectable cytosolic or mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (n = 7). The single AP elicited by brief somatic current pulse injection, however, produced a cytosolic but no mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the dendrites. Remarkably, the coincidence of the EPSP and backpropagating AP synergized to elicit a robust cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). While most dendritic mitochondria were silent, the EPSP and AP coincidence created single localized mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> “hotspots” with peak ΔF/F amplitude of 6.4% ± 0.8% (n = 8) in the dendritic regions of interest. We interpreted the appearance of these hotspots as evidence for a highly restricted, probably single mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, in the vicinity of the active spine. The unitary character of the mitochondrial signals under this experimental paradigm can be explained by a spatial sparseness of the synapses formed by the presynaptic fiber on the dendrites of the postsynaptic cortical cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Markram et al., 1997a</xref>) such that only one out of a few currently active spines could be found in the relatively short segment of a dendritic branch that we examined. The cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, measured in the same hotspot at which the mitoGCaMP6m signal was detected, was not significantly larger than in the nearby dendrite. The failure to see the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> “hotspots” is, most probably, due to temporal and amplitude resolution of our optical recording that was insufficient to reveal Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in the tiny volume between the spine neck and the mitochondrion during the fast single spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyazaki and Ross, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Svoboda et al., 1996</xref>). We extended our analysis by measuring the cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals elicited by 20 unpaired APs and APs paired with EPSP. In both apical and basal dendrites, the paired APs produced a significantly larger mitochondrial signal. In contrast, the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation amplitude was not significantly different for unpaired and paired stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). Hence, the peak amplitude of the mitoGCaMP6m transients elicited by paired APs was 2.73 ± 0.32 (n = 8) and 2.11 ± 0.32 (n = 9) times higher than of those evoked by the unpaired APs in the basal and apical dendrites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). The ability of postsynaptic neurons to generate an AP was crucial for triggering the dendritic mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.

In contrast to a recent report of ‘loose’ coupling of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients to neuronal activity and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in in vivo cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), our data suggest a tight, causative relationship between neuronal electrical activity, cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><p>Several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashrafi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devaraju et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>) have revealed the tens-of-seconds long mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in presynaptic terminals of cultured central neurons. While this extremely slow rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance may reflect compartmental specialization of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling at the presynaptic sites, it seems more likely to be due to excessively intense stimulation. Indeed, small mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in axons of cultured hippocampal neurons elicited by 1–5 antidromic stimuli decayed rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>). Our results indicate that the prolonged mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations occur only following the long period of robust high-frequency firing. Although such intense firing is not typically observed in cortical pyramidal cells under physiological conditions, it may occur during various neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Makinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zott et al., 2019</xref>) contributing to the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and disease progression.</p><p>Our evidence indicates that the summation of the unitary AP-evoked mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients steeply depends on firing frequency. Thus, in contrast to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which is less sensitive to firing rate, the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations were strongly amplified at firing frequencies of &gt;40 Hz. As expected, the enhanced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake accelerated the rate of NAD(P)H production and consumption via the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the electron transport chain, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Díaz-García et al., 2021</xref>), thereby upregulating the ATP synthesis.</p><p>The finding that action potential induced mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are about threefold greater in the soma and apical dendrites than in proximal axon and basal dendrites, most likely, indicates the compartmental difference in expression of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, MCU. Alternatively, the subcellular differences in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling may reflect region-specific MCU molecular tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashrafi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patron et al., 2019</xref>) or mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>). From the functional viewpoint, the greater mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in thick neuronal processes might be necessary to compensate for the higher energetic cost of AP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attwell and Laughlin, 2001</xref>).</p><p>A recent study suggests that the metabolic activity of mitochondria plays a pivotal role in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rangaraju et al., 2019</xref>). How neuronal activity is linked to this process is poorly understood, however. Our results suggest that mitochondria can detect the Hebbian time coincidences between the pre- and postsynaptic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Markram et al., 1997b</xref>). The resultant Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the mitochondrial matrix could be an essential part of the cascade of events underlying spike-time-dependent synaptic plasticity. This cascade might involve the initiation of fission of the dendritic mitochondria, as has been proposed for chemically induced NMDAR-dependent LTP in hippocampal neuronal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Divakaruni et al., 2018</xref>), although it remains unclear whether the LTP associated burst of fission events occurs at a physiologically relevant time scale. The involvement of the frequency-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, most probably, explains the observed repetition rate requirement for LTP induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inglebert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lisman and Spruston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, the spike-timing-dependent potentiation of cortical synapses, in addition to precise spike timing, requires a sufficiently high repetition frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sjöström et al., 2001</xref>). Our data indicate that the unique ability of the mitochondria to decode firing frequency and Hebbian timing code of neuronal activity make this organelle a long-thought link between the firing pattern, metabolism, and plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Ben Gurion University of the Negev.

MitoGCaMP6m was excited at 940–950 nm. L5 pyramidal cells with low resting fluorescence that responded to electrical stimulation delivered via the nearby placed bipolar electrode were selected for whole cell recording (see below).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sacha B Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor.

We added discussion of the earlier studies of activity-dependent mitochondrial calcium uptake, as recommended by the Reviewer (Kwon et al., 2016; Gazit et al., 2016; Vaccaro et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2018; Devaraju et al., 2017; Styr et al., 2019; Ashrafi et al., 2020). We also added discussion of the results by Divakaruni et al. (2018), who proposed a role of fission of the dendritic mitochondria as a mechanism of the chemically induced NMDAR-dependent LTP in hippocampal neuronal culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The main current weaknesses of the study are the lack of mechanistic insight and the mainly observational data.

Similarly their proposal that mitochondrial co-incidence detection could impact plasticity is not tested experimentally. Addressing some of these issues would significantly increase the impact of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that elucidating the molecular mechanisms regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis of neuronal mitochondrial is of utmost importance. We plan to address these mechanisms in future work. We anticipate that the publication of our data will stimulate other labs in the field to contribute effort to advance our understanding of the activity-metabolic relationship in central neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose that in different neuronal subdomains, mitochondrial calcium uptake may respond differently to activity. While this is interesting, no mechanism is provided for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the observed subcellular differences in the magnitude of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are related to compartmentally specific regulation of MCU expression or its activity (see Discussion). The detailed analysis would require developing new, currently unavailable molecular tools suitable for in-vivo manipulations. We plan to address this important issue in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report a frequency dependency of mitochondrial calcium uptake.

To the best of our knowledge, the spike-frequency-dependent amplification of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling has never been demonstrated in neurons or other cell types. We believe that a dramatic increase in the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response at 50 vs. 20 Hz cannot be explained by slightly more prominent (10-20%, Figure 2B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1) cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains beneath the OMM, 5- to 10-fold higher than in bulk cytosol, have indeed been demonstrated by the Pozzan’s group (Giacomello et al., 2010). However, there is no evidence that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration at these hotspots behaves in a non-linear fashion relative to the bulk.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors nicely demonstrate that there is also a frequency dependency of metabolic rate (imaging NAD(P)H) but not evidence is provided that this is indeed dependent on mitochondrial calcium influx. Other mechanisms could be at play. Can the authors provide evidence (pharmacological, genetic) that frequency-dependent metabolic rate change is indeed dependent on mitochondrial calcium influx.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important issue. Several other groups have shown the activity-dependent mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation to promote the oxidation and recovery of mitochondrial NAD(P)H. Most recently, an elegant <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Diaz-Garcia, 2021 #64) showed a clear link between mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and NAD(P)H changes. These experiments were performed under similar experimental conditions, and therefore we felt that it would be redundant to repeat them here. Indeed, our results are entirely consistent with this study. From a historical perspective, the close correlation of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and NAD(P)H changes was demonstrated as early as in 1992 when Duchen (Duchen, 1992) reported that the superfusion with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution or intracellular application of the MCU blocker, RuR, completely abolished changes in NADH autofluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The examples shown for mitochondrial co-incidence detection appear to be in the proximal dendrite 20-40 microns from the cell body. Backpropagating APs can travel many hundreds of microns into dendrites. Have the authors observed similar phenomena more distally?</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusions are based on recordings from the mitochondria in proximal apical and basal dendrites, up to 200 µm from the soma. The dynamics of backpropagation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling could indeed differ in distal vs. proximal dendritic arbor. We believe, however, that our finding that the coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic spikes cause spatially restricted mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals will remain valid for distant dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is overly succinct and therefore fails to place the current work within the wider literature.
