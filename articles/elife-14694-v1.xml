normal brain function and closely linked to brain disorders including dementias. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we demonstrate roles of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in regulating synapse numbers, thus unravelling an important cellular requirement of normal Tau. In this context, we find that Tau displays a strong functional overlap with microtubule-binding spectraplakins, establishing new links between two different neurodegenerative factors. Tau and the spectraplakin Short Stop act upstream of a three-step regulatory cascade ensuring adequate delivery of synaptic proteins. This cascade involves microtubule stability as the initial trigger, JNK signalling as the central mediator, and kinesin-3 mediated axonal transport as the key effector. This cascade acts during development (synapse formation) and ageing (synapse maintenance) alike. Therefore, our findings suggest novel explanations for intellectual disability in Tau deficient individuals, as well as early synapse loss in dementias including Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14694.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14694.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14694.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells form cable-like projections called axons that connect to other nerve cells to form the nervous system. Axons carry nerve impulses in the form of electrical messages, and they pass on these messages to other cells at junctions known as synapses. Specific patterns of connections between axons allow us to coordinate our movements, feel emotions and think. In Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions, synapses often decay earlier than they should, which can cause important connections between nerve cells to be lost.</p><p>To be able to make and maintain synapses, nerve cells transport materials from the main body of the cell along axons to the sites where synapses form. A protein called Tau and a family of proteins called the spectraplakins are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Changes (or mutations) in these proteins were known to disrupt the formation and maintenance of synapses, but it was not clear how these proteins work in this context.</p><p>Voelzmann et al. studied Tau and spectraplakin during synapse formation and maintenance in fruit flies. The experiments show that both proteins stabilise tube-like structures called microtubules in axons, which provide structural support to cells. The loss of Tau or spectraplakins causes the microtubules to fall apart and triggers an internal stress signalling pathway known as the JNK pathway. Activating JNK signalling blocks the transport of synaptic materials along axons, which prevents the formation of new synapses and starves existing synapses leading to their decay.</p><p>The next step is to find out whether Tau and spectraplakins play similar roles in the nerve cells of mammals, which may open up new opportunities to develop therapies for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14694.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14694.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axons</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>transport</kwd><kwd>tau</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M007456/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Soriano</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I002448/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prokop</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105610/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prokop</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2071/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voelzmann</surname><given-names>Andre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel regulatory cascade downstream of Tau and spectraplakins ensures that synaptic proteins are delivered to axonal terminals in the developing and ageing brain, providing potential explanations for precocious synapse loss in dementias.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The correct formation and subsequent maintenance of synapses is a key prerequisite for brain development, function and longevity. Precocious loss of synapses is observed in late onset neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), likely contributing to the cognitive decline and neuronal decay observed in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pooler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saxena and Caroni, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the characterisation of mechanisms maintaining synapses during ageing would have major implications for our understanding of dementias.</p><p>The development of synapses and their maintenance during ageing is dependent on sustained transport of synaptic proteins from the distant soma, driven by motor proteins which trail along the bundles of microtubules in axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein et al., 2008</xref>). Microtubules are regulated by microtubule binding proteins which are therefore in a key position to regulate synapse formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prokop, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Tau is a microtubule associated protein (MAP) discovered in the mid-seventies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weingarten et al., 1975</xref>). Reduction in Tau levels has been linked to intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapir et al., 2012</xref>) and a class of brain disorders termed 'dementias which lack distinctive histopathology' (DLDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhukareva et al., 2001</xref>). Tau detachment from MTs is linked to prominent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and some forms of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kovacs, 2015</xref>). In vitro, Tau has the ability to regulate microtubule properties including stability, cross-linkage and polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2013</xref>). Through such functions, Tau would be expected to regulate multiple aspects of neuronal cell biology, but its physiological roles are still not understood and highly debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2013</xref>). This might partly be due to experimental challenges posed by functional redundancy, where other MAPs are proposed to mask physiological roles of Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takei et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>A good model in which to deal with functional redundancy is the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. As is ideal for studies of Tau, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons provide access to powerful genetics, they are readily established for research on the neuronal cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2010</xref>), on neuronal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwarz, 2013</xref>) and on synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</xref>). Importantly, concepts and mechanisms gained from work in flies are often well conserved in higher organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaiswal et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggested that the spectraplakin Short Stop (Shot), a large actin-MT linker molecules and potent regulators of microtubules, could display potential functional overlap with Tau during microtubule stabilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alves-Silva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prokop, 2013</xref>). This hypothesis is attractive because the well-conserved mammalian spectraplakin Dystonin is already linked to a neurodegenerative disease (type VI hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy; OMIM #614653;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrier et al., 2013</xref>), and its paralogue ACF7/MACF1 plays important roles during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goryunov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ka and Kim, 2015</xref>). Since ACF7 continues to be expressed in the brain, it is tempting to speculate that it might be required for neuronal maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernier et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Here we use <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, in culture and in vivo alike, to demonstrate novel roles of Tau in regulating the formation and maintenance of synapses during ageing, by coordinating the intracellular trafficking of synaptic proteins. Thus, we show that the role of Tau in synapse regulation occurs in functional overlap with Shot. The robust <italic>shot-tau</italic> double-mutant phenotypes enabled us to study the mechanistic cascade composed of three steps: microtubule stability as the trigger, the JNK signalling pathway as the mediator and kinesin-3 mediated axonal transport of synaptic proteins as the key effector. We propose a new mechanism based on the loss of Tau function which could explain intellectual disability in MAPT (the human tau gene) mutant individuals and precocious synapse loss in tau-related neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saxena and Caroni, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tau is required for the formation of synapses</title><p>To study synaptic roles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Tau, we first used primary <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons generated from <italic>tau</italic> mutant embryos. Primary fly neurons are genetically and experimentally highly amenable and provide robust cellular and subcellular readouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prokop et al., 2012</xref>). These cultures are also particularly suited for the study of embryonic lethal mutations since they allow the examination of neurons beyond the embryonic lethal stage. Already 8 hr in vitro (HIV), these neurons show transport of synaptic material in the growing axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2010</xref>) and after 2 days in vitro (DIV), they display functional presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Küppers-Munther et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Küppers et al., 2003</xref>) that can be reliably stained with antibodies against presynaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Notably, these analyses were performed on clearly polarised neurons with well developed axons to exclude indirect effects caused by defective axon growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Despite that, we found that the double-mutant neurons displayed reduced branch numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>). However, we could demonstrate that the lower number in branches is not the cause for synapse reduction by using knock-down experiments as well as rescue experiments (explained in detail below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, see also Discussion).</p><p>In further support of functional overlap, also our genetic interaction studies revealed a synapse reduction phenotype in <italic>shot<sup>3/+</sup> tau<sup>MR22/+</sup> </italic>double heterozygous mutant neurons (see later in Figure 5A). Finally, we performed cross-rescue experiments by expressing a <italic>shot</italic> transgene in <italic>tau<sup>MR22</sup></italic> mutant neurons and a <italic>tau</italic> transgene in <italic>shot<sup>3</sup></italic> mutant neurons. In both cases, Syt staining revealed a rescue of the synapse reduction phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that Shot and Tau functionally overlap, rather than act hierarchically in the same pathway.</p><p>Next, we investigated synaptic phenotypes in vivo. Since <italic>shot<sup>3</sup></italic> and <italic>tau<sup>MR22</sup></italic> animals are late embryonic lethal, we analysed them at late embryonic stage 16, when Syt is already confined to nascent synaptic terminals, as can be reliably imaged at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for a schematic drawing of the embryonic NMJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Littleton et al., 1993</xref>).

To test our hypothesis, we investigated the pattern of JNK activity, using an antibody against phosphorylated JNK (JNK-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langen et al., 2013</xref>).

This effort was essentially aided by our finding that Tau and Shot are functionally redundant, and the subsequent incorporation of Shot into our studies. The robust phenotypes of <italic>shot-tau</italic> double-mutant neurons enabled us to demonstrate roles of Shot-Tau during the formation and maintenance of pre-synaptic sites in axons, and unravel the underlying mechanistic cascade which involves three major steps. Firstly, the absence of Shot-Tau causes microtubule destabilisation. Secondly, this cytoskeletal stress causes aberrant JNK activity patterns with upregulation in somata and downregulation at axon tips. Thirdly, aberrant JNK activation leads to a somatic roadblock for kinesin-3 mediated transport, thus inhibiting the delivery of synaptic proteins and eventually causing synapse loss. Depending on whether the functions of Tau and/or Shot are removed during development or ageing, either the formation or the maintenance of synapses are affected, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Our model explaining the function of Tau and Shot in synapse establishment and maintenance by regulating intracellular transport, is supported by loss- and gain-of-function experiments, genetic interactions and cross-rescue experiments. The initial finding that <italic>shot-tau</italic> mutant neurons had reduced branch numbers, could have suggested that defects on synapse numbers is indirect. However, experiments with double knock-down in culture and in the adult brain clearly showed strong synapse reduction whilst maintaining normal branch patterns, and Unc-104 rescued synapse reduction in <italic>shot-tau</italic> mutant neurons without major increases of the branch pattern in these neurons. These results clearly demonstrate that changes in neuronal morphology are not the cause of changes in synapse number.</p><p>Notably, the synaptic function of Tau described here for <italic>Drosophila</italic> might be conserved in higher animals or humans, since also aged Tau knock-out mice develop a reduction of synaptic proteins from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications of our findings for Tau-related pathologies</title><p>Our findings provide potential new mechanistic explanations for various tau related brain disorders. For example, microdeletions in the region of MAPT (the human tau gene) cause intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sapir et al., 2012</xref>), and Tau's synapse-promoting roles m﻿ay well contribute to this pathology. Furthermore, various tauopathies are characterised by precocious pathological loss of synapses. Our data suggest that loss of tau could lead to defective synapse maintenance and eventually synapse loss. For example, a prominent group of dementias which lacks distinctive histopathology (DLDH) are characterised by the loss of Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhukareva et al., 2001</xref>). Further tauopathies including Alzheimer disease, typically involve hyper-phosphorylation and aggregate formation of Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hernández and Avila, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams, 2006</xref>). In this scenario, there are two parallel, non-exclusive modalities through which Tau can cause pathology. Firstly, detached hyper-phosphorylated tau attains gain-of-function roles in the cytoplasm damaging neurons through a number of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2013</xref>). Secondly, hyper-phosphorylation of tau causes a loss-of-function condition by depleting Tau from microtubules. However, since Tau knock-out mouse models mostly failed to show significant phenotypes and the neuronal functions of endogenous tau remain little understood, the pathological importance of Tau loss from microtubules has been marginalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morris et al., 2013</xref>). Our results now re-emphasise the notion that loss of Tau from microtubules could contribute to neurodegenerative pathology and deliver mechanistic explanations.</p><p>To unravel pathomechanisms caused by the loss of Tau, we mostly used combined depletion of Shot and Tau, which gave us strong phenotypes, ideal for short-term experimental approaches. However, we found similar, yet milder phenotypes if only Tau was depleted, suggesting that the mechanisms described here could well contribute to slow disease progression in tauopathies. Our discovery that spectraplakins are MAPs which functionally overlap with Tau, opens up new experimental avenues for Tau studies. So far, spectraplakins have been linked to the degeneration of sensory and autonomous neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edvardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrier et al., 2013</xref>), and it remains to be elucidated whether they may have similar roles also in the brain. Our results clearly hint at this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A novel mechanism for Tau-dependent regulation of neuronal transport</title><p>The loss of Tau and/or Shot inhibits kinesin-3 mediated transport leading to accumulation of synaptic proteins in the soma of neurons.

A likely mechanism causing a roadblock in intracellular transport could be the direct inactivation of Unc-104 or its associated adaptor proteins, for example through JNK or other kinases within its pathway. This mode of regulation has a clear precedent in kinesin-1 and its adaptor Jip which are directly phosphorylated by JNK leading to transport inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stagi et al., 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, our extensive attempts to co-immunoprecipitate JNK and Kinesin-3 were unsuccessful (data not shown), leaving open for now the exact molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>JNK is an important mediator between <italic>shot-tau</italic> induced microtubule stress and synapse loss</title><p>We propose that aberrant JNK activation downstream of microtubule destabilisation or stress is the ultimate cause for the defective delivery of synaptic proteins in Tau and/or Shot loss of function.

Our findings emphasise that Tau detachment from microtubules can be an important aspect contributing to the pathology of tauopathies in parallel to roles of hyper-phosphorylated Tau in the cytoplasm. Synaptic decay, axonal transport and alterations in the JNK pathway are emerging as central players in a wider range of adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, and here we have aligned these factors into a concrete mechanistic cascade.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The following fly stocks were used: the Gal4 driver lines <italic>sca-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>elav-Gal4</italic> (3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luo et al., 1994</xref>) and <italic>ato-Gal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zschätzsch et al., 2014</xref>); the mutant alleles <italic>Df(3R)tauMR22</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolkan and Kretzschmar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doerflinger et al., 2003</xref>), <italic>shot<sup>3</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolodziej et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>unc-104<sup>imac170</sup></italic> (courtesy of Dr. T.

Z-stacks of embryonic CNSs were taken with a Leica DM6000 B microscope and extracted with Leica MM AF Premier software. Z-stacks of adult fly brains were taken with a Leica DM6000 B microscope or with a 3i Marianas Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope. Using custom software written in Python and NumPy, fly brain images taken with a Leica DM6000 B microscope were individually band-pass filtered (A trous wavelet [1][2], linear 3x3 filter, keeping scales 1–4) to remove stationary background.</p><p>To quantify the number of synaptic densities in mature neurons in culture and the number of vesicles containing synaptic proteins in 8h neurons in culture, we used ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/scicrunch/Resources/record/nlx_144509-1/063e0149-a929-5fd5-8968-34dff7e4fd59/search">SCR_003070</ext-link>). In detail, we used thresholding to select synaptic densities from axons of single isolated cells, followed by particle analysis. For all experiments done in parallel, identical thresholds were used. For the quantification of synapses in mature neurons in culture, we selected polarised neurons with a clear distinguishable axon, the same neurons were used to study axon length and number of branches.</p><p>To quantify synaptic proteins or Unc-104 in the soma of neurons, we manually selected the area of the somata using the tubulin or HRP channel and measured the signal intensity derived from the Syt or Unc-104 channel. To measure the levels of Unc-104 at the tip of axons, we selected an area of the same size at the most distal part of axons and measured the signal intensity derived from the Unc-104 channel. To quantify synaptic proteins at the tip of embryonic motorneurons in vivo. we manually selected the area occupied by the growth cones using the FasII staining and measured the signal intensity derived from the Syt channel; the background intensity was subtracted. Images used for these measurements did not contain saturated levels. Also, to measure the number of synaptic densities in DC neurons in the medulla of the adult brain, we used thresholding to select synaptic densities followed by particle analysis. The number of branches in the medulla per DC neuron was quantified manually. To quantify MT stability upon nocodazole treatment, we counted the number of breaks in the microtubule bundle per axon.</p><p>Time lapse imaging of cultured primary neurons (in Schneider's/FCS) was performed on a Delta Vision RT (Applied Precision) restoration microscope using a 100x/1.3 Ph3 Uplan Fl objective and the Sedat filter set (Chroma 89000). The images were collected using a Coolsnap HQ (Photometrics) camera. The temperature control was set to 26°C. For time lapse recording, images were taken every 2 s for 2 min. To generate transport measurements, vesicles containing fluorescently tagged Syt were tracked manually using the manual tracking plugin for ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics, replicates and sample-size</title><p>All data are shown as mean with SEM.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tau and spectraplakins promote synapse formation and maintenance through JNK and neuronal trafficking&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sean Sweeney (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Voelzmann et al. provide a compelling set of data that gives a deep insight into tau function with regard to axon traffic with development and age, by pinpointing a redundancy with short-stop/spectraplakin, and a pathway with kinesin-3/immaculate-connections. They use an elegant series of experiments involving primary culture, in vivo experiments, genetics, pharmacology, ageing and live imaging to demonstrate this. As the discussion states, this data has profound implications for our understanding of tau function in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Yet, the authors try to cover a large area for which they need to support numerous potential causalities.</p><p>While the overall idea is strong, there are numerous open ends and insufficiently supported statements in this manuscript to support the cascade-like chain of causalities presented here.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The abstract and introduction might be toned down a little and move away from the idea of 'homeostasis'. This term has become all things to all folks, and 'synaptic maintenance' or similar phrasing could be used. The authors should take time within the results to explain the experimental system – i.e. the tau mutants are lethal, and the primary culture allows examination of neurons beyond this lethal stage. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we would suggest including, or referring to the later figure where double heterozygotes of shot/tau give significant data – this more directly alludes to the pathway, rather than two loss-of-function mutants making a defective phenotype worse (But see below on this). They also refer often to 'synapses' when a more precise description of (something like) 'materially deficient' synapses would be useful. In general it will be useful to make the statements precise and clear. The diagrammatic explanations of the experimental system are beautifully clear, as are the images presented.</p><p>The strongest experiments in the paper are the rescue of tau, shot mutants through unc104 overexpression and through JNK attenuation. However, in these cases, only selective read-outs are used (for example, we do not learn whether JNK attenuation affects unc104, as predicted by the model). Sometimes read-outs focus on syt punctae, sometimes brp, n-syb and different ages in culture or in vivo. Different read-outs in different experiments make comparisons more difficult. A principal concern arising from the presentation of selective read-outs is the specificity of the phenotypes. Defective syt puncta (the most commonly used read-out in the paper) can arise directly and indirectly from numerous causes. Just because they become more when there is more kinesin does not mean that the function of tau and shot is truly rescued. I am wondering what these neurons look like, what other markers look like and what aspects of neuronal function and maintenance are truly 'rescued' with unc104 overexpression compared to the microtubule-stabilizing drug compared to JNK signaling attenuation. Finally, a key issue is the lack of simple genetic rescue experiments. The authors only provide one tau rescue experiments at the beginning of the paper. The shot mutant is never rescued by a shot transgene.</p><p>In sum, while we find the paper compelling and interesting substantial revisions are required and should be done within the two month period required by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Required experiments:</p><p>1) Rescue of shot, rescue attempt of tau with shot and rescue attempt of shot with tau. Only these experiment reveal functional overlap. We do not think the rescue of the double mutant with either tau or shot is as meaningful, because the double mutant clearly gets worse than any single and any single rescue in that background would make it better, without revealing functional overlap of the two proteins.</p><p>2) Morphology of the neurons throughout, in mutants and rescues, to show to what extent syt puncta counts are a consequence of more severe neuronal defects.</p><p>3) Further regarding the specificity issue: Please see the reference in the review below to how the original unc104 paper made its point on specificity (mitochondria, HRP, fasII, mCD8, – subset of these). The key is whether this is a defect specific to synaptic proteins as proposed or a general transport or even health problem of these neurons.</p><p>4) The authors should use UNC-104 as a readout in the rescues and throughout for mutants presented. JNK-P is also key as presented by the authors.</p><p>5) The pharmacological experiments require some level of meaningful rescue as well: epothilone B rescuing JNK-P.</p><p>Important points that should be addressed:</p><p>1) RNAi experiments The authors present no phenotypes after 18 DIV using RNAi, but then at 26DIV -- again only Syt punctae as read-out – what is the overall morphology of these neurons. It is unclear what is happening to these cells from pictures. ato-RNAi has similar problems – in both cases it is unclear when neurons are actually running out of protein, and it is unclear whether there is a developmental defect or no rescue… These 'delay experiment' does not allow to conclude 'not only required for development, but also maintenance'.</p><p>2) kinesin and drug experiments. The kinesin (unc104) overexpression rescue of the shot, tau double mutant is a strong experiment. The authors show rescue of syt puncta at 2 DIV. As above, we are not sure what the overall morphology and issues of these cells are. Are these really fully rescued neurons? Unfortunately there is no in vivo experiment in this case. How about brp? Does it also rescue the 'aging/maintenance' issues?</p><p>The authors find that the microtubule-stabilizing drug epothilone B also provides a significant rescue of Syt 'intensity' in cultured neurons at DIV 2. Like the puncta graphs, everything is normalized to 100 in the graph (6E), but apparently now intensity and not numbers of puncta are compared? Why? Next the authors produce microtubule stress with nocodazole and report active JNK redistribution similar to the tau, shot double mutant and conclude that microtubule stress is the underlying cause. The key test of this idea would be epothilone B treatment to reduce microtubule stress and show that JNK-P is normalized, but unfortunately this experiment is missing.</p><p>3) JNK experiments</p><p>The attenuation of the JNK pathway itself as a partial rescue of the tau, shot double mutant is again a strong experiment. However, again the selective read-outs and different experimental approaches make it difficult to come to a straight-forward conclusion. For example, in the brain the authors use a DN for bsk to attenuate JNK signaling, but the same method is not used for comparison for the syt count experiments in DIV 2 neurons. Why is n-syb used as a read-out at the end of the paper for the first time? Furthermore, there is no information how either of the JNK attenuation approaches affects Unc104 localization and function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14694.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The abstract and introduction might be toned down a little and move away from the idea of 'homeostasis'.

When discussing the issue of redundancy, we now refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and indicate that double-heterozygotes give significant reduction in synapses supporting the idea that tau and shot function in the same pathway. As further proof of redundancy, we are now including cross-rescue experiments between tau and shot (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).</p><p><italic>The most widely used method to count presynaptic sites in Drosophila is to stain them with specific antibodies against presynaptic proteins. Accordingly, a reduction in the number of Syt- or Brp-stained puncta is commonly interpreted as reduction in the number of presynaptic sites. We used this strategy with both synaptic markers in the first part of the manuscript in order to characterise the phenotypes. For the rest of the paper we mostly focused on Syt which has been used previously to quantify presynaptic sites (see as an example Wan et al., Neuron, 2000; Liu et al., The Journal of Neuroscience 2010; Franciscovich et al., Genetics 2008 and Rieckhof et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2003). We have introduced a description of the phenotype, which is more precise: “[…]tau-deficient primary neurons contain fewer Brp and Syt positive presynaptic specialisations. In the following, we will refer to this phenotype as “synapse reduction”. We find that exchanging the term synapses by materially deficient synapses across the text would make the reading of the paper unnecessary complicated.</italic> </p><p><italic>The strongest experiments in the paper are the rescue of tau, shot mutants through unc104 overexpression and through JNK attenuation. However, in these cases, only selective read-outs are used (for example, we do not learn whether JNK attenuation affects unc104, as predicted by the model).</italic></p><p>We performed new experiments both in culture and in embryos for the rescue of tau-shot mutants through JNK attenuation and stained for unc104. As the model predicts, we find that the aberrant localisation of unc104 in the somas is rescued upon JNK attenuation, and we demonstrate this both in vivo and in vitro. These data are now discussed in the results part and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8 —figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Sometimes read-outs focus on syt punctae, sometimes brp, n-syb and different ages in culture or</italic> in vivo<italic>. Different read-outs in different experiments make comparisons more difficult.</italic> </p><p>At the beginning of the results part we look at both Syt and Brp punctae in the single and double <italic>tau-shot</italic> mutant neurons to demonstrate that several presynaptic proteins are affected. Subsequently, we consistently focus on Syt and, in some instances n-Syb is used for technical reasons (see below). We have made sure that in the text, the use of readouts and stages are clearly indicated.</p><p><italic>A principal concern arising from the presentation of selective read-outs is the specificity of the phenotypes. Defective syt puncta (the most commonly used read-out in the paper) can arise directly and indirectly from numerous causes. Just because they become more when there is more kinesin does not mean that the function of tau and shot is truly rescued.</italic> </p><p>We provide many data that point to the involvement of kinesin-3 and defective transport in this synaptic function. These indications include the defects in transport, the defective localisation of Unc-104 in <italic>shot-tau</italic> mutant neurons, the genetic interactions between <italic>tau</italic>, <italic>shot</italic> and <italic>unc-104</italic> and the Unc-104 rescue experiments. These experiments support our model that diminished function of Unc-104 in axons is the cause for the synaptic defects and that synaptic defects are not the consequence of general ill health of neurons. We can also rule out that defective Syt puncta is an indirect consequence of defects in axonal length and number of branches of cultured neurons since our new analyses of morphological parameters show no correlation between synaptic phenotypes and change in morphology (see also the new passage in the Discussion).</p><p>As for the ability of kinesin-3 to truly rescue the function of Tau and Shot, we only claim that kinesin-3 rescues the synaptic phenotypes in double mutant neurons. Tau and Shot are microtubule regulators and regulate other aspects of neuronal physiology and morphology, which are independent of kinesin-3.</p><p><italic>I am wondering what these neurons look like, what other markers look like and what aspects of neuronal function and maintenance are truly 'rescued' with unc104 overexpression compared to the microtubule-stabilizing drug compared to JNK signaling attenuation.</italic></p><p>These data are now provided under &quot;Required experiments&quot; below.</p><p><italic>Finally, a key issue is the lack of simple genetic rescue experiments.

We found a very good rescue of the synaptic phenotypes with <italic>shot</italic> rescue in <italic>tau</italic> mutants, <italic>shot</italic> rescue in <italic>shot</italic> mutants and <italic>tau</italic> rescue in <italic>shot</italic> mutants, further confirming our hypothesis of functional overlap between these proteins. These results are now incorporated in the text and the data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>We do not think the rescue of the double mutant with either tau or shot is as meaningful, because the double mutant clearly gets worse than any single and any single rescue in that background would make it better, without revealing functional overlap of the two proteins.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) Morphology of the neurons throughout, in mutants and rescues, to show to what extent syt puncta counts are a consequence of more severe neuronal defects.</italic> </p><p>We incorporated the analysis of axonal length and number of branches of cultured neurons. We find that in the double mutant condition, the length of axons is not significantly affected but the number of branches is reduced. We performed similar analysis for the tau-shot RNAi experiments at 3, 18 and 26 DVI. In none of the time points we observed changes in axonal length nor in branch number of tau-shot RNAi neurons when compared to control neurons. This data clearly indicates that the synaptic phenotype occurs independently of the branching phenotype.</p><p>We further quantified axonal length and branch number in the rescues of <italic>tau-shot</italic> with unc104 overexpression and JNK attenuation. We find that axonal length is slightly reduced in both conditions and the number of branches remains significantly reduced in the unc104 rescues but is rescued upon JNK attenuation. Therefore, there is clearly no correlation between morphological changes and changes in synapse number. These data are explained in the results and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Further regarding the specificity issue: Please see the reference in the review below to how the original unc104 paper made its point on specificity (mitochondria, HRP, fasII, mCD8, – subset of these). The key is whether this is a defect specific to synaptic proteins as proposed or a general transport or even health problem of these neurons.</italic> </p><p>Since we can successfully rescue the synaptic phenotype at the various levels of the pathological pathway (and find no correlation with morphological changes affected differently in these rescues; see previous point), we are confident that the synaptic defects we observe are dependent on and specific for the pathway we describe and not the indirect consequence of general cellular decay. As discussed above, Tau and Shot are microtubule regulators and, as such, regulate other aspects of neuronal physiology and morphology. Accordingly, we do not claim at any point that Tau and Shot function exclusively regulates the transport of synaptic proteins.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should use UNC-104 as a readout in the rescues and throughout for mutants presented. JNK-P is also key as presented by the authors.</italic> </p><p>We did new rescue experiments and tested the localisation of unc104. Both in vivo and in vitro, the aberrant localisation of unc104 in the somas is rescued upon JNK attenuation, as is consistent with our model. These data are now discussed in the results part and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> S1 and S2. As for JNK-P we also confirmed that epothilone B rescues the localisation of JNK-Pin <italic>tau-shot</italic> i.e. it increases the localisation of JNK-P at axonal tips and reduces the aberrant localisation is somas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The pharmacological experiments require some level of meaningful rescue as well: epothilone B rescuing JNK-P.</italic> </p><p>This experiment has been performed successfully.</p><p><italic>Important points that should be addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>1) RNAi experiments The authors present no phenotypes after 18 DIV using RNAi, but then at 26DIV -- again only Syt punctae as read-out – what is the overall morphology of these neurons. It is unclear what is happening to these cells from pictures. ato-RNAi has similar problems – in both cases it is unclear when neurons are actually running out of protein, and it is unclear whether there is a developmental defect or no rescue… These 'delay experiment' does not allow to conclude 'not only required for development, but also maintenance'.</italic> </p><p>Detailed morphological data for RNAi experiments in cell culture have been added. In summary, at any of the time points: 3, 18 and 26 DVI we observed changes in axonal length nor in branch number of tau-shot RNAi neurons. For the ato-RNAi we use independent readouts to assess the number of axonal branches and find that precocious synapse decay is not due to axonal loss or to changes in branch patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E-F</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer wonders when neurons are actually running out of protein.To clarify this, we performed experiments in primary neuronal cultures with RNAi for <italic>tau</italic> and <italic>shot</italic> and stained with anti-Shot and anti-Tau at 3 DIV and 25 DVI. We find that at 3 DIV the intensity of anti-Shot is unchanged when compared to controls. By 25 DIV the intensity of anti-Shot is down to at least 50% when considering background levels in staining that are suggested by parallel controls with null mutant neurons. As for Tau, the intensity of anti-Tau is lower than controls at 3 DIV and it continues to decrease significantly between 3 and 25 days. These results support that this strategy takes out Tau and Shot functions with some delay, overcoming developmental functions (i.e. pre-synaptic sites can be properly established as well as axonal branches). These data can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) kinesin and drug experiments. The kinesin (unc104) overexpression rescue of the shot, tau double mutant is a strong experiment. The authors show rescue of syt puncta at 2 DIV. As above, we are not sure what the overall morphology and issues of these cells are. Are these really fully rescued neurons? Unfortunately there is no</italic> in vivo <italic>experiment in this case. How about brp? Does it also rescue the 'aging/maintenance' issues?</italic></p><p>The outcome of our morphology studies of Unc104 rescue was described above and suggests that Unc104 only fully rescues the transport-related, synaptic phenotypes of the <italic>tau-shot</italic> double mutant neurons (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The involvement of Unc104 is supported by rescue experiments but is further supported by transport assays, genetic interaction between <italic>tau-shot</italic> and <italic>unc104</italic> and the substantial changes in the localisation of Unc104 (as described already in the first manuscript version).</p><p>As for the aging/maintenance issue, we now also provide unc104 brain rescues of aging/maintenance phenotypes induced by tau-shot RNAi in vivo (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Concerning BRP, it has been previously demonstrated that Syt and BRP are both transported by unc-104, therefore it is expected that defects in Unc104 function will affect both synaptic proteins (Pack-Chung et al., 2007). To repeat the unc-104 rescues using BRP will take more than 2 months since the fly stocks need to be re-established. We feel that the advance provided by such data is not sufficient to justify the time investment.</p><p><italic>The authors find that the microtubule-stabilizing drug epothilone B also provides a significant rescue of Syt 'intensity' in cultured neurons at DIV 2. Like the puncta graphs, everything is normalized to 100 in the graph (6E), but apparently now intensity and not numbers of puncta are compared? Why?</italic> </p><p>The experiments with epothilone B are not performed in cultured neurons but in embryonic motoraxons. The terminal of these axons at this developmental stage is very narrow and small; it is not possible to quantify separated puncta. To overcome this caveat, we quantified the intensity of synaptotagmin staining as we did similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p><italic>Next the authors produce microtubule stress with nocodazole and report active JNK redistribution similar to the tau, shot double mutant and conclude that microtubule stress is the underlying cause. The key test of this idea would be epothilone B treatment to reduce microtubule stress and show that JNK-P is normalized, but unfortunately this experiment is missing.</italic> </p><p>We now show that epothilone B treatment normalises JNK-P, these data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) JNK experiments</italic> </p><p><italic>The attenuation of the JNK pathway itself as a partial rescue of the tau, shot double mutant is again a strong experiment. However, again the selective read-outs and different experimental approaches make it difficult to come to a straight-forward conclusion. For example, in the brain the authors use a DN for bsk to attenuate JNK signaling, but the same method is not used for comparison for the syt count experiments in DIV 2 neurons. Why is n-syb used as a read-out at the end of the paper for the first time?</italic></p><p>The JNK pathway can be attenuated in different ways, for example using mutations in <italic>wnd</italic>, expressing UAS-puc and Uas-bsk-DN. All these methods have been frequently used by others and are widely accepted. Our choice of method was for technical reasons. For culture studies, the <italic>wnd</italic> mutation and UAS-puc could be easier combined with the <italic>tau-shot</italic> mutant chromosome. For in vivo studies in the adult brain, the X-chromosomal Uas-bskDN was easier to combine with the existing Uas-tau-RNAi, Uas-shot-RNAi, ato-Gal4 and Uas-nSyb fly lines. Similarly, for technical reasons, we used nSyb instead of Syt in a few experiments in the adult brain. The reduction in nSyb we observed can be taken as a further confirmation for the phenotype described for Syt and is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that nSyb is also transported by Unc-104 (Pack-Chung et al., 2007).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, there is no information how either of the JNK attenuation approaches affects Unc104 localization and function.</italic> </p><p>We performed new experiments showing that JNK attenuation restores Unc104 to normal distribution patterns. We present these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
