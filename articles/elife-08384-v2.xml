However, the relationship between its two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, and the extent to which they are functionally distinct, remain uncertain. Using mouse models of paralog deficiency, we demonstrate that they are not equivalent for CD4<sup>+</sup> 'helper' T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Instead, we find that STAT5B is dominant for both effector and regulatory (Treg) responses and, therefore, uniquely necessary for immunological tolerance. Comparative analysis of genomic distribution and transcriptomic output confirm that STAT5B has fargreater impact but, surprisingly, the data point towards asymmetric expression (i.e. paralog dose), rather than distinct functional properties, as the key distinguishing feature. Thus, we propose a quantitative model of STAT5 paralog activity whereby relative abundance imposes functional specificity (or dominance) in the face of widespread structural homology.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08384.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08384.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08384.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system in mammals is one of the most complex networks in the animal kingdom. One way that its many components communicate is via proteins called cytokines, which are released by cells and detected by receptors on the surface of other cells. This leads to the activation of signals inside the responding cells that alter the activity of genes and, ultimately, direct how they behave.</p><p>STAT5 is a signal protein that is activated when certain cytokines bind to receptors on the cell surface. Consequently, it is an attractive target for drug therapies that seek to alter immune responses and there is keen interest in understanding how it works. It is an unusual protein in that there are two versions – termed STAT5A and STAT5B – that are produced by two separate genes. Together, STAT5A and STAT5B are fundamental to the immune system but there is considerable debate about whether they perform the same job or have distinct roles.</p><p>Villarino et al. used a combination of genetic and genomic approaches to investigate how both versions of STAT5 work in mice. The experiments show that STAT5B plays a much bigger role in immune cells than STAT5A. Unexpectedly, the experiments indicate that the disparity is not due to differences in protein activity, but is caused by differences in the amount of these proteins in cells.</p><p>Villarino et al.’s findings resolve longstanding questions about the relationship between STAT5A and STAT5B within the immune system. A logical next step is to find the molecular mechanisms responsible for causing different amounts of STAT5A and STAT5B to be produced in immune cells. Future work will also compare the roles of STAT5A and STAT5B in non-immune cells and explore whether it might be possible to develop therapies that specifically target one version and not the other.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08384.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08384.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>STAT5</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>STAT signaling</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villarino</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name><name><surname>Laurence</surname><given-names>Arian</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Gertraud W</given-names></name><name><surname>Bonelli</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Dema</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Afzali</surname><given-names>Behdad</given-names></name><name><surname>Shih</surname><given-names>Han-Yu</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Hong-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hennighausen</surname><given-names>Lothar</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanno</surname><given-names>Yuka</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Asymmetrical expression dictates functional dominance of one STAT5 paralog at cellular and tissue levels despite redundancy at molecular and genomic levels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family proteins are an evolutionarily conserved set of transcription factors, which operate downstream of cytokine and hormone receptors to convert extracellular stimuli into biochemical signals that instruct gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Villarino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stark and Darnell, 2012</xref>). In mammals, STAT5 is unique because it is encoded by two genes, termed <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic>, derived from a relatively recent duplication event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang and Levy, 2012</xref>). In fact, the ancestral STAT5 gene appears to have duplicated on two separate occasions during vertebrate evolution. Once in teleosts, resulting in two paralogs on different chromosomes, and again in eutherians, resulting in the two contiguous mammalian paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liongue et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Because of their recent divergence, STAT5A and STAT5B are homologous at the DNA, RNA and protein levels, which has led to persisting questions about whether they are redundant or functionally distinct. Genetically engineered mice lacking <italic>Stat5a</italic> or <italic>Stat5b</italic> have provided compelling evidence for both arguments. On one hand, there are phenotypic differences; <italic>Stat5a</italic>-deficient mice exhibit poor mammary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 1997</xref>), reduced hematopoietic stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>) and diminished antibody class switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagami et al., 2000</xref>), while <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice exhibit dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Udy et al., 1997</xref>), more pronounced lymphopenia, and greater defects in cytokine-driven lymphocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moriggl et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Imada et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, deletion of <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> has comparable effects on some physiological processes, such as eosinophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagami et al., 2000</xref>), and the most dramatic phenotypes, such as infertility, anemia and perinatal lethality, are evident only in mice lacking both paralogs, which implies redundancy and/or cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teglund et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Socolovsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2004</xref>). Genome-wide DNA-binding profiles also support both viewpoints. The target repertoires for STAT5A and STAT5B mostly overlap, which implies redundancy, but there are also a subset of sites that may be differentially bound, which implies specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanai et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the latter point, humans with germline mutations in <italic>STAT5B</italic> exhibit a range of clinical abnormalities, indicating that <italic>STAT5A</italic> cannot compensate for some vital functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Compound STAT5 deficiency manifests striking immunological abnormalities in mice, most notably lymphopenia, splenomegaly and autoimmunity. These are typically attributed to its role downstream of the common gamma chain (ɣc) receptor and its dedicated Janus kinase, Jak3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moriggl et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Snow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yao et al., 2006</xref>). The ɣc is shared by 6 different cytokines, IL-2 IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, each of which employs a unique co-receptor subunit that determines which cell types can respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rochman et al., 2009</xref>). ɣc cytokines impact all lymphocytes but have been most extensively studied in CD4<sup>+</sup> 'helper' T cells, the key orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Among the many functions ascribed to the ɣc-STAT5 axis in this lineage are the ability to promote Th1- and Th2-type effector responses, to support T cell memory, to promote activation-induced cell death, to suppress Th17-type and T follicular helper cell (Tfh) responses, and to promote T regulatory cell (Treg) responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moriggl et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dooms et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kagami et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lenardo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballesteros-Tato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahmud et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To assess redundancy between STAT5 paralogs, we developed a mouse model where STAT5A and/or STAT5B were reduced but not absent, allowing us to compare their respective functions while avoiding the confounding lymphopenia associated with complete STAT5 deficiency. These studies reveal STAT5B as the dominant paralog in helper T cells; exhibiting far greater impact on pathogenic effector and host-protective regulatory responses and, therefore, uniquely required for immunological tolerance. Surprisingly, genome-wide DNA binding and transcriptome surveys did not uncover widespread differences in target gene selection but, instead, point towards relative abundance as the key distinguishing factor. Thus, we propose that asymmetric expression (i.e. paralog dose), rather than differential function, determines the dominant STAT5 paralog in lymphoid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A dominant role for STAT5B in immunological tolerance</title><p>To investigate the relationship between STAT5A and STAT5B, we generated a series of mice with pre-determined combinations of <italic>Stat5</italic> alleles, ranging from two alleles each of A and B (4 total) to one allele of either A or B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>). We refer to each genotype according to the total number of <italic>Stat5</italic> alleles that are retained.

All 8 genotypes were born at the expected Mendelian ratios and survived beyond 6 months of age, thereby demonstrating that a single allele of either paralog is sufficient to prevent the perinatal lethality seen in STAT5-null mice (<bold>Data not shown</bold>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoelbl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2004</xref>).

Next, we used statistical variance to identify differentially expressed genes. Surprisingly, we found widespread discord between <italic>Stat5a</italic>- and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells; many transcripts appeared dysregulated in the absence of one paralog or the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). However, upon close inspection, we concluded that this disparity was largely due to the arbitrary fold-change cutoff that was used. Most genes that were designated as STAT5B-specific were also affected by the loss of STAT5A (and vice versa), albeit to a lesser degree that did not reach our 2-fold threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To avoid this statistical artifact, we devised a ‘paralog preference’ scale whereby all STAT5-sensitive genes were compiled and ranked according to how much they were impacted by the loss of <italic>Stat5a</italic> or <italic>Stat5b</italic>. This analysis revealed a binomial distribution for all experimental conditions. The majority of genes were in central bins, affected by both STAT5A and STAT5B, while membership in peripheral bins decreased steadily as paralog preference increased. Importantly, all curves were shifted towards STAT5B, suggesting that STAT5-sensitive genes are generally more impacted by STAT5B than STAT5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This latter trend was also evident at the protein level; IL-2-driven (but not IL-6-driven) induction of IL-2Rα was clearly more diminished in <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells than in <italic>Stat5a</italic>-deficient counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Collectively, these data affirm that STAT5B is dominant over STAT5A while, at the same time, demonstrating pervasive redundancy at the level of gene transcription.</p><p>Beyond quantitative differences, our transcriptomic survey also revealed qualitative differences between <italic>Stat5a</italic>- and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells. Using strict analysis criteria, we discovered that between 12% and 22% of all STAT5-sensitive genes can be classified as paralog-specific, meaning that they are solely dependent on either STAT5A or STAT5B. The absolute number of paralog-specific genes varied across cell states and stimuli, with the largest allotment found in IL-7-treated naive cells, and was typically skewed towards STAT5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, we can create 2 general categories: ‘pan-STAT5' genes that are regulated by both STAT5A and STAT5B (e.g. <italic>Pdk1, Cish, Lta</italic>) and 'paralog-specific' genes that are regulated by either STAT5A (e.g. <italic>Smc6</italic>) or STAT5B (e.g. <italic>Cd74</italic>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that pan-STAT5 genes are much more numerous, we propose that phenotypic differences between <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> deficient T cells are due largely to paralog preference, owing to the fact that deletion of <italic>Stat5b</italic> has greater quantitative impact, with limited contribution from qualitative, paralog-specific effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Paralog dose dictates genome-wide distribution of STAT5</title><p>Functional divergence between STAT5A and STAT5B could be due to differences in target gene selection.

To explore this possibility, we mined various transcriptome datasets (including our own) and confimed that, indeed, <italic>Stat5b</italic> is more abundant than <italic>Stat5a</italic> at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we used flow cytometry to measure total STAT5 protein in naive, regulatory (Treg), follicular (Tfh) and effector/memory T cells. Regardless of cellular subset, the results were clear: removing one-allele of <italic>Stat5b</italic> (<italic>Stat5a<sup>+/+</sup> Stat5b<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) had greater impact than removing one-allele of <italic>Stat5a</italic> (<italic>Stat5a<sup>+/+</sup> Stat5b<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) while, at the other end of the spectrum, retaining one-allele of <italic>Stat5b</italic> (<italic>Stat5a<sup>-/-</sup> Stat5b<sup>+/-</sup></italic>) than retaining one-allele of <italic>Stat5a</italic> (<italic>Stat5a<sup>+/-</sup> Stat5b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). A similar trend was observed for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 dowsntream of IL-2 or IL-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that STATB makes a greater contribution to the total STAT5 protein pool.</p><p>To determine how STAT5 availability (i.e. paralog dose) influences gene expression, we transduced <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient T cells with a STAT5A-expressing retrovirus, thereby increasing the total amount of STAT5 without re-introducing STAT5B. We first validated the system by measuring <italic>Il2ra</italic>, a well-documented STAT5 target, and found it to be highly induced at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that, overall, ectopic STAT5A mobilized 320 genes, most of which fall within the pan-STAT5 category (e.g. <italic>Cish, Lta</italic>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–B</xref>). Applied to our paralog preference scale, these genes did not favor STAT5A, meaning that they were similarly affected in <italic>Stat5a</italic>- and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), and GSEA revealed a high degree of enrichment for both STAT5A- or STAT5B-dependent gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Thus, our data support the idea that differences in STAT5 protein concentrations underlie many (if not most) of the transcriptomic divergence between <italic>Stat5a</italic>- and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells.</p><p>Having established that ectopic STAT5A can rescue gene expression in <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient T cells, we next asked whether it can rescue cellular differentiation. For these studies, naive T cells from wild type, <italic>Stat5a/b<sup>het</sup></italic> or one-allele <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice were cultured under iTreg polarizing conditions, transduced with either control or STAT5A retrovirus and FOXP3 measured to assess lineage commitment. As expected, FOXP3 was reduced in control-transduced <italic>Stat5a/b<sup>het</sup></italic> cells and almost completely abolished in control-transduced <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). However, when ectopic STAT5A was introduced, the percentage of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells became comparable across all genotypes and, whether endogenous (top row) or ectopic (bottom row), there was a clear linear correlation between STAT5 and FOXP3 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). IL-2Rαwas also diminished in both <italic>Stat5a/b<sup>het</sup></italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficients cells, and was restored by ectopic STAT5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). These data argue that a threshold concentration of STAT5 must be reached to institute the Treg program and, given the conspicuous effect of ectopic STAT5A on WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), they imply that STAT5 is a limiting resource for this process.</p><p>Although they share a common instructive cytokine (TGF-β), Th17 cells and Treg cells have opposing pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. STAT5 is key to this divergence - it promotes Treg responses at the expense of Th17 responses – so we next investigated the effect of paralog dose on Th17 differentiation. We found that the percentage of IL-17+ cells was 4-fold higher in <italic>Stat5a/b<sup>het</sup></italic> Th17 cultures and &gt;25-fold higher in <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient Th17 cultures than in WT controls, consistent with a high paralog dose threshold, and most importantly, that ectopic STAT5 not only extinguished IL-17 but also induced FOXP3 in all genotypes, thereby demonstrating that changes in STAT5 concentration can tip the balance between effector and regulatory T cells programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the importance of STAT5 is widely recognized, there is no consensus on whether its closely related paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, are redundant or functionally distinct. Assuming the latter, it is also unclear how specificity can be achieved given their extensive structural homology. Both positions are grounded in sound experimental evidence but, until the present studies, there has been no comprehensive inquiry on their relationship in immune cells. We addressed this longstanding question in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cells, the principal orchestrators of adaptive immunity. Using a combination of genetic and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that STAT5B is dominant over STAT5A and, thus, plays a non-redundant role in controlling effector and regulatory T cell responses. This conclusion is based on phenotypic differences between <italic>Stat5a</italic>- and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice, as well as bioinformatic analyses showing that STAT5B has greater impact on both selection and transcription of STAT5 target genes. The disparity does not appear to be due to differences in genome wide distribution or transcriptional capacity but, instead, relates to differences in relative abundance. Consistent with the latter point, our loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that a threshold concentration of STAT5 must be reached to execute STAT5-dependent gene expression and differentiation programs. Based on these findings, we submit that STAT5A and STAT5B are largely redundant at the molecular level, but not at the cellular or organismal levels, where STAT5B is dominant.</p><p>It has been proposed that the target repertoires of STAT5A and STAT5B vary due to subtle differences in their DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boucheron et al., 1998</xref>). However, this notion has been disputed because the nature and location of the amino acid substitutions may not alter protein structure enough to impact specificity. In addition, multiple studies have shown that the consensus DNA-binding motifs for STAT5A and STAT5B are identical, although it should be noted that these measured optimal binding to synthetic oligonucleotides in cell free systems, leaving open the possibility that divergent binding properties become apparent only at lower affinity sites or in the context of native chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Soldaini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ehret et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, differential binding of STAT5A or STAT5B has been detected at several loci in primary immune cells but it remains unclear whether this reflects <italic>bonafide</italic> differences in specificity or other factors that may influence target gene selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanai et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, it is known that STAT5A and STAT5B can exhibit distinct phosphorylation patterns, so preferential binding may reflect cell type- or stimulus-specific differences in activation rather than distinct targeting capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldenhoven et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinke et al., 1996</xref>).

The idea that STAT5 concentration can impact cellular function also has precedent. Of particular interest are studies reporting severe immunological phenotypes in transgenic mice which over-express STAT5A or STAT5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelly et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelly et al., 2003b</xref>), and studies showing that <italic>Stat5a/b</italic> haplo-insufficiency ameliorates contact hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nivarthi et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we have previously demonstrated that ectopic STAT5A can expand the target repertoire of STAT5 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>), and have explored the concept of STAT5 gene dosage in the context of mammary development, finding that a high STAT5 threshold must be reached for mammary epithelial cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>). Given that STAT5A is the dominant paralog in mammary epithelium, we can infer that asymmetric expression of STAT5 paralogs is not just a feature of immune cells, and that it must be controlled in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Metser et al., 2016</xref>). Several mechanisms may explain this phenomenon. First, it is known that <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> are transcribed from opposite DNA strands and, thus, may be subject to strand-specific modes of regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, differential transcription could be achieved through paralog-specific enhancer elements whose accessibility is tissue- and/or cell type-restricted. We have recently characterized an intergenic enhancer that drives expression of <italic>Stat5a</italic> in mammary epithelium and have identified multiple DNase hypersensitivity sites within the <italic>Stat5b</italic> locus that are present in T cells but not in non-lymphoid tissues, perhaps indicating an analogous mechanism for immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Metser et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>). Third, paralog-specific epigenetic modifications, such as histone or DNA methylation, may impose distinct transcriptional outputs, as shown for tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Fourth, the 3’ UTRs of <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> are highly divergent so it is possible that their mRNAs are subject to post-transcriptional regulation via distinct sets of microRNAs and/or RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Beyond asserting the dominance of STAT5B, our work also affirms the importance of STAT5A. Several observations support this latter point: 1) deletion of one <italic>Stat5a</italic> allele exaggerates the gross and cellular phenotypes of <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice, 2) transcription of STAT5 target genes is typically influenced by both STAT5A or STAT5B, and 3) ectopic STAT5A can rescue gene expression in <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells. Furthermore, just one-allele of either <italic>Stat5a</italic> or <italic>Stat5b</italic> is sufficient to prevent the perinatal lethality and anemia seen in STAT5-null mice, suggesting that molecular redundancy protects the most critical ‘life-and-death’ functions. We also identified a small subset of genes that appear to be regulated by either STAT5A or STAT5B, some of which have known immunological functions. Given that STAT5B is more abundant, it can be argued that all STAT5B-dependency may be due to a high paralog dose threshold, but this cannot explain the appearance of STAT5A-dependent genes. Thus, we propose that phenotypic differences between <italic>Stat5a</italic>- and <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient T cells result from widespread ‘paralog preference’ and circumscribed 'paralog specificity'.</p><p>Our ChIP-seq studies indicate that the overall availability of STAT5, whether STAT5A or STAT5B, has profound influence on target gene selection. Previous studies have compared genomic distribution of STAT5A and STAT5B in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and found that they mostly overlap, thereby supporting the idea of redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanai et al., 2014</xref>). However, they also identified a subset of sites that are occupied by one paralog or the other and, thus, have been taken as evidence for paralog specificity. All such comparisons (including ours) should be interpreted with care. Shared sites can be appointed with confidence but, due to technical confounders (e.g. differences in antibody affinity), incongruent sites cannot be definitively classified as STAT5A- or STAT5B-specific. The mechanisms underlying differential binding must also be considered. It is possible that <italic>bona fide</italic> paralog-specific binding sites do exist, but these are probably only a minor fraction. In most cases, differential binding likely reflects competition; the more abundant paralog is more likely to be detected. Given this nuance, claims that certain genes are uniquely regulated by STAT5A or STAT5B should be tempered. For instance, it has been suggested that <italic>Bcl2l1</italic> is regulated only by STAT5A and that <italic>Bcl2, Il2ra</italic> and <italic>Foxp3</italic> are regulated only by STAT5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kanai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jenks et al., 2013</xref>). Our data indicate that these are more accurately described as 'pan-STAT5' genes that are more impacted by deletion of one paralog or the other.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08384.021</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Paralog dose governs STAT5-driven gene transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from one-allele <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice were transduced with STAT5A retrovirus, then processed for RNA-seq.

This principle is well illustrated in humans with congenital <italic>STAT5B</italic> defects, who typically manifest a range of autoimmune symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanai et al., 2012</xref>), and is further supported by the present work, which demonstrates that <italic>Stat5b</italic> deficiency leads to spontaneous kidney disease in mice. The link between STAT5 and autoimmunity is often attributed to its role downstream of IL-2/IL-2Rα in Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malek and Castro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mahmud et al., 2013</xref>). Our work clearly endorses this viewpoint and brings to mind the autoimmune phenotype of Treg-deficient <italic>Scurfy</italic> mice which, like <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice, exhibit both autoantibodies and kidney disease {Aschermann:2013gn}. We demonstrate that, similar to <italic>STAT5B</italic>-deficient humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2006</xref>), Treg cells are functionally compromised in <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice, but, surprisingly, the baseline frequency of FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells was not reduced, likely reflecting immunological and/or environmental differences between the two species. We also present new ideas about why STAT5-deficient Treg cells are impaired. First, they acquire the ability to produce IL-2, a cytokine that is typically restricted in Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malek and Castro, 2010</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that STAT5 can suppress IL-2 production by conventional T cells and, given that Treg cells are thought to operate, in part, by consuming IL-2, it provides one explanation for their ineffectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Villarino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pandiyan et al., 2007</xref>). Second, they fail to express TBX21, a transcription factor that is required to limit Th1-type T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koch et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have shown that STAT1-activating cytokines (e.g. interferons, IL-27) can induce TBX21 in Treg cells but we are the first to show that IL-2, a STAT5-activating cytokine, can do it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Aside from its role in Treg cells, STAT5 promotes immunological tolerance via effector cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Given the dramatic accumulation of Tfh cells in our STAT5 mutants, the capacity of Tfh cells to promote autoimmunity, and recent work showing that STAT5 can suppress Tfh differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ballesteros-Tato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>), we conclude that exaggerated Tfh responses factor heavily in the autoantibody responses and attendant kidney pathology seen in <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice. Our data also suggest an intimate relationship between STAT5 and BCL6, the ‘master’ transcription factor for Tfh cells. We report that STAT5 directly engages the <italic>Bcl6</italic> locus, where it likely acts as a transcriptional repressor, and that STAT5 binding sites are often enriched for BCL6 motifs, consistent with published accounts of co-localization between these two transcription factors (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). These findings strongly implicate Tfh cells in the pathogenesis of <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient mice but, since these are germline ‘knockouts’, we must consider the (likely) possibility that intrinsic defects in other cell types contribute to the autoimmune phenotype. For instance, multiple dendritic cell subsets are known to be dysregulated in <italic>Stat5-</italic> or <italic>Jak3</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yamaoka, 2005</xref>), and its influence on non-immune cells, particularly downstream of hormone receptors, cannot be ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhrt and Wojchowski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hennighausen and Robinson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Because of its prominent role within the immune system, STAT5 has long been viewed as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Clinical use of STAT5-activating cytokines and growth factors (e.g. IL-2, erythropoetin) is now commonplace and the recent approval of Jak3 inhibitors for the treatment of autoimmune disease and malignancy points to sustained interest in this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Villarino et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, a detailed understanding of how STAT5 signaling works is imperative not only to inform new drugs, but also to improve existing regimens. The present study yields multiple clinically relevant insights and, in particular, raises two key issues that should be considered. First, partial inhibition of STAT5 expression and or activity may be sufficient to have desired effects on immune cell function. Second, targeting of STAT5A may be safer (though perhaps less robust) than targeting of STAT5B. Therefore, taking a broad view, our findings provide a molecular rationale for exploiting STAT5 paralog redundancy in clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials &amp; methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental Animals</title><p>STAT5 mutants were generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamaji et al., 2013</xref>).

Note that the use of absolute fold change negates the distinction between up- and down-regulated genes, while the multiplication step improves the score for high-abundance transcripts. The paralog score for STAT5B was then divided by the paralog score for STAT5A and the resulting 'preference score' was log 2 transformed so that transcripts which are more impacted by the loss of STAT5B are assigned positive values while those which are more impacted by the loss of STAT5A are assigned negative values.

Transcripts that were significantly impacted (&gt;1.5 fold change, p&lt;0.05) by ectopic STAT5A relative to empty vector were enumerated using EdgeR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Relative paralog measurements</title><p>Transcriptome data for CD4<sup>+</sup> naive and Treg cells was sourced from: 1) Immunological Genome Project (mouse microarrays: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.immgen.org">http://www.immgen.org</ext-link>), 2) EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas (mouse RNA-seq: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2582">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2582</ext-link>), 3) BioGPS Primary Cell Atlas (human microarrays: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://biogps.org/dataset/BDS_00013/">http://biogps.org/dataset/BDS_00013/</ext-link>), and 4) our RNA-seq catalogue (described above; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Largely through genomic analysis of a range of allelic combinations of <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> mutant mice via disruption of either single or dual alleles (combinations of homozygous or heterozygous <italic>Stat5a</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> mutant mice), the authors find that the two paralogs are highly redundant in their functions, but because STAT5B is expressed at higher levels, it has a dominant role in regulating immune cell development and function. The studies are generally well-performed and address an issue that has not been clearly resolved for immune cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the authors have used state-of-art genomic analysis to arrive at the conclusion that a dose-dependent effect of the STAT5 paralog is critical to drive the STAT5 inducible genes optimally, most of their conclusions are correlative rather serving as a direct biological 'cause-effect' relation. Additional studies would be needed to provide direct biological evidence to validate their claim of dosage effect of paralog on T cell-mediated immune response. The studies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> should be extended to demonstrate that the aberrant T cell responses exhibited by STAT5B-deficieny (e.g., increased frequency of CD44high effector populations, lower Tbet induction in response to IL-2, lower extent of IL-2Ra and FoxP3 induction during Treg development and greater loss of suppressive ability of Tregs) can be reversed by retroviral expression of STAT5A in STAT5B-deficient cells. This could be achieved by transducing naive T cells ex vivo and then analyzing their ability to differentiate into distinct T cell lineages.</p><p>2) This paper involves comparisons between 8 different mouse genotypes yet according to the Methods section these were all compared using single t-tests which is inappropriate. The analysis of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref>, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> should be performed using ANOVA or some other comparable test to account for multiple sample comparison.</p><p>3) Replicates for ChIP-seq experiments should be performed if not done so already. Without replicates a determination of FDR (or IDR using Encode methods for combining replicates) cannot be performed. This is important given that the question is whether or not STAT5A and STAT5B bind differentially to any regions of the genome. A Table summarizing read depth is needed to allow assessment of data quality. An anonymous link to a browser session is recommended. The RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq data needs to be deposited in a public repository.</p><p>4) Because of the global nature of the <italic>Stat5</italic> knockouts, cell types in addition to T cells could contribute autoimmune kidney pathology, particularly macrophages. These experiments would be strengthened by blocking cytokine signaling pathways of T cells that are dysregulated in the absence of STAT5B. At the least, the potential contributions of additional cell types to the renal pathology needs to be discussed.</p><p>5) A major point of the manuscript is that STAT5B is dominant because it is expressed at higher levels. This point is not adequately documented. The only figure panel that directly shows differential expression at the level of protein is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, which uses a pan-STAT Ab to visualize STAT5 in WT and 5A or 5B KO cells. The labeling of this figure is ambiguous, but a large decrease in expression is observed for 5A (5A-deficient) cells and no expression is seen in 5B (5B-deficient) cells. These differences seem to be much greater than the ~2-fold differences in RNA expression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> for Treg and Nv cells and RNA expression is nearly equal in Tef cells. The authors show evidence for cell-specific enhancers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, which could explain differences in STAT5 expression across cell types, but these do not necessarily explain differences in STAT5A vs. STAT5B expression within a particular cell type, raising the possibility that differences in post transcriptional regulation of STAT5A/B expression are important. Further documentation of different levels of STAT5B and STAT5A protein expression is needed in wild type cells. Any further insights into the basis of differential expression would also strengthen the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08384.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) Although the authors have used state-of-art genomic analysis to arrive at the conclusion that a dose-dependent effect of the STAT5 paralog is critical to drive the STAT5 inducible genes optimally, most of their conclusions are correlative rather serving as a direct biological 'cause-effect' relation.

This conclusion is supported in the original manuscript by gain-of-function studies showing that ectopic STAT5A can rescue gene expression in <italic>Stat5b-</italic>deficient T cells but, as noted by the reviewers, these did not address whether it can also rescue cellular differentiation. To explore the latter possibility, we transduced <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient T cells under Treg or Th17 polarizing conditions, then measured FoxP3 and IL-17 to gauge lineage commitment. As expected, ectopic STAT5A restored their capacity to become FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Treg cells while, at the same time, limiting their capacity to become IL-17-producing effectors. Ectopic STAT5A even drove FoxP3 expression in WT and heterozygous cells (i.e. <italic>Stat5a</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Stat5b</italic><sup>+/-</sup>), suggesting that availability of STAT5 is actually rate limiting for Treg differentiation. Furthermore, there was a clear, linear correlation between STAT5 protein levels, whether endogenous or ectopic, and FoxP3 induction in all genotypes, suggesting that high concentrations predispose towards the Treg lineage. Collectively, these data support our hypothesis that STAT5 paralog dose bears major influence on T cell differentiation and imply that a certain STAT5 threshold must be achieved to execute the Treg program.</p><p>All ectopic STAT5A experiments have been compiled in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Positive false discovery rates, or q-values, were calculated empirically for each peak.

However, as noted by the reviewers, STAT5 is known to impact many other cell types that may influence pathogenesis in these germline mutant animals. This important point is now raised in the Discussion section:</p><p>&quot;These findings strongly implicate Tfh cells in the pathogenesis of Stat5b-deficient mice but, since these are germline ‘knockouts’, we must also consider the (likely) possibility that intrinsic defects in other cell types contribute to their autoimmune phenotype. For instance, multiple dendritic cell subsets are known to be dysregulated in mice lacking STAT5 or upstream kinase Jak3, and its influence on non-immune cells, particularly downstream of hormone receptors, cannot be overlooked.&quot;</p><p><italic>5) A major point of the manuscript is that STAT5B is dominant because it is expressed at higher levels. This point is not adequately documented. The only figure panel that directly shows differential expression at the level of protein is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, which uses a pan-STAT Ab to visualize STAT5 in WT and 5A or 5B KO cells. The labeling of this figure is ambiguous, but a large decrease in expression is observed for 5A (5A-deficient) cells and no expression is seen in 5B (5B-deficient) cells. These differences seem to be much greater than the ~2-fold differences in RNA expression shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> for Treg and Nv cells and RNA expression is nearly equal in Tef cells. The authors show evidence for cell-specific enhancers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>, which could explain differences in STAT5 expression across cell types, but these do not necessarily explain differences in STAT5A vs. STAT5B expression within a particular cell type, raising the possibility that differences in post transcriptional regulation of STAT5A/B expression are important. Further documentation of different levels of STAT5B and STAT5A protein expression is needed in wild type cells. Any further insights into the basis of differential expression would also strengthen the manuscript.</italic></p><p>The idea that STAT5B is more abundant than STAT5A is central to our thesis on why it is the dominant paralog in helper T cells. To better support this point, we employed two independent strategies. First, we mined published transcriptome datasets to confirm that STAT5B is more abundant at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we refined our pan-STAT5 flow cytometry assay to better illustrate the disparity at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>Due to inevitable differences in affinity and/or avidity, we believe it is impossible to compare cellular concentrations of two proteins using two separate antibodies. Therefore, we have chosen to calculate relative abundance based on the performance of a single pan-STAT5 antibody, which presumably recognizes a single homologous epitope, across a range of STAT5 allele combinations. Using this methodology, which has been refined such that we can resolve individual subsets (i.e. naive, Treg, Tfh) across 6 genotypes (or more), we confirmed that STAT5B makes the greater contribution to the total STAT5 pool. The asymmetry was most obvious in cells lacking one allele – deleting a single copy of <italic>Stat5b</italic> was enough to yield a phenotype while deleting a single copy <italic>Stat5a</italic> was not – but was also evident in those lacking two; <italic>Stat5b</italic>-deficient cells had far less STAT5 protein than <italic>Stat5a</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We also found that STAT5 levels were consistently lower in cells from 'one allele' Stat5a-deficient mice (<italic>Stat5a</italic><sup>-/-</sup><italic>Stat5b</italic><sup>+/-</sup>) than in those from double heterozygotes (<italic>Stat5a</italic><sup>+/-</sup><italic>Stat5b</italic><sup>+/-</sup>), suggesting that, while <italic>Stat5b</italic> may be the dominant input, the <italic>Stat5a</italic> locus does make an appreciable, albeit more limited, contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>All STAT5 mRNA and protein measurements have been compiled in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>. They are described in the Results section, subsection “Asymmetric expression of STAT5 paralogs in helper T cells” and in the Methods section, subsection “Flow cytometry”.</p><p>Overall, there was good accord between our mRNA and protein data in demonstrating that STAT5B is from 1.5 to 3 times more abundant than STAT5A. These ratios are in line with our original flow cytometry studies (Original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) but less dramatic than what we had observed by western blotting (Original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), likely due to differences in sensitivity between the two assays. Given this inconsistency, and the fact that our original flow cytometry studies did not distinguish individual T cell subsets, we have chosen to include only our latest flow cytometry data in the revised manuscript.</p><p>One surprise that emerged from our RNA-seq studies is that paralog asymmetry appeared to be lost after in vitro activation (see 'effector T cells' in the Original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Upon inspection, we found that this was evident only when cells were cultured for 72 hours, not when they were cultured for 96 hours (Data not shown) or under iTreg polarizing conditions (data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also found no evidence for such an effect in published datasets (Data not shown), nor could we detect it at the protein level (Data not shown). Thus, while it remains possible that acute stimuli (i.e. TCR engagement, co-stimulation) temporarily alter the balance between STAT5 paralogs, we are unsure about the kinetics and/or robustness of this phenomenon and, thus, have decided to omit all mention of it from the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
