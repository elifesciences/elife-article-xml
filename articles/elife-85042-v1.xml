Multiple tongue deformities including cleft, hamartoma, and ankyloglossia are also seen in ciliopathies, which yield difficulties in fundamental functions such as mastication and vocalization. Here, we found these tongue anomalies in mice with mutation of ciliary protein. Abnormal cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCC) failed to evoke Hh signal for differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into myoblasts, which resulted in abnormal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into adipocytes. The ectopic adipose subsequently arrested tongue swelling formation. Ankyloglossia was caused by aberrant cell migration due to lack of non-canonical Wnt signaling. In addition to ciliopathies, these tongue anomalies are often observed as non-familial condition in human. We found that these tongue deformities could be reproduced in wild-type mice by simple mechanical manipulations to disturb cellular processes which were disrupted in mutant mice. Our results provide hints for possible future treatment in ciliopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>cell-cell interaction</kwd><kwd>cranial neural crest-derived cells</kwd><kwd>X-inactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H01601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohazama</surname><given-names>Atsushi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K18753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujita</surname><given-names>Akira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K18661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagai</surname><given-names>Takahiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K10088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishida</surname><given-names>Yoko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-cell interaction between neural crest-derived cells and mesoderm-derived cells determine cell fate of mesoderm-derived cell in tongue development through Hh signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary cilium, a nonmotile organelle existing on almost all somatic cell surfaces in vertebrates, has been shown to play critical roles in many biological processes, including regulating signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bisgrove and Yost, 2006</xref>). The primary cilium consists of a membrane-bound cylinder surrounding nine doublet microtubules, which extends from a centriole termed the basal body. Cilia are assembled and maintained by intraflagellar transport (IFT), in which multiple protein complexes are moved bidirectionally along the axoneme. Perturbations in the function of primary cilia result in a wide spectrum of human diseases: the ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bisgrove and Yost, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scholey and Anderson, 2006</xref>). Ciliopathy patients exhibit prominent mixed symptoms in several vital organs including the brain, lung, kidney and liver, and others, such as the eye and digit. Multiple congenital tongue anomalies including aglossia, cleft, hamartoma, and ankyloglossia are also observed in ciliopathy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mostafa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaghloul and Brugmann, 2011</xref>). These tongue anomalies significantly impair quality of life, since the tongue plays a critical role in multiple fundamental functions including mastication, deglutition, general sensation and taste, oral cleansing, and vocalization. In addition to ciliopathies, these tongue anomalies are often observed as non-familial condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cobourne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin and Zhao, 2020</xref>). However, the cause of these tongue anomalies remains unclear.</p><p>The tongue is a muscular organ. During tongue development, tongue myoblasts originate from the anterior-most somites (the occipital somites), which are derived from the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ziermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>). Cells from these somites (known collectively as the hypoglossal cord) passed through the posterior edge of the caudal pharyngeal arch, along the lateral side of the pericardium toward the anterior, ventral to branchial arches, and then inside the second and first branchial arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mackenzie et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2018</xref>). Cranial neural crest-derived cells (CNCC) also migrate to the tongue primordia, and contribute to form the lamina propria, tendon, and interstitial connective tissue to compartmentalize tongue muscles and serve as their attachments. A lingual swelling begin to appear in the mandibular processes at embryonic day (E) 11.5 in mice, which undergoes rapid enlargement, with a rudimentary tongue-like structure observed by E12.5.</p><p>OFDI syndrome is an X-linked dominant ciliopathy that affects females and causes prenatal lethality in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Macca and Franco, 2009</xref>). OFD1 syndrome is characterized by malformations of the oroface and digits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Macca and Franco, 2009</xref>). <italic>OFD1</italic> has been identified as the gene mutated in OFD1 syndrome patients.

Thus, abnormal brown adipose tissue formation was also occurred, when <italic>Ofd1</italic> is completely deleted in CNCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell differentiation by cell-cell interaction</title><p>Brown adipose tissue is normally derived from the mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kajimura et al., 2010</xref>), whereas <italic>Ofd1</italic> is deleted in CNCC in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice. In order to understand whether ectopic brown adipose tissue in the <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant tongue was derived from CNCC, we examined <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> mice using <italic>ROSA26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic> mice. CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells were observed as YFP-positive and -negative cells, respectively, in these mice. Brown adipose marker, C/EBPβ, was not overlapped with YFP expression in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Furthermore, brown adipose marker was overlapped with mesoderm marker molecule, Pax3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). These indicate that ectopic brown adipose was derived from mesoderm. Tongue muscles are also derived from the mesoderm in wild-type mice, and tongue muscle in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> mice was overlapped with Pax3, but not YFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). These suggest that muscular tissue in mutant tongue was derived from the mesoderm under normal conditions. Thus, ectopic brown adipose tissue was formed from mesoderm-derived cells, when <italic>Ofd1</italic> was deleted from CNCC. It is possible that the interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is involved in differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we firstly examined the early stages of tongue development to identify the timing and location of possible interactions between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells. Morphological anomalies and obvious adipose marker expression were observed in the tongue of <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice at E12, when the early tongue swelling has become apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O and Q</xref>). Next, we examined <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice at E11. Ectopic adipose would be easily identified in these mice at such early stage, since ectopic adipose was formed as full penetrant in these mice. Myogenic progenitor cells were observed in wild-type mandibular processes, which was remarkably reduced in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice at E11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2T and U</xref>). Brown adipose marker was observed in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice, which could not be seen in wild-type mandibular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2V and W</xref>). These indicate that mesoderm-derived cells were already demonstrating an abnormal status when they reached to mandibular processes. Thus, the timing of interactions between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is likely stage before E11.</p><p>At E10, mesoderm-derived cells and CNCC were observed within pharyngeal arch in the wild-type confirmed by <italic>Mesp1Cre;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Wnt1Cre;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> mice, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Myogenic precursor cells confirmed by <italic>Myf5</italic> expression was observed within pharyngeal arch at the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, <italic>Myf5</italic> expression could not be detected when <italic>Ofd1</italic> was deleted from all CNCC [<italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>]. It has been shown that <italic>Osr2</italic> is expressed in tongue connective tissue where CNCC form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lan et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, at E13.5, we found that <italic>Osr2Cre;R26R<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> mice showed LacZ expression in lamina propria (neural crest-derived region), but not in tongue muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, it has been shown that <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> activation could not be detected in craniofacial region at E9.25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lan et al., 2004</xref>). At E10, <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> activation was found in pharyngeal regions at E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, E’</xref>). At E11, both <italic>Osr2</italic>-expressing cells and tongue myoblast precursor cells were present in the mandibular process; however, <italic>Osr2</italic>-expressing cells did not interact with tongue myoblast precursor cells at the stage, due to the significant distance between <italic>Osr2</italic>-expressing cells and tongue myoblast precursor cells (confirmed by <italic>MyoD</italic> or <italic>Myf5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–G</xref>). Thus, <italic>Osr2</italic>-expressing cells likely interact with mesoderm-derived cells only within the pharyngeal regions at E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Therefore, we generated <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice using <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> to understand whether interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is occurred within pharyngeal arches at E10. Indeed, ectopic sparse tissue was observed in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HM) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). To further confirm this, we generated <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice using <italic>Sox10-Cre. Sox10-Cre</italic> has also been used for gene deletion from CNCC. However, <italic>Sox-10Cre</italic> activation starts in the middle of CNCC migration, while <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> is activated before their migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hari et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>, <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic> is not activated immediately after start of migration. If interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is crucial before CNCC migration for mesoderm-derived cell differentiation, tongue phenotype would not be present in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant generated by <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic>. If interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is crucial within mandibular processes (after completion of their migration), tongue phenotypes would be same between <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant generated by <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic>. If interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is crucial during migration, tongue phenotypes would be partially rescued in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant generated by <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic>, since CNCC could interact with mesoderm-derived cells immediately after start of migration (while <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic> is inactivated). We compared <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Sox10Cre</italic>(HM) mice with <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice, since tongue phenotypes were consistent in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice. We found the presence of slight muscle tissue in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Sox10Cre</italic>(HM) mice, which was never seen in tongue of <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>). Thus, interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells start immediately after migration. To further confirm the interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells for cell differentiation, in vitro assay was performed using mesenchymal cells obtained from <italic>Wnt1Cre;R26R<sup>YFP</sup></italic> mice. These contained CNCC as YFP-posivive cells and mesoderm-derived cells as YFP-negative cells. Expression of muscle marker was observed in mesoderm-derived cells (YFP-negative cells) around CNCC (YFP-posivive cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Mesoderm-derived cells (YFP-negative cells) showed adipose marker expression, when they were isolated from CNCC (YFP-posivive cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>).

Adipose tissue was observed in the tongue of wild-type with incisions (n=4/8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>), which was never seen in wild-type without incisions (n=0/8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>). These results indicated that in normal tongue development, CNCC interact with mesoderm-derived cells within the pharyngeal region, which is essential for normal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into myoblasts. Aberrant interaction results in abnormal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into brown adipocytes. Thus, ectopic adipose formation due to aberrant differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells were caused by a lack of proper cell-cell interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells.</p><p>The supraclavicular and cervical brown tissues are present as the most anterior brown adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mo et al., 2017</xref>). If ectopic adipose in <italic>Ofd</italic>1 mutant tongue was derived from the cervical brown adipose tissue due to mis-migration, the supraclavicular or cervical brown adipose tissue in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice would be shrinked or be connected to ectopic adipose in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant tongue. However, any shrinkage of these brown adipose tissue or connection between these brown adipose tissues and ectopic adipose could not be detected in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B–I</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic brown adipose tissue in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice was found from E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2W</xref>), while the supraclavicular and cervical brown adipose tissue are known to be formed from E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014</xref>). Thus, ectopic brown adipose tissue found in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice is unlikely caused by mis-migration of the supraclavicular and cervical brown adipose tissue.</p><p>In addition to ectopic adipose tissues, normal muscle tissue was also present in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) tongue, indicating that some CNCC successfully interact and induced normal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells into muscle progenitors, while other CNCC populations failed to elicit this. Thus, two types of CNCC (normal and abnormal CNCC) would appear to be present in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice. This is most likely caused by X-inactivation, since <italic>Ofd1</italic> is located on the X-chromosome. To confirm this, we used <italic>Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice that have a GFP reporter expressed by Cre ribonuclease on the X-chromosome. We found that both GFP-positive cells [CNCC with paternal Ofd1 (+) activation] and GFP-negative cells [CNCC with maternal Ofd1 (+) activation] showed scattered pattern in <italic>Wnt1Cre;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice made by crossing male <italic>Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice with female <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

All CNCC were found as GFP-negative cells in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we generated <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice which show cells with Ofd1 (+) chromosome activation [normal CNCC] and Ofd1 (-) chromosome activation [<italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant CNCC] as GFP-positive and -negative cells, respectively. In <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice, GFP<italic>-</italic>positive (normal CNCC) and -negative (<italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant CNCC) cells were observed as a mosaic pattern in the mandibular processes, indicating that both normal and <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant CNCC were present in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In wild-type mice, Myo-D was observed as a single domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); however, <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice showed a mosaic pattern of MyoD-positive domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) as <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice showed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). MyoD-positive domains were found only around GFP<italic>-</italic>positive cells (normal CNCC) in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Adipose marker expression was found in the region where GFP-positive (normal CNCC) was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). To further confirm whether adipocyte formation occurs when mesoderm-derived cells contact with <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant CNCC, in vitro assay was performed. For that experiment, we generated <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice to detect <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant CNCC as GFP-positive cells. UCP1 expression was observed around GFP-positive cells (<italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant cells), while MyoD expression could not be observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>). Thus, <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutation in CNCC disrupts proper interactions between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells, and subsequent differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells. These findings suggested that, in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice, CNCC displaying inactivation of the X-chromosome with <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutation induced normal differentiation of surrounding mesoderm-derived cells, while CNCC with inactivation of the normal X-chromosome failed to elicit this to surrounding mesoderm-derived cells. It is likely that CNCC in branchial arch region are randomly divided into two types of cell clusters (cells with and without <italic>Ofd1</italic>) due to the X-inactivation, since X-inactivation is based on random choice between the two X-chromosomes. In fact, mosaic pattern of GFP<italic>-</italic>positive (normal cells) and -negative (<italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant cell) cells varied widely in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This might lead to the phenotypic tongue variation seen in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice. Thus, the interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells is under control of X-inactivation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>X-inactivation in <italic>Ofd</italic>1 mutant tongue.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Frontal sections showing immunohistochemistry of GFP (<bold>A–C</bold>) and MyoD (<bold>D, E</bold>) in <italic>Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET)<italic>;Hprt<sup>fl</sup></italic> (<bold>A</bold>), <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM)<italic>;Hprt<sup>fl</sup></italic> (<bold>B</bold>), <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre(HET);Hprt<sup>fl</sup></italic> (<bold>C</bold>), wild-type (<bold>D</bold>), and <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) (<bold>E</bold>) mice at embryonic day (E) 11.

Brown adipose marker expression was observed in cyclopamine treated group, although CNCC [YFP (+) cells] were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

The absence of a tongue swelling in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice suggested that ectopic brown adipocytes could not develop a tongue swelling. Unlike <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice, tongue was present in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice, and abnormal deep clefts originating from the tongue root were often observed, while adipose tissue was seen at the bottom of these clefts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sagittal sections of the cleft part of the tongue also showed that the adipose tissue was present at the most posterior part of the cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Fate mapping analysis using DiD labeling (injection where the early tongue emerges = TE region; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) confirmed that the tongue develops along the antero-positerior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–E’’</xref>). This suggested the possibility that the presence of adipose disturbs the formation of the early tongue swelling, which lead to the cleft formation in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice, since ectopic adipose could not form tongue swelling in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HM) mice. To confirm this hypothesis, myoblasts and CNCC were replaced with adipose tissue in wild-type mandible at E11.0 where the tongue emerges, and cultured them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The replacement was performed only restricted area within the region tongue swelling usually emerges. The cleft-like structures were observed in the cultured tongue, which was never seen in cultured tongue without replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H’</xref>). Thus, cleft is occurred when adipose tissue was present where CNCC/myoblasts are usually located before emergence of tongue swelling.

Our findings indicated that early formation of the tongue swelling requires the presence of CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells. We often found that adipose tissue was present in the dorsum region of the emerging tongue swelling at E12.5, when the tongue swelling emerged in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and C’</xref>). It is possible that myogenic progenitors and CNCC push adipocytes up during early formation of the tongue swelling. To confirm this, we examined the formation of tongue papillae. In wild-type mice, the tongue papillae initiate through epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during emergence of the early tongue swelling. It is unlikely that adipocytes induce tongue papillae epithelium through epithelial-mesenchymal interaction. Therefore, the presence or absence of tongue papillae would be an indicator of whether adipocytes are located underneath the tongue epithelium during emergence of the tongue swelling. The epithelium and lamina propria overlying the tongue muscle exhibited tongue papillae-like structures in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and E’</xref>). However, only a thin epithelium was observed in the region overlying the ectopic adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and E’’</xref>). The tongue papillae marker <italic>Krt1-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jonker et al., 2004</xref>) was expressed in the epithelium overlying muscle tissue with lamina propria only, and not in the overlying ectopic adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). The tongue papillae was also observed in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant using <italic>Sox10-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>), which further confirm the presence of muscle in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Sox10Cre</italic>(HM) mice. Thus, the presence of ectopic adipose tissue underneath the tongue epithelium led to a lack of tongue papillae. To further confirm this finding, we implanted adipose tissue on CNCC and myoblasts in wild-type mandibular explants at E11.0, and cultured them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). The adipose tissue was found on the dorsum region after tongue swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I and J</xref>). Thus, adipocytes could enter the tongue swelling when adipocytes are located above CNCC and/or myoblasts. These also confirmed that tongue morphology was determined by which tissue first reaches the region where the tongue swelling emerges. Adipose could enter to tongue primordia when adipocytes reach after CNCC/myoblasts. Adipose tissue often goes down to the floor of the mandible from the dorsum of the tongue during emergence of tongue swelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Adipose tissue in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant tongue.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C–E’’</bold>) Frontal (<bold>A, B, D–E’’</bold>) and sagittal (<bold>C, C’</bold>) sections showing histological images in wild-type (<bold>D</bold>), and <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) (<bold>A–C’, E–E’’</bold>).

The tongue frenum is often absent in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The tongue frenum is a thin flap of mucous membrane, and the tissue underneath the epithelium consists of CNCC, but not myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>). The tongue frenum is already formed in wild-type mice at E12 when the tongue swelling becomes obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the tongue frenum likely forms during emergence of the tongue swelling. It has been shown that tongue frenum is absent in <italic>Lgr5</italic> and <italic>Tbx22</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pauws et al., 2009</xref>). We found restricted expression pattern of <italic>Lgr5</italic> and <italic>Tbx22</italic> in wild-type mandibular processes at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D</xref>). <italic>Lgr5</italic> expression could not be detected in the mandibular processes at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicated that the region showing <italic>Lgr5</italic> and <italic>Tbx22</italic> at E11.5 are probably involved in tongue frenum formation. Although the tongue frenum is located at the midline, <italic>Tbx22</italic> showed no expression in the midline of the mandibular processes at E11.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). In order to determine whether the anterior region of the <italic>Lgr5</italic>/<italic>Tbx22</italic> expression domain is linked to tongue frenum formation, fate mapping analysis using DiD was performed in the wild-type mandible. DiD was injected within the anterior part of <italic>Lgr5</italic>/<italic>Tbx22</italic>-expressing domain (AP region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). DiD in the AP region moved to the midline region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G’</xref>). Thus, cells at the AP region moved along the lingual-buccal axis and were then retained at the midline. Moreover, DiD labeled cells were located at tongue frenum region after culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1G</xref>). When we injected DiO to more lateral regions of the <italic>Lgr5</italic>/<italic>Tbx22</italic>-expressing domain (LT region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1H</xref>), cells labeled with DiO in the LT region moved along the anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1H’ and H’’</xref>). We already concluded that the TE region (the more posterior part of the mandibular processes from the AP regions at the midline) moved along the anterior-posterior axis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–E’’</xref>). We then injected DiO at the TE region, and DiD at both left and right AP regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H and I</xref>). Cells labeled with DiO (TE region) moved along the anterior-posterior axis and overtook cells with DiD (AP region) which moved across the lingual-buccal axis and merged at the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10I’</xref>). Thus, distinct axis of tissue formation is present to form tongue swelling and frenum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10J</xref>). To confirm whether cells in AP region form tongue frenum, we made incisions a lingual-buccal axis between the midline and AP region in wild-type mandibular processes to disturb tissue formation from the AP region to the midline, and cultured embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10K and K’</xref>). No tongue frenum was observed in cultured mandibles with incision (n=1/6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10M</xref>), while the tongue frenum was present in most cultured mandibles without incision (n=8/10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10L</xref>). Thus, cells in the AP region move the lingual-buccal axis to form the tongue frenum.

Hh signaling in mesoderm-derived cells could not be activated by CNCC without Hh signaling. Without proper interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells, mesoderm-derived cells also fail to induce their Hh signaling.

These tongue anomalies are observed in syndromic and non-syndromic condition in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cobourne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin and Zhao, 2020</xref>). Similar tongue phenotypes were observed in wild-type mice with mechanical manipulations. These revealed that genetical or mechanical disturbances in these processes result in syndromic or non-syndromic tongue anomalies, respectively. Moreover, these cellular processes are under the control of X-inactivation.</p><p>The phenotypic variation seen in the tongues of <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) mice is likely caused by X-inactivation. However, <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HET) mice display no apparent brown adipose tissue, even though X-inactivation is present in these mice. Instead, brown adipose tissue was observed in all <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HM) mice, in which no X-inactivation occurs. All cells in the <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> expression domain were <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant cells in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HM) mice, whereas only a certain number of cells were <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant cells in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HET) mice, due to X-inactivation. The <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> domain only partially overlaps with CNCC in paryngeal arch region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N’’</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Ofd1</italic> deletion from all cells of the <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> expression domain is necessary for obvious brown adipose tissue formation, while <italic>Ofd1</italic> deletion from some cells within the <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic> expression domain is not sufficient to induce morphological detectable brown adipose tissue formation. <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant CNCC was observed as clusters within pharyngeal arch region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible that abnormal differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells is occurred, when mesoderm-derived cells are interacted with clustered <italic>Ofd1</italic> (-) CNCC, but not single <italic>Ofd1</italic> (-) cell. Hence, clustered <italic>Ofd1</italic> (-) CNCC within the <italic>Osr2Cre</italic> expression domain through X-inactivation might not be enough amount to induce mis-differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells, while <italic>Ofd1</italic> deletion from all <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic>-expressing cells in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HM) mice results in enough amount of clustered <italic>Ofd1</italic> (-) CNCC formation. In wild-type mice, mesoderm-derived cells could easily interact with <italic>Ofd1</italic> (+)CNCC, since <italic>Ofd1</italic> (+) CNCC spatter to entire pharyngeal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Further study is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of cluster formation of <italic>Ofd1</italic> (-) CNCC in <italic>Ofd1</italic> mutant mice. Furthermore, adipose tissue was often found to be surrounded by CNCC in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/WT</sup>;Wnt1Cre</italic>(HET) tongue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). It is possible that mesoderm-derived cells migrate to mandibular processes along with clustered <italic>Ofd1</italic> (-) CNCC.</p><p>It has been shown that CNCC act as a scaffolding structure for the organization of migrating myoblasts. Furthermore, the direction of tissue formation is determined after CNCC and myoprogenitors reach to the mandible, which might lead to a variety of tongue phenotypes in <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl</sup>;Osr2Cre</italic>(HM) mice.</p><p>Ciliopathies show prominent mixed symptoms in several organs, including the tongue. Our findings provide hints for possible future treatment in ciliopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Production and analysis of transgenic mice</title><p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Niigata University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number SA00610, SD01308). <italic>Ofd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>Smo<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <italic>R26R<sup>LacZ</sup></italic>, <italic>R26R<sup>Yfp</sup></italic>, <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic>, <italic>Osr2-Cre</italic>, <italic>Krt14-Cre</italic>, <italic>Sox10-Cre,</italic> and <italic>Ift88<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were produced as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ferrante et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jeong et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soriano, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Danielian et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lan et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yi et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Matsuoka et al., 2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haycraft et al., 2007</xref>, respectively. <italic>Hprt<sup>fl</sup></italic> mice (021427) were purchased from the Jackson laboratory.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.

Moreover, some of the conclusions are not supported by high-quality data. Below are detailed comments:</p><p>1. On page 5 (lines 11 and lines 17-19), the conclusions &quot;Ectopic bone and sparse tissue were observed in the tongue…&quot; and &quot;… immunohistochemistry analysis suggested that this tissue was brown adipose tissue, but not muscle or white adipose tissue (Figure 2A-C, S3)&quot; need more supporting data, particularly for the immunohistochemistry analysis in Figure 1 and Figure S3. If the authors claim that there is ectopic bone (page 5, line 11), Figure 1 should provide markers for ectopic bone formation. Are Figure 1A, B, E, and F from comparable locations in control and mutant mice? In some sections, tooth germs are visible in the control, but not in the mutant. Do the mutants have an abnormal tooth phenotype as well? How can authors be sure that they are comparing the same locations? Furthermore, panels C, D, F, and G in Figure S3 are very high magnification images and therefore it is difficult to determine the original anatomical locations. The authors should include lower magnification images (e.g., Figures 2E and F) showing the region of the higher magnification images in Figure S3. On top of that, the Results section should describe the reasoning for using specific markers in the qPCR analysis in Figure 2A-C.</p><p>2. On page 6 (lines 7-9), the authors used Figure 2D to show &quot;No YFP expression could be detected in the adipose tissue, indicating that ectopic brown adipose was derived from the mesoderm.&quot; Since Figure 2D only has YFP staining, it is not sufficient to support this conclusion. Co-localization of YFP signaling and brown adipose marker(s) is needed to support this conclusion.</p><p>3. The authors only showed YFP expression in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET);HprtGFP mice (Figure 3A) and did not show YFP expression in HprtGFP control mice. Similar expression patterns in the control samples are needed to draw the conclusion on page 8 that &quot;YFP-expressing cells were observed in some region of the mandibular processes in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET);HprtGFP mice, indicating that normal CNCC was present in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) mice (Figure 3A)&quot;. Moreover, control data is also needed to support the statement on page 9 that &quot;It is likely that CNCC in the hypoglossal cord are randomly divided into two types of cell clusters (cells with and cells without Ofd1) due to the X-inactivation since X-inactivation is based on a random choice between the two X-chromosomes.&quot;</p><p>4. In Figure 3 D-E, it is difficult to see the relationship between MyoD+ and GFP+ cells because they are presented as two individual figures. The authors should provide co-localization of MyoD and GFP in the same sections to show their relationship more clearly.</p><p>5. The conclusion that &quot;Thus, the interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells are reliant on Hh signalling in CNCC, which is essential for proper differentiation of mesoderm-derived cells.&quot; on page 10 needs higher quality data to support it. Similarly, Figure 3 I-J does not provide sufficient information on the relationship between GFP+ CNCCs and Ptch1+ cells as the expression patterns are shown separately as two individual images. Co-localization of GFP and Ptch1 on the same sections is needed to clarify whether reduced Hh signaling is occurring in the CNCCs or other cells. Again, Figure 3I-J is only showing the expression pattern of Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET);HprtGFP samples. Control samples with the same staining should also be included to better evaluate the changes in CNCCs in Ofd cko mice.</p><p>6. The authors concluded that &quot;ectopic brown adipose formation was caused by the lack of Hh signaling in CNCCs&quot; on page 11. However, the authors did not further explore the detailed interaction between CNCCs and myogenic cells. Which CNCC-derived signaling molecules are affected in Ofd cko mice? Is it possible that these affected molecules from CNCCs lead to the fate change of myogenic cells to brown adipose?</p><p>7. The authors provided human OFD1 patient samples, which is a very valuable resource. However, although qPCR analysis of adipogenic genes has been performed, the presence of adipose tissue is not obvious from the HandE staining (Figure 6 C-F). Could the authors provide higher magnification of the histology sections to show the typical morphology of adipose cells in the patient samples? Or, if possible, could immunohistochemistry staining of adipose markers be performed on the patient sample sections? In addition, is the Hh signaling affected in the patient samples, too?</p><p>8. On page 15, the authors need more evidence for the conclusion that &quot;After emergence of tongue swelling (E11.5), Osr2 expression was also found within the tongue swelling in wild-type mice (Figure 7Q, Lan et al., 2007). Osr2-expressing cells are likely to migrate into the tongue to form tongue connective tissue such as the lamina propria, tendon, and interstitial connective tissue since these tissues are formed by CNCC.&quot; The appearance of Osr2 can simply be the resident cells turning on Osr2 rather than the migration of Osr2+ cells, which the authors do not provide evidence for.</p><p>9. On page 15, the conclusion that &quot;However, in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) mice, these cells abnormally differentiate into osteoblasts due to the lack of Hh signaling, which migrate into the tongue when tongue formed.&quot; needs more supporting evidence. The functional requirement for Hh in osteogenic fate regulation needs to be experimentally tested. Could the authors test whether restoring Hh in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) samples can rescue the CNCC defects? If transgenic mice are not available, primary cell cultures from Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) mice can also be used as an alternative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The manuscript title and the overall conclusion that &quot;tongue development requires coordinated multiple cellular processes&quot; are uninformative. Formation of every organ in the mammalian body requires the coordination of multiple cellular and molecular processes. The major question is whether the data in this manuscript have uncovered significant new mechanisms coordinating the multiple cellular processes in tongue development. Please clearly summarize what new coordination mechanisms were uncovered.</p><p>2. The paper needs to use clear terms to distinguish tongue myoblast precursor cells from other mesoderm-derived cells in the mandible throughout the manuscript. For example, the statement &quot;before mesoderm-derived cells enter the mandibular process they migrate as a single stream along the hypoglossal cord around E9-E10&quot; (Lines 168-170) is wrong. Mesoderm-derived cells, including cranial mesoderm giving rise to endothelial cells and muscles other than tongue muscles, enter the mandibular process through different routes in different groups.</p><p>3. While Figure 2D shows that the sparse adipose tissue in the tongue was not derived from CNCCs, the manuscript only vaguely describes this tissue as derived from mesoderm but then implies, with no experimental evidence, that the adipose tissue is derived from aberrant differentiation of tongue myoblast precursor cells due to disruption of CNCC-mesoderm interactions in the hypoglossal cord. Please clarify the relationship between the adipose tissue and tongue myoblast precursor cells and provide clear experimental data supporting the conclusion.</p><p>4. Figure 2J shows that Myf5 expression was not present in the hypoglossal cord in the mutant embryo, but it is not known whether the tongue myoblast precursor cells failed to activate, or downregulated, Myf5 expression but still migrated through the hypoglossal cord or failed to migrate or died.</p><p>5. Data presented in Figure 2Q-S are not convincing to support the conclusion that disruption of CNCC-myoblast precursor interaction in the hypoglossal cord was the sole cause of ectopic brown adipose in the tongue because (1) the diagram in Figure 2Q suggests puncture of the mandibular arch tissues in addition to the hypoglossal cord and (2) the explant did not form a muscular tongue structure with proven brown adipose tissue derived from tongue myoblast precursor cells. In addition, although the Osr2-Cre lineage was shown to partly overlap with the hypoglossal cord at E10, Osr2 lineage cells are also in the tongue primordium at E11.5. Thus, the Osr2-Cre did not provide sufficient evidence for the hypoglossal cord interaction hypothesis (and the interpretation of the Smo/Osr2-Cre data in Line 245 also needs to take account of Osr2-Cre lineage cells in the tongue primordia in addition to the hypoglossal cord). Alternative methods, such as temporally controlled Ofd1 inactivation, might help provide the necessary evidence for the conclusion.</p><p>6. The manuscript describes the adipocyte differentiation as a result of &quot;aberrant interaction&quot; in Line 198 and &quot;lack of proper cell-cell interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells&quot; in Lines 201-202. Please clarify whether the adipocyte differentiation was due to loss or gain of a signal from the CNCCs and try to determine what that might be.</p><p>7. Lines 222-226, there is a likely alternative interpretation to the data in Figure 3: the colocalization of MyoD-negative domain with the GFP-negative domain in the hypoglossal cord could be due to Myf5/MyoD positive cells migrating around the Ofd1 mutant cells in the genetic mosaic situation rather than migrating normally but failing to express Myf5/MyoD. Furthermore, as myoblast precursor cells migrate through the hypoglossal cord, they encounter and interact with distinct CNCCs along the way rather than maintaining a one-on-one partnership. Thus, the same myoblast precursor could encounter wildtype allele-inactivated CNCCs and then Ofd1fl allele-inactivated CNCCs, and vice versa, along the way. Can the author clarify what mechanism could mediate the failure of MyoD expression in the myoblast precursor cells and if those same cells could reactivate MyoD expression and myoblast differentiation when they encounter Ofd1fl allele-inactivated CNCCs after they had contact with wildtype allele-inactivated Ofd1fl/+;Wnt1-Cre CNCCs in the hypoglossal cord? Identifying the mechanism involved would also help explain better why the Ofd1fl/WT;Osr2Cre mice do not have the ectopic adipose in tongue phenotype.</p><p>8. Line 263-265 and 277-278, please clarify the sentence &quot;CNCC with Ofd1 mutation failed to migrate into this region (of site of future tongue swelling)&quot;. Does it mean that CNCCs contributing to the tongue swelling came from CNCCs outside of the mandibular arch together with the myoblasts? Multiple studies have shown that there were large numbers of CNCC death in the future tongue swelling region in CNCC-specific Smo mutant embryos. Thus, the lack of tongue swelling in the Ofd1(HM) embryos could well be due to CNCC cell death rather than a lack of CNCC migration to the area. Please check to see if CNCC survival in the mandibular arch of Ofd1(HM) mutant embryos from E9.5 to E11.5 was affected and explain why the authors interpret the data as a failure of CNCCs to migrate into the area. In addition, tongue swelling formation involves locally increased CNCC proliferation, which is also regulated by HH signaling. Thus, both apoptosis and defect in CNCC proliferation, rather than a defect in CNCC migration, might be the reason for the failure of tongue swelling formation in the HM mutant.</p><p>9. Lines 349-352, &quot;unlike region for the emergence of the early tongue swelling, CNCC with Ofd1 mutation could migrate into the mandibular bone… some CNCC retained the capability of migration in Ofd1fl;Wnt1Cre(HM) mice&quot; demonstrate complete lack of understanding of the mandibular developmental process. The tongue swelling and the mandibular bone form from CNCC-derived mandibular mesenchyme, rather than the CNCCs migrate into the swelling or the bone. Please rewrite many sentences throughout the text regarding CNCC &quot;migration&quot; in the tongue and bone development processes and only use the term &quot;migration&quot; for what it should mean when the cells move over other groups of cells from one place to another over some distance (such as myoblast precursors migrate through the CNCC-derived mesenchyme).</p><p>10. Lines 370-371, &quot;In wild-type mice before emergence of tongue swelling (E11.0), Osr2-Cre activation was observed in the lingual region where mandible duplicated&quot; does not make sense.</p><p>11. Figure 8I/I', it is unclear from the whole mount image which cells at what locations are labeled. Please provide images of serial sections of the mandible/tongue at the completion of the culture to show the locations of the labeled cells.</p><p>12. Lines 486-487, &quot;Ofd1 mutation always occurred in the same region within the hypoglossal cord in Ofd1f/;Osr2Cre(HM) mice&quot; is not supported by experimental evidence. In fact, the initial report on the Osr2Cre mice (Lan et al. 2007) described variability in Cre activity and pattern in those mice. Furthermore, because Osr2Cre activity only partly overlapped with the hypoglossal cord and tongue mesenchyme, it is not known why only some CNCCs at the hypoglossal cord/tongue mesenchyme exhibited Osr2Cre activity and whether the exact same cells in different Osr2-Cre mouse embryos exhibited Cre activity. Thus, the most logical interpretation of the phenotype of the Ofd1fl;Osr2Cre(HM) mice is that the differences resulted in variation in the pattern, level, and timing of Cre activity.</p><p>13. Sample numbers and developmental stages need to be included in figure legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors seem to misinterpret the results. In Figure 2D, the authors try to show that bone tissue in the tongue region is derived from the neural crest. The image is taken from the Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) and complete lack of GFP in the tongue means the cells in the tongue are all mesoderm-derived. Since it seems the tongue forms in the Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) to some extent, there is a possibility that the authors detected autofluorescence. It should be confirmed.</p><p>The objective of the experiment of making punctiform incisions is not clear. By making the incisions, it affects the tissue interaction but it induces bleeding or other tissue damage at the same time. It may not be ideal to include the results in the Figures, could be only used as supportive figures.</p><p>The word &quot;hypoglossal cord&quot; normally means a group of mesodermal cells that are derived from the occipital somites and moving into the branchial arches.</p><p>The interpretation of Figure 3F-H is not accurate since there is no confirmation the sections were obtained from the appropriate planes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85042.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) This study is very descriptive in nature and will require extensive new experiments to address the molecular and cellular mechanism.

The authors concluded that &quot;ectopic brown adipose formation was caused by the lack of Hh signaling in CNCCs&quot; on page 11. However, the authors did not further explore the detailed interaction between CNCCs and myogenic cells. Which CNCC-derived signaling molecules are affected in Ofd cko mice?

However, we think that it is beyond the scope of this study to deepen these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors provided human OFD1 patient samples, which is a very valuable resource. However, although qPCR analysis of adipogenic genes has been performed, the presence of adipose tissue is not obvious from the HandE staining (Figure 6 C-F). Could the authors provide higher magnification of the histology sections to show the typical morphology of adipose cells in the patient samples? Or, if possible, could immunohistochemistry staining of adipose markers be performed on the patient sample sections? In addition, is the Hh signaling affected in the patient samples, too?</p></disp-quote><p>High magnification of HandE staining has been added as new Figure 9G and 9H. Immunohistochemistry data in human samples have been added as new Figure 9I-9L. Molecular analysis in Ofd1 mutant mice indicated that ectopic adipose in the tongue is similar to low thermogenic adipocyte. Histological feature of low thermogenic adipocyte is known to be different from that of typical brown adipose tissue. In fact, histological features of adipose in Ofd1 mutant mice is similar to that of low thermogenic, but not that of typical brown adipose. This has been mentioned in Results section.</p><p>Hh signal in CNCC is important, when CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells migrate within pharyngeal arch region before their differentiation. The tongue is not formed yet at the time. On the other hand, our human sample was obtained from tongue. It means that CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells already finished their migration and differentiation. We think that positive or negative of Hh signaling in CNCC at such later time should indicate other meanings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. On page 15, the authors need more evidence for the conclusion that &quot;After emergence of tongue swelling (E11.5), Osr2 expression was also found within the tongue swelling in wild-type mice (Figure 7Q, Lan et al., 2007). Osr2-expressing cells are likely to migrate into the tongue to form tongue connective tissue such as the lamina propria, tendon, and interstitial connective tissue since these tissues are formed by CNCC.&quot; The appearance of Osr2 can simply be the resident cells turning on Osr2 rather than the migration of Osr2+ cells, which the authors do not provide evidence for.</p><p>9. On page 15, the conclusion that &quot;However, in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) mice, these cells abnormally differentiate into osteoblasts due to the lack of Hh signaling, which migrate into the tongue when tongue formed.&quot; needs more supporting evidence. The functional requirement for Hh in osteogenic fate regulation needs to be experimentally tested. Could the authors test whether restoring Hh in Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) samples can rescue the CNCC defects? If transgenic mice are not available, primary cell cultures from Ofd1fl/WT;Wnt1Cre(HET) mice can also be used as an alternative.</p></disp-quote><p>Bone part of results has been removed from revised paper, since ectopic bone is likely caused by abnormal mandibular formation, but not tongue formation.

The manuscript title and the overall conclusion that &quot;tongue development requires coordinated multiple cellular processes&quot; are uninformative. Formation of every organ in the mammalian body requires the coordination of multiple cellular and molecular processes. The major question is whether the data in this manuscript have uncovered significant new mechanisms coordinating the multiple cellular processes in tongue development. Please clearly summarize what new coordination mechanisms were uncovered.</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been changed. The overall conclusion also has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The paper needs to use clear terms to distinguish tongue myoblast precursor cells from other mesoderm-derived cells in the mandible throughout the manuscript. For example, the statement &quot;before mesoderm-derived cells enter the mandibular process they migrate as a single stream along the hypoglossal cord around E9-E10&quot; (Lines 168-170) is wrong. Mesoderm-derived cells, including cranial mesoderm giving rise to endothelial cells and muscles other than tongue muscles, enter the mandibular process through different routes in different groups.</p></disp-quote><p>These have been changed in revised manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While Figure 2D shows that the sparse adipose tissue in the tongue was not derived from CNCCs, the manuscript only vaguely describes this tissue as derived from mesoderm but then implies, with no experimental evidence, that the adipose tissue is derived from aberrant differentiation of tongue myoblast precursor cells due to disruption of CNCC-mesoderm interactions in the hypoglossal cord. Please clarify the relationship between the adipose tissue and tongue myoblast precursor cells and provide clear experimental data supporting the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Many in vitro and in vivo data have been added as new data. We hope that these are enough for our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 2J shows that Myf5 expression was not present in the hypoglossal cord in the mutant embryo, but it is not known whether the tongue myoblast precursor cells failed to activate, or downregulated, Myf5 expression but still migrated through the hypoglossal cord or failed to migrate or died.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer’s comment. However, it is difficult to determine these. Therefore, in new manuscript, these sentences have been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Data presented in Figure 2Q-S are not convincing to support the conclusion that disruption of CNCC-myoblast precursor interaction in the hypoglossal cord was the sole cause of ectopic brown adipose in the tongue because (1) the diagram in Figure 2Q suggests puncture of the mandibular arch tissues in addition to the hypoglossal cord and (2) the explant did not form a muscular tongue structure with proven brown adipose tissue derived from tongue myoblast precursor cells. In addition, although the Osr2-Cre lineage was shown to partly overlap with the hypoglossal cord at E10, Osr2 lineage cells are also in the tongue primordium at E11.5. Thus, the Osr2-Cre did not provide sufficient evidence for the hypoglossal cord interaction hypothesis (and the interpretation of the Smo/Osr2-Cre data in Line 245 also needs to take account of Osr2-Cre lineage cells in the tongue primordia in addition to the hypoglossal cord). Alternative methods, such as temporally controlled Ofd1 inactivation, might help provide the necessary evidence for the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The diagram has been changed, since old version was not correct.</p><p>Data showing the presence of muscle and adipose tissue confirmed by immunohistochemistry after giving incision have been added as new Figure 3P, 3Q.

However, only slight rescue of phenotypes in Ofd1 mutant using Sox10Cre indicate the importance of Ofd1 during migration. The data has been added in revised paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The manuscript describes the adipocyte differentiation as a result of &quot;aberrant interaction&quot; in Line 198 and &quot;lack of proper cell-cell interaction between CNCC and mesoderm-derived cells&quot; in Lines 201-202. Please clarify whether the adipocyte differentiation was due to loss or gain of a signal from the CNCCs and try to determine what that might be.</p></disp-quote><p>It is extremely difficult to identify signal from CNCCs for the differentiation of myogenic cells after activation of Hh signaling in CNCC.

Lines 222-226, there is a likely alternative interpretation to the data in Figure 3: the colocalization of MyoD-negative domain with the GFP-negative domain in the hypoglossal cord could be due to Myf5/MyoD positive cells migrating around the Ofd1 mutant cells in the genetic mosaic situation rather than migrating normally but failing to express Myf5/MyoD. Furthermore, as myoblast precursor cells migrate through the hypoglossal cord, they encounter and interact with distinct CNCCs along the way rather than maintaining a one-on-one partnership. Thus, the same myoblast precursor could encounter wildtype allele-inactivated CNCCs and then Ofd1fl allele-inactivated CNCCs, and vice versa, along the way. Can the author clarify what mechanism could mediate the failure of MyoD expression in the myoblast precursor cells and if those same cells could reactivate MyoD expression and myoblast differentiation when they encounter Ofd1fl allele-inactivated CNCCs after they had contact with wildtype allele-inactivated Ofd1fl/+;Wnt1-Cre CNCCs in the hypoglossal cord? Identifying the mechanism involved would also help explain better why the Ofd1fl/WT;Osr2Cre mice do not have the ectopic adipose in tongue phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer’s comment. However, it is difficult to prove these mechanisms. Therefore, these comments have been changed in new manuscript. On the other hand, our new data might suggest the possibility that being as a cluster of Ofd1(-) cells in Ofd1 cKO might be important to induce mis-differentiation of mesoderm rather than one-one contact. Furthermore, these data also raise the possibility that mesoderm-derived cells migrate into to mandibular processes along with CNCC cluster. Sentences describing these have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 263-265 and 277-278, please clarify the sentence &quot;CNCC with Ofd1 mutation failed to migrate into this region (of site of future tongue swelling)&quot;. Does it mean that CNCCs contributing to the tongue swelling came from CNCCs outside of the mandibular arch together with the myoblasts? Multiple studies have shown that there were large numbers of CNCC death in the future tongue swelling region in CNCC-specific Smo mutant embryos. Thus, the lack of tongue swelling in the Ofd1(HM) embryos could well be due to CNCC cell death rather than a lack of CNCC migration to the area. Please check to see if CNCC survival in the mandibular arch of Ofd1(HM) mutant embryos from E9.5 to E11.5 was affected and explain why the authors interpret the data as a failure of CNCCs to migrate into the area. In addition, tongue swelling formation involves locally increased CNCC proliferation, which is also regulated by HH signaling. Thus, both apoptosis and defect in CNCC proliferation, rather than a defect in CNCC migration, might be the reason for the failure of tongue swelling formation in the HM mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer’s comments. Sentences describing migration have been removed or changed. Apoptosis or cell proliferation were not altered in Ofd1 mutant mice, which has been added as new Figure 6-S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

The tongue swelling and the mandibular bone form from CNCC-derived mandibular mesenchyme, rather than the CNCCs migrate into the swelling or the bone. Please rewrite many sentences throughout the text regarding CNCC &quot;migration&quot; in the tongue and bone development processes and only use the term &quot;migration&quot; for what it should mean when the cells move over other groups of cells from one place to another over some distance (such as myoblast precursors migrate through the CNCC-derived mesenchyme).</p></disp-quote><p>These sentences describing migration have been changed.

Lines 486-487, &quot;Ofd1 mutation always occurred in the same region within the hypoglossal cord in Ofd1f/;Osr2Cre(HM) mice&quot; is not supported by experimental evidence. In fact, the initial report on the Osr2Cre mice (Lan et al. 2007) described variability in Cre activity and pattern in those mice. Furthermore, because Osr2Cre activity only partly overlapped with the hypoglossal cord and tongue mesenchyme, it is not known why only some CNCCs at the hypoglossal cord/tongue mesenchyme exhibited Osr2Cre activity and whether the exact same cells in different Osr2-Cre mouse embryos exhibited Cre activity.
