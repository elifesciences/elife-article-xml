Such stresses commonly include cell-extrinsic factors such as hypoxia, amino acid deprivation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection. However, cell-intrinsic stresses such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>), and mitochondrial stress can also activate the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quirós et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). Induction of the ISR and its main effector activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) in response to various stress conditions frequently correlates with increased levels of the endocrine factors fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in tissues, such as liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2021</xref>) and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ost et al., 2020</xref>). However, the upstream mechanisms mediating ISR induction in response to mitochondrial stress are unclear. Furthermore, the respective roles of FGF21 and GDF15 in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction are incompletely understood.</p><p>We recently reported that mitochondrial stress caused by deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1 BKO) activated the ISR and induced its main effector ATF4 in brown adipose tissue (BAT). ATF4-mediated FGF21 induction was required to promote browning of inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and improve thermoregulation in OPA1 BKO mice at baseline conditions. Although activation of the ISR in BAT led to resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO) in an ATF4-dependent manner, this phenomenon was independent of FGF21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we sought to investigate the upstream mechanisms mediating ISR activation in BAT in response to OPA1 deletion and the molecular mechanisms downstream of ATF4 mediating resistance to DIO.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis showed that the unfolded protein response (UPR), and specifically the protein kinase R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), was induced in OPA1-deficient BAT. Given that PERK is shared by the ISR and the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>), here, we tested the hypothesis that PERK is required for ATF4 induction in BAT. We also observed that in addition to FGF21, GDF15 was highly induced in BAT upon OPA1 deletion. Because GDF15 has been shown to regulate energy homeostasis in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsai et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2017b</xref>), here we tested the hypothesis that GDF15 is downstream of ATF4 and mediates the resistance to DIO in mice lacking OPA1 in thermogenic adipocytes. Our data reveal that PERK is dispensable for ISR and ATF4 induction in BAT in response to OPA1 deletion. Notably, GDF15 partially mediates the resistance to DIO, but is necessary for the improvement in glucose homeostasis and hepatic steatosis following high-fat feeding in OPA1 BKO mice. Furthermore, mice lacking GDF15 were unable to properly thermoregulate during cold exposure. Mechanistically, GDF15 deficiency abrogated browning of iWAT under obesogenic conditions and prevented the induction of calcium cycling in muscle, which likely contributes to increased weight gain and impaired thermogenesis in OPA1 BKO mice. These data underscore the complex regulation of systemic metabolism by various BAT-derived endocrine regulators that are released in response to mitochondrial stress and highlight novel roles for BAT-derived GDF15 in the regulation of energy homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OPA1 BKO mice have higher resting metabolic rates and are completely resistant to DIO</title><p>We have previously shown that OPA1 BKO mice have reduced body mass, increased resting metabolic rates, and are resistant to DIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira and McFarlane, 2019</xref>). To further characterize their metabolic phenotype, we analyzed indirect calorimetry data collected in 12-week-old male mice while housed under thermoneutral conditions and after 12 wk of high-fat feeding. Under isocaloric conditions and after being housed at thermoneutral conditions (30°C) for 7 d, 12-week-old OPA1 BKO mice had reduced body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with no detectable changes in food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and VCO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) were unchanged between genotypes, regardless of time of day. Interestingly, respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher in KO mice, indicating an increased relative preference for carbohydrates as energy substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Although the averaged oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) values for the dark and light cycles were unchanged between genotypes, ANCOVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) detected a significant group effect for the relationship between body mass and energy expenditure, indicating that the reduced body mass in KO mice is a result of higher metabolic rates. In response to high-fat feeding, weight gain is completely prevented in KO mice as shown in the body weight curve over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). A subset of OPA1 BKO mice exemplifying this drastic abrogation of DIO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) was utilized for analysis of indirect calorimetry. Different than in our previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira and McFarlane, 2019</xref>), here we analyzed only mice fed high-fat diet (HFD), instead of simultaneously analyzing both HFD and control groups. Moreover, rather than representing the overall averaged data, we plotted the averaged data for the last 48 hr of data collection for each cycle of the day (light and dark). Surprisingly, although our previous analysis was unable to detect these changes, here we show that OPA1 BKO mice fed HFD for 12 wk had increased food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>) and locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) relative to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) and VCO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>) were unchanged between genotypes, and respiratory exchange ratio was elevated in KO mice fed HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Although the absolute energy expenditure values were unchanged between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), ANCOVA revealed a leftward shift in the relationship between body weight and energy expenditure in OPA1 BKO mice with a nearly significant group effect (p=0.055) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>). Indeed, this was also the case when the relationship between body weight and oxygen consumption was determined by ANCOVA, which revealed a statistically significant group effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Thus, relative to total body mass, KO mice have higher energy expenditure and OCRs compared to WT animals. Together, this data confirms the hypothesis we put forth in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira and McFarlane, 2019</xref>) that the increase in resting metabolic rates likely contributes to the resistance to DIO in OPA1 BKO mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OPA1 BKO mice have higher resting metabolic rates and are completely resistant to diet-induced obesity (DIO).</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Data collected on 12-week-old male OPA1 BKO mice.

Specifically, we were interested in identifying the mechanistic link between OPA1 deletion and induction of the ISR effector ATF4, and the molecular mechanism downstream of ATF4 that mediated resistance to DIO in OPA1 KO mice. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that the ER stress pathway and the UPR were amongst the top 3 induced canonical pathways in OPA1-deficient BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Fgf21</italic>, which we previously demonstrated was required for activation of browning of iWAT and to regulate changes in core body temperature at baseline conditions, but not for the resistance to DIO in OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Gdf15</italic> were among the top 25 upregulated genes in BAT in response to <italic>Opa1</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The ER kinase PERK was significantly enriched in OPA1 BKO mice (see the GEO database under the accession number GSE218907), as shown in the bar graph comparing the averaged transcripts per million (TPM) for WT and KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Gdf15</italic> mRNA induction in OPA1 BKO mice was confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, mice lacking both ATF4 and OPA1 (OPA1/ATF4 DKO mice) in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) had significantly lower levels of <italic>Gdf15</italic> mRNA expression relative to OPA1 BKO mice. This data suggests that ATF4 at least partially regulates <italic>Gdf15</italic> induction in OPA1-deficient BAT. Importantly, GDF15 serum levels were also induced in OPA1 BKO mice but were significantly attenuated in mice lacking both OPA1 and ATF4 in BAT (OPA1/ATF4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Conversely, GDF15 serum levels remained elevated in mice concomitantly lacking OPA1 and FGF21 in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These are important control groups as mice lacking both OPA1 and ATF4 in BAT are no longer resistant to DIO, while mice lacking OPA1 and FGF21 in BAT remain lean when fed HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). It is noteworthy that the degree of GDF15 induction observed in OPA1 BKO mice is similar to that observed after cold exposure or prolonged high-fat feeding and is not further increased by these stressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Together, these data led us to hypothesize that PERK could be the ISR kinase regulating ATF4 induction, and that GDF15 is a downstream target of ATF4 mediating the resistance to DIO in OPA1 BKO mice.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transcriptome analysis reveals induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and GDF15 in mice lacking OPA1 in brown adipose tissue (BAT).</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Data collected from BAT of 7-week-old male and female OPA1 BKO mice.

To test this hypothesis, we generated mice concomitantly lacking both OPA1 and PERK in thermogenic adipocytes (OPA1/PERK BAT DKO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When we downregulated PERK expression in BAT of OPA1 BKO mice, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which is required for ATF4 translation, remained significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

As observed in OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>), expression of thermogenic genes was attenuated in BAT under baseline conditions (room temperature and regular chow feeding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and UCP1 protein levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). State 3 pyruvate/malate-supported mitochondrial respirations were significantly impaired in mitochondria isolated from DKO BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Next, we investigated whether PERK deletion in the OPA1 BKO background would affect browning of iWAT. Expression of thermogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) was induced in the iWAT of DKO mice. Consistently, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) were also elevated in iWAT of OPA1/PERK BAT DKO mice, indicating increased compensatory browning.

Therefore, we fed OPA1/PERK BAT DKO mice HFD for 12 wk. Like OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>), DKO mice were completely resistant to DIO, as demonstrated by overlapping weight curves between DKO and OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Relative to HFD controls, final body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and percent fat mass were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and percent lean mass increased in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating reduced body mass at the expense of reduced fat mass. In contrast to OPA1 BKO mice, food intake was statistically unchanged between DKO mice and their WT littermate controls, although it trended higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and VCO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) were unchanged between genotypes, regardless of the time of the day. Interestingly, in contrast to OPA1 BKO mice fed HFD, respiratory exchange ratio was significantly lower in DKO mice during the light cycle, indicating a relative increased preference for fatty acids as energy substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These data indicate that increased resting metabolic rates in OPA1/PERK BAT DKO mice, as in OPA1 BKO mice, likely contribute to the reduced body weight observed in these mice.

Male WT and DKO mice were fed a HFD (60% calories from fat) for 12 wk. Body mass gain over time was significantly attenuated in DKO relative to their WT littermate controls, but DKO mice gained significantly more weight than OPA1 BKO mice after 12 wk of high-fat feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Final body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and total fat mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) were also significantly reduced in DKO mice relative to WT mice, while total lean mass was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data suggest that GDF15 partially mediates the resistance to DIO observed in OPA1 BKO mice. To gain insight into the mechanisms contributing to these changes in weight gain, we placed a subset of high-fat-fed WT and DKO in metabolic chambers. In contrast to OPA1 BKO mice, in which food intake was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), food intake in DKO mice tended to be lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Also, in contrast to OPA1 BKO, locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) was unchanged between WT and DKO mice. Energy expenditure was also similar between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). While in OPA1 BKO mice ANCOVA revealed a near significant group effect for energy expenditure as a function of body mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), in the DKO mice, ANCOVA detected no significant differences for the group effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The averaged oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) and CO<sub>2</sub> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) for the light and dark cycles were similar between genotypes. Interestingly, the increase in RER observed in OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>) was no longer observed in the absence of BAT GDF15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). These data suggest that GDF15 is required to mediate the increase in resting metabolic rates observed in OPA1 BKO mice and regulates fuel preference. Although body mass was significantly reduced in DKO mice relative to WT mice, glucose homeostasis, as demonstrated by the GTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K and L</xref>) and fasting glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>), was similarly impaired in WT and DKO mice. Likewise, diet-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation was comparable between WT and DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). However, insulin sensitivity was significantly improved in DKO mice, as shown by the decreased serum fasting insulin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>) and reduced area under the curve for the insulin tolerance test (ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P and Q</xref>). Although under baseline conditions the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT was largely preserved, upon high-fat feeding, several thermogenic genes were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6R</xref>) and UCP1 protein levels were reduced in BAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of DKO mice. In iWAT, <italic>Ucp1</italic> mRNA levels were elevated in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>), but UCP1 protein levels, which were highly induced under baseline conditions, were undetectable after high-fat feeding in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6U</xref>). Nonetheless, UCP1 protein levels were significantly induced in iWAT of OPA1 BKO mice after 12 wk on HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Furthermore, expression of the calcium pump Serca1, which is involved in non-shivering thermogenesis and was recently shown to be induced in muscle by GDF15 administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2023</xref>), was induced in gastrocnemius muscle of OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>), but not in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6V</xref>). Our data suggest that BAT-derived GDF15 is required to sustain browning of iWAT under obesogenic conditions in the OPA1 BKO background and likely regulates calcium cycling in muscle contributing to the increased metabolic rates in these mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>GDF15 partially mediates the resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO) and is required to improve glucose homeostasis in OPA1 BKO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A–O</bold>) Data collected in OPA1/GDF15 brown adipose tissue (BAT) double-knockout (DKO) male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 wk.

We, therefore, tested whether core body temperature would be affected in DKO mice at thermoneutrality and in response to cold stress. After 7 d at 30°C, core body temperature, as measured by telemetry, was similar between WT and DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Conversely, when housed at 4°C, DKO mice became severely hypothermic, with only two mice surviving past the first 24 hr of cold exposure. Indeed, the averaged core body temperature for the initial 24 hr at 4°C was significantly lower in DKO mice relative to their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To capture the changes in core body temperature in all mice, we also plotted the last temperature recorded per mouse, which was greatly reduced in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Indirect calorimetry during the first 24 hr of cold exposure showed no significant differences in oxygen consumption for OPA1 BKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or OPA1/GDF15 BAT DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), although VO<sub>2</sub> started declining in DKO mice towards the end of the dark cycle. The averaged energy expenditure for the light and dark cycles during the first 24 hr of cold exposures were not significantly different between WT and DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, respiratory exchange ratio, which was unchanged in OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), was reduced in DKO mice, demonstrating an increased relative preference for fatty acids as energy substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Food intake was unchanged in OPA1 BKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>) relative to their WT controls, while locomotor activity was increased during the light cycle in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>), but not in OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>) (mice that died within the first 24 hr of cold exposure were removed from these analyses). In a separate cohort of mice housed at 30°C for 7 d, we used a rectal probe to measure core body temperatures prior to cold exposure (time 0) and hourly after ambient temperature was switched to 4°C (for up to 5 hr). Our data shows a precipitous decline in core body temperature in DKO mice, starting at 4 hr post-cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This phenotype is the opposite of what we previously reported for OPA1 BKO mice, which had increased core body temperature at thermoneutrality and were better able to maintain core body temperature after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). After 5 hr, animals were euthanized, and tissues were harvested for analysis. mRNA levels of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Dio2</italic> were significantly reduced in BAT of DKO mice, while <italic>Fgf21</italic> mRNA levels were elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Nonetheless, UCP1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>) in BAT were unchanged between genotypes. Although UCP1 levels were also unchanged under baseline conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), UCP1-dependent respirations were markedly inhibited in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>), indicating impaired UCP1-mediated thermogenesis. Surprisingly, mRNA expression of thermogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>) and protein levels of UCP1 were induced in the iWAT of DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>), suggesting increased browning. Because induction of browning of iWAT normally occurs after longer periods of cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher et al., 2012</xref>), we believe that this increase in thermogenic markers reflects the high baseline compensatory browning of iWAT already observed in DKO mice housed at room temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L–M</xref>). TH levels in iWAT were similar between genotypes, likely because of cold-induced TH levels in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). It was recently shown that recombinant GDF15 administration in mice can increase energy expenditure in muscle via induction of calcium cycling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, we observed that OPA1 BKO mice have higher levels of Serca1a, a marker of muscle thermogenesis, in gastrocnemius muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J</xref>). However, in DKO mice, protein levels of Serca1a were similar to WT levels in gastrocnemius muscle after acute cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>), suggesting that GDF15 is required for Serca1a induction in the OPA1 BKO background. GLUT1 levels, which are also normally induced during muscle-mediated thermogenesis, were comparable between WT and DKO mice after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that GDF15 induction in BAT is required to regulate core body temperature in cold-exposed OPA1 BKO mice. Although browning of iWAT was preserved after acute cold exposure, the induction of Serca1a in muscle was prevented in DKO mice. Further studies will be required to determine the mechanisms for GDF15-mediated thermoregulation in OPA1 BKO mice, but our data suggest that muscle thermogenesis via futile calcium cycling might contribute to this phenotype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>GDF15 is required to regulate core body temperature in cold-exposed OPA1 BKO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Averaged core body temperature (light and dark cycles) collected from 12-week-old wild-type (WT) and OPA1/GDF15 brown adipose tissue (BAT) double-knockout (DKO) mice after 7 d at 30°C.

These adaptations were mediated by the main effector of the ISR, ATF4, partially via the induction of FGF21 as a batokine. Nonetheless, the resistance to DIO and improvements in glucose homeostasis observed in OPA1-deficient mice occurred in an ATF4-dependent, but FGF21-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the molecular mechanisms leading to activation of the ISR in OPA1 BKO mice remained incompletely understood. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating ISR induction and the mechanisms downstream of ATF4 promoting resistance to DIO in mice lacking OPA1 in thermogenic adipocytes.</p><p>The ISR can be induced by four different eIF2α kinases that act as early responders to disturbances in cellular homeostasis. Each kinase responds to distinct environmental and physiological stresses, which reflects their unique regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). We and others have shown induction of the ISR downstream of mitochondrial stress, but the mechanisms mediating this induction are incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ost et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forsström et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ost et al., 2016</xref>). RNASeq data in OPA1-deficient BAT indicated an increase in ER stress pathways and activation of the UPR in OPA1 BKO mice. Indeed, of the four different ISR kinases, the ER kinase PERK was the only one significantly enriched in our transcriptome analysis of OPA1-deficient BAT. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that PERK, an eIF2α kinase shared by the UPR and the ISR, is required for ATF4 induction in OPA1-deficient BAT. Our data in mice demonstrated that, although ER stress is increased in response to OPA1 deletion, PERK is dispensable for eIF2α phosphorylation and ISR induction in OPA1-deficient BAT. Therefore, mice concomitantly lacking OPA1 and PERK in BAT display similar improvements in systemic metabolic health as observed in OPA1 BKO mice, including increased metabolic rates, browning of iWAT, and resistance to DIO and IR. These data suggest that an alternative ISR kinase is likely activated downstream of mitochondrial stress to induce the ISR in BAT when OPA1 is deleted. Indeed, a recent study revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction induces different paths to promote ISR activation, depending on both the nature of the mitochondrial stress and the metabolic state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mick et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, studies suggest that heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI) is required to activate ATF4 in response to mitochondrial stress in HEK293 cells treated with oligomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), and in embryonic and adult hearts of a mouse model of mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). Whether the same mechanisms mediate ATF4 induction upon OPA1 deletion in BAT remain to be determined.</p><p>Transcriptome analysis also revealed that GDF15 was induced in OPA1-deficient BAT, which correlated with increased GDF15 serum levels. GDF15 is a member of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily. It acts through a recently identified receptor, an orphan member of the GFRα family called GFRAL, and signals through the Ret coreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breit et al., 2021</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that GDF15 mediates its effects on reducing food intake, body weight, and adiposity largely by its actions on regions of the hindbrain, where GFRAL is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsai et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tran et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study also reported that the GDF15-GFRAL pathway is required to maintain energy expenditure during caloric restriction by increasing β-adrenergic signaling to skeletal muscle, thereby inducing fatty acid oxidation and futile calcium cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, several lines of evidence indicate that GDF15 may also have peripheral effects. Indeed, systemic overexpression of GDF15 prevents obesity and insulin resistance by modulating metabolic activity and enhancing the expression of thermogenic and lipolytic genes in BAT and WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chrysovergis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Macia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013b</xref>). Some of these effects were independent of changes in food intake, suggesting that GDF15 might also exert its effects through yet unidentified receptors other than GFRAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Recarte et al., 2022</xref>). GDF15 can be secreted by various organs such as liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2022</xref>), kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek and Eling, 2019</xref>), and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ost et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, studies demonstrated that GDF15 can also be induced in brown adipocytes in response to thermogenic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flicker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campderrós et al., 2019</xref>) and prolonged high-fat feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). Like FGF21, GDF15 is induced in response to mitochondrial stress downstream of the ISR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, our data show that <italic>Gdf15</italic> mRNA levels were dramatically reduced in mice lacking both OPA1 and ATF4 in BAT, suggesting that ATF4 may indirectly regulate GDF15 induction in OPA1 BKO mice, perhaps via its downstream target, CHOP, which can bind to the GDF15 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Deletion of GDF15 in the OPA1 BKO background completely normalized GDF15 serum levels, confirming GDF15 secretion from BAT. Under baseline conditions, the metabolic phenotype of OPA1 BKO mice was largely unaffected by GDF15 deletion in BAT. Importantly, FGF21 levels remained elevated in DKO mice and browning of iWAT and increased resting metabolic rates under baseline conditions were preserved. These data reinforce the idea that FGF21 plays a predominant role on the baseline phenotype of OPA1 BKO mice, particularly browning of iWAT; however, FGF21 was dispensable to promote resistance to DIO in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). Conversely, under obesogenic conditions, our data revealed that GDF15 partially mediates the resistance to DIO. These changes occurred independently of changes in food intake as DKO mice consumed similar amounts of food relative to their WT controls. Rather, our data support the idea that BAT-derived GDF15 increases metabolic rates in OPA1 BKO mice fed obesogenic diets, thereby attenuating weight gain. Furthermore, although under isocaloric conditions browning was preserved in DKO mice, GDF15 was required to maintain browning of iWAT in OPA1 BKO mice fed HFD. These data suggest that GDF15-mediated browning of iWAT during obesogenic conditions might contribute to the increased metabolic rates and reduced weight gain observed in OPA1 BKO mice, as also proposed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teijeiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirschner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, while the calcium pump Serca1 was induced in the gastrocnemius muscle of OPA1 BKO mice fed HFD, this effect was abrogated in DKO mice. This data suggests that GDF15 may also regulate futile calcium cycling in muscle to increase energy expenditure in OPA1 BKO fed an obesogenic diet. Of note, although GDF15 effects on body weight were only partial, the improvements in glucose disposal and hepatic steatosis observed in OPA1 BKO mice were completely abolished in the absence of BAT GDF15, highlighting additional mechanisms of GDF15-mediated metabolic protection that are independent of its body weight-lowering effects. Paradoxically, insulin sensitivity remained improved.</p><p>In the context of hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, which is associated with increased hepatic FGF21 and GDF15 expression and increased liver-derived GDF15 in the circulation, GDF15 was shown to regulate changes in body and fat mass and protect against hepatic steatosis in DIO but had no effect on glucose disposal. Instead, FGF21 was required to increase insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, and UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in iWAT of regular chow-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2021</xref>), which is similar to what we previously reported for OPA1 BKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). FGF21 and GDF15 induction and secretion was also reported in a model of mitochondrial stress in adipose tissue (both BAT and WAT). In this study, under regular chow-fed conditions, neither GDF15 nor FGF21 appeared to regulate whole-body metabolism. Conversely, as in OPA1 BKO mice, long-term induction of GDF15 attenuated progression of obesity by increasing energy expenditure in DIO, while FGF21 was dispensable for this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Together, our study suggests that FGF21 and GDF15 play fundamentally distinct roles as part of the mitochondrial stress response in regulating energy metabolism and glucose homeostasis in different metabolic states. Our data support a predominant role for GDF15 rather than FGF21 in promoting resistance to DIO in response to mitochondrial stress and highlights a role for GDF15 in promoting iWAT browning during DIO and potentially inducing futile calcium cycling in skeletal muscle. Some discrepancies between our model and similar models in the literature may stem from differences in the nature of the mitochondrial stress, level of GDF15 induction, and the fact that in our studies FGF21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>) and GDF15 were deleted in a tissue-specific manner, rather than globally. Also, additional methodological details such as age and duration of feeding might have contributed to differences in our overall conclusions.</p><p>Because OPA1 BKO mice have improved thermoregulation, we tested the role of BAT-derived GDF15 for adaptive thermogenesis. The increase in averaged baseline core body temperature observed in OPA1 BKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>) mice was no longer seen when GDF15 was deleted in BAT. Furthermore, in response to cold, mice lacking both OPA1 and GDF15 (DKO) became severely hypothermic as early as 4 hr into the cold exposure (4°C) protocol. Surprisingly, these mice had increased markers of browning in white adipose tissue (WAT) after 5 hr of cold exposure, despite similar degrees of sympathetic activation. Nonetheless, this increase in browning was not sufficient to maintain thermoregulation in the context of impaired BAT thermogenesis. Our data suggests increased futile calcium cycling in skeletal muscle of OPA1 BKO mice, but the induction in Serca1a levels was lost in DKO mice. Thus, in addition to severely impaired UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT, inhibited compensation in muscle non-shivering thermogenesis pathways in DKO mice may contribute to overall reduced thermogenic capacity in these mice, leading to severe cold-induced hypothermia. Therefore, at least in the context of mitochondrial stress, GDF15 expression in thermogenic adipocytes plays a critical role in maintaining core body temperature in cold-exposed mice, likely by regulating UCP1-mediated and UCP1-independent thermogenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study has ruled out a role for PERK in inducing the ISR in response to OPA1 deletion in BAT. Furthermore, we also unveiled a role for GDF15 in attenuating DIO and improving glucose clearance and hepatic steatosis in OPA1 BKO mice. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that BAT-derived GDF15 may play a role in energy metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and thermoregulation in the context of mitochondrial stress. Our data also show that GDF15 may exert its effects independently of changes in food intake but predominantly by increasing energy expenditure. The specific molecular mechanisms downstream of GDF15 regulating these metabolic adaptations and the potential peripheral signaling mechanisms that mediate these effects remain to be elucidated. Furthermore, future studies exploring the role of BAT-derived GDF15 on energy metabolism and thermogenesis under physiological conditions might reveal novel GDF15-mediated effects in metabolic homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse models</title><p>Experiments were performed in male and/or female mice on a C57Bl/6J background.

Sequencing libraries were prepped using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA Stranded kit and sequenced on a HiSeq4000. Two approaches were used for read alignment, mapping, and quantification. First, a workflow using HISAT2 (v2.1.0), featureCounts (v1.6.3), and DESeq2 (v1.22.2) was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Love et al., 2014</xref>). The second approach used pseudo-alignment and quantification with Kallisto (v0.45.0) and DESeq2 for differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bray et al., 2016</xref>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software from QIAGEN was utilized for identification of potentially modified pathways. Data visualization was performed using pheatmap and ggplot2 packages in R. RNA-seq data have been deposited to the GEO database under the accession number GSE218907.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Immunoblotting analysis was performed in BAT, iWAT, and gastrocnemius muscle, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pereira et al., 2021</xref>). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight and with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature.

Briefly, tissue was excised, rinsed in ice-cold PBS, and maintained in ice-cold isolation buffer (500 mM EDTA, 215 mM D-mannitol, 75 mM sucrose, 0.1% free fatty acid bovine serum albumin (BSA), 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 with KOH) until ready for homogenization. Bradford assay was performed to determine the protein concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Oxygen consumption</title><p>Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were assessed in 50 µg of mitochondrial protein using the Oroboros O<sub>2</sub>K Oxygraph system (Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria) in buffer Z containing (mM) 110 K-MES, 35 KCl, 1 EGTA, 5 K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>2</sub>, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, and 5 mg/ml BSA (pH 7.4, 295 mosmol/l). The following substrates and nucleotides were utilized: pyruvate (5 mM) + malate (2 mM), followed by addition of ADP (5 mM). To inhibit UCP1, GDP (1 mM) was added after pyruvate/malate. UCP1-dependent respiration was calculated by subtracting the OCRs after GDP addition from the OCR prior to adding GDP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Electron micrographs of BAT were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, BAT was trimmed into tiny pieces (1 mm in width) using a new blade to minimize mechanical trauma to the tissue. Tissues were fixed overnight (in 2% formaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde), rinsed (0.1% cacodylate pH 7.2), and stained with increasing concentrations of osmium (1.5, 4, and 6%), and dehydrated with increasing concentrations of acetone (50, 75, 95, and 100%). Samples were then embedded, cured, sectioned, and poststained with uranyl and lead. Sections were then imaged on a Jeol 1230 Transmission electron microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology</title><p>Fragments of BAT and iWAT were embedded in paraffin, portioned into 4-μm-thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA).

To determine statistical differences, Student’s <italic>t</italic>‐test was performed for comparison of two groups, and two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test was utilized when more than three groups were compared. A probability value of p≤0.05 was considered significantly different. Statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism Software (La Jolla, CA). The association between oxygen consumption or energy expenditure and body mass was calculated by ANCOVA using the CalR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mina et al., 2018</xref>). The significance test for the ‘group effect’ determined whether the two groups of interest were significantly different for the metabolic variable selected.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>R.J.S. has received research support from Fractyl, Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, and Eli Lilly.

Since FGF21 is dispensable for these metabolic benefits, here the authors investigate what mediates the activation of the integrated stress response in OPA1 BKO mice and downstream mediators of the protection from dietary obesity. By making new brown fat-selective double mutant mice, they suggest that PERK is not required for ATF4 induction in this context and that deletion of GDF15 in brown fat partially reverses the protection from dietary obesity seen with OPA deletion.</p><p>Strengths of this manuscript include the generation of new brown fat selective double knockout models (OPA1/PERK DKO and OPA1/GDF15 DKO). Moreover, the authors performed phenotyping on both standard chow and high fat diets. Their data indicate that PERK in brown adipocytes is not required for the induction of ATF4 seen in OPA1 deletion. They further show that OPA1 BKO mice with concomitant deletion of GDF15 show attenuated protection from dietary obesity. These mice also have impaired cold tolerance. Weaknesses of the manuscript include the absence of single knockout controls in the experiments presented. In addition, the metabolic phenotyping is not comprehensive and underlying mechanisms for the phenotypes observed are not deeply explored.</p><p>1. It is very difficult to interpret the findings of the experiments on the DKO models without single knockout controls. The reader is forced to make a mental comparison to OPA1 BKO mice in a prior paper from this group, but those mice were presumably not studied contemporaneously. Because of this, it is difficult to have confidence that the data support the conclusions made. For example, in Figure 2, the authors make OPA1/PERK DKO mice, and they argue that the increase in GDF15 seen with OPA1 deletion is unchanged (Figure 2D). However, without single KO controls, how can one be sure of this? In addition, the authors argue that OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice show attenuated protection from dietary obesity (Figure 4). Again, single OPA1 KOs controls would be needed to make this conclusion more solid.</p><p>2. The metabolic phenotyping is not complete in this manuscript. Specifically, the authors should: (i) show longitudinal weight curves instead of static bar graphs; (ii) provide a more thorough analysis of browning in Figure 2, including UCP1 Westerns, qPCR of other thermogenic genes, and histology/IHC; (iii) the analysis of energy expenditure should show longitudinal data over time in the light and dark cycles, rather than bar graphs.</p><p>3. The manuscript does not contain any mechanistic exploration of the findings here. The authors begin to do this in Figure 5, but what do they think explains the fact that OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice show partial protection from DIO, yet are also more cold-sensitive? Additionally, the authors argue that the increased browning in iWAT in DKO mice is due to increased sympathetic activation, but they do not present any data in support of this claim.</p><p>4. In Figure 1, panels C and D should be in the same graph.</p><p>5. In Figure 1, GDF15 levels are in the ng/ml range, but in Figure 2, they are in the pg/ml range. This should be clarified.</p><p>6. The PERK KO in BAT was not nearly as complete as the OPA1 KO. Why do the authors think this is? And could this explain the lack of an effect on ATF4?</p><p>7. On page 10 of the text, lines 4-5 (in reference to Figure 4), shouldn't there be a NOT in this sentence?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The report by Jena et al. describes the observation that genetic inhibition of both OPA1 and GDF15 using UCP1-cre leads to reductions in circulating GDF15 and reductions in body mass. These effects are associated with increases in EE during the dark but not light cycle, lower fat mass and reduced expression of thermogenic genes in WAT. The findings are interesting but there are many incomplete findings presented which require further clarification.</p><p>1. The data around the assessment of energy expenditure is incomplete and inconsistent. For example in Figure 2 the authors present the EE relative to body but no other data from this experiment is provided. In Figure 4F they show EE is elevated in the dark cycle but not the light cycle. They then plot VO2 relative to body mass in an n=4 mice and show no difference between groups. It is unclear where this data came from and if it was the same experiment and if so whether this was collected in the dark or light cycle? In both Figure 2 and Figure 4 VO2, VCO2, and RER should be presented as it is unclear whether a shift to Fatty acid oxidation might be the primary contributor to the increase in the calculated EE. In addition the sample size for all measures is very low making it possible the results may be due to a type 1 error.</p><p>2. The authors suggest that the increase in EE may be leading to the reduced body mass of the DKO mice. To validate this hypothesis authors should complete pair feeding experiments as it is currently unclear whether these relatively small changes in EE are critical for the phenotype which is central to the primary conclusions.</p><p>3. It is now well recognized that housing mice outside of the thermoneutral zone masks changes in adaptive thermogenesis. Authors should complete experiments at thermoneutrality.</p><p>4. Throughout the paper there is paucity of information besides the assessment of a few thermogenic genes about the morphology of the brown and white adipose tissue depots. Authors should provide adipose tissue histology images and ideally electron microscopy images detailing whether there may be defects in mitochondrial function.</p><p>5. Related to the above the authors suggest reduced WAT browning is the reason for the hypothermia with cold, however, it seems highly unlikely that given the relatively low thermogenic capacity of this tissue that this is the primary driver of the effect. For example, what about the very large reduction in BAT UCP1 in the DKO mice. Alternatively, did the authors examine whether there might be differences in shivering or skeletal muscle function?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86452.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers noted a lack of inclusion of single knockout controls.

This data is now included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is increase in serum GDF15 levels due to OPA1 BKO in Figure 1E is it in the physiological range for the receptor GFRAL to be activated?</p></disp-quote><p>Under physiological conditions, such as after prolonged high-fat feeding, GDF15 circulating levels in mice usually double, going from ~ 100pg/mL to ~ 200 pg/mL (DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2018.12.016). Thus, our data suggest that the increase observed in OPA1 BKO mice (Figure 2) is within the physiological range. Importantly, administration of recombinant GDF15 within the physiological range does not lead to changes in food intake, whereas at a higher concentration (~5000 pg/mL), food intake is reduced, suggesting GDF15-mediated activation of GFRAL (DOI: 10.1016/j.cmet.2018.12.016). Although not directly tested in this study, we believe that the increase in GDF15 levels observed in OPA1 BKO mice is likely insufficient to activate GFRAL signaling in the hindbrain to reduce food intake, which might explain why we do not see suppression of food intake associated with increased GDF15 levels in our model. Indeed, it has been proposed that the anorectic effect of GDF15 involving GFRAL requires a threshold of circulating GDF15 levels that is ≥400 pg/ml in mice, with lower values not affecting appetite (10.15252/embr.201948804). Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicate that GDF15 may also have peripheral effects. Indeed, GDF15 increases thermogenesis, lipid catabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation independently of changes in food intake (doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201607110), suggesting that GDF15 might also exert its effects through receptors other than GFRAL and independently of appetite reduction (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2022.08.004). We have expanded our discussion to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is giving additional GDF15 to WT or to the OPA1/GDF15 DKO to bring the concentration up to OPA1 BKO levels going to replicate these aspects of the OPA1 KO phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>These are interesting experiments to pursue. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct these studies. It is likely that restoring GDF15 circulating levels to the levels reported in OPA1 KO mice might replicate some of the OPA1 KO phenotype, particularly those shown to be mediated by GDF15. Future studies using mice lacking GFRAL should clarify which aspects of the OPA1 BAT KO phenotype are regulated by GDF15’s central effects, and which ones require GDF15’s action locally in BAT or possibly in other tissues.</p><p>Of note, the degree of GDF15 induction in OPA1 KO mice under baseline conditions is similar to that caused by cold stress or high-fat feeding in WT mice, and is not further induced in response to these stressors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. One of their conclusions states that &quot;Our data shows that GDF15 may exert its effects independently of changes in food intake but predominantly by increasing energy expenditure.&quot; The energy expenditure data shows no difference between WT in HFD and loss of GDF15 increases energy expenditure in chow feeding. This needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer bringing this to our attention. ANCOVA analysis revealed increased energy expenditure and oxygen consumption rates as a function to body mass in OPA1 BAT KO mice under isocaloric conditions and when fed obesogenic diet (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.66519 and Figure 1). These data led us to conclude that the increase in metabolic rates resulted in the lean phenotype observed in these mice. Although OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice had increased metabolic rates under isocaloric conditions (Figure 5 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 2), which we believe is mediated by FGF21 (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.66519), upon high-fat feeding, the group effect for energy expenditure as a function of body mass was no longer statistically significant (Figure 6 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). This suggested to us that GDF15 might regulate changes in energy expenditure in OPA1 BKO mice fed obesogenic diet. Therefore, OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice lack this increase in resting metabolic rates, resulting in increased weight gain relative to OPA1 BKO mice when fed HFD (Figure 6A). Interestingly, OPA1 BAT KO mice fed HFD have high UCP1 expression in iWAT, while OPA1/GDF15 BAT DKO mice lack this adaptation (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). Furthermore, we observed increased Serca1a levels in the skeletal muscle of OPA1 BKO mice, but not in OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice, suggesting GDF15 might also regulate futile calcium cycling in muscle, as recently demonstrated elsewhere (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06249-4). Although not directly tested in this study, it is possible that GDF15-dependent induction of thermogenic activity in iWAT and in muscle might contribute to the increased metabolic rates observed in OPA1 BAT KO mice during obesogenic conditions contributing to leanness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors followup on prior findings in which they showed that mice with a brown fat specific knockout of OPA1 (OPA1 BKO) demonstrate induction of ATF4 and FGF21 secretion and resistance to dietary obesity.

Although we understand that ideally the studies in the OPA1 BKO and OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice should have been performed in parallel, our data in OPA1 BKO mice was collected several years ago, and most of it was published in 2021 (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.66519). The cost and time associated with repeating all the experiments in parallel with the OPA1/GDF15 and OPA1/PERK DKO studies would have been prohibitive. Nonetheless, we have now added additional data on OPA1 BKO mice that were not previously published. Although we were unable to conduct new studies, we have added historical data (new Figure 1) on body mass and energy homeostasis on OPA1 BAT KO under normal chow and HFD conditions. We hope that the addition of these new data will aid the reviewers in evaluating the different phenotypes described for each mouse model. We believe these data strengthen our conclusions that GDF15 regulates metabolic rates and the resistance to DIO, as well as thermoregulation in cold-exposed OPA1 BKO mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For example, in DIO, although BAT thermogenesis was impaired, OPA1 BAT KO had increased browning of iWAT. This compensatory effect was lost in the absence of GDF15. Furthermore, we observed increased Serca1a levels in the skeletal muscle of OPA1 BKO mice, but not in OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice, suggesting GDF15 might also regulate futile calcium cycling in muscle, as recently demonstrated elsewhere (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06249-4). Although not directly tested in this study, it is possible that GDF15-dependent induction of thermogenic activity in iWAT and in muscle might contribute to the increased metabolic rates observed in OPA1 BAT KO mice during obesogenic conditions contributing to leanness.</p><p>Therefore, in the absence of GDF15, when browning is blunted, mice gain significantly more weight (Figure 6 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). On the other hand, after acute cold exposure, we see preserved browning of iWAT in DKO mice, while core body temperatures were highly reduced (Figure 7). This suggests that the degree of browning was insufficient to generate enough heat for cold-induced thermogenesis, in light of greatly reduced UCP1-dependent thermogenesis in BAT and inhibited compensatory thermogenic activation in muscle (via futile calcium cycling).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

And could this explain the lack of an effect on ATF4?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ observation that PERK levels are not as reduced in DKO mice as OPA1. We believe this reflects PERK expression in non-adipocytes cells in BAT. However, given the greatly reduced PERK expression, we find it highly unlikely that activation of the residual PERK, could account for the increased eIF2a activation and ATF4 induction. Our interpretation is that reduced total PERK corresponds to reduced levels of phosphorylated PERK. In this scenario, if PERK was required for eIF2a phosphorylation and ISR activation in OPA1 BKO mice, OPA1/PERK DKO mice would have had reduced (or normalized) and not increased eIF2a phosphorylation and ATF4 induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. On page 10 of the text, lines 4-5 (in reference to Figure 4), shouldn't there be a NOT in this sentence?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this may sound confusing. We write “Indeed, the group effect from the ANCOVA analysis for oxygen consumption rates in relation to body weight was not significantly different (Figure 4P), suggesting GDF15 may mediate the increase in metabolic rates observed in OPA1 BAT KO mice in DIO”. We believe, that when examined in light of the new data added on OPA1 BKO mice that this interpretation should make more sense. In the DIO studies, OPA1 BKO mice had elevated metabolic rates, which we believe contributed to the lean phenotype in these mice. Conversely, when GDF15 is deleted in the OPA1 BKO background, mice lack this increase in metabolic rates. Therefore, we concluded that GDF15 is required for this adaptation, and, therefore, upon its deletion, mice gain significantly more weight than the OPA1 BKO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The report by Jena et al. describes the observation that genetic inhibition of both OPA1 and GDF15 using UCP1-cre leads to reductions in circulating GDF15 and reductions in body mass. These effects are associated with increases in EE during the dark but not light cycle, lower fat mass and reduced expression of thermogenic genes in WAT. The findings are interesting but there are many incomplete findings presented which require further clarification.</p><p>1. The data around the assessment of energy expenditure is incomplete and inconsistent. For example in Figure 2 the authors present the EE relative to body but no other data from this experiment is provided. In Figure 4F they show EE is elevated in the dark cycle but not the light cycle. They then plot VO2 relative to body mass in an n=4 mice and show no difference between groups. It is unclear where this data came from and if it was the same experiment and if so whether this was collected in the dark or light cycle? In both Figure 2 and Figure 4 VO2, VCO2, and RER should be presented as it is unclear whether a shift to Fatty acid oxidation might be the primary contributor to the increase in the calculated EE. In addition the sample size for all measures is very low making it possible the results may be due to a type 1 error.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. Although we were unable to add more mice to these studies, in this revised manuscript we include additional metabolic data on all mouse models, including VO2, VCO2 and RER. Overall, our data reinforces the conclusion that GDF15 is likely mediating changes to resting metabolic rates in OPA1 BKO mice. Increased RER under obesogenic conditions in OPA1BKO mice, were abrogated in DKO mice, suggesting that GDF15 might also regulate fuel preference. We have included this in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors suggest that the increase in EE may be leading to the reduced body mass of the DKO mice. To validate this hypothesis authors should complete pair feeding experiments as it is currently unclear whether these relatively small changes in EE are critical for the phenotype which is central to the primary conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, due to time constrains and limited number of animals, we were unable to perform pair-feeding experiments. Nonetheless, our data argues against food intake being the main driver in our phenotype. Despite having elevated GDF15 levels, OPA1 BKO mice have increased food intake under obesogenic conditions (Figure 1), which is not detected in OPA1/GDF15 BKO mice. If food intake was driving the changes in body weight, then DKO mice should weigh less than OPA1 BKO mice, but the opposite is observed. Meanwhile, resting metabolic rates are increased in OPA1 BKO mice fed HFD, but are unchanged in DKO mice. Therefore, our data points to a role for higher energy expenditure as the driver of our phenotype rather than food intake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is now well recognized that housing mice outside of the thermoneutral zone masks changes in adaptive thermogenesis. Authors should complete experiments at thermoneutrality.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We previously performed experiments in OPA1 BKO mice reared at thermoneutrality (DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.66519). Our data showed that even under thermoneutral conditions, metabolic rates were elevated in these mice, and body mass was reduced. Based on this initial data, we decided to conduct our studies in DKO mice under room temperature conditions. Nonetheless, in this revised manuscript we show metabolic data collected in mice housed under thermoneutral conditions for 7 days (Figure 1 and Figure 5). Our data show that resting metabolic rates were increased in both OPA1 BKO and OPA1/GDF15 DKO under these conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Throughout the paper there is paucity of information besides the assessment of a few thermogenic genes about the morphology of the brown and white adipose tissue depots. Authors should provide adipose tissue histology images and ideally electron microscopy images detailing whether there may be defects in mitochondrial function.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We have now included morphological data (histology and TEM for OPA1/GDF15 DKO – Figure 5) and performed mitochondrial respirations in BAT (OPA1/PERK DKO – Figure 3 and OPA1/GDF15 DKO mice – Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Related to the above the authors suggest reduced WAT browning is the reason for the hypothermia with cold, however, it seems highly unlikely that given the relatively low thermogenic capacity of this tissue that this is the primary driver of the effect. For example, what about the very large reduction in BAT UCP1 in the DKO mice. Alternatively, did the authors examine whether there might be differences in shivering or skeletal muscle function?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to expand on this point. We indeed observe reduced expression of thermogenic genes in DKO mice in DIO and in response to cold exposure. Although UCP1 protein levels were unchanged under baseline conditions, UCP1-dependent respiration was greatly inhibited. Therefore, it is likely that deletion of GDF15 further impairs BAT thermogenesis rendering DKO mice severely cold intolerant. Although we initially thought that impaired thermogenesis resulted from impaired browning of iWAT, now we show data clearly demonstrating that browning is maintained after cold exposure, and tyrosine hydroxylase levels are unchanged, showing comparable sympathetic activation of iWAT.</p><p>Regarding shivering thermogenesis, unfortunately, we were unable to measure this directly, but molecular markers of muscle function (Serca1 and GLUT1) normally affected by cold exposure, were unchanged between cold exposed WT and DKO mice. Interestingly, we now show that Serca1a is induced in gastrocnemius muscle of OPA1 BKO mice (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), which is inhibited when GDF15 is deleted in BAT (Figure 6V). Therefore, we conclude that although it is unlikely that defects in shivering thermogenesis are contributing to our phenotype, it is possible that non-shivering thermogenesis in muscle via futile calcium cycling may be part of the compensatory mechanisms maintaining core body temperature in cold-exposed OPA1 BKO mice. Indeed, a recent study suggest that recombinant GDF15 induces muscle thermogenesis to maintain energy expenditure in mice (DOI: 10.1038/s41586-023-06249-4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
