How <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection can lead to poor clinical outcomes, despite low peripheral parasitaemia, remains a matter of intense debate. Estimation of total <italic>P. vivax</italic> biomass based on circulating markers indicates existence of a predominant parasite population outside of circulation. In this study, we investigate associations between both peripheral and total parasite biomass and host response in vivax malaria. We analysed parasite and host signatures in a cohort of uncomplicated vivax malaria patients from Manaus, Brazil, combining clinical and parasite parameters, multiplexed analysis of host responses, and ex vivo assays. Patterns of clinical features, parasite burden, and host signatures measured in plasma across the patient cohort were highly heterogenous. Further data deconvolution revealed two patient clusters, here termed Vivax<sup>low</sup> and Vivax<sup>high</sup>. These patient subgroups were defined based on differences in total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia. Overall Vivax<sup>low</sup> patients clustered with healthy donors and Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients showed more profound alterations in haematological parameters, endothelial cell (EC) activation, and glycocalyx breakdown and levels of cytokines regulating different haematopoiesis pathways compared to Vivax<sup>low</sup>. Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients presented more severe thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, along with enrichment of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLCR). When patients’ signatures were combined, high association of total parasite biomass with a subset of markers of EC activation, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia severity was observed. Finally, machine learning models defined a combination of host parameters measured in the circulation that could predict the extent of parasite infection outside of circulation. Altogether, our data show that total parasite biomass is a better predictor of perturbations in host homeostasis in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients than peripheral parasitaemia. This supports the emerging paradigm of a <italic>P. vivax</italic> tissue reservoir, particularly in the haematopoietic niche of bone marrow and spleen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic></kwd><kwd>malaria parasite</kwd><kwd>total biomass</kwd><kwd>tissue infection</kwd><kwd>endothelial activation</kwd><kwd>haematopoiesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019/01578-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silva-Filho</surname><given-names>João L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017/18611-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Costa</surname><given-names>Fabio TM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marti</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016/12855-9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silva-Filho</surname><given-names>João L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Data exploring host and parasite signatures in the peripheral blood indicate that total parasite biomass is a better predictor of <italic>P. vivax-</italic>induced host responses and pathogenesis than peripheral parasitemia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria remains a heavy burden across endemic regions worldwide. In 2018, <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> infection accounted for 41% of all malaria cases outside of Sub-Saharan Africa, with a total of 6.5 million cases and more than 2 billion people in 90 countries at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">World Malaria Reports, 2019</xref>). There are concerns that <italic>P. vivax</italic> elimination will be significantly more difficult than <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as the current measures for malaria control are less effective for <italic>P. vivax</italic> than for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, with the elimination of the former presenting a major challenge in areas that successfully reduced <italic>P. falciparum</italic> burden. This persistence is due to some unique biological features complicating treatment and elimination, including low peripheral parasitaemia and presence of dormant liver stages (hypnozoites) which relapse weeks or months after blood infection has been cleared.</p><p><italic>P. vivax</italic> infection is associated with low peripheral parasitaemia (&lt;2%) as a result of a strict host cell tropism to immature reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malleret et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mayor and Alano, 2015</xref>) that are exceedingly rare in peripheral blood (&lt;2%) but highly prevalent in the haematopoietic niche of bone marrow (BM) and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhodes et al., 2016</xref>). Because of limited microvascular adherence in vivo and endothelial cell (EC) binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lacerda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valecha et al., 2009</xref>), it was generally assumed that peripheral parasitaemia reflects the majority of <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites during infection. However, discrepancy of parasite biomass based on systemic biomarkers such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) compared to peripheral parasitaemia supports existence of a major <italic>P. vivax</italic> reservoir outside of circulation, particularly in patients with complicated outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that late asexual blood stage <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites (i.e. schizonts) are capable of cytoadhering to endothelial host receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De las Salas et al., 2013</xref>) and present at reduced abundance compared to the other blood stages in the blood of <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Obaldia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lopes et al., 2014</xref>). In experimentally infected non-human primates (NHPs), a significant enrichment of sexual stages (gametocytes) and schizonts in BM sinusoids and parenchyma has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Obaldia et al., 2018</xref>), supporting previous evidence from multiple case reports that identified <italic>P. vivax</italic> in BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yx et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wickramasinghe et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wickramasinghe and Abdalla, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salutari et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Machado Siqueira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacerda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brito et al., 2020</xref>). A series of recent studies in acute and chronic human <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection have meanwhile provided direct evidence that BM and spleen represent the major reservoir of parasite biomass in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kho et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kho et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><p><italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites can elicit a potent host response, including inflammation and EC activation, and cause severe and fatal manifestations at significantly lower peripheral parasitaemia than the more virulent species, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2010</xref>). However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying these alterations in host homeostasis and their relationship with <italic>P. vivax</italic> biomass are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacerda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naing and Whittaker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tangpukdee et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here we systematically investigated host responses in a cross-sectional cohort of uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients from Manaus, in the Brazilian Amazon region. Our analysis revealed an association between alterations in host homeostasis, including EC activation, damage, and haematological disturbances, such as thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and increased neutrophils turnover, with total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia. These findings are in line with the emerging paradigm of a clinically relevant parasite reservoir outside of circulation and merit systematic investigations of this reservoir in vivax malaria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients present with haematological changes</title><p>We have conducted a cross-sectional study with uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria patients seen at FMT-HVD in Manaus, Brazil.

In order to identify possible stratification of patients into distinct subgroups, we further analysed the clinical data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), parasite parameters, and Luminex data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) from the same 31 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> patients and 9 controls as above. After z-score normalization, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for data dimensionality reduction, considering the large number of variables in our dataset. Next, we ran K-means clustering (k) followed by bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s2sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>) to identify possible subclusters of individuals.

In order to visualize covariables of the observed patient distribution (PCA) and clustering (K-means), we plotted the correlation (loading score) of each input variable with a principal component (PC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

Direct comparison of the two patient subgroups revealed significant higher total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia or parasite load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva-Filho et al., 2021</xref>), z-score comparison further demonstrated that total parasite biomass was higher than and not correlated with peripheral parasitaemia levels or parasite load, particularly in patients of cluster 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In addition, PvLDH was the input parasite variable with the highest loading score (correlation = 0.59) and lowest p-value (0.0000917) in the first PC dimension when compared with peripheral parasitaemia and parasite load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

The network topology is drastically altered in symptomatic <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients, largely due to the introduction of parasite parameters in the patient graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The network analysis revealed a decentralized topology, lower complexity and connectivity between the edges with data from <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients compared to the highly dense, homogenous and centralized network graph of healthy donors (91 edges vs. 166 edges, respectively). Of note, the network pattern described in our study is similar to protein-protein-associated networks described previously in <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria and in other clinical contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mendonça et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frankenstein et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, due to its decentralized and heterogenous patterns of interactions, the network graph of <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients is separated into three modules of strong interactions, with closely related biological functions. Module 1 is formed by markers of EC activation and damage, together with lymphocyte, platelet, and neutrophil counts in addition to the megakaryocyte differentiation-inducing cytokines (TPO and IL-11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In support of the role of EC activation and damage in the haematological changes observed in this cohort, hierarchical clustering revealed a positive correlation between adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and E-selectin and EC glycocalyx breakdown (Syndecan-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, VCAM-1, E-selectin, Ang-2 and VWF-A2, and Syndecan-1 are negatively correlated with platelet and lymphocyte counts, while ICAM-1 is positively correlated with neutrophil counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Module 2 is formed by proinflammatory cytokines with myelopoiesis-inducing effects and molecules associated with platelet activation and coagulation cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Interestingly, EC activation markers and Syndecan-1 (EC damage) from module 1 also display positive correlations with myelopoiesis-inducing cytokines from module 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Finally, module 3 is formed by Ang-2 and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β negatively associated with haemoglobin, haematocrit, and RBC numbers (anaemia markers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Most notably, PvLDH connects the two main functional modules 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Accordingly with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A and B</xref>, the biological significance of total parasite biomass, but not peripheral parasitaemia or parasite load, in affecting host response is also corroborated by the high significant and positive associations of PvLDH with multiple host parameters, including Syndecan-1 (EC damage), VCAM-1, VWF (EC activation and platelet pooling), and IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α (inflammation and myelopoiesis-inducing cytokines) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Meanwhile, platelet, lymphocyte, and neutrophil counts are negatively correlated with high significance (p-value&lt;0.0001) with total parasite biomass, but not with peripheral parasitaemia or parasite load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The association between endothelial activation, Syndecan-1, and parasite biomass (PvLDH) indicates a positive feedback loop between glycocalyx breakdown, activation of endothelial receptors such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and parasite accumulation in deep tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lopes et al., 2014</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, application of a best-fit classification tree model demonstrated that Syndecan-1, IL-6, and platelet counts are the most dominant predictor attributes capable of classifying <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients based on total parasite biomass levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Using this model, all <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients were correctly classified into either low (Vivax<sup>low</sup>) or high (Vivax<sup>high</sup>) total parasite biomass (PvLDH). In turn, PvLDH is a relevant predictor attribute (high information gain) in predicting thrombocytopenia severity, and it is associated with increased severity of thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these data further support the hypothesis that a parasite population outside of circulation, as represented by total parasite biomass, is driving the host response including EC activation and damage as well as haematological disturbances (i.e. lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia) in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of host and parasite signatures detected in the plasma of a cross-sectional cohort of uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria. Initial analysis of a series of circulating host biomarkers revealed significant levels of thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and anaemia, as well as EC activation and damage across <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients compared to healthy controls. Deconvolution of heterogeneity across patients revealed two patient subgroups (Vivax<sup>high</sup> and Vivax<sup>low</sup>) characterized by differences in total parasite biomass (based on circulating PvLDH levels) but not peripheral parasitaemia (based on blood smears). We observed a significant correlation between total parasite biomass (but not peripheral parasitaemia) and systemic levels of markers of EC activation and damage and haematopoietic perturbations. In addition, by applying a supervised machine learning tree-structured model, we were able to associate EC damage and thrombocytopenia with parasite biomass. In agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva-Filho et al., 2021</xref>), our observations further suggest that total parasite biomass as measured by PvLDH is a better predictor of <italic>P. vivax</italic> host responses and pathogenesis than peripheral parasitaemia. Furthermore, these findings support the emerging paradigm of a major <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasite reservoir outside of circulation, particularly in the haematopoietic niche of BM and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva-Filho et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The existence of a significant <italic>P. vivax</italic> reservoir outside of circulation was first predicted by disproportionately high PvLDH levels in peripheral circulation compared to parasitaemia by blood smear (particularly in patients with complicated outcomes) and by modelling using experimental <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgy</italic> infections in NHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fonseca et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies provide direct evidence that BM and spleen represent the major reservoir of parasite biomass in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Obaldia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brito et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kho et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kho et al., 2021b</xref>). PvLDH is produced by viable or recently killed parasites and hence considered a proxy for ongoing rather than past infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Druilhe et al., 2007</xref>). PvLDH antigen capture ELISA established a direct relationship between pLDH levels and <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasitaemia in ex vivo experiments, demonstrating that pLDH reflects total <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasite biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Druilhe et al., 2007</xref>). Our study further explores the relevance of PvLDH as a prognostic marker of host perturbations and disease severity, with a particular focus on markers of changes in the haematopoietic niches of BM and spleen. A major observation in the network graph of <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients is the central position of the total parasite biomass marker PvLDH due to its equally strong interactions with the two main functional modules 1 and 2. Given that the haematopoietic niches of the BM and the spleen are the major reservoir of parasite biomass, interactions of PvLDH with these two main modules indicate an interplay between parasite infection in these niches and endothelial activation/damage as well as the proinflammatory response that results in myeloid-biased differentiation, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia. Furthermore, the highly significant and positive associations between endothelial activation, Syndecan-1, and parasite biomass (PvLDH) indicate a positive feedback loop between glycocalyx breakdown, activation of endothelial receptors such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and parasite accumulation in deep tissues. Vivax<sup>High</sup> patients show higher plasma levels of all these markers. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yeo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 2021</xref>), we propose that elevated EC activation and glycocalyx damage increases the exposure of adhesion molecules, which in turn favours endothelial cytoadherence of <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected RBCs, particularly in the splenic red pulp cords and in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kho et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Introini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hempel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Toda et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, application of a best-fit classification tree model identifies Syndecan-1 as a putative host biomarker (EC glycocalyx breakdown marker) predicting total parasite biomass in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients. We hypothesize that elevated endothelial activation and damage in Vivax<sup>High</sup> patients results in increased cytoadherence of <italic>P. vivax</italic> iRBCs and hence accumulation and growth in deep tissues, thus reducing the fraction of the parasite biomass in circulation.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected individuals, a wide range of complicated clinical syndromes occur in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients even at low or subpatent parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird, 2013</xref>), thus indicating that peripheral parasitaemia is a poor predictor of clinical outcomes. Two lines of evidence support our conclusion that severity of infection is dependent on parasite biomass instead. First, the discrepancy between PvLDH levels and peripheral parasitaemia determined by blood smears is more evident in <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected patients with complicated outcomes: the ratio of plasma pLDH to peripheral parasitaemia is sixfold higher than in non-severe patients. The same comparison between severe and non-severe <italic>P. falciparum</italic> patients reveals only a 1.4-fold difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barber et al., 2015</xref>). Second, although thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia are not included in the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for defining severe malaria, it has been associated with severe manifestations and the need for blood and platelet transfusions in severe vivax malaria. This points out their clinical relevance in malaria diagnosis and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacerda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naing and Whittaker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gerardin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kochar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kochar et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that these haematological complications could be explored as markers of severity for this species. Both severe thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were more frequent in patients in cluster 2 (Vivax<sup>high</sup>) in our study. By integrating these clinical perturbations with host biomarker measurements and parasite parameters, we demonstrated the high attribute value of total parasite biomass in predicting the severity of thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia and highly significant correlations with endothelial activation, glycocalyx breakdown, and other markers of inflammation.</p><p>Thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and anaemia are the most frequent <italic>P. vivax-</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-associated haematological complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacerda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naing and Whittaker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tangpukdee et al., 2008</xref>). In our cohort, 34, 85, and 87% of patients exhibited anaemia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the damage or excessive removal of platelets in <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection, including oxidative stress, platelet phagocytosis, IgG binding to platelet-bound malaria antigens, spleen pooling, or increased circulating nucleic acids levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lacerda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naing and Whittaker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kochar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrade et al., 2010</xref>). EC activation and damage also plays a role in intravascular platelet agglutination and increased platelet clearance from the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Park et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Punnath et al., 2019</xref>). Our data also demonstrate that thrombocytopenia is associated with an increase in IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α. We also observed elevated levels of cytokines inducing megakaryocyte differentiation, TPO, and IL-11, suggesting that a compensatory response is mounted in the BM to counterbalance the massive decrease of platelets in the periphery. In contrast, the relatively large drop in peripheral lymphocyte numbers we observed in the <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients is likely non-specific effect, for example, pooling in the enlarged spleen rather than a response by <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hviid and Kemp, 2000</xref>). Corroborating the potential role of total parasite biomass, rather than peripheral parasitaemia, in haematological disturbances (i.e. lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia), Figures S7 and S8 show that total parasite biomass increases accordingly with thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia severity. Patients with severe thrombocytopenia also show more severe leukopenia, lymphopenia, and mega platelets (higher MPV). In addition, plasma levels of cytokines – such as TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-8, IL-10; EC activation/damage markers, VCAM-1, E-selectin, VWF-A2, Ang-2, Ang-2:Ang1 ratio; Syndecan-1; thrombopoiesis-inducing cytokines, TPO and IL-11; platelet activation marker, CD40L; and neutrophil activation marker, L-selectin – follow the increase in thrombocytopenia severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). A similar pattern is observed when stratifying patients based on lymphopenia severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, a tree-structured model demonstrated that PvLDH, along with VCAM-1 and Syndecan-1, is a relevant predictor attribute (high information gain) in predicting thrombocytopenia severity in our cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our data support previous studies suggesting a role for EC activation and damage in increased leukocyte adhesion, intravascular platelet agglutination with increased platelet clearance from the circulation and skewing of haematopoiesis towards the myeloid lineage (likely at the expense of lymphopoiesis) in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Mast et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Mast et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gomes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boiko and Borghesi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kovtonyuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dos-Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pillinger and Kam, 2017</xref>). <italic>P. vivax</italic> elicits a stronger inﬂammatory response and more pronounced endothelial activation when compared with other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections with similar or higher peripheral parasitaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeo et al., 2010</xref>); however, the role of EC activation in <italic>P. vivax</italic> pathogenesis is not yet understood. Damage of the EC plasma membrane, as represented by glycocalyx breakdown, has been associated with poor prognostic outcome in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yeo et al., 2019</xref>), but there is no data available for <italic>P. vivax</italic>. In our cohort, soluble EC activation biomarkers (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, Ang-2, CD40L, vWF-A2) and the EC damage product, Syndecan-1, are positively correlated with thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, anaemia, and neutrophil enrichment in the peripheral blood. In addition, these biomarkers are positively correlated with increased circulating levels of cytokines inducing megakaryocyte differentiation (e.g. IL-11 and TPO) and with cytokines inducing myeloid-biased HSC differentiation (e.g. TNF-α, IL1-α, IL6, IL-8, and G-CSF), suggesting both direct and indirect links between EC activation and damage and haematological perturbations. Total parasite biomass-inducing EC activation might act synergistically with inflammatory changes potentially leading to splenic platelet pooling and platelet clumping in the vasculature without DIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lacerda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pillinger and Kam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, increased activation-induced cell death (AICD) in T cells, splenic T-cell accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hviid and Kemp, 2000</xref>), or decreased lymphopoiesis due to myeloid-biased HSC differentiation induced by inflammatory cytokines and EC activation in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boiko and Borghesi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva-Filho et al., 2021</xref>) might explain the severe lymphopenia and neutrophilia in vivax patients. Together, such mechanisms could explain the link between parasite biomass and EC activation/damage with haematological changes observed in vivax patients that might contribute to pathogenesis and disease severity.</p><p>In a second series of experiments, we performed ex vivo stimulation of HUVECs with the plasma of the <italic>P. vivax</italic> cohort demonstrating that the mixture of parasite and host factors can directly induce EC activation in the absence of parasitized RBCs. Of note, functional differences between HUVECs and adult vascular endothelium, including lack of ABO blood group antigen expression, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Donnell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, EC stimulation with patient plasma may be further evaluated using primary vascular ECs.</p><p>ECs are capable of responding to pathogens by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), which might play a key role in inducing EC activation when detecting <italic>P. vivax</italic> molecules enriched in the tissues where the parasite accumulates. ECs also express specific cytokine/chemokine receptors to detect proinﬂammatory signals released systemically or locally by activated immune cells in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernardo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bevilacqua, 1993</xref>). As a result, EC activation induces exocytosis of secretory granules known as Weibel–Palade bodies that leads to the release of Ang-2 and VWF, as well as transcriptional programmes that activate expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and secreted cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Mast et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernardo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bevilacqua, 1993</xref>). However, EC pathophysiology is complex, and changes represent a heterogenous spectrum ranging from simple perturbation to activation and even EC damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Mast et al., 2009</xref>). Our Luminex data clearly confirm such heterogeneity in the spectrum of EC changes due to <italic>P. vivax</italic> infection, with systemic increase of markers of EC activation and damage only detected in Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients. The ex vivo data show that increased systemic host proinflammatory factors and/or parasite products can alter EC properties, including activation of adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines and downregulation of ADAMTS13. In contrast, vascular integrity was not affected. These data indicate that systemic inflammatory responses in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients can lead to local EC activation but not vascular damage, central events in malaria pathogenesis. It is likely that other circulating factors that we have not directly measured in our study are also contributing to EC activation and vascular permeability. In particular, extracellular vesicles (EV) originating from ECs, platelets, and RBCs are present during malaria infection and are known to modulate the host immune response to the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Toda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mantel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mantel et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, infected RBCs release EVs containing immunogenic parasite antigens, which activate macrophages, induce neutrophil migration, and alter endothelial barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mantel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mantel et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>P. vivax</italic>, plasma-derived EVs from iRBCs are taken up by human spleen ﬁbroblasts (hSFs). This event signals NF-kB translocation and upregulation of ICAM-1 expression, facilitating cytoadherence of <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected reticulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Toda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although our study lacks longitudinal information, the findings might have clinical implications during and after treatment of vivax malaria. Several case reports demonstrate progressive clinical deterioration after commencement of treatment in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients, associated with parasite killing that result in haemolysis of iRBCs and intravascular inﬂammation and oedema in response to the products released from these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anstey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anstey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Val et al., 2017</xref>). Patients presenting with a strong host response during acute infection might therefore be at increased risk of deteriorating and developing severe symptoms after commencement of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, identification of unique biological signatures in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients might help to build rational approaches to the diagnosis, prognosis, and individualized treatment to modulate the host response to vivax malaria.</p><p>Altogether, our data indicate that changes in clinical parameters and biomarkers detected in the plasma of <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients are the result of both systemic host responses and local infection in tissue reservoirs such as BM and spleen. Our analysis shows that measuring a combination of host parameters (e.g. Syndecan-1, IL-6, platelet levels) and total parasite biomass (PvLDH) could predict the extent of parasite infection outside of circulation. Our data also instigate future investigations of systemic signatures with parallel analysis focused on tissue responses, particularly in reservoirs such as the haematopoietic niche of BM and spleen, which has great potential to advance better diagnosis and treatment of <italic>P. vivax</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Next, plates were washed and biotinylated anti-PvLDH detection antibody (clone 6c9, Vista Diagnostics International LLC; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2892827">AB_2892827</ext-link>), diluted 1:4000 in blocking buffer, was incubated for 2 hr at room temperature, followed by streptavidin-HRP incubation for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated for 20 min with substrate solution. Optical density was determined at 450 nm. Cut-off of positivity was defined by correcting absorbance values generated in the plasma samples from healthy donors (controls) by blank values (plate controls), with both values being in the same range. Absorbance values higher than controls were considered positive. In parallel, we used schizont extracts to perform standard curves and lower absorbance values were in the range of O.D = 0.03–0.04. All positive patient samples gave O.D. values equal to or higher than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>PCA and K-means hierarchical clustering</title><p>Haematological parameters (haemoglobin levels, haematocrit, differential blood cell counts), parasite parameters (peripheral parasitaemia by blood smear, parasite load by qPCR, and parasite biomass PvLDH ELISA), and Luminex data (24 biomarkers) from the selected 9 healthy donors and 31 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>vivax</italic> patients were normalized to avoid variable-specific bias and z-score values were determined. Since the host response is complex and multidimensional (one dimension per Luminex biomarker), we applied dimension reduction and clustering for ease of downstream analysis. For this, all variables were used as input for PCA to reduce the dimensionality of data using the <italic>PCA</italic> function in the <italic>FactoMineR</italic> package in R. For visualization of PCA results, <italic>ggplot2</italic>, <italic>factoextra,</italic> and <italic>corrplot</italic> packages were used. For each PC, we determined which variables are better represented and the contribution (correlation or loading score) of each variable for each (PC). Investigation of eigenvalues and the percentage of explained variances retained by the PCs demonstrated that the first 10 PCs accounted for the variance of the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, variables were well represented by the first two PCs (Dim 1 and Dim 2), which were therefore retained for further analysis. In parallel, we performed K-means clustering (k) followed by bootstrapping, which produced the most stable clusters with k = 2 (cluster 1 = 21 individuals; cluster 2 = 18 individuals), which seemed to be the most consistent with the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s2sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s2sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref> contains the numerical data representing cluster stability via bootstrapping. The metrics of interest is jaccard_index, which measures the cluster similarity across bootstrap samples. Similar to the above, k = 2 gives stable clusters for all configurations (jaccard_index 0.9 and 0.86). Using Monte Carlo reference-based consensus clustering (M3C) analysis (<italic>M3C</italic> function in the <italic>M3C</italic> package in R) indicated that k = 2 is the optimal number of clusters when using K-means clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>), but when determining spectral clusters, different from elliptical k-means clusters, k = 3 gives the best number of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Correlation plots and heatmap visualization</title><p>Heatmaps were created to visualize variable values using R function <italic>Complex Heatmap</italic>. They represent z-scores using row scaling obtained by centring represented variables with the <italic>scale</italic> function, followed by column clustering using average cluster method and Euclidean distance metric in R. The same software was used to determine pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficients between variables by running the function <italic>cor</italic> in the <italic>ggcorrplot</italic> package and visualized as a correlogram using R function <italic>corrplot</italic> in the <italic>Hmisc</italic> package displaying positive correlations in red and negative correlations in blue using p≤0.01 as a cut-off.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Recursive partitioning decision tree classification and machine learning models</title><p>We used recursive partitioning decision tree classification models to evaluate dominant signatures (attributes) predicting a specific outcome. For decision tree construction, we applied the C4.5 algorithm, using the <italic>RWeka</italic>, <italic>caret</italic> (Classification and Regression Training) and <italic>e1071</italic> packages or the <italic>rpart</italic> package in R. First, the library <italic>caret</italic> is used to create a 10-fold training set to train the model. Then, the algorithm implements decision trees (using the J48 method, which is an open-source Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm) starting with all instances in the same group, then repeatedly divides the data based on attributes until each item is classified. The attribute on which to divide is selected by information gain, a statistical technique for determining which attribute split will most cleanly divide the data. To avoid overfitting, sometimes the tree is pruned back. In parallel, the algorithm performs k-fold cross-validation to measure the performance of a given predictive model and indicates which one has the higher accuracy. Here, we used k = 10 to yield test error rate estimates that suffer neither from excessively high bias nor from very high variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">James et al., 2013</xref>). In parallel, features with mean decrease accuracy larger than six were used for random forest. In the random forest analysis, a thousand trees were built using R package <italic>randomForest</italic> (version 4.6.14). The normalized additive predicting probability was computed as the ﬁnal predicting probability. Those selected important features were used for the random forest analysis on the test cohort for model validation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Stimulation of HUVEC with patients’ plasma pools</title><p>After standardization procedures, primary HUVEC were stimulated or not (mock control) in culture media for 6 hr – to evaluate mRNA expression – or for 18 hr – to evaluate protein expression – with complete EGM-2 medium (Lonza) containing 30% (v/v) plasma pools generated from the three subgroups – healthy control, Vivax<sup>low</sup> and Vivax<sup>high</sup> – and 3 U/L heparin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Real-time quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>After 6 hr stimulation, total RNA was isolated from the cell lysate using the miRVana miRNA Extraction kit (Ambion) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized with TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and mRNA expression of genes were determined by qRT-PCR.

The system then applies weak alternating currents through the electrode array and continuously measures the ability of the cell monolayer to impede the movement of electrons between adjacent EC (resistance). Briefly, cells were seeded at 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well on fibronectin-coated (10 µg/mL) eight-well arrays (8WE10, Applied Biophysics) containing interdigitated gold electrodes. ECs were seeded 48 hr before experiments and the resistance started to be recorded after 48 hr. Only wells with resistance &gt;1500 ohms and stable impedance/resistance readings were used. Before stimulation, resistance was continuously monitored for 2 hr to confirm monolayer stability represented by a plateau in the resistance curve. Stimuli (20% v/v pooled plasma in complete medium) was then added to wells under continuous impedance/resistance monitoring for 12 hr.

The reported evidence will have a significant impact on diagnosing infectious diseases. The language in the manuscript is very good. However, some typos were reported. Some paragraphs might need particular attention to punctuation. Overall, the work is very good. The statistics are straight forward. However, there are a couple of major points that must be addressed before publication. Some of my comments are just recommendations to clarify some sections of the text.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The statistical methods can be improved by using generalised mixed models (GLMM).</p><p>1. PCA graphs need to be organised in more descriptive ways. Dim1 and Dim2 in each axis need to be defined clearly in the figures. PCA in Figure 2 c is very difficult to follow, and it needs to be organised.</p></disp-quote><p>Figures have been amended to be more self-explanatory and clearer to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In this study, patients were male and female, and we know already male and female haematological parameters are hugely different, specially Hb level, and so on. My question is how the sex variable is treated in this study? Did your control group were from both sexes? Sex could be treated as a random variable in all studies if GLMM models were used.</p></disp-quote><p>Information in how the sex variable was treated in the study has been added to the methods section. In our cross-sectional study with uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria patients seen at FMT-HVD in Manaus, Brazil, patients and healthy donors (controls) were matched by age and sex. In both groups, frequency of female individuals was 30% and male individuals 70%.</p><p>We think sex is better fitted as fixed effect since only two levels for this factor are possible. Thus, we used linear models with age and sex as fixed variables for statistical testing and to ensure that the differences observed between <italic>P.vivax</italic>- infected patients and controls, as well as between the clusters, were only due to disease status. This analysis showed that red blood cells count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MXD and neutrophils counts (this parameter only when comparing the clusters) needed to be corrected only due to sex influence. For these parameters, estimates of predicted sex influence were subtracted from the raw parameter values and residuals were used for statistical testing. We have added this information in the Methods section as indicated below:</p><p>“Patients and healthy donors were age and sex-matched, with a frequency of 30% female and 70% male individuals in both groups.”</p><p>“To ensure that differences observed between <italic>P. vivax</italic> – infected patients and controls, as well as between the clusters, were due to disease status and not confounded by age or sex, the clinical parameters were fitted as response variables in a linear model with sex and/or age fitted as explanatory variables. Age and sex were included in the model if their coefficients were estimated as different from zero with p-value &lt; 0.05.”</p><p>The residuals from the linear model were then used as age and/or sex corrected parameters in subsequent analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why 6h and 18h used for the HUVEC evaluation?</p></disp-quote><p>We ran several optimization experiments with individual plasma samples where we observed maximal mRNA expression changes after 6h of stimulation. For experiments detecting protein expression (IFA and flow cytometry), we increased the stimulation time to 18h. Preliminary experiments suggested this to be the optimal duration without compromising cellular viability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is mentioned only neutrophil enriched in this study, if myelopoiesis is affected, why the other granulocytes were not showed significant enhancement?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data reveal no change in the number of circulating neutrophils in the different clusters of individuals. However, mixed cell counts (MXD), a parameter representing monocytes, basophils and eosinophils numbers, was significantly reduced in Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients. As a result, there was a significant enrichment of neutrophils in the leukocyte fraction in the blood of Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients as well as a higher Neutrophil:Lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) (Figure 4). In hematopoietic progenitors, stochastic changes in each factor’s concentration could result in one factor’s becoming more abundant and committing a hematopoietic progenitor to a particular lineage. To generate each mature granulocyte population (e.g. basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils), common myeloid precursor cells (CMPs) and later precursors for granulocytic and monocytic lineages (GMPs) follow in the BM different lineage commitment programs, tightly-regulated or instructed by a specific set of soluble factors, cell-cell interactions and transcription factors, that define cell fate decisions and lineage restrictions. For instance, differential PU.1 activity can specify different cell fates during haematopoiesis regulating monocyte and neutrophils differentiation. Genetic and biochemical analyses have shown that G-CSF can direct granulocyte differentiation by changing the ratio of C/EBPα to PU.1 (Zhu et al., Oncogene 2002; Friedman Oncogene 2002; Dahl et al., Nat Immunol 2003). High expression levels of PU.1 and C/EBPα, stimulated by G-CSF, promote GMP differentiation to neutrophils and inhibits monocyte differentiation, while only PU.1 expression, IRF-8 and lower expression/activity of C/EBPs induce GMP differentiation to monocytes (Zhu et al., Oncogene 2002; Friedman Oncogene 2002; Dahl et al., Nat Immunol 2003). Meanwhile, a combination of PU.1, C/EBPβ and low levels of GATA-1 differentiates GMPs to eosinophil lineage (Kulessa et al., 1995; McDevitt et al., 1997; Yamaguchi et al., 1999) and PU.1 must also cooperate with GATA2 to direct mast cell differentiation (Walsh et al., Immunity 2002). In addition, eosinophil and basophil differentiation are induced by a different set of cytokines, usually produced in prevalent T-helper 2 response, such as IL-5, which should be inhibited in the strong Th1 environment evidenced by our and previous Luminex data in Pv patients. The enrichment of activated neutrophils in the peripheral circulation of <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients could be due to a response that specifically enhances neutrophil production and release from the bone marrow (BM). This hypothesis is supported by emerging evidence for enrichment of <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites in the hematopoietic niche of BM, our Luminex data showing significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with emergency myelopoiesis (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8), and increased circulating levels of G-CSF, the major inducer of neutrophils production in the BM. Likewise, increased activation-induced cell death (AICD) in T cells, splenic T-cell and platelet accumulation or decreased lymphopoiesis due to myeloid-biased HSC differentiation induced by inflammatory cytokines and EC activation in the BM (refs 36,37,39) might explain the neutrophil enrichment in vivax patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I would also ask the authors to speculate a bit on, What could be the mechanism behind the different function of <italic>P. vivax</italic> compared to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>? From an evolutionary perspective, the parasite should rather become softer and keep the host alive for its own benefit.</p></disp-quote><p>One of the characteristics of <italic>P. vivax</italic> that could play an important role in immunity is its restriction to invade immature reticulocytes. For example, the infected reticulocyte could play a role in the presentation of parasite antigens as reticulocytes (but not mature RBCs) express MHC-I and are capable to process and present antigens on their surface for recognition by T cells. Indeed, it has been shown that reticulocytes act directly as an antigen-presenting cell, emphasizing the importance of erythrocyte surface antigens both in the induction as well as the target of a protective immune response (Burel et al. 2016, Junqueira et al. 2018). Recent investigations comparing <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> controlled human infection models (CHMIs) also revealed marked differences in the immune profiles generated following infection with the two species and postulated that protective immune responses to <italic>Plasmodium</italic> are species-specific. It has been hypothesized that this difference is due to strict <italic>P. vivax</italic> tropism for MHC-I-expressing reticulocytes that, unlike mature red blood cells, can present antigen directly to CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. Specifically, <italic>P. vivax</italic> but not <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection led to the expansion of a specific subset of CD38<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells which were associated with an activated phenotype and cytotoxic potential. Corroborating Burel et al. findings in the CHMI model, Junqueira et al. showed that <italic>P. vivax</italic>–infected reticulocytes express HLA-I. In <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected patients, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood express high levels of cytotoxic proteins, recognize and form immunological synapses with <italic>P. vivax</italic>–infected reticulocytes in HLA–dependent manner. Next, it was showed that <italic>P. vivax</italic>-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells release their cytotoxic granules to kill both host cell and intracellular parasite, which prevented reinvasion (Junqueira et al. 2018). Although these data indicate a protective role of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood-stage malaria, it is not clear whether these lymphocytes would always be beneficial because they might contribute to anemia, inflammation or other pathological sequelae of infection, which needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In that work, it was already demonstrated that <italic>P. vivax</italic> biomass is related to plasma concentration of LDH levels. As such, the present work cannot be considered of high novelty. Yet, through a meticulous approach including clinical data, computational approaches, machine learning, LDH measurement, multiplex analysis and quantitave RT-PCR, the authors here have extended the original observations that a large biomass of <italic>P. vivax</italic> parasites is out of blood circulation. In contrast, unlike the original observations of Anstey´s group, a correlation between total parasite biomass and systemic levels of markers of endothelial cells activation, was observed. The manuscript is very well written and the discussion brings new knowledge in this key topic for elimination of malaria. This manuscript is therefore recommended for publication after the following comments are addressed.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The vascular endothelium plays a pivotal role in malaria. Therefore, to test whether cell and/or parasite factors affect the vascular endothelium, HUVEC cells were used in this study. This is of major concern as endothelial cells from the bone marrow, where most hematological disturbances, notoriously thrombocytopenia, occur, were not used instead. HUVEC cells seems the only endothelial cell that does not express ABO blood group antigens, thus suggesting that surface expression on these cells is highly altered (O´Donnell et al., 2000 J Vasc Res). Moreover, significant functional differences between HUVEC cells and adult vascular endothelium have been reported (Chan et al., 2004). Together, this indicates that results obtained with HUVEC cells might not reflect responses of the bone marrow vascular endothelium. As one of the corresponding authors have ample experience with working with human bone marrow endothelial cells (Mantel et al., 2016 Nat Comm), it is suggested to perform some experiments with these cells to assure extrapolation of the results obtained with HUVEC cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that performing ex vivo assays with primary human bone marrow endothelial cells would be an excellent alternative. However, we would like to argue that HUVECs are also suitable for our purposes. HUVECs are widely used to study endothelial barrier function, for example in the context of angiogenesis and inflammatory responses/barrier disruption. To emphasise this point, we have now referenced examples where HUVECs were used in the context of endothelial barrier biology and in different inflammatory conditions (see also lists a, b, c below).</p><p>A) Papers showing the use of HUVECs in studies yielding important insights about endothelial barrier function</p><p>– Krispin S et al.

These data also support our hypothesis that patients with higher parasite biomass present higher endothelial cell perturbations, corroborating the associations between parasite accumulation in deep tissues (total parasite biomass represented by PvLDH levels) and endothelial cell activation as demonstrated in the Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Strikingly, the authors stated that &quot;<italic>P. vivax</italic> infection results in different ranges of EC alterations without massive cytoadhesion&quot;. This statement has no data supporting it. In fact, their own flow cytometry data convincingly demonstrated that exposure of HUVEC cells to plasma of vivax-high patients significantly increased the surface expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM. ICAM-1 expression is a well know receptor for cytoadhesion in malaria and Dr. Costa first demonstrated the importance of this receptor in cytoadherence of <italic>P. vivax</italic> (Carvalho et al., 2010). Moreover, these data are in some contradiction with the original observations of Anstey and collaborators who demonstrated that parasite LDH concentration did not correlate with markers of endothelial activation (Barber et al., 2015 PLoS Path). Therefore, this sentence should be modified to accommodate the alternative possibility of cytoadherence, deleted from the manuscript or binding functional assays should be performed to sustain it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have removed this statement.</p><p>“The association between endothelial activation, Syndecan-1 and parasite biomass (PvLDH) indicates a positive feedback loop between glycocalyx breakdown, activation of endothelial receptors such as ICAM-1and VCAM-1 and parasite accumulation in deep tissues<sup>9,12</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Extracellular vesicles are key players in pathology of malaria and this includes <italic>P. vivax</italic> where concentration of circulating microparticles were associated with acute infections (Campos et al., 2010 Mal J). Moreover, Dr. Marti has pioneered this field since the original manuscript describing the role of EVs in malaria as intercellular communicators (Mantel et al., 2013 Cell). More recently, his group also demonstrated that interaction of EVs with bone marrow endothelial cells induce expression of IL-6 and IL-1 as well as vascular endothelium perturbations after trans-endothelial electrical resistance experiments (Mantel et al., 2016 Nat Comm). Furthermore, another recent report showed the physiological role of EVs in vivax malaria by demonstrating that EV uptake by human spleen fibroblast induced nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcriptional factor, concomitant with surface expression of ICAM-1, thus facilitating cytoadherence of infected reticulocytes from <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients (Toda et al., 2020 Nat Comm). This growing evidence indicates that plasma circulating EVs are key communicators in malaria infections potentially explaining some of the findings reported in this work. Neglecting the importance of EVs in the discussion of this article is not reasonable and weakens this manuscript. Including a paragraph on EVs and accurate references in the discussion is thus strongly recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that extracellular vesicles are key communicators in malaria infection. We have not measured them in our study, however, and therefore can only speculate about their impact on our observations. We have added a phrase in the discussion:</p><p>“It is likely that other circulating factors that we have not directly measured in our study are also contributing to EC activation and vascular permeability. In particular, extracellular vesicles (EV) originating from ECs, platelets, and RBCs are present during malaria infection and are known to modulate the host immune response to the parasite<sup>54-56</sup>. In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, infected RBCs release EVs containing immunogenic parasite antigens, that activate macrophages, induce neutrophil migration and alter endothelial barrier function<sup>54,55</sup>. In <italic>P. vivax</italic>, plasma-derived EVs from iRBCs are taken up by human spleen ﬁbroblasts (hSFs). This event signals NF-κB translocation and upregulation of ICAM-1 expression, facilitating cytoadherence of <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected reticulocytes<sup>56</sup>.”</p><p>Minor comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The lack of a group including severe vivax malaria patients is a drawback of this article as this group would have firmly validated the predictor of severe disease.</p></disp-quote><p>This study was investigating a cohort of uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic> malaria compared to controls. We agree that it will be important to extent our analysis to severe vivax malaria in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the selection criteria of the patients to be included in the study, no information on other co-infections were mentioned. Is this information available? If so, this should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the Methods sections, Page 6, line 132, mono infection by <italic>P. vivax</italic> was confirmed by analysis of blood smears and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for both <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. We agree that excluding other coinfections could have been of interest. However, the differential diagnosis for an acute febrile illness is very broad and it would be impractical to track all other possible diseases. In addition, the patients included in the present work had mild disease, and therefore were discharged from hospital after a positive malaria diagnosis. No further investigation on other infections was done.</p><p>The main coinfection to be considered for an acute febrile illness with no localizing signs in our context is Dengue Fever. Although Dengue coinfection in our cohort is possible, the incidence at the Hospital is only 2.8% (<italic>P. vivax</italic>/Dengue coinfection) (Magalhães et al., Plos NTD 2014). Thus, it is unlikely that such a coinfection would have a major impact on our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

From the biomass Vivax high vs. Vivax low, they compare multiple determination in patients with uncomplicated <italic>P. vivax</italic>. This raises questions about disease and the presence of parasites in various organs. The question is if <italic>P. vivax</italic> sequesters and the answer is yes in the bone marrow and spleen. Does it sequester like <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that causes disease by sequestration by binding endothelium in various organs. That is less clear. As <italic>P. vivax</italic> is rarely fatal, the sequestration has not been studied. The presence of parasites in organs of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infected splenectomized squirrel and Aotus monkeys has been found in bone marrow and liver (note: splenecotomized monkeys so parasitemia can rise to higher levels than in non-splenectomized monkeys).

In our cohort, the frequency of anaemia was not as high or severe as the frequency of thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. However, we still find associations between endothelial cell activation marker Ang-2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 IL-1 negatively associated with several markers of anaemia, such as haemoglobin, haematocrit and RBC numbers. Although we did not further investigate this association, it may indicate indirect effects of parasite biomass on anaemia mediated by inflammation and EC activation, which will be further investigated in other current longitudinal cohort studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>The manuscript by by Silva- Filho et al., entitled: &quot;Total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia is associated with endothelial and haematological perturbations in Plasmodium vivax patients&quot; reports the importance of total parasite mass of P. vivax infection, and its relationship with a variety of host hematological and immunological markers. The study classifies infection based on clinical features, parasitemia, and host features. I have the following questions:</p><p>1. The use of PvLDH in patient plasma as a proxy for parasite biomass has been established before. But the use of the biomass marker in combination with other host markers are novel. Can the authors explains more in-depth why the suspected deep tissue mass contribute to the PvLDH levels from different host tissues? Because the conclusion of this study relies on this parameter, an in-depth understanding of this marker is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Low peripheral parasitaemia of <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections (generally below 2%) compared to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has been attributed to the strict tropism of <italic>P. vivax</italic> to infect mostly immature reticulocytes, a red blood cell (RBC) population that it is largely conﬁned to the erythropoietic niche of the bone marrow (~0.016% of all immature reticulocytes are in the circulation) [1, 2]. Such low peripheral parasitaemia has long been considered to indicate a low total parasite biomass in vivax malaria. More recently, existence of a significant <italic>P. vivax</italic> reservoir outside of circulation was predicted by disproportionately high PvLDH levels in peripheral circulation compared to parasitemia by blood smear (in particular in patients with complicated outcomes), and by modelling using experimental <italic>P. cynomolgy</italic> infections in non-human primates [3, 4].

One of the important conclusion is the severity of the infection is parasite-biomass dependent. While the current study does not include severe vivax cases, are there studies support the author's conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a key question. In contrast to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected individuals, a wide range of complicated clinical syndromes occurs in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients even at low or subpatent parasitemia [11] – thus indicating that peripheral parasitemia is a poor predictor of clinical outcomes. Two lines of evidence support our conclusion that severity of infection is dependent on parasite biomass instead. First, the discrepancy between PvLDH levels and peripheral parasitaemia determined by blood smears is more evident in <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected patients with complicated outcomes: the ratio of plasma pLDH to peripheral parasitaemia is 6-fold higher than in non-severe patients. The same comparison between severe and non-severe <italic>P. falciparum</italic> patients reveals only a 1.4-fold difference [3]. Second, severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts under 50,000/μL) and lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts under 500/μL) have been associated with severity in vivax patients, suggesting that these haematological complications could be explored as a marker of severity for this species [12-15]. Both thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia were more frequent in patients in the Cluster 2 (Vivax<sup>high</sup>) in our study. By integrating these clinical perturbations with host biomarker measurements and parasite parameters, we demonstrated the high attribute value of total parasite biomass in predicting the severity of thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia (Figures S7 and S8), and highly significant correlations with endothelial activation, glycocalyx breakdown and other markers of inflammation (Figure 6). Our ongoing studies aim to directly investigate the role of host parasite interactions in the hematopoietic niches in <italic>P. vivax</italic> pathogenesis and severity.</p><p>The following text has been added in the Discussion section:</p><p>“In contrast to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected individuals, a wide range of complicated clinical syndromes occurs in <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients even at low or subpatent parasitemia<sup>53</sup> – thus indicating that peripheral parasitemia is a poor predictor of clinical outcomes.

Given that the hematopoietic niches of the BM and the spleen are the major reservoir of total parasite biomass, interactions of PvLDH with these two main modules indicate an interplay between parasite infection in these niches and endothelial activation/damage as well as the proinflammatory response that results in myeloid-biased differentiation, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia.</p><p>Similar to a previous study with <italic>P. vivax</italic> patients and healthy donors from an endemic area in Brazil [21], our analysis revealed a dense network of interactions with homogenous and centralized topology among the biomarkers in healthy donors (see values for network diameter; heterogeneity; density and connectivity in Table S4).
