A similar characterization of real-time sub-second dopamine signals in areas outside of the striatum has been limited. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit the measurement of dopamine binding correlates, which can divulge basic functions of dopamine signaling in non-striatal dopamine terminal regions, like the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST). Here, we record GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in the dBNST during a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task. We observe greater Pavlovian cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals in sign-tracking (ST) compared to goal-tracking/intermediate (GT/INT) rats and the magnitude of cue-evoked dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals decreases immediately following reinforcer-specific satiety. When we deliver unexpected rewards or omit expected rewards, we find that dBNST dopamine signals encode bidirectional reward prediction errors in GT/INT rats, but only positive prediction errors in ST rats. Since sign- and goal-tracking approach strategies are associated with distinct drug relapse vulnerabilities, we examined the effects of experimenter-administered fentanyl on dBNST dopamine associative encoding. Systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. These results reveal multiple dBNST dopamine correlates of learning and motivation that depend on the Pavlovian approach strategy employed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BNST</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>sign tracking</kwd><kwd>association learning</kwd><kwd>cues</kwd><kwd>reward prediction error</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calu</surname><given-names>Donna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA043533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calu</surname><given-names>Donna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calu</surname><given-names>Donna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopamine signaling in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis supports sign-tracking, reinforcer-specific satiety, and encodes reward prediction errors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Survival depends on learning to associate environmental cues with food or other natural rewards. Individual differences in learning and motivational processes support the acquisition, expression, and updating of cue-reward associations. Recent evidence suggests that distinct learning strategies are predictive of dysregulated motivation for drug-associated cues/conditioned stimuli (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pitchers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saunders et al., 2013</xref>). Midbrain and striatal dopamine signals are broadly implicated in a diverse array of learning and motivational processes, including CS-reward associations underscoring the importance of dopamine (DA) in adaptive behavior that promotes survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Langdon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasser et al., 2017</xref>). Yet considerably less is known about the role of DA signals in areas outside of the striatum during adaptive and maladaptive cue-reward learning. Recent advances in fluorescent sensor technology and fiber photometry permit the measurement of DA binding correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Labouesse et al., 2020</xref>). These new techniques can reveal understudied functions of DA signaling in non-striatal DA terminal regions like the dBNST, an extended amygdala nucleus, that is critical for dysregulated CS-triggered opioid relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gyawali et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we characterize basic dBNST DA correlates by recording fluorescent GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals during a Pavlovian task that distinguishes two distinct relapse vulnerability phenotypes.</p><p>Recent studies identify unique learning strategies that predict heightened CS-triggered relapse vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pitchers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saunders et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, a simple Pavlovian Lever Autoshaping task distinguishes two extreme tracking phenotypes: (1) sign-tracking (ST) rats that approach and vigorously engage with the reward predictive lever cue, even though cue interaction is not necessary to obtain food reward and (2) goal-tracking rats that interact with the food cup during cue presentation where food reward is delivered after lever retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boakes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flagel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hearst and Jenkins, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). Sign-tracking rats show heightened CS-triggered drug relapse vulnerability compared to goal-trackers. A third group called intermediates approach both the food cup and lever at similar levels, and their relapse vulnerability is like that of goal-tracking rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saunders and Robinson, 2010</xref>). Fast scan cyclic voltammetry recording of real-time dopamine indicated that sign-, but not goal-tracking, evokes increases in phasic fluctuations in DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during CS presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>). NAc DA is necessary for both the expression of sign-tracking and for sign-trackersâ heightened CS-triggered drug relapse, but not for goal-trackers or their relapse behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Saunders et al., 2013</xref>). Given the critical role of dBNST in CS-triggered relapse, we aimed to determine whether there are similar individual differences in dBNST DA signaling in sign- and goal-tracking rats using the Pavlovian Lever Autoshaping task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buffalari and See, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gyawali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Silberman and Winder, 2013b</xref>).</p><p>Midbrain dopamine neuron activity strengthens cue-outcome associations by serving as a bidirectional prediction error signal where unexpected reward delivery increases and omitted reward decreases dopamine neuron firing relative to expected reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schultz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). Over the course of learning, the phasic dopamine activity transfers from the unconditioned stimulus (US) to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schultz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). In the NAc, the transfer of dopamine signals from the US to the CS occurs more robustly in ST compared to GT rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Saddoris et al., 2016</xref>), and NAc DA antagonism reduces sign-tracking but not goal-tracking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Saunders and Robinson, 2012</xref>). Together, these studies support the Pavlovian lever autoshaping task (and sign-tracking) as a reliable framework for studying dopamineâs role in regions of the brain critically involved in cue-motivated natural and drug reward-seeking behaviors.</p><p>The dBNST receives dense dopaminergic input from several midbrain regions including the ventral tegmental area, ventral periaqueductal gray, and to a much lesser extent, the substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meloni et al., 2006</xref>). dBNST dopamine is associated with a variety of reward-motivated behaviors. dBNST dopamine release is increased during intra-oral sucrose infusion and in response to cues that predict intracranial self-stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, dopamine antagonist injections in the dBNST reduce responding to sucrose in a binge eating paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maracle et al., 2019</xref>). All major drugs of abuse, including opioids, increase extracellular dopamine in the BNST and dBNST dopamine antagonism reduces cocaine self-administration and ethanol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carboni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eiler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epping-Jordan et al., 1998</xref>). Despite these studies implicating dBNST dopamine in motivated behaviors, a comprehensive characterization of endogenous dBNST dopamine dynamics in cue-induced behaviors is lacking. To address this, we used a dopamine sensor GRAB<sub>DA</sub> in combination with fiber photometry to examine the basic properties of the dBNST dopamine signals; their role during lever autoshaping, reward violations, outcome specific-satiety and during systemic fentanyl administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sun et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals respond to cues and rewards in a Pavlovian learning task</title><p>We sought to determine if BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals correlate with individual differences in approach to Pavlovian cues (Experiment timeline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Representative and histological inventory of GRAB<sub>DA</sub> expression from these rats is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. We analyzed the behavioral PCA score using a mixed ANOVA with between-subject factors of Tracking (ST, GT/INT) and within-subject factors of Session (Day 1, Day 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The differential change in lever presses was associated with the difference in cue-evoked GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signal during the sated and sham conditions compared to hungry condition (State Ã Condition: F<sub>(1,20)</sub> = 6.68, p=0.018).

Microdialysis and voltammetry studies show that natural and drug rewards, including opioids, increase DA in the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carboni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Although dBNST dopamine is important for a variety of appetitive motivated behaviors, little is known about cue-evoked dopamine signaling and its role in cue-triggered motivation. A recent study showed BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals are associated with both cues and rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). Our data extend these findings by showing individual differences in CS- and US-evoked BNST dopamine signaling during Pavlovian conditioning. We also demonstrate that CS-evoked BNST DA signals are state-dependent and outcome-specific.</p><p>Consistent with prior studies, we observed individual differences in sign- and goal-tracking behaviors elicited by the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boakes, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hearst and Jenkins, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>). Accompanied by this behavioral variation, we observed tracking differences in GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals to CS onset and differences in dopamine signal transfer from US to CS, both of which were stronger in sign-tracking compared to goal-tracking and intermediate rats. We observed a relationship between CS-maintained GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signal and PCA scores, indicating sign-tracking approach and interaction with the lever cue is associated with heightened dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signaling. These findings for the dBNST dopamine signal are consistent with prior tracking differences in NAc dopamine signals during Pavlovian lever autoshaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>). We also find that only in ST rats did GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals adhere to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref> reinforcement learning algorithm, which states that after learning, reward-evoked signals are temporally transferred back to antecedent cues predicting reward delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed an increase in sustained GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signal during the entire 10 s CS interaction period on Day 5 of PLA training compared to Day 1. Sustained BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals during the cue interaction period could reflect a number of processes, including (1) ongoing lever interaction, (2) the incentive value gain of the CS, (3) the strength of CS-US association, and/or (4) the back-propagating US to CS signal. Our results suggest that dopamine signaling differences between STs and GTs are not just limited to NAc and could be present across a distributed network receiving dopaminergic projections.</p><p>To adapt to environmental changes and learn about future rewards, dopaminergic neurons calculate reward prediction errors (RPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we examined if BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals encode RPE and whether there are individual differences in dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals and behavioral strategies following violations of reward expectations. We found that dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals follow the classical bidirectional prediction error signal such that the signals increased following unexpected reward delivery and decreased following unexpected reward omission. Consistent with attention to learning theories and empirical studies, we observed that rats increase their food cup checking behavior on a trial after a positive or negative reward violation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>). Sign-tracking rats increase food cup checking on trials after both unexpected reward delivery and omission, whereas GT/INTs increase food cup checking only after reward omission. Behaviorally this suggests GT/INT rats may be more sensitive to negative reward violations than positive, which is consistent with their sensitivity to outcome devaluation and their insensitivity to conditioned reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keefer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keefer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kochli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robinson and Flagel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Smedley and Smith, 2018</xref>). Such excitatory behavioral responses (more checking for both increases and decreases in reward) before the trial are evidence for an incremental attentional processes, which reflect enhanced attention to environmental predictors for the purpose of increasing the rate of learning for either excitatory or inhibitory associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holland and Gallagher, 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, reward prediction errors are critical for such enhanced attentional processes, and the theoretical instantiation of incremental attention for learning about positive and negative reward violations takes the absolute value of RPE signals into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pearce and Hall, 1980</xref>). Prior work establishes the involvement of other amygdala nuclei, namely the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala for encoding unidirectional prediction error signals that track enhanced attention after reward violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roesch et al., 2010</xref>). Midbrain dopamine signaling is required for such attentional encoding in the basolateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esber et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we identify bidirectional dopamine encoding of positive and negative reward violations in an extended amygdala nuclei, the dBNST. GT/INTs showed evidence for bidirectional RPE in the dBNST DA signal, which may be important for enhancing attention signals in downstream areas.</p><p>BNST receives heavy dopaminergic afferents from the A10 Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and A10dc ventral periaqueductal gray/dorsal raphe (vPAG/DR) dopaminergic cell groups, and to a lesser extent from the substantia nigra pars compacta and the retrorubral nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel and Rainnie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melchior et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meloni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Vranjkovic et al., 2017</xref>). While VTA and SNc dopamine neurons classically encode bidirectional reward prediction error signals, vPAG dopamine and its projections unidirectionally encode rewarding and aversive outcomes, suggesting salient event detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Walker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>). Different aspects of the dBNST DA signaling we observed lead us to postulate both dopamine projections may be contributing. For the bidirectional RPE, we observed in dBNST, we predict that VTA dopaminergic projections are the source of dopamine during reward violations. In contrast, for the greater CS signaling in ST compared to GT/INT rats may reflect salient features of the CS that support the attracting and reinforcing properties of cues in sign-tracking rats, which may also be supported by vPAG/DRâBNST dopamine. Future studies are needed to identify the extent to which VTA and PAG/DR dopaminergic inputs contribute to the BNST DA signals observed here. Dissecting the role of each dopaminergic input in driving cue and reward-related signaling and behavior will inform whether these circuits work synergistically or in competition to influence appetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2013</xref>). Anatomical studies indicate that a substantial proportion of putative dopaminergic projections to BNST originate in the vPAG/DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meloni et al., 2006</xref>). Prior work has established glutamate and dopamine co-release from the vPAG/DR projection to BNST, positioning this input to directly influence BNST synaptic plasticity and associated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Regardless, the dopamine dynamics reported here for BNST resemble those previously reported for nucleus accumbens in related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saddoris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Saddoris et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a potential role for VTA DA in shaping BNST DA signaling. Notably, NAc DA also shows greater CS-evoked, and a greater shift from US to CS- evoked DA in ST compared to GT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, tracking-related differences in bidirectional RPE signaling in the NAc have not been systematically tested, however, the bidirectional error encoding we observe across all rats is consistent with prior NAc voltammetry studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hart et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report that GT/INT, but not ST, show evidence for bidirectional RPE DA signaling in the BNST. Whether this is also the case for NAc DA signaling remains an open question. Consistent with our findings, short inter-trial-intervals (ITI, similar to what we employ here) during autoshaping promote both classic NAc DA RPE signaling and goal-tracking, whereas longer ITIs promote NAc DA CS-salience signaling and sign-tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Pharmacology studies show D1 receptors and NAc DA signaling drive CS-salience in sign-trackers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Saunders and Robinson, 2012</xref>). The potentiating effects of hunger and systemic fentanyl injections on BNST DA signals observed here are in line with effects observed for NAc DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassareo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castro and Berridge, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mahler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">PeciÃ±a and Berridge, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wilson et al., 1995</xref>). Notably, NAc primarily receives input from the VTA, whereas the BNST receives DA inputs from VTA and vPAG/DR. The tracking-specific differences in BNST dopamine signaling during simple appetitive approach and reward violations observed here suggest either (1) distinct contributions of VTA and vPAG/DR to dopamine signaling observed in BNST and/or (2) individual differences in the engagement of DA systems that bias towards CS-salience or RPE processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Consideration of tracking-specific dopamine signaling differences in future studies that employ projection-specific manipulations will aid in interpreting each projectionâs contribution to BNST dopamine signaling and behavior.</p><p>A methodological limitation of the current approach is that variations in the expression of fluorescent sensor and/or fiber placement along a gradient of DA input to BNST could potentially influence the magnitude of GRAB<sub>DA</sub> measurements. Our fiber placements were largely consistent (~73% at the level of bregma) and overlapped with the densest area of viral expression of the fluorescent sensor. At this level of BNST where we measured the majority of GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals, there is heavy vPAG/DR DA input and to a lesser extent VTA input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002</xref>). Other anatomical and/or functional studies that target BNST up to 0.2 mm anterior or posterior to bregma also observe substantial putative dopaminergic input from vPAG/DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meloni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yu et al., 2021a</xref>). Regardless, some rats presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref> were excluded that had sufficient viral expression and fiber placement, but that did not show evidence of dopamine binding in the dBNST during these Pavlovian tasks. While we are limited from drawing conclusions from negative data, such individual differences in extended amygdala dopamine signaling may be important for interpreting differences in appetitive behaviors. In addition, we analyzed signals that were significantly different from the baseline (greater than 2z scores) in our behavioral window. We might have missed some behaviorally relevant signals due to this restriction. Future studies with control GRAB<sub>DA</sub> virus are needed to determine how large a signal can be expected from artefactual sources (blood flow, autofluorescence, movement, etc).</p><p>The BNST is a sexually dimorphic brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hisasue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shah et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tsuneoka et al., 2017</xref>), highlighting the necessity of studying both sexes to fully understand the contribution of BNST DA to motivated behavior. Dopaminergic projections from vPAG/DRâBNST play sex-specific roles, with pathway activation associated with distinct pain and locomotor behavioral changes for males and females, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yu et al., 2021b</xref>). We used both male and female rats in the present study and analyzed our BNST DA photometry data from Pavlovian autoshaping, RPE, and satiety test sessions using Sex instead of Tracking as a factor. While we observed no sex effects here, prior studies establish BNST-mediated sex differences in pain and locomotor behaviors as well as in opioid withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luster et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yu et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yu et al., 2021b</xref>). While there is limited evidence for sex differences in the incubation of fentanyl seeking (a form of relapse), we find this effect to be dependent on dBNST CRFR1 receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gyawali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reiner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reiner et al., 2020</xref>). Drug-induced synaptic plasticity in the dBNST requires both dopamine and CRF and molecular and electrophysiology studies suggest that DA increases CRF release in the dBNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kash et al., 2008</xref>). Given the known role of sex differences in CRF-induced relapse and opioid withdrawal, it is critical to include both sexes when studying BNST DA and CRF systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffalari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Luster et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To our surprise, we found evidence for outcome-specific state-dependent BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signaling. Consistent with our prior studies, we found that rats decreased their lever responding only when they were sated on food pellets specifically associated with the lever cue, but not when sated on homecage chow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keefer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kochli et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, we observed decreased cue-evoked BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> when rats were sated on food pellets but not when they were sated on chow. All rats ate all their pellets during these reinforced sessions, and we did not see any change in GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals during reward consumption when sated on either food pellets or chow. Prior studies report a similar decrease in cue-evoked dopamine signals in the basolateral amygdala and dopaminergic neuron activity in the dorsal raphe during satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these studies that manipulated state using hunger or satiety, we expected dopamine signals to generally decrease to cues both when sated on chow or training pellets, but we found BNST dopamine signals only decreased when sated on the training pellet associated with the cue. However, other studies find evidence for sensory-specific signaling in dopamine function and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests BNST DA signals may carry sensory-specific information that is critical for higher-order learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke et al., 2008</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keefer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lichtenberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sias et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Takahashi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Studies show elevated BNST dopamine, dopamine-induced plasticity, and dopamine-mediated seeking behavior during and after drug administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carboni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eiler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epping-Jordan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kash et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krawczyk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krawczyk et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krawczyk et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melchior et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stamatakis et al., 2014</xref>). We extend these findings by reporting that systemic fentanyl injections do not disrupt dBNST cue discrimination but generally potentiate dBNST dopamine signals. The present study supports the need for future work aimed at fully characterizing drug-induced changes to dBNST DA cue and reward encoding during natural and opioid reward seeking.</p><p>Dopamine projections to the BNST are concentrated in the dBNST and synapse specifically onto the CRFergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meloni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Phelix et al., 1994</xref>). Molecular and electrophysiology studies suggest that dopamine increases local CRF release in the dBNST and drug-induced synaptic plasticity in the dBNST requires both dopamine and CRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kash et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Silberman et al., 2013a</xref>). These anatomical and ex vivo physiology studies suggest dopamine and CRF are critically interacting to drive reward and stress-related behaviors. Indeed, our prior work indicates that CRF receptor activation in the dBNST is necessary for CS-triggered opioid relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gyawali et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, dBNST dopamine receptor activation decreases blood corticosterone levels in mice suggesting that an increased dopamine response in the dBNST could serve as an anxiolytic signal, which could promote continued drug seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daniel and Rainnie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kash et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Melchior et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meloni et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The present findings add substantially to the role of dBNST dopamine in motivated behaviors, providing a comprehensive characterization of endogenous dBNST dopamine dynamics in cue-induced behaviors under several natural and drug reward conditions.

After surgery, we individually housed the rats and maintained them under a reversed 12:12 hr light/dark cycle (lights off at 9 AM). We estimated the sample size based on prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bacharach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kochli et al., 2020</xref>) and pilot experiments. Each primary experiment was replicated in at least one additional cohort. Investigators were blinded to the tracking phenotype until the end of the experiments. We performed all experiments in accordance with the âGuide for the care and use of laboratory animalsâ (8<sup>th</sup> edition, 2011, US National Research Council) and the University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures. We excluded rats because of a lack of viral expression (n=4), incorrect fiber optic placements (n=6), and headcap loss (n=4). Additionally, rats (n=4) presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref> were excluded that had sufficient viral expression and fiber placement but did not show robust photometry signals in the dBNST during CS+ presentation by day five of PLA training (see <italic>Photometry Analysis</italic> subsection for more details). Finally, we excluded rats (n=8) presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref> that showed food cup entry artifacts before we optimized our photometry setup. The artifacts resulted in the loss of signal due to the patch cord hitting the wall of the food cup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Virus and fiber optic implantation surgery</title><p>We anesthetized 9-week-old rats with isoflurane (4.5% induction, 2â3% maintenance) and placed them in a stereotaxic frame. We maintained stable body temperature with a heating pad and administered pre-operative analgesic carprofen (5 mg/kg, s.c) and lidocaine (10 mg/mL at the site of incision). We made a scalp incision and drilled a hole above left dBNST AP = 0.0 or â0.1 from bregma, ML = +3.5, DV = â6.75 or â6.8 at 16Â° from midline for viral injection, and DV = â6.6 or â6.7mm relative to the skull for fiber implantation. In addition, we also drilled three holes anterior and posterior to attach anchor screws. We lowered the 5 Î¼L Hamilton syringe unilaterally into the dBNST and injected AAV9.hsyn.DA4.4.eyfp (1.14 Ã 10<sup>14</sup> GC/mL; WZ Biosciences) via a micropump at a volume of 0.7â1 Î¼L over 10 min. We implanted the fiber optic (ThorLabs CFMC54L10, 400 Î¼m, 0.50 NA, 10 mm) 0.1 mm or 0.15 mm above the virus injection site. We anchored the fiber optic to the skull using dental cement (Metabond and Denmat) and jeweler screws. We handled the rats at least three times a week after surgery before starting behavioral and photometry sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Apparatus</title><p>We conducted behavioral experiments in operant chambers housed in sound-attenuating cabinets (Med Associates). Each chamber had one white house light that was illuminated during the entire session. On the opposite wall, two retractable levers (CS+ and CSâ, right or left location counterbalanced) were located on either side of the food cup. The food cup was attached to a programmed pellet dispenser that delivered 45 mg training pellets (Testdiet, 5 TUL, protein 20.6%, fat 12.7%, carbohydrate 66.7%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pavlovian lever autoshaping (PLA)</title><p>We conducted all training sessions during the dark phase. Schematic of our behavioral design can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Five weeks after viral injection surgery, we maintained rats at 90% of ad libitum body weight during all behavioral sessions unless noted otherwise. Prior to the PLA training, we exposed rats to 25 magazine training trials divided into three sessions to acclimatize rats to the operant box and fiber optic cables. The three sessions consisted of 7, 8, and 10 trials, respectively in which two food pellets (US) were delivered, 0.5 s apart using a variable interval (VI) the 60 s (50â70 s) schedule. After magazine training sessions, we trained rats in five 46 min PLA sessions. Each session consisted of 25 reinforced (CS+) and 25 non-reinforced (CSâ) lever presentation trials on a mean VI 45 s (35â55 s) schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each CS+ trial consisted of the insertion and retraction of a lever for 10 s followed by delivery of two food pellets, 0.5 s apart. CSâ trials consisted of insertion/retraction of another lever, but no US delivery. We recorded the food cup and lever approach during the 10 s CS interaction and calculated a Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PCA) score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). We use the PCA score as a comprehensive measure of individual differences in PLA that accounts for contact, latency, and probability differences. We used each ratâs Days 4 and 5 average PCA score to determine whether they are sign-trackers (avg PCA score â¥0.5, ST) or goal-trackers/intermediates (avg PCA score &lt;0.5, GT/INT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reward prediction error (RPE) probe sessions</title><p>After five PLA sessions, we gave rats (n=13) one session in which we violated ratsâ reward expectations to probe for reward prediction error signaling. During this session, only the CS+ lever was presented, and rats received 48 trials divided into three different trial types presented in pseudorandom order. In the âexpected rewardâ condition, we gave 24 reinforced CS+ â US trials (50% of total trials). In the âunexpected reward or positiveâ condition, we delivered two food pellets (US) randomly during the intertrial interval period without the predictive CS+ (12 trials, 25% of total trials). Finally, in the âunexpected reward omission or negativeâ condition, we delivered the CS+, but omitted the US (12 trials, 25% of total trials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Satiety test</title><p>After the RPE session, we trained a subset of rats (n=11) in PLA for two more days when rats were either sated on food pellets or hungry. On the first day, we gave half the rats 30 g of the training food pellets in a ramekin for 30 min (pellet-sated condition) in their home cage after the rats had completed 25 out of 50 trials. For the other half of the rats, we gave empty ramekins in their home cage (sham condition). After 30 min, we placed the rats back into the operant chamber where they completed the remaining 25 trials in PLA. The next day, we gave training pellets to rats that received empty ramekins on the first day and vice versa. We ran the chow satiety test in a subset of rats (n=7) using the same experimental design as the pellet satiety test but replaced the food pellets in the ramekins with homecage chow instead.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fentanyl i.p injections</title><p>We injected 5 Î¼g/kg i.p fentanyl (Cayman Chemical) or vehicle in rats (n=4) 5 min before PLA sessions. We selected this dose based on pilot experiments. In two counterbalanced PLA sessions, we gave the rats either i.p injection of fentanyl or saline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>We used LEDs (ThorLabs) to deliver 465 nm (wavelength to excite GRAB<sub>DA</sub>) and 405 nm (isosbestic control) and measure dopamine activity. The isosbestic signal is used as a control for fiber bleaching and motion artifacts as it is subtracted from the 465 nm signal during analysis. We sinusoidally modulated the intensity of the 465 nm and 405 nm light at 210 and 337 Hz, respectively and connected the LEDs to a four-port fluorescence mini cube (Doric Lenses). The combined LED output passed through a fiber optic cable (1 m long; 400 Î¼m core; 0.48 NA; Doric Lenses) which was connected to the implanted fiber optics with sleeves. We maintained the light intensity at the tip of the fiber optic cable at 10â15 Î¼W across behavioral sessions. We collected the GRAB<sub>DA</sub> and isosbestic control channel emission using the same fiber optic cable and focused the emission light onto a photoreceiver (Newport). We low pass filtered and digitized the emission light at 3 Hz and 5 KHz, respectively by a digital processor controlled by Synapse software suite (RZ5P, Tucker Davis Technologies (TDT)). We time-stamped the behavioral events including lever insertion/retraction, lever press, food cup entry, etc. by sending them as TTL (transistor-transistor logic) pulses to Synapse software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>After all behavioral testing, we deeply anesthetized rats with isoflurane and transcardially perfused them with 200 mL of 0.1 M PBS followed by 400 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O. We quickly removed the brains and post-fixed them in 4% PFA for at least 2 hr before we transferred them to 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 hr at 4 Â°C. We subsequently froze the brains using dry ice and stored them at â20 Â°C until sectioning. We collected 50 Î¼m coronal sections containing BNST on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems) and preserved them in a cryopreservant. We mounted the sections on slides and coverslipped them with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). We verified fiber optic placements and viral expression in the dBNST using anatomical boundaries defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paxinos and Watson, 2006</xref> under a confocal microscope. A representative example and summary of GRAB<sub>DA</sub> expression and fiber placements are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Photometry analysis</title><p>We analyzed the signals using custom-written MATLAB (Mathworks) scripts. We calculated ÎF/F (z score) by smoothing signals from the isosbestic control channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Root et al., 2020</xref>). We regressed the isosbestic signal onto the GRAB<sub>DA</sub>-dependent signal to create a fitted isosbestic signal by using the linear model generated during the regression. We then calculated z scores by subtracting the fitted isosbestic signal from the GRAB<sub>DA</sub>-dependent signal and dividing by the fitted isosbestic signal. This resulted in a GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signal devoid of artifacts created by photobleaching, fiber bending, or movements. We collected z scores in the behavioral window of interest defined as 5 s before cue onset to 10 s after pellet delivery. We quantified the area under the curve (AUC) in the 2 s following cue onset and pellet delivery and independently calculated these parameters for CS+ and CSâ trials. In all dopamine signal analyses, unless otherwise noted, we subtract CSâ signal from the CS+ signal. We defined significant transients in our behavioral window if the peak amplitude during the trials (0 to +20 s relative to cue onset) was 2z-score (p=0.05) above baseline (5 s prior to cue onset) during the entire behavioral window on Day 1 or Day 5 of PLA. Furthermore, to ensure these signals were time-locked to cues and not spurious, we calculated 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapped resampling (1000 resamples) of all trials' photometry data for each rat across CS+ trials of Day 5 of PLA. Most rats displayed a consistent, robust increase in the signal reaching significantly above baseline within 70 milliseconds of CS+ onset, that stayed above baseline for a minimum of 40 milliseconds, consecutively. Four rats did not meet either of these criteria (greater than 2z-score peak signal or 40 ms of consecutive time with the significantly elevated signal at CS+) and were excluded. Their data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>. All included rats met both criteria. We also removed trials where the patch cord disconnected from further signal processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We analyzed the data using SPSS, GraphPad Prism, and Matlab. We used mixed design repeated measures ANOVAs to analyze PLA behavioral and GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signal data. Whenever ANOVAs revealed significant interactions between groups, we ran t-tests with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons to guard against Type I errors. We define dependent measures, within/between-subject factors, and report significant effects and interactions in the corresponding results section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Code availability</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/offline-data-matlab/fiber-photometry-epoch-averaging-example/">Modified TDT-supplied MATLAB code</ext-link> is available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ugyawali/photometry">https://github.com/ugyawali/photometry</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gyawali, 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>We performed all experiments in accordance with the 'Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals' (8th edition, 2011, US National Research Council), and the University of Maryland Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental procedures (IACUC protocol number: 0919007).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-81980-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data used in this manuscript are available on Zenodo (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7947009">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7947009</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gyawali</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Martin</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Calu</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>Dopamine in the Dorsal Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis signals Pavlovian sign-tracking and reward violations</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.7947009</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Jessie Feng for technical assistance and the Animal Care Facility for colony maintenance.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional data and analyses for the fentanyl self administration experiments are needed given the low sample size. Relatedly, some explanation for exclusion of 26 rats is warranted.</p><p>2) There should be a more thorough discussion of inputs from different DA sources.</p><p>3) Analysis of shuffled vs. time-locked signal to control for spontaneous fluorescence is a minimum requirement, though ideally some pilot data with a control sensor (see individual reviewer comments).</p><p>4) Better comparison of sign-tracking vs. goal-tracking in the fentanyl experiment and tighter integration with reward prediction error (RPE) analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study is well conducted and provides new information as to how DA is signaling within the BNST during reward-relevant behaviors. At present though I have some questions that I think would guide/improve the study:</p><p>The big question is where is the DA coming from during these relevant behaviors. The BNST receives DA from both the VTA and the PAG but the anatomical distribution of this innervation is distinct https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26792442/. The discussion gets into this a bit, however, the lack of pathway-specific studies is an absence to fully understanding how what is being observed in the BNST is functionally distinct from what is happening with DA encoding in the NAc.</p><p>26 rats were excluded for various reasons, 2 additional for catheter patency.</p><p>The methods state that transients were excluded when they were not equal to or greater than 2 z-scores above baseline. This seems excessive and may miss smaller events? Perhaps this wording is confusing in the methods bc while the transients are over 2, the &quot;sustained DA&quot; as measured in AUC seems to be under 2z. Further, the transients in Figure 2B don't appear to be over 2z in the representative traces. This being said, I've recently been made aware that there are issues with autofluorescence, and blood flow that can result in optical signals that do not correspond to the detection of an analyte. The authors should demonstrate that they do not observe behaviorally relevant signals with the control GRAB DA virus. (https://www.addgene.org/140555/)</p><p>In discussing dBNST NE input, it would be good to cite the following where NE release was directly measured in the dBNST: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128849/ (see Figure 3).</p><p>Were there any differences in dBNST DA signaling with the fentanyl SA between the sign trackers and the goal trackers?</p><p>The authors state: &quot;Microdialysis studies establish that several classes of drugs of abuse, including opioids, increase tonic DA in the BNST (Carboni et al., 2000).&quot; As microdialysis cannot distinguish tonic vs. phasic dopamine signals, I would not describe this as &quot;tonic&quot; DA.</p><p>For discussion of phasic dopamine in the BNST with voltammetry and opioids (Line 561), this should be cited: https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2016135</p><p>The discussion on sex differences within dopaminergic signaling in the BNST would benefit from the following papers examining PAG dopamine neurons, pain, and sex differences: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-91672-8, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33740416/</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors interestingly find that, after intermittent fentanyl self-administration, cues associated with fentanyl reward appear to trigger enhanced BNST dopamine release. However, the small group of rats (n=3) makes it difficult to appropriately make this assertion in the same thorough manner as in earlier experiments. This interesting trend would be further strengthened with a larger group of rats that allow enough power to detect interaction in Figure 5C, for example. It would also be interesting to know whether the 3 rats tested in the fentanyl probe test were sign-tracking or goal-tracking rats.</p><p>2) How do the GRABDA expression/optic fiber placements overlap with dopaminergic fibers in dBNST? â For example, how does the density of dopaminergic terminals span dBNST, from rostral to caudal? This could potentially account for differences in the magnitude of the signal seen between rats, or between goal and sign trackers (although most of their placements look to be among mostly overlapping Bregma points).</p><p>3) In the methods section (lines 114-115), the text states that rats were excluded if there was a 'lack of significant GRABDA signal during behavioral event compared to baseline (N=26)&quot;. Please clarify what behavioral event was used. Did the experimenters use a lack of response to reward or reward CS+ in the PLA as being indicative of a low/no signal? This could be potentially important if only those rats that showed dopamine response to reward and reward cues during PLA were included and others were not. In that case, it would mean a substantial proportion of animals where dBNST dopamine release does not occur in dBNST during said tasks. In such a case, that proportion should be reported and traces depicted in Figure 1 (or supplement to Figure 1).</p><p>4) Regarding the analysis in Figure 3, I appreciate that the authors chose to show z-scores for each of the 2s time bins following reward delivery/non-delivery. This is important in light of the fact that judging from the traces, there seems to be a biphasic signal during negative reward error trials (a brief positive response followed by a negative signal). Yet, it is unclear why this analysis strategy is abandoned for the insets of Figures3G-H that show analysis that averages the signal across the entire 6s bin (as opposed to the above Figure 3D which parses each time bin). As a result, it appears that there is no effect of positive or negative RPE signals (especially in STs). Instead, in panels G-H, it might make more sense to compare z scores during each bin among STs and then among GTs. Otherwise, it's difficult to discern whether STs show any negative reward prediction signaling in dBNST. Relatedly, for the same set of analyses in Fig3G-H (also in text lines 406-412), comparing positive to negative trial z scores among each type of rat (goal- or sign- tracking) seems an odd choice â because these trials are independent and it's unclear what is gained from comparing the two. Rather, a more insightful analysis could be to see whether z-scores on positive or negative trials among each group differ significantly from zero (i.e., &gt;2) or from z-scores on 'expected' trials.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have comments on some of the analysis and interpretations of the data overall.</p><p>The RPE manipulation is a nice addition and really broadens the scope of the dopamine investigation. I'm a little confused about the approach to determining if a positive or negative RPE is signaled by the recorded GRAB fluorescence, however. Generally, it seems like the changes in dopamine based on expectation violations are temporally specific, which motivates the data binning in Figure 3 â but it's a bit unclear what statistical comparisons are significant. Maybe an area under/below the curve analysis would help this a little.</p><p>Related, the positive vs negative RPE comparisons for STs vs GT/INT is also confusing â it seems that only positive vs negative trials are contrasted statistically (Figure 3G+H). This is where the difference between tracking groups comes â with STs not differing between positive and negative, but GT/INTs showing elevated signals in positive vs negative trials. First, which part/bin/time of the signal being compared here is not clear. Second, to me in order to really say that a positive or negative RPE has been signaled the dopamine response would need to be different in positive vs expected and expected vs negative conditions. The fact that GT/INT dopamine more clearly discriminates against positive and negative expectation violations is still meaningful but it doesn't seem quite the same as &quot;encode bidirectional RPE&quot; without further analysis. Overall I feel like the analysis of this section could be beefed up and expanded. I also think the extension of RPE encoding questions to the BNST is the most impactful part of the data.</p><p>More or less, the dopamine signals recorded in BNST follow classic striatal/midbrain dopamine encoding. That is interesting and to me a little unexpected, given the role BNST has in stress, anxiety, and other negative states. Perhaps a little more discussion of how these signals do and do not compare to classic striatal dopamine is warranted. Also given the quite distinct dopamine signals seen in the tail of the striatum, which also come from nigra dopamine neurons (rather than raphe and another place), it is also surprising to see such &quot;normal&quot; RPE-related dynamics in a non-striatal region.</p><p>The satiety experiment and fentanyl results are interesting, but in the scope of the paper in the current form, they felt disconnected, especially given that the ST/GT tracking component of the investigation is not carried through. It just feels a bit like two different papers, perhaps these elements of the data could be better linked.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dopamine in the Dorsal Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis signals Pavlovian sign-tracking and reward violations&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The bootstrapping method is interesting, but I am not sure if animals should be excluded based on it, perhaps the other reviewers can elaborate. In the same vein, the distinct BNST inputs (VTA and PAG) release DA very differently, therefore smaller signals may be relevant, and they are still excluding small signals. The fiber placement is too large to determine if there is input coming into the oval BNST (more PAG input) vs. the juxtacapsular (more VTA input); and, it is concerning that there were some rats with no signals at all (contributing to a large number of animals that were excluded from the study).</p><p>Finally, the removal of the fentanyl SA study, while focusing on the paper, does eliminate some of the excitement.

I also appreciate their added explanation of exclusion criteria in photometry experiments. The overall revisions help strengthen the authors' conclusion that dBNST dopamine contributes to cue-induced motivated behavior and is influenced by factors such as satiety and opioids. These findings add new and important insight to the role of dBNST in reward-related behavior beyond the more classical role of negative/stress-related motivation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thanks to the authors for this revised manuscript. My original comments have been addressed and I think the paper is stronger and more focused. I have a few remaining comments mostly about the excluded rats.</p><p>A little clarification. In the rebuttal, the authors say &quot;We had 20 rats that were not excluded for technical reasons. Of these, 4 rats were excluded for not meeting our (revised) standards of having sufficient photometry signals (see below).&quot; But then in the revised manuscript text, it says â &quot;We excluded rats because of lack of viral expression (N = 4), incorrect fiber optic placements (N = 6), and headcap loss (N = 4). Additionally, we excluded rats (N = 8) that showed food cup entry artifacts before we optimized our photometry setup. The artifacts resulted in loss of signal due to the patch cord hitting the wall of the foodcup. Finally, rats (N = 4) presented in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3 were excluded that had sufficient viral expression and fiber placement but did not show robust photometry signals&quot;.</p><p>- Unless I'm misunderstanding it sounds like only 4 rats were excluded for non-technical reasons and the other 22 had various technical issues.</p><p>For the 6 rats with misplaced optic fibers â did these rats have measurable dopamine signals, or is this a matter of missing the virus expression completely? If there are rats with viable signals that happen to be outside of the BNST that would be an interesting control comparison. Alternatively, if these 6 rats have measured photometry signals but the fibers aren't above virus expression, you could include them as controls with the new confidence interval analyses in a supplement â presumably there will be no meaningful autofluorescence signals in these rats. Either way, this could potentially further strengthen the main dataset.</p><p>Did the 4 excluded rats with no cue signals develop conditioned behavior at similar levels to the main data set rats? I would suggest including the behavioral data for these rats alongside the photometry data in the corresponding supplemental figure.</p><p>8 rats were excluded because of signal artifacts associated with the port entry. It's unclear from the behavior data presented when rats are making port entries (presumably this varies substantially by tracking phenotype) but if there is substantial CS onset data that is not contaminated by port entry, that could be a meaningful addition given the large size of this exclusive group.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81980.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional data and analyses for the fentanyl experiments are needed given the low sample size.

This second requirement greatly reduces the possibility that a chance signal crossing above 0 is mistaken for a real signal and reduces the corresponding false positive rate.

While we cannot address the issue of blood flow changes or other biological phenomena leading to fluorescence changes without conducting lengthy additional experiments with a control sensor, we have no reason to doubt that our signals reflect dopamine given the extensive characterization of these GRAB<sub>DA</sub> sensors in other brain areas in which verified dopamine signals share very similar time courses of fluorescence changes as the signals we observe here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Better comparison of sign-tracking vs. goal-tracking in the fentanyl experiment and tighter integration with reward prediction error (RPE) analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially revised our RPE analysis based on reviewer 2âs thoughtful feedback.

At present though I have some questions that I think would guide/improve the study:</p><p>The big question is where is the DA coming from during these relevant behaviors. The BNST receives DA from both the VTA and the PAG but the anatomical distribution of this innervation is distinct https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26792442/. The discussion gets into this a bit, however, the lack of pathway-specific studies is an absence to fully understanding how what is being observed in the BNST is functionally distinct from what is happening with DA encoding in the NAc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an interesting question and something we plan to explore in the future. Ultimately, identifying the source of dopamine within the BNST during reward relevant behaviors is out of the scope of the present manuscript. However, we hope that the work presented here will spur future research on this topic. We expand on this topic in the Discussion section:</p><p>âFuture studies are needed to identify the extent to which VTA and PAG/DR dopaminergic inputs contribute to the BNST DA signals observed here. Dissecting the role of each dopaminergic input in driving cue and reward related signaling and behavior will inform whether these circuits work synergistically or in competition to influence appetitive behaviors (Lin et al., 2020; Park et al., 2012, 2013). Anatomical studies indicate that a substantial proportion of putative dopaminergic projections to BNST originate in the vPAG/DR (Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002, Meloni et al., 2006). Prior work has established glutamate and dopamine co-release from the vPAG/DR projection to BNST, positioning this input to directly influence BNST synaptic plasticity and associated behaviors (Li et al., 2016). Regardless, the dopamine dynamics reported here for BNST resemble those previously reported for nucleus accumbens in related behaviors (Clark et al., 2013; Flagel et al., 2011; Hart et al., 2014; Saddoris et al., 2015, 2016), suggesting a potential role for VTA DA in shaping BNST DA signalingâ¦â ââ¦The tracking specific differences in BNST dopamine signaling during simple appetitive approach and reward violations observed here suggest either (1) distinct contributions of VTA and vPAG/DR to dopamine signaling observed in BNST and/or (2) individual differences in the engagement of DA systems that bias towards CSsalience or RPE processes (Chow et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2018). Consideration of tracking-specific dopamine signaling differences in future studies that employ projection-specific manipulations will aid in interpreting each projectionâs contribution to BNST dopamine signaling and behavior.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26 rats were excluded for various reasons, 2 additional for catheter patency.</p><p>The methods state that transients were excluded when they were not equal to or greater than 2 z-scores above baseline. This seems excessive and may miss smaller events? Perhaps this wording is confusing in the methods bc while the transients are over 2, the &quot;sustained DA&quot; as measured in AUC seems to be under 2z. Further, the transients in Figure 2B don't appear to be over 2z in the representative traces. This being said, I've recently been made aware that there are issues with autofluorescence, and blood flow that can result in optical signals that do not correspond to the detection of an analyte. The authors should demonstrate that they do not observe behaviorally relevant signals with the control GRAB DA virus.

We have now added more robust exclusion criteria for rats that displayed viral expression and proper fiber placement, but not high levels of signal during training (4 rats) in the form of a consecutive, confidence interval test. We have now expanded the reasons in the Subjects subsection of Methods and the Photometry Analysis subsection of the Methods section:</p><p>Methods</p><p>âSubjects</p><p>â¦We excluded rats because of lack of viral expression (N = 4), incorrect fiber optic placements (N = 6), and headcap loss (N = 4).

The artifacts resulted in loss of signal due to the patch cord hitting the wall of the foodcup. Finally, rats (N = 4) presented in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3 were excluded that had sufficient viral expression and fiber placement but did not show robust photometry signals in the dBNST during CS+ presentation by day five of PLA training (see Photometry Analysis subsection for more details).â</p><p>âPhotometry Analysis</p><p>â¦We defined significant transients in our behavioral window if the peak amplitude during the trials (0 to +20 s relative to cue onset) was 2 z-score (p=0.05) above baseline (5s prior to cue onset) during the entire behavioral window on Day 1 or Day 5 of PLA. Furthermore, to ensure these signals were time-locked to cues and not spurious, we calculated 95% confidence intervals using bootstrapped resampling (1000 resamples) of all trials' photometry data for each rat across CS+ trials of Day 5 of PLA. Most rats displayed a consistent, robust increase in signal reaching significantly above baseline within 70 milliseconds of CS+ onset, that stayed above baseline for a minimum of 40 milliseconds, consecutively. 4 rats did not meet either of these criteria (greater than 2 z-score peak signal or 40 ms of consecutive time with significantly elevated signal at CS+) and were excluded. Their data is in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3. All included rats met both criteria. We also removed trials where the patch cord disconnected from further signal processing.â</p><p>The addition of the consecutive-confidence-interval criteria should rule out spurious signals, and potentially autofluorescence artifacts. Some rats (N = 4) had viral expression and correct fiber placement but did not show peak amplitude 2 z-score above baseline (during the trial) on either Day 1 or Day 5 of PLA. In Figure 2âfigure supplement 3, we now show parallel analysis to Figure 2 from excluded rats that do not meet the 2 z-score peak and threshold and confidence interval analyses. Based on these analyses we are confident we are not missing smaller events, as excluded rats with expression do not show robust event related activity changes. We also added a brief discussion about excluded rats that had sufficient viral expression and fiber placement, but that did not show evidence of dopamine binding in the dBNST. As noted above in this response letter, our signals display time courses consistent with well characterized dopamine signaling using this sensor in other brain areas, leading us to conclude that blood flow changes are unlikely to be the source of the signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In discussing dBNST NE input, it would be good to cite the following where NE release was directly measured in the dBNST: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20128849/ (see Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this reference and add the finding about relatively slow NE clearance in the dBNST:</p><p>âEven though the GRAB<sub>DA</sub> construct we used is 15-fold more sensitive to dopamine than norepinephrine (NE), BNST norepinephrine plays an important role in motivated behaviors and dBNST receives dense noradrenergic input with relatively slow NE clearance measured in vivo (Egli et al., 2005; Flavin and Winder, 2013; Park et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2020).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were there any differences in dBNST DA signaling with the fentanyl SA between the sign trackers and the goal trackers?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question, but since our sample size for this phase of the study was low, we have now removed the fentanyl self-administration data.

Dopaminergic projections from vPAG/DR-BNST play sexspecific roles, with pathway activation associated with distinct pain and locomotor behavioral changes for males and females, respectively (Yu et al., 2021). We used both male and female rats in the present study and analyzed our BNST DA photometry data from Pavlovian autoshaping, RPE, satiety test sessions using Sex instead of Tracking as a factor. While we observed no sex effects here, prior studies establish BNST-mediated sex differences in pain and locomotor behaviors as well as in opioid withdrawal (Luster et al., 2020; Yu et al. 2021a; Yu et al., 2021b).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors interestingly find that, after intermittent fentanyl self-administration, cues associated with fentanyl reward appear to trigger enhanced BNST dopamine release.

This interesting trend would be further strengthened with a larger group of rats that allow enough power to detect interaction in Figure 5C, for example. It would also be interesting to know whether the 3 rats tested in the fentanyl probe test were sign-tracking or goal-tracking rats.</p></disp-quote><p>The three rats tested were N = 2 intermediate (mix of sign- and goal-tracking approach) and N = 1 sign-tracker. The self-administration phase of the experiment was not a primary aim of the study, though we agree the data are interesting. Only one cohort of rats was trained in fentanyl selfadministration, and unfortunately, we were not sufficiently powered to look within tracking groups. Conceptually, this departs from our aim to characterize individual differences in extended amygdala dopamine dynamics. Furthermore, we do not currently have the expertise (first author graduated) or resources to replicate this phase of the study, so we have removed data from the self-administration phase of the study from the manuscript. We look forward to pursuing these questions in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How do the GRABDA expression/optic fiber placements overlap with dopaminergic fibers in dBNST? â For example, how does the density of dopaminergic terminals span dBNST, from rostral to caudal? This could potentially account for differences in the magnitude of the signal seen between rats, or between goal and sign trackers (although most of their placements look to be among mostly overlapping Bregma points).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer keenly points out, our placements were largely consistent (~73% (N=11) at level of bregma and only ~13% (N=2) slightly anterior(+0.12) and ~20 % (N=3) slightly posterior (-0.12) to bregma), limiting our ability to analyze the data with sufficient power to determine whether variability in expression and/or fiber placement contributed to differences in the signal along the anterior to posterior axis of BNST. Regardless, we think this is an important consideration and have consulted anatomical and functional studies (1 relevant case, no BNST coordinates given, estimated targetâ based on lateral ventricle, fornix and anterior commissure landmarks in Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002: Figure 7Bâ around 0.0, bregma, in rat), Meloni et al., 2006 (stereotaxic target -0.2 posterior to bregma in rat), Yu et al., 2021 (stereotaxic target +0.23 anterior to bregma in mouse). From these studies that demonstrate DA input anatomically and/or functionally that spans anterior (Yu et al., 2021) to posterior (Meloni et al., 2006) of our reported cases mostly around bregma (ie: Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002), we conclude there is substantial vPAG/DR DA input and to a lesser extent VTA input at the level of BNST that we measure GRABDA signals. We appreciate any further insight the reviewer may have for anatomical or functional studies that increase resolution on rostral-caudal distribution of dopaminergic inputs to BNST. We have added the following sentences to the discussion to address this important methodological limitation of our approach:</p><p>âA methodological limitation of the current approach is that variations in expression of fluorescent sensor and/or fiber placement along a gradient of DA input to BNST could potentially influence the magnitude of GRAB<sub>DA</sub> measurements. Our fiber placements were largely consistent (~73% at level of bregma) and overlapped with the densest area of viral expression of the fluorescent sensor. At this level of BNST that we measure the majority of GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals, there is heavy vPAG/DR DA input and to a lesser extent VTA input (Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002). Other anatomical and/or functional studies that target BNST up to 0.2 mm anterior or posterior to bregma also observe substantial putative dopaminergic input from vPAG/DR (Meloni et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2021).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the methods section (lines 114-115), the text states that rats were excluded if there was a 'lack of significant GRABDA signal during behavioral event compared to baseline (N=26)&quot;. Please clarify what behavioral event was used. Did the experimenters use a lack of response to reward or reward CS+ in the PLA as being indicative of a low/no signal? This could be potentially important if only those rats that showed dopamine response to reward and reward cues during PLA were included and others were not. In that case, it would mean a substantial proportion of animals where dBNST dopamine release does not occur in dBNST during said tasks. In such a case, that proportion should be reported and traces depicted in Figure 1 (or supplement to Figure 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that we did not list all the reasons for animal exclusions.

This is important in light of the fact that judging from the traces, there seems to be a biphasic signal during negative reward error trials (a brief positive response followed by a negative signal). Yet, it is unclear why this analysis strategy is abandoned for the insets of Figures3G-H that show analysis that averages the signal across the entire 6s bin (as opposed to the above Figure 3D which parses each time bin). As a result, it appears that there is no effect of positive or negative RPE signals (especially in STs). Instead, in panels G-H, it might make more sense to compare z scores during each bin among STs and then among GTs. Otherwise, it's difficult to discern whether STs show any negative reward prediction signaling in dBNST. Relatedly, for the same set of analyses in Fig3G-H (also in text lines 406-412), comparing positive to negative trial z scores among each type of rat (goal- or sign- tracking) seems an odd choice â because these trials are independent and it's unclear what is gained from comparing the two. Rather, a more insightful analysis could be to see whether z-scores on positive or negative trials among each group differ significantly from zero (i.e., &gt;2) or from z-scores on 'expected' trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this analysis shortfall. We have conducted suggested analyses which appear on the manuscript and below:</p><p>âFirst, to determine whether BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals encode bidirectional reward prediction error (RPE), we compare signals on expected, positive and negative trials. Notably, because lever retraction occurs simultaneously with reward delivery, and sign- and goal-trackers may be in different locations at this time, we examine the signals during the six seconds (three 2-s bins) after reward delivery or omission, which captures the period corresponding to violations in reward expectations (Figure 3D). We performed a repeated measures ANOVA on z scores during the RPE session including Trial Type (Expected, Positive, Negative) and Bin (three 2 s bins (0-2 s, 2-4 s, 4-6 s)) as factors. We observed a difference in dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signaling between the three trial types in the bins following reward delivery/omission (Figure 3D, Bin: F<sub>(2,72)</sub> = 13.65, p&lt;0.001, Bin x Trial Type: F<sub>(4,72)</sub> = 13.99, p&lt;0.001, Trial Type: F<sub>(2,36)</sub> = 3.49, p=0.041). Post-hocs confirm that in the second 2-second bin (ie. 2-4 s) after reward delivery/omission, BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals differed from one another for all three trial types, Expected vs. Positive (population traces in Figure 3E; p=0.013), Expected vs. Negative (population traces in Figure 3F; p=0.043) and Positive vs. Negative (p=0.0004). Across all rats, we observe that dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals reflect bidirectional reward prediction errors.</p><p>Then to determine whether there are tracking differences in dBNST RPE signals, we separately analyzed the z scores during RPE sessions in the two tracking groups. Again we examine how GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signaling differs for the three trial types (expected, positive, negative) during the three 2second bins after reward delivery (population traces for STs and GT/INTs Figure 3G-H). In GT/INT rats we observed main effects of Trial (F(2,12) = 8.2, p = 0.006) and Bin (F(2,12) = 4.9, p = 0.027) and a Trial x Bin interaction (F(4,24) = 25.7, p &lt;0.001). GT/INT rats showed evidence for both positive RPE (Trial (Expected, Positive) x Bin interaction F(2,12) = 14.5, p = 0.001) and negative RPE Trial (Expected, Negative) x Bin interaction (F(2,12) = 9.9, p = 0.003; Figure 3G inset). In GT/INT rats, we next examined the time course and found dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signaling on both positive and negative trials differs from expected trials during the second 2-second bin (ie 2-4 s) after lever retraction/pellet delivery/omission (positive vs. expected p = 0.04, negative vs. expected p = 0.021). This suggests GT/INT rats show evidence for dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> bidirectional RPE signaling.</p><p>In a parallel analysis in ST rats considering all trial types (Expected, Positive, Negative) we also observed main effect of Bin (F(2,10) = 10.4, p = 0.004) and Trial x Bin interaction (F(4,20) = 5.4, p = 0.004). ST rats showed evidence for positive RPE (Trial (expected, positive) x Bin interaction F(2,10) 6.8, p = 0.014) but not negative RPE (Trial (expected, negative) x Bin interaction F(2,10) = 2.8, p = 0.153, Figure 3H inset). Post-hoc analyses in ST rats on the time-course failed to identify which bin GRABDA signals distinguished by trial type, however a planned analysis on the relevant second 2-s bin (ie. 2-4 s after lever retraction/pellet delivery/omission) indicates a main effect (F(2,10) = 5.3, p = 0.027) is marginally driven by Expected vs. Positive trial types (F(1,5)=5.0, p = 0.075) and not Expected vs. Negative trial types (F(1,5) = 2.0, p=0.216). This analysis suggests ST rats fail to show evidence for dBNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> bidirectional RPE signaling.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have comments on some of the analysis and interpretations of the data overall.</p><p>The RPE manipulation is a nice addition and really broadens the scope of the dopamine investigation. I'm a little confused about the approach to determining if a positive or negative RPE is signaled by the recorded GRAB fluorescence, however. Generally, it seems like the changes in dopamine based on expectation violations are temporally specific, which motivates the data binning in Figure 3 â but it's a bit unclear what statistical comparisons are significant. Maybe an area under/below the curve analysis would help this a little.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the ambiguity that previously existed for this analysis and associated Figure 3.

We paste subsections of this revised text in the next point to address the specific issues outlined in the point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related, the positive vs negative RPE comparisons for STs vs GT/INT is also confusing â it seems that only positive vs negative trials are contrasted statistically (Figure 3G+H). This is where the difference between tracking groups comes â with STs not differing between positive and negative, but GT/INTs showing elevated signals in positive vs negative trials. First, which part/bin/time of the signal being compared here is not clear. Second, to me in order to really say that a positive or negative RPE has been signaled the dopamine response would need to be different in positive vs expected and expected vs negative conditions. The fact that GT/INT dopamine more clearly discriminates against positive and negative expectation violations is still meaningful but it doesn't seem quite the same as &quot;encode bidirectional RPE&quot; without further analysis. Overall I feel like the analysis of this section could be beefed up and expanded. I also think the extension of RPE encoding questions to the BNST is the most impactful part of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback and positive assessment of the work.

That is interesting and to me a little unexpected, given the role BNST has in stress, anxiety, and other negative states. Perhaps a little more discussion of how these signals do and do not compare to classic striatal dopamine is warranted. Also given the quite distinct dopamine signals seen in the tail of the striatum, which also come from nigra dopamine neurons (rather than raphe and another place), it is also surprising to see such &quot;normal&quot; RPE-related dynamics in a non-striatal region.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and speculate a bit in the discussion about how individual differences in BNST DA signaling may arise from differences in the relative contribution of distinct inputs (VTA-BNST in bidirectional RPE seen in GT/INT group, and potentially vPAG-BNST involvement in strong CS incentive salience encoding of ST group.) Unlike the tail of the striatum, BNST receives relatively little DA input from substantia nigra (Hasue and Shammah-Lagnado, 2002; Meloni et al., 2006). In addition to the prior text briefly touching on this matter, we have added the following to the discussion.</p><p>âRegardless, the dopamine dynamics reported here for BNST resemble those previously reported for nucleus accumbens in related behaviors (Clark et al., 2013; Flagel et al., 2011; Hart et al., 2014; Saddoris et al., 2015, 2016), suggesting a potential role for VTA DA in shaping BNST DA signaling. Notably, NAc DA also shows greater CS-evoked, and a greater shift from US to CS- evoked DA in ST compared to GT (Flagel et al., 2011). To our knowledge, tracking-related differences in bidirectional RPE signaling in the NAc have not been systematically tested, however the bidirectional error encoding we observe across all rats is consistent with prior NAc voltammetry study (Hart et al., 2014). Here we report that GT/INT, but not ST, show evidence for bidirectional RPE DA signaling in the BNST. Whether this is also the case for NAc DA signaling remains an open question. Consistent with our findings, short inter-trial-intervals (ITI, similar to what we employ here) during autoshaping promote both classic NAc DA RPE signaling and goaltracking, whereas longer ITIs promote NAc DA CS-salience signaling and sign-tracking (Lee et al., 2018). Pharmacology studies show D1 receptors and NAc DA signaling drive CS-salience in sign-trackers (Chow et al., 2016; Saunders and Robinson 2012). The potentiating effects of hunger and systemic fentanyl injections on BNST DA signals observed here are in line with effects observed for NAc DA (Bassareo et al., 2013; Castro and Berridge 2014; Cone et al., 2014; Mahler et al., 2007; Pecina and Berridge 2005; Wilson et al., 1995). Notably, the NAc primarily receives input from the VTA, whereas the BNST receives DA inputs from VTA and vPAG/DR. The tracking specific differences in BNST dopamine signaling during simple appetitive approach and reward violations observed here suggest either (1) distinct contributions of VTA and vPAG/DR to dopamine signaling observed in BNST and/or (2) individual differences in the engagement of DA systems that bias towards CS-salience or RPE processes (Chow et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018). Consideration of tracking-specific dopamine signaling differences in future studies that employ projection-specific manipulations will aid in interpreting each projectionâs contribution to BNST dopamine signaling and behavior.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The satiety experiment and fentanyl results are interesting, but in the scope of the paper in the current form, they felt disconnected, especially given that the ST/GT tracking component of the investigation is not carried through. It just feels a bit like two different papers, perhaps these elements of the data could be better linked.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, particularly about the self-administration results, which were conceptually inconsistent with our goal to characterize individual differences in BNST DA signaling during Pavlovian behaviors. The self-administration phase of the experiment was not a primary aim of the study, though we agree the data are interesting. Only one cohort of rats was trained in fentanyl self-administration, and unfortunately, we were not sufficiently powered to look within tracking groups. Furthermore, we do not currently have the expertise (first author graduated) or resources to replicate this phase of the study, so we have removed data from the self-administration phase of the study from the manuscript. We look forward to pursuing these questions in future studies.</p><p>Given we have refocused the manuscript on BNST DA signaling during natural reward seeking, we revise the manuscript to better incorporate the satiety and i.p. fentanyl data. We feel these experiments are in line with our goal to characterize BNST DA signaling in natural reward seeking. While we do not observe tracking differences in the satiety data, we are cautious to interpret the lack of main effects or interactions with Tracking factor, due to the smaller sample size (pellet satiety N = 11, ST N = 4 , GT/INT N = 7 and chow satiety N = 7, ST N = 3 , GT/INT N = 4) in this phase of the study. We now report these Nâs in the revised text. We have also added more rationale and associated citations to better incorporate these findings to what is known for the striatal dopamine system. A few excerpts are included below.</p><p>âIn the current and following sections, we report the number of ST and GT/INT rats for each experimental phase but do not report tracking differences due to decreased statistical power to detect group differences. Prior studies indicate that the midbrain and striatal dopamine system tracks motivational state through satiety-dependent changes in the magnitude of dopamine responses (Cone et al., 2014; Hsu et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 1995). Here we determined whether motivational state also decreases task-related BNST GRABDA signals during lever autoshaping.â</p><p>âThese results further bolster our finding that BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals encode cue-outcome associations, which similar to striatal dopamine signaling, is blunted when the animal has reduced motivational drive (Cone et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 1995).â</p><p>âOpioids potentiate NAc activity and NAc DA responses to natural rewards and natural reward associated cues (Bassareo et al., 2013; Castro and Berridge 2014; Mahler et al., 2007; Pecina and Berridge 2005). Here we sought to determine whether opioids also potentiate task-related BNST GRAB<sub>DA</sub> signals during natural reward seeking in lever autoshaping.â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I am still enthusiastic about this study and the contributions it makes to the field.

These ratsâ data is presented in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3. We are not suggesting that smaller GRABDA signals are irrelevant. However, because smaller events are more likely to be contaminated by noise (ie. autofluorescence), we apply a standard approach in signal analysis of examining signals in our behavioral window that are significantly different from baseline (p&lt;0.05 or z&gt;2). Our additional confidence interval analysis further supports our approach. We have added a couple of sentences in the Discussion section to highlight this caveat:âA methodological limitation of the current approach â¦ In addition, we analyzed signals that were significantly different from baseline (greater than 2z scores) in our behavioral window. We might have missed some behaviorally relevant signals due to this restriction. Future studies with control GRABDA virus are needed to determine how large a signal can be expected from artefactual sources (blood flow, autofluorescence, movement, etc).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the same vein, the distinct BNST inputs (VTA and PAG) release DA very differently, therefore smaller signals may be relevant, and they are still excluding small signals. The fiber placement is too large to determine if there is input coming into the oval BNST (more PAG input) vs. the juxtacapsular (more VTA input); and, it is concerning that there were some rats with no signals at all (contributing to a large number of animals that were excluded from the study).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that distinct BNST inputs (VTA <italic>vs</italic> PAG) release dopamine differently in the BNST. Indeed, the fiber placement area is too large to determine the source of dopamine. Our goal of the manuscript was not to determine the source of dopamine, nor make any claim on what the source of dopamine signals are. Instead, our study points to the general role of BNST dopamine in response to reward associated cues and reward prediction error in sign and goal tracking rats. Here are snippets from Discussion that highlight the need for future investigation related to this point:</p><p>âFuture studies are needed to identify the extent to which VTA and PAG/DR dopaminergic inputs contribute to the BNST DA signals observed here. Dissecting the role of each dopaminergic input in driving cue and reward related signaling and behavior will inform whether these circuits work synergistically or in competition to influence appetitive behaviors (Lin et al., 2020; Park et al., 2012, 2013)â¦â</p><p>ââ¦ The tracking specific differences in BNST dopamine signaling during simple appetitive approach and reward violations observed here suggest either (1) distinct contributions of VTA and vPAG/DR to dopamine signaling observed in BNST and/or (2) individual differences in the engagement of DA systems that bias towards CS-salience or RPE processes (Chow et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2018).

In the rebuttal, the authors say &quot;We had 20 rats that were not excluded for technical reasons. Of these, 4 rats were excluded for not meeting our (revised) standards of having sufficient photometry signals (see below).&quot; But then in the revised manuscript text, it says â &quot;We excluded rats because of lack of viral expression (N = 4), incorrect fiber optic placements (N = 6), and headcap loss (N = 4). Additionally, we excluded rats (N = 8) that showed food cup entry artifacts before we optimized our photometry setup. The artifacts resulted in loss of signal due to the patch cord hitting the wall of the foodcup. Finally, rats (N = 4) presented in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3 were excluded that had sufficient viral expression and fiber placement but did not show robust photometry signals&quot;.</p><p>â Unless I'm misunderstanding it sounds like only 4 rats were excluded for non-technical reasons and the other 22 had various technical issues.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. 4 rats were excluded for non-technical reasons and the other 22 had various technical issues. This was a typo in the rebuttal. We now also include behavior data from those 4 rats in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the 6 rats with misplaced optic fibers â did these rats have measurable dopamine signals, or is this a matter of missing the virus expression completely? If there are rats with viable signals that happen to be outside of the BNST that would be an interesting control comparison. Alternatively, if these 6 rats have measured photometry signals but the fibers aren't above virus expression, you could include them as controls with the new confidence interval analyses in a supplement â presumably there will be no meaningful autofluorescence signals in these rats. Either way, this could potentially further strengthen the main dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>All 6 rats had dBNST viral expression but misplaced fiber placements outside of the dBNST. Most of these rats were run for 3-5 sessions before they were no longer imaged due to lack of real time signal and limited photometry setups. Regardless, we analyzed the fluorescence signals from the last recording session from these rats (session 3-5 depending on when they were no longer run) and qualitatively found no consistent fluctuations in signal in the behavioral window. We also performed a confidence interval analysis on these 6 rats. Only 1/6 of these rats with misplaced cannula exhibited a signal significantly and consistently above baseline following CS+ onset (according to the parameters of our bootstrapping confidence interval test described in the methods) on the last day of training, however, the average maximum of this signal was very small, and did not exceed 2z above baseline. Therefore, all six rats with misplaced cannula had little to no appreciable signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the 4 excluded rats with no cue signals develop conditioned behavior at similar levels to the main data set rats? I would suggest including the behavioral data for these rats alongside the photometry data in the corresponding supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, these rats developed conditioned behavior similar to the main data set rats. The data are now added in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8 rats were excluded because of signal artifacts associated with the port entry. It's unclear from the behavior data presented when rats are making port entries (presumably this varies substantially by tracking phenotype) but if there is substantial CS onset data that is not contaminated by port entry, that could be a meaningful addition given the large size of this exclusive group.</p></disp-quote><p>Out of the 8 rats, there were 2 STs and 6 GT/INTs. The population photometry signals and associated behavior from these rats are now added as a supplement in Figure 2 âfigure supplement 4. Since we also do unconditioned stimulus (US) analyses, we exclude these rats completely from the study since we do not have reliable signal from the time of US delivery for these rats. However, qualitatively we observe that these rats show similar patterns of CS-evoked dBNST dopamine signals and behavior relative to rats included in the reported data set (Figure 2) that have the continuous uncontaminated signals across the trial.</p></body></sub-article></article>
