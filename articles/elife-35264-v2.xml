Here, we reveal that the mushroom body (MB) integrates hunger and satiety signals to control food-seeking behavior. We have discovered five pathways in the MB essential for hungry flies to locate and approach food. Blocking the MB-intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs) and the MB output neurons (MBONs) in these pathways impairs food-seeking behavior. Starvation bi-directionally modulates MBON responses to a food odor, suggesting that hunger and satiety controls occur at the KC-to-MBON synapses. These controls are mediated by six types of dopaminergic neurons (DANs). By manipulating these DANs, we could inhibit food-seeking behavior in hungry flies or promote food seeking in fed flies. Finally, we show that the DANs potentially receive multiple inputs of hunger and satiety signals. This work demonstrates an information-rich central circuit in the fly brain that controls hunger-driven food-seeking behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mushroom bodies</kwd><kwd>hunger</kwd><kwd>dopaminergic neurons</kwd><kwd>food-seeking behavior</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105-2628-B-001-005-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Suewei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001869</institution-id><institution>Academia Sinica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Suewei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mushroom bodies are a hunger and satiety integrative center that controls food-seeking behavior in <italic>Drosophila.</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Searching for food is costly with respect to energy and physical risk. Most animals are equipped with an ability to evaluate their internal energy state and use it to decide whether to respond to food-related cues such as taste and smell. To achieve this, the nervous system of an animal must sense its energy state, produce signals that reflect the energy status, and integrate the signals with external sensory inputs. Understanding the computational and operational principles that underpin these neural processes will offer insights into the neural basis of motivated behaviors. The main nutrient- and energy-sensing organs in vertebrates are stomach, gut, and white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kairupan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Porte et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Small and Bloom, 2004</xref>). Hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and cholecystokinin that are secreted by these organs serve as hunger and satiety signals in the nervous system and control how an animal responds to food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kairupan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Porte et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sternson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sternson and Eiselt, 2017</xref>). The detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in this process remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Hormonal signals also play important roles in mediating hunger control in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>; these include insulin-like peptides, the two homologs of mammalian NPY (Neuropeptide F, NPF, and short Neuropeptide F, sNPF), the homolog of mammalian leptin (Unpaired 2, Upd2), the insect analog of glucagon (adipokinetic hormone, AKH), and a handful of other neuropeptides and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). These hormonal signals and neuromodulators are regulated by starvation and have been shown to modulate neural circuit functions in both the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farhan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">LeDue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Root et al., 2011</xref>) and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beshel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schlegel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Flies primarily rely on olfactory cues to locate food. Starvation sensitizes the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) for attractive odors via the cooperation of insulin and sNPF signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Root et al., 2011</xref>) and, in parallel, dampens the activity of ORNs for aversive odors through the neuropeptide tachykinin released from interneurons in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ko et al., 2015</xref>). Another neuropeptide, CCHamide, is also involved in hunger-induced modulation in ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farhan et al., 2013</xref>). Whether a similar system exists in the brain to regulate the perception of odor valence in accordance with the hunger state is less clear. A pair of NPF-expressing neurons in the adult brain have been shown to encode odor attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>). More attractive odors evoke stronger activity in the NPF neurons, and silencing of these neurons abolishes the fly's behavioral response to attractive odors. Importantly, starvation heightens the activity of the NPF neurons, but how the graded NPF signal is translated into approach behavior is not known.</p><p>Food odors detected by specific ORNs are relayed by antennal lobe projection neurons to the mushroom body (MB) and lateral horn (LH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Stocker et al., 1997</xref>). It has been suggested that the LH plays a major role in innate olfactory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heimbeck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Parnas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). Neural modulation in the LH has been shown to regulate feeding behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Brief presentation of appetizing odors causes voracious feeding on sugar-rich food even in fed larvae; a process involving NPF neurons and dopaminergic neurons projecting to the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Whether the same neural pathways mediate starvation-induced feeding awaits to be tested. In contrast to the LH, the MB is conventionally considered to be an olfactory learning and memory center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">McGuire et al., 2005</xref>). The MB is composed of around 2200 intrinsic neurons called Kenyon Cells (KC), which extend parallel axonal fibers to form the γ, α′β′, and αβ lobes of the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Strausfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Each KC receives inputs from a random combination of antennal lobe projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). The KC outputs converge onto 21 types of 34 MB output neurons (MBONs). The dendrites of each MBON type arborize in specific compartments of the MB lobes, and all MBON types together innervate 15 distinct compartments that tile the MB lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). The MB lobes are also extensively innervated by dopaminergic neurons (DANs). About 130 MB-innervating DANs of 20 cell types have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). Like the MBONs, each DAN type projects its axons to distinct MB lobe zones. Distinct types of DANs react selectively to punishment or reward stimuli to potentiate or depress KC-to-MBON synapses in specific compartments; a process believed to be the neural basis of olfactory associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso and Rubin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galili et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lin et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). The role of the MB in innate olfactory behavior has been less studied. It was initially reported that the MB is required for innate odor attraction but not repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that the MB circuit also regulates innate odor repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Siju et al., 2014</xref>). Blocking the MBONs innervating the tips of the horizontal MB lobes impairs a fly's response to aversive odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). It has been proposed that starvation controls sugar memory expression by modulating odor-evoked responses in these MBONs via other neurons in the MB circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). The same MBONs also respond to CO<sub>2</sub> and mediate CO<sub>2</sub>-induced avoidance behavior in both fed and starved flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lewis et al., 2015</xref>). However, blocking neurotransmission of the KCs impairs CO<sub>2</sub> avoidance only in hungry flies, but not in fed flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>). Apparently, hunger and satiety states can influence the information processing of the MB, but to what extent and whether the MB circuit is utilized to regulate hunger-evoked food-seeking behavior in naive flies remains to be addressed.</p><p>In this study, we show that the MB plays an essential role in controlling food-seeking behavior. Flies approach yeast food only when they are hungry. Blocking the KCs strongly impairs yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies. We have identified five MBONs required for hungry flies to seek not only yeast odor, but also apple cider vinegar and banana odors. In vivo functional imaging showed that these MBONs respond to yeast odor and that the responses were modulated by starvation. There are six types of DANs innervating the same MB lobe compartments occupied by the dendritic arbors of the five MBONs. Blockage and activation of these DANs inhibited and promoted yeast food-seeking behavior, respectively. The function of the DANs is mediated by the dopamine receptor DAMB in both the KCs and the MBONs. Finally, we demonstrate that the six DANs potentially receive rich and diverse inputs of hunger and satiety signals. Our data establish the MB as an integration center for hunger-control of innate food-seeking behavior. The DANs constantly monitor the metabolic state of the fly and, when there is a need, reconfigure the KC-to-MBON circuits in specific MB lobe compartments to bias the fly's response to food odors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flies approach yeast food when they are hungry</title><p>We used a single-fly assay to quantify each fly’s food-seeking behavior. For each assay, a male fly was allowed to move freely in a petri dish for 10 min to locate a drop of yeast. Yeast is an ethologically relevant food source for flies and yeast odor has been shown to be a strong attractant for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Scheidler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Stökl et al., 2010</xref>). The assay was performed under red light (630 nm) to minimize visual inputs to the fly. To avoid scoring flies that accidentally passed by the yeast drop, we considered that the fly had found the target when it located and remained on the yeast drop for 3 s or more. We calculated each fly's food-seeking performance based on how quickly it found the yeast drop (see Materials and methods for details). At the population level, average yeast food-seeking performance increased linearly with the duration of food deprivation, suggesting that hunger regulates food-seeking behavior in a graded manner within a high dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Flies starved for 24 hr did not seek a water-only drop, confirming that they were attracted to yeast in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We found that <italic>orco</italic> and <italic>Ir8a</italic> mutant flies could not locate yeast drops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that flies relied on their sense of smell to find the target.

We could not identify a GAL4 line that would allow us to specifically manipulate MBON-β1&gt;α so we did not investigate this neuron type further.

Therefore, there is no strong evidence to suggest that these β′2-innervating MBONs are required for hungry flies to seek yeast food. In summary, we have identified five MBON types—MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ, MBON-β2β′2a, MBON-γ2α′1, MBON-α′2, and MBON-α3—that are critical for yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies. To further ensure that the yeast food-seeking phenotype caused by the blockage of the five MBONs was mainly due to the flies' inability to locate and approach yeast food, we altered how we scored the flies and considered flies as finding the target whenever they touched the yeast drop. Nevertheless, we still found equally strong yeast food-seeking defects using this approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–E</xref>), which was also the case when we used the same scoring method to test flies with blockage of neurotransmission in three major types of KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4F–H</xref>).</p><p>Some MBONs have been shown to encode valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>). Interestingly, not all positive-valence MBONs are required for yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of the five MBONs we identified, only MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ and MBON-γ2α′1 encode positive valence and drive approach behavior; the other three MBONs elicit neither approach nor avoidance behavior when optogenetically activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Are the five MBONs specifically required for yeast-odor seeking or are they also required for hungry flies to seek other food odors? To test these possibilities, we blocked the five MBONs and examined hungry flies’ performance in seeking the source of apple cider vinegar (ACV) and banana odors. We found that all five MBONs required for yeast food-seeking are also important for hungry flies to seek and approach sources of ACV and banana odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also tested the three major KC populations and found that they were also required for ACV- and banana odor-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

We mounted individual flies under a two-photon microscope and presented them with a yeast odor stimulus for 10 s. Odor-evoked calcium transients in the MBONs were imaged using the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). All five MBONs showed hunger-dependent changes in their responses to yeast odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, starvation modulated the two positive-valence MBONs contrastingly: it potentiated MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ and depressed MBON-γ2α′1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Since blocking MBON-γ2α′1 impairs yeast food-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the diminished response to yeast odor in hungry flies suggests that the level of response might be critical (see Discussion for details). Hunger-dependent potentiation was also observed in MBON-α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In MBON-β2β′2a and MBON-α′2, starvation depressed the neurons' response to yeast odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). We note that the reduced hunger-dependent odor response for MBON-γ2α′1 and MBON-α′2 was more pronounced for diluted odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and E</xref>). Therefore, these neurons are more sensitive to changes in odor concentration (at least for the concentration range that we tested) when the fly is starved. This modulation in odor response may be important for hungry flies to navigate along an odor concentration gradient to locate food. Together, our findings show that starvation changes how yeast odor information is processed in the MB circuit by fine-tuning the activities of the five MBONs required for yeast food-seeking behavior. Since an overall increase or decrease in the responses of KCs to yeast odor should result in a general increase or decrease in odor-evoked responses in the MBONs, the bi-directional tuning suggests that the starvation-induced modification likely happens at the KC-to-MBON synapses. It has been shown that when food odor-evoked calcium transients are measured from the cell bodies of the entire KC population, no difference was observed between fed and starved flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>). To check whether this is the case when odor-evoked calcium transients are recorded from individual compartments in the MB lobes, we expressed GCaMP6m in all KCs using <italic>MB010B-splitGAL4</italic> or in γ KCs-only using <italic>MB131B-splitGAL4</italic>, and measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from the compartments innervated by the five food-seeking MBONs. Consistent with previous findings, the yeast odor-evoked responses in these compartments did not differ between fed and hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, unexpectedly, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in the α′2 compartment decreased in response to yeast odor in both fed and hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The nature of this decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and how it is connected to the activation of MBON-α′2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) are unclear. We did not investigate these issues further, but it would be interesting to find out if this decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is specific to yeast odor and if MBON-α′2 also receives inputs from other MB lobe compartments. Overall, our findings and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>) suggest that starvation-induced tuning in yeast odor-evoked responses in the five MBONs is not due to changes in the responses of KCs to yeast odor, supporting that the modulations happen at the KC-to-MBON synapses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35264.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Starvation bi-directionally modulates the responses of MBONs to yeast odor.</title><p>Hunger increases (<bold>A and C</bold>) and decreases (<bold>B, D and E</bold>) yeast odor-evoked calcium transients (visualized using GCaM6m) in (<bold>A</bold>) MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ (with <italic>MB112C-splitGAL4</italic>), (<bold>B</bold>) MBON-γ2α′1 (with <italic>MB077B-splitGAL4</italic>), (<bold>C</bold>) MBON-α3 (with <italic>G0239-GAL4</italic>), (<bold>D</bold>) MBON-β2β′2a (with <italic>MB399B-splitGAL4</italic>), and (<bold>E</bold>) MBON-α′2 (with <italic>MB091C-splitGAL4</italic>).

MBONs whose dendrites innervate other compartments along the α and β lobes have not been examined. Since blockage of MBONs innervating the α3 zones (MBON-α3) and β2 zones (MBON-β2β′2a) suppressed rather than promoted yeast food-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), these MBONs are unlikely to be the targets of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ, at least in terms of regulating the innate behavioral response of flies to yeast odor. Therefore, we tested whether MBON-α1 is a potential target. Knockdown of the GABA-A receptor with two independent RNAi lines and <italic>MB310C-splitGAL4</italic> that specifically labels MBON-α1 resulted in decreased yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

These results suggest that when flies are starved, increased GABA release from MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ inhibits MBON-γ5β′2a/MBON-β′2mp and MBON-α1 via the GABA-A receptor. In turn, suppression of MBON-γ5β′2a/MBON-β′2mp and MBON-α1 positively biases flies' responses toward yeast odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, it is important to note that potential involvement of other GABAergic neurons of the MB circuit, such as APL neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Liu and Davis, 2009</xref>), in the regulation of MBON-γ5β′2a/MBON-β′2mp and MBON-α1 cannot be excluded based on our experiments.

Therefore, we examined the corresponding DANs of the yeast-seeking MBONs that we had identified. For MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ, MBON-γ2α′1, MBON-α′2, and MBON-α3, there is one DAN type—PPL1-γ1pedc, PPL-γ2α′1, PPL1-α′2α2, and PPL1-α3, respectively—whose axonal termini overlap with the dendrites of each of the MBON types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). In contrast, MBON-β2β′2a is potentially regulated by two types of DANs: PAM-β2β′2a and PAM-β′2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).

These results suggest that the corresponding DANs for MBON-α3, MBON-β2β′2a, MBON-α′2, and MBON-γ2α′1 play important roles in regulating yeast food-seeking behavior and that hunger promotes dopamine release in these DANs. The PPL1-γ1pedc DANs have been shown to repress the activity of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ, thereby mediating the hunger control of sugar memory expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, artificial activation of the PPL1-γ1pedc DANs with <italic>UAS-TrpA1</italic>, a heat-sensitive cation channel transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>), reduced yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies at a restrictive 32°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), but not at a permissive 23°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results indicate that the fruit fly uses the same PPL1-γ1pedc-to-MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ neural pathway to mediate hunger control for both innate and learned food-related olfactory cues and that hunger inhibits rather than promotes the release of dopamine by PPL1-γ1pedc DANs. It remains to be determined whether PPL1-α3, PAM-β2β′2a, PAM-β′2a, PPL1-α′2α2, and PPL1-γ2α′1 DANs play a role in regulating hunger-dependent sugar memory expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35264.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>DANs mediate hunger-control of yeast food-seeking behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Male flies starved for 24 hr were assessed for their yeast food-seeking performance.

However, these flies performed normally in seeking yeast food, suggesting that olfactory learning contributes minimally in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The minimum olfactory learning effect might be due to yeast odor having a strong innate value to the fly, so it cannot be easily conditioned. Another possible reason is that we activated or silenced DANs for 10 min before testing flies in the food-seeking assay, but fly olfactory conditioning has been demonstrated to be strongest if unconditioned stimuli (in our case, the activation or silencing of DANs) come in slightly later than conditioned stimuli (odors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). It is not clear whether pairing odors with activation of PAM-β2β′2a and PAM-β′2a DANs induces an aversive or appetitive memory. Nevertheless, we found that pre-conditioning yeast odor with activation or silencing of PAM-β2β′2a and PAM-β′2a DANs did not change flies' yeast food-seeking performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>). Finally, pairing yeast odor with silencing of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ before testing also did not influence flies' yeast food-seeking behavior <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2G</xref>, even though silencing of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ has been shown to induce an aversive memory when it is paired with an odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Ueoka et al., 2017</xref>). These results and the anatomy of the MB circuits indicate that the six DANs we have identified might be the main switches the hunger and satiety signals used to tune the innate behavioral response of fruit flies to the smell of food.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The dopamine receptor DAMB functions pre- and post-synaptically to mediate hunger control</title><p>To gain more mechanistic insights into how the DANs mediate hunger control, we sought dopamine receptors that are involved in the process.

This is not surprising because DAMB is strongly expressed in all KC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 1996</xref>). However, we found that DAMB in the MBONs is also required for yeast food-seeking behavior. Knockdown of DAMB in MBON-β2β′2a, MBON-γ2α′1, and MBON-α3 with two independent RNAi lines significantly impaired yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

To search for evidence that these DANs are modulated by starvation, we first checked their spontaneous activities using in vivo functional imaging according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found the spontaneous activities to be variable among individuals and we failed to identify obvious differences between fed and hungry flies. We then checked the odor-evoked responses in these DANs. Some DANs have been shown to respond to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Felsenberg et al., 2017</xref>), and we reasoned that changes in the odor-evoked responses of these DANs could be detected if their excitability is modulated by hunger. Interestingly, we found that starvation decreased the yeast odor-evoked calcium transient in PPL1-γ1pedc DANs but increased it in PPL1-α3 DANs, consistent with our behavioral data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref>). However, we did not detect starvation-induced change in odor-evoked responses of PAM-β2β′2a and PPL1-α′2α2 DANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). Also, PAM-β′2a and PPL-γ2α′1 DANs showed small and inconsistent responses to yeast odor in both hungry and fed flies (data not shown). Recent studies have found that some DANs receive direct inputs from the KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>).

This supports our notion that the starvation-induced modulations we observed are not due to changes in circuits upstream of the KCs.

A recent study demonstrated that serotonin is a general hunger signal that affects a wide range of feeding-related behaviors in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 2015</xref>). To examine whether serotonin also regulates hunger-evoked yeast food-seeking behavior, we first used <italic>R50H05-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>UAS-shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic> to block serotoninergic neurons in hungry flies.

We next examined whether the effect of serotonin is mediated by the six food-seeking DANs through RNAi knockdown of each of the five serotonin receptors in these DANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that serotonin receptors in PPL1-γ2α′1 and PPL1-γ1pedc DANs are critical for yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–F</xref>), suggesting that hunger-evoked serotonin release may control the response of flies to the smell of yeast food through these two DANs. Interestingly, the two DAN types are regulated by different serotonin receptors. Knockdown of 5HT1B receptors in PPL1-γ2α′1 DANs with two independent RNAi lines impaired yeast food-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3A</xref>), but no significant defect was detected when the same receptor was knocked down in PPL1-γ1pedc DANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). In contrast, no phenotypic deficiency was observed when 5HT2A receptors were knocked down in PPL-γ2α′1 DANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), whereas knockdown of 5HT2A receptors with two independent RNAi lines in the PPL1-γ1pedc DANs strongly impaired yeast food-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s3">Figure 10—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Differential usage of these serotonin receptors may potentially explain how starvation activates PPL1-γ2α′1 DANs but inhibits PPL1-γ1pedc DANs.

The random connectivity between antennal lobe projection neurons and the KCs makes the MB an ideal circuit for olfactory learning, but not for encoding innate odor valences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). However, recent studies suggest that the MB also plays a role in innate odor responses. Switching off KC outputs impairs the responses of flies to attractive odors at low concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wang et al., 2003</xref>) and decreases their aversion to CO<sub>2</sub> when they are hungry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>). Blocking the neurotransmission of β′2-innervating MBONs reduces the avoidance behavior of flies to aversive odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we provide further evidence to support the role of MB circuits in innate olfactory behavior. Switching off the output synapses of each of the three major KC types compromises the abilities of flies to seek food odors. Five MB output neurons—MBON-α3, MBON-β2β′2a, MBON-α′2, MBON-γ2α′1, and MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ—collectively drive hungry flies to follow the smell of food. MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ does so by inhibiting MBON-α1, MBON-β′2mp and MBON-γ5β′2a. Our data, together with previous studies, suggest that the MB is a value-processing center for both trained and untrained odors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The MB potentially receives rich inputs of hunger and satiety signals</title><p>An unexpected finding of our study is that the MB may receive remarkably rich inputs of hunger and satiety signals. It has previously been shown that PPL1-γ1pedc DANs are regulated by NPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we tested two satiety signals (insulin and AstA) and three hunger signals (serotonin, sNPF, and NPF), and found that the six DAN types regulating food-seeking behavior are differentially modulated by combinations of these signals. PPL1-γ1pedc and PPL1-α3 DANs are regulated exclusively by hunger signals, whereas PPL1-α′2α2 DANs only receive satiety signals. The other three DAN types are regulated by both signals. Our survey is by no means complete, so hunger and satiety regulation of these DANs might be even richer. It is important to point out that although our RNAi experiments suggest that the food-seeking DANs receive direct inputs of hunger and satiety signals, further study is required to identify their upstream serotonergic and peptidergic neurons, showing the functional connections to these DANs and demonstrating the expression and cellular localization of the receptors for hunger and satiety signals in them. If these DANs indeed receive direct hunger and satiety input signals, it would be interesting to understand the purpose of such rich regulation and how a single DAN integrates multiple hunger and satiety signals. Nevertheless, our data imply that the satiety state could have a strong impact on MB circuit computations. Indeed, in addition to controlling appetitive memory expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>), hunger also gates memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, feeding flies nutritious sugar after olfactory learning changes the activity of PPL1-γ1pedc DANs and this change upregulates energy metabolism in the MB to promote long-term memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). Nutritious sugar feeding has also been shown to immediately suppress the PAM-γ3 DANs via the AstA signaling pathway, and this suppression provides a positive reinforcing signal for the formation of sugar-odor associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yamagata et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, starvation recruits the MB for CO<sub>2</sub> avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>). The MB circuit has been shown to be involved in thirst-driven water-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Lin et al., 2014b</xref>), sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>), decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DasGupta et al., 2014</xref>), and temperature preference behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shih et al., 2015</xref>). Given the broad influence of hunger and satiety on the MB-innervating DANs, the MB may serve as an integration center for hunger to interact with other motivations, giving rise to hierarchical behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hunger tunes the response of MBONs to yeast odor</title><p>Our study reveals that hunger tunes the response of MBONs to yeast odor in a cell-type-specific manner. The outputs of the five MBONs we have identified are required for food-seeking behavior. Since flies only seek food when they are hungry, it could be expected that starvation potentiates food odor-evoked responses in these MBONs. Indeed, starvation increases yeast-odor responses in MBON-α3 and MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ; yet, intriguingly, it depresses the responses in the other three MBONs. These unexpected results suggest that the level of odor-evoked response might be critical in some MBONs. We propose a putative circuit mechanism to explain this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this putative configuration, MBONs like MBON-β2β′2a, MBON-α′2, and MBON-γ2α′1 connect to two downstream neurons with different connectivity strength, and the weakly connected downstream neuron (neuron B) inhibits the strongly connected one (neuron A). Under this configuration, only weakly evoked MBONs under starvation will engage neuron A and induce food-seeking behavior. Importantly, in this model, blocking the MBON will also impair food-seeking behavior in hungry flies. A similar activity level-dependent mechanism has been observed in courtship-promoting P1 interneurons in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>). Low-frequency activation of P1 neurons evokes aggression, whereas high-frequency activation of the same neurons inhibits aggression but promotes wing extension. Our hypothetical model remains to be investigated and there are certainly many other possible circuit configurations that can achieve a similar effect. It will be important to identify the neural circuits downstream of the MBONs to understand how the outputs of the MBONs are integrated and translated into food-seeking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DAMB is critical for hunger control of food-seeking behavior</title><p>Hunger-induced modulation appears to occur both pre- and post-synaptically through DAMB receptors. Knockdown of DAMB either in KCs or MBONs (except MBON-α′2) impairs yeast food-seeking behavior in hungry flies. DAMB is highly expressed in all KCs, and immunostaining results have showed that DAMB is mainly distributed in axonal processes, but is absent from dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 1996</xref>). However, our data suggest that DAMB might also function in the dendrites of the MBONs. Consistent with this possibility, a recent study found that DAMB is required in MBON-α′3 to allow flies to become accustomed to novel odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hattori et al., 2017</xref>). In the same study, a GAL4 transgene inserted in the genomic locus of DAMB labels MBON-α′3. Nevertheless, it remains to be demonstrated that the MBONs required for food-seeking behavior also express DAMB and that DAMB can be localized to the dendrites of these MBONs.</p><p>Another dopamine receptor, DopR1, is also highly expressed in the KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). DopR1 has been shown to be critical for the acquisition of olfactory memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), whereas DAMB is mainly required for memory maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). This scenario raises an interesting question as to how these two dopamine receptors are differentially utilized by the MB circuit. An attractive hypothesis is that phasic dopamine release evoked by rewards or punishments during learning activates DopR1, and tonic (or spontaneous) dopamine release mainly engages DAMB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berry and Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ichinose et al., 2017</xref>). Although this hypothesis remains to be tested, our study provides another supportive example of satiety state, which presumably modulates DAN activities in a mild and sustained manner, controlling food-seeking behavior via DAMB.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Odor specificity in MB-mediated behavior</title><p>The lack of stereotypic connectivity between olfactory inputs and the KCs, together with the reinforcing DANs and the valence-encoding MBONs, make the MB an ideal center for olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>). It has been suggested that a given odor drives a collection of balanced MBON outputs in naive flies, and learning activates distinct reinforcing DANs that skew the outputs by changing the connectivity of specific KC-to-MBON synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>). Although each MBON and DAN is in contact with a large number of KCs wherein odors are sparsely coded, learning only modifies the output synapses of the KCs that are activated near to when reinforcement signals are triggered. Therefore, learning only skews the MBON outputs driven by trained odors. Such odor specificity is more difficult to achieve in MB-mediated motivated behavior. Hunger seems to regulate DAN activity and tip the balance of MBON outputs independently of olfactory inputs. According to the current model of how the MB circuit operates, starvation should assign positive valence to all odors, rather than just food odors. However, this supposition may not be entirely true. It has been shown that the MB is dispensable for CO<sub>2</sub> avoidance in food-satiated flies but, when flies are starved, blockage of the KCs decreases CO<sub>2</sub> avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräcker et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, starvation in this scenario seems to change the CO<sub>2</sub>-driven MBON output valence from nil to negative. Interestingly, a comprehensive study on odor tuning in MBONs suggests that although MBONs are generally broadly tuned to odors, they do encode some odor specificity. In particular, odor groups of opposing valence are well separated in the MBON coding space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hige et al., 2015b</xref>). How this is achieved given the probabilistic input connectivity of the antennal lobe projection neurons to the KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caron et al., 2013</xref>) remains to be answered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Male flies (5–7 days old) of appropriate genotype were collected under CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia and allowed to recover for 2 days on standard cornmeal food. Single flies were introduced into petri dishes (85 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height) close to the dish wall. For experiments conducted at 23°C, a 5 µl drop of yeast, apple cider vinegar (Alce Nero, Italy), or banana odor solution was placed in the middle of each dish. The banana odor solution was prepared by dissolving 3 g banana powder (Gen Asia Biotech, Taiwan) in 5 ml sterilized water. The yeast solution was prepared as follows: 1 g dry yeast (Ferminpan red, Italy) and 5 g sucrose (Merck, Germany; 107687) were mixed with 50 ml sterilized water and incubated in a 28°C shaking incubator (170 rpm) for 16 hr. For experiments conducted at 32°C, the odor solutions were diluted (1:4 for yeast; 1:500 for apple cider vinegar; 1:3 for banana odor) by mixing with 1% agar (BD, NJ, USA; 214530) because odors are more volatile and evaporate more easily at higher temperature. At these dilutions, wild-type flies exhibited similar food-seeking performance under both temperatures. Experiments were conducted under 630 nm LED lights. A fly was considered as having found the food when it rested for 3 s or longer on the food drop. We chose 3 s to avoid scoring flies that accidentally passing by the food drop. To induce hunger in flies, they were starved on 1% agar for 24 hr, except for the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, in which they were starved for various durations. For experiments using <italic>UAS-TrpA1</italic> and <italic>UAS-Shi<sup>ts1</sup>,</italic> flies were raised at 23°C before being shifted to 32°C for 10 min to activate or block the relevant neurons. All experiments not involving a temperature-sensitive effector were performed at 23°C. We calculated the ‘Food-seeking index’ as: [Total assay time (600 s) - the time taken to locate food (sec)]/Total assay time (600 s). Statistical analyses were conducted in Prism 7 software (GraphPad, CA, USA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>). As our behavioral data did not conform to normal distributions, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison tests were used to detect differences between experimental groups and their relevant controls.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-35264-video1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35264.035</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Single fly food-seeking assay</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Conditioning flies before food-seeking assay</title><p>Around 50 flies with desired genotypes were starved for 24 hr on 1% agar at 23°C.

After fixation, the brains were washed three times for 20 min each in PBST (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated for 30 min in PBST with 5% normal goat serum (blocking solution; Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, USA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2336990">AB_2336990</ext-link>). Then the brains were incubated in the blocking solution with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The next day, the brains were washed three times for 20 min each in PBST at room temperature and then incubated with secondary antibodies in PBST at 4°C overnight. The brains were then washed three times for 20 min each in PBST at room temperature and mounted with Gold Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA; S36937). Antibodies used in this study are listed in Key resources table. The stained brains were imaged using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM880) and analyzed in the software platform Fiji/ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>). To measure the DSyd-1-GFP and DenMark signals, regions of interest (ROIs) containing DSyd-1-GFP were manually outlined focal plane by focal plane. Mean intensities of both DSyd-1-GFP and DenMark signals were measured using the same ROIs. These mean intensity data are normally distributed (D′Agostino and Pearson normality test, p&gt;0.05) and therefore comparisons between fed and hungry flies were made using unpaired t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo functional imaging</title><p>Two-photon imaging of odor-evoked calcium responses was performed on 3–8 day-old flies following 22–26 hr of starvation or <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding. Flies were anesthetized on ice and mounted in an imaging chamber (Warner Instruments, CT, USA; PH-5/RC-20), and the head was affixed by sealing the eyes to the chamber with paraffin wax (Sigma; 327304). The legs and proboscis were immobilized with wax to reduce movements while imaging. Part of the head capsule was removed to allow optic access to the brain under sugar-free HL3-like saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Yoshihara, 2012</xref>). We used a 20x water-immersion objective and a Zeiss 880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope with a two-photon laser (Spectra-Physics, CA, USA; Mai Tai HP 1040S) to acquire images (100 × 100 pixels; 8.088 Hz). Yeast odor was delivered on a clean air carrier stream, and it was diluted further x10 or x100 with sterilized ddH<sub>2</sub>O for some experimental groups. At the resting state, air constantly flowed through the control vial and was delivered to the fly antennae. During imaging, flies were exposed to yeast odor for 10 s, then re-exposed to clean air for the remaining time. At least two trials were conducted on each fly, and the inter-trial interval was longer than 3 mins. For data analysis, all acquired images were analyzed using Fiji/ImageJ (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>). Regions of interest were manually assigned to the anatomically distinct neuronal processes. The change in ΔF/F was calculated, with baseline fluorescence F being defined as the mean fluorescence from 5 s prior to odor delivery. Data from individual flies is presented as the mean result from at least two trials. The area under the curve (AUC) was measured as the integral of ΔF/F during the 10 s between onset and offset of odor delivery. Data were excluded if flies did not show any visible response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RT-PCR</title><p>RT-PCR was performed using a S1000 Thermal Cycler (BioRad, CA, USA).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom bodies integrate hunger and satiety signals to control innate food-seeking behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The two reviewers agreed that examining the effects of hunger and satiety on the larger MB circuit is interesting and important. However, it is not clear how generalizable some of the results are and a number of additional experiments were recommended. Because these experiments are likely to require more than two months to complete, we feel that it is most appropriate to reject the manuscript. However, if the experiments suggested by reviewer 2 (1-3) are performed, we would be happy to consider a new version. Of course, we understand that you may wish to take your paper elsewhere at this time, and certainly would not wish you to carry out extensive new experiments unless you agree that they are scientifically reasonable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The mushroom body (MB) in insect brains has been extensively studied as a model system for learning and memory. Dr. Lin previously demonstrated that behavioral expression of odor-reward memories in the MB are gated by motivational states (i.e. hungry or thirsty). This paper provides comprehensive circuit-level analysis of the MB for innate behavioral responses to a food-related odor and its motivational regulation. The authors first established a simple assay to measure response time for flies to locate food, and showed that it requires olfaction and the response time is shortened when flies are hungry. Blocking any one of three major classes of MB's intrinsic neurons or specific MB output neurons (MBONs) prolonged response time. Using in vivo calcium imaging, the authors demonstrated that odor responses of MB output neurons to yeast are altered in hungry flies. Intriguingly the effect of starvation differed among the MBON cell types. Furthermore, the authors extended their analysis to dopaminergic neurons (DANs), connections between MBONs and molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Overall, the paper provides new insights into hunger modulation of the MB circuit, which has not been studied sufficiently. Below I list my major concerns and suggestions for further improvements.</p><p>1) The authors proposed that starvation and satiety signals modulate DANs, and that in turn modulates odor response of MBONs. Directly demonstrating starvation effects on DANs and Kenyon Cells is essential to support this idea. Also, odor concentration dependency in Figure 4B and E could be due to modulation at earlier steps (e.g. in the antennal lobes) rather than dopamine-dependent modulation in the MB lobes.</p><p>2) Show specificity and generality of the effect to food odors by testing other odors. Using T-maze, Bräcker et al., 2013 described that &quot;Blocking of MB output, on the other hand, had no effect on the attraction to vinegar alone (Figure S1)&quot;. Repeating experiments in Figure 2 and 3 with vinegar (and if necessary repeating experiments in Figure 4 with vinegar) would be important to evaluate the generality of the findings.</p><p>3) dTrpA1 activation of the DANs could induce aversive memory of yeast. Recent papers showed that flies can form olfactory memory when they smelled odors while MBONs or DANs are blocked (Yamagata et al., 2016; Ueoka et al., 2017). Therefore, the observed defect in some of dTrpA1 shibire experiments (e.g. Figure 3A and 6F) could be because flies formed aversive memory of yeast odors. I suggest repeating at least a few key results in a learning mutant background; i.e., repeat shibire and dTrpA1 experiments in Figure 3 and 6 in <italic>rutabaga2080</italic> mutant background.</p><p>4) Description of the assay and quantification of flies' behavior are insufficient. Diagram of the assay, example trajectories of flies and movies would be helpful to better understand the assay.</p><p>5) Authors defined that a fly was considered as having found the food when it rested for 3 s or longer on the food drop. Why 3 seconds? What if it is set as 1s or shorter?</p><p>6) For all the behavioral experiments with RNAi, expression of receptors in the targeted cell types and its knockdown by RNAi should be shown. Otherwise, authors should significantly tone down conclusions regarding RNAi experiments, and explicitly write that RNAi experiment does not necessarily prove expression of the targeted gene.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript extensively examined roles of the mushroom body (MB) －Kenyon cells (KCs), mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), and MB-projecting dopaminergic neurons (DANs) – in the yeast odor-seeking behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Roles of the MB circuits in innate/acquired odor approach have repeatedly been reported (e.g. Bracker et al., 2013; Lewis et al., 2015; Owald et al., 2015, Nat Neurosci; Perisse et al., 2016). Additionally multiple studies have shown that hunger and satiety signals converge in the MB through DANs/damb, and change MBON responses (e.g. Krashes et al., 2009; Musso et al., 2015; Hige et al., 2015; Perisse et al., 2016). The major findings in this study is a) the comprehensive identification of cell types and the MB network important for yeast odor approach; b) that hunger/satiety changes the calcium responses of these MBONs to the yeast odor; c) neuropeptidergic pathways that modulate the dopaminergic neurons involved in yeast odor-seeking. Overall, the work is thorough and well controlled, and I have only few technical concerns.</p><p>1) I did not understand the authors' explanation regarding why the response of some MBONs required for the yeast-seeking are suppressed upon starvation (Figure 4).</p><p>2) This study used only yeast odor, and thus generalization to &quot;food odors&quot; should be done with more care; it is questionable if MBONs identified in this study are required for other food odors like vinegar.</p><p>3) The &quot;food-seeking index&quot; in their assay takes into account time spent for eating yeast. This means, in principle, that flies with normal odor approach but without continuous feeding (&gt; 3s as the authors define) would be scored as &quot;impaired&quot; in food seeking. Were there such flies?</p><p>4) Maybe it might be too neurotic, but fly food usually contains yeast, such that the behavior in this assay can contain an experience-dependent component.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;<italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom bodies integrate hunger and satiety signals to control innate food-seeking behavior&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining changes to the text that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Based on RNAi experiments, the authors concluded that &quot;DANs receive surprisingly rich inputs of hunger and satiety signals&quot;. To support the conclusion, authors would need to show a) which specific serotonergic or peptidergic neurons mediate hunger/satiety signals, b) they are anatomically and functionally connected to DANs, c) localize receptors in DAN's dendrites, and d) establish physiological effect of serotonin/neuropeptides on DANs. Behavioral phenotype with RNAi may provide good starting point for such endeavor, but I would describe it as a modest evidence for &quot;rich inputs of hunger and satiety signals&quot;. Please tone down the conclusions and discuss the caveats of these experiments.</p><p>2) Related to the above criticism, GABA receptor knock down in Figure 6B-D is consistent with the model in Figure 6F, but does not necessarily prove it. It is unclear if the RNAi knock down phenotype is due to disruption of GABA signals from MB-MVP2 or other GABAergic neurons including MB-APL. Please note this caveat.</p><p>3) The new Syd1-GFP data is possibly interesting, but it is very weak evidence for state dependent modulation of active zones. Syd1-GFP is under the control of GAL4/UAS rather than endogenous promoter as in brp-GFP BAC (Chen et al., 2014). Therefore GFP signals do not necessarily correlate with amount of endogenous Syd1. Also Syd1-GFP fluorescence would not change depending on whether Syd1-GFP molecules are in the functional active zone molecular complex or outside of active zone as a non-functional form. Authors would need more direct measurement of active zones quantity and density. Please state this caveat.</p><p>4) In Figure 5 and 9, it would be more intuitive if color for fed and starved are swapped. The color for &quot;starved&quot; should be more salient than basal &quot;fed&quot; state.</p><p>5) Figure 14 explains how the MBON that showed reduced response at hunger induces food-seeking behavior, but this can't be generalized to all the MBONs. In other words, it looks as if there were no other circuit explanations. This figure should be a figure supplement and the authors can also try to shorten the text explaining this model.</p><p>6) Table 2 shows extreme efforts that the authors have made, but is very hard to follow. Please make it simpler by showing the results by the cell types but not drivers.</p><p>7) The newly added Figure 4 has too much information. Reconsider the essential dataset to show in the main figure and move the others (e.g. the permissive control to a figure supplement).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35264.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Overall, the paper provides new insights into hunger modulation of the MB circuit, which has not been studied sufficiently.

Beshel and Zhong have shown that, when measured from the cell bodies of all KCs using calcium imaging, the food odor-evoked response did not differ between fed and starved flies (Beshel and Zhong, 2013). In our revised manuscript, we have performed additional experiments and show that KC responses to yeast odor remained the same between fed and hungry flies even when we measured odorevoked calcium signals from specific MB lobe compartments innervated by the five food-seeking MBONs (revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These new data support that the hunger-modulated odor responses in the MBONs are not due to changes of odor response in KCs and their upstream circuits.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that understanding which aspects of the DANs are modulated by starvation is an important and very interesting question. We have performed additional experiments to show that odor responses in some DANs are modulated by hunger. Interestingly, PPL1-γ1pdec DANs show a decreased odor response and PPL1-α3 DANs show an increased odor response in starved flies (revised Figure 9). This is consistent with our behavioral data, which suggest that hunger positively regulates PPL-α3 DANs but suppresses PPL1-γ1pdec DANs. Furthermore, in several DANs whose activities are promoted by starvation (as suggested by our behavioral data), the density or size of their active zones marked by Dsyd-1-GFP is significantly higher in hungry flies (revised Figure 10). Other physiological properties of the DANs may also be modulated by hunger and satiety, but a comprehensive survey is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Show specificity and generality of the effect to food odors by testing other odors. Using T-maze, Bräcker et al., 2013 described that &quot;Blocking of MB output, on the other hand, had no effect on the attraction to vinegar alone (Figure S1)&quot;. Repeating experiments in Figure 2 and 3 with vinegar (and if necessary repeating experiments in Figure 4 with vinegar) would be important to evaluate the generality of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added new data showing that both KCs and the five MBONs we have identified are also important for hungry flies to approach apple cider vinegar and banana odors (revised Figure 4). These data suggest that the MB pathways we have identified are generally required for flies to seek food odors. The difference between the T-maze results in Bräcker et al. and our data may highlight the importance of behavioral assay choice in uncovering neural mechanisms of behavior. In T-maze, flies are choosing between fresh air and high concentration of an odor, whereas in our assay, flies need to navigate along odor concentration gradients to locate food. We believe that our behavioral paradigm is a more natural setting for assaying food seeking behavior and is potentially more sensitive in identifying neurons required for this behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) dTrpA1 activation of the DANs could induce aversive memory of yeast. Recent papers showed that flies can form olfactory memory when they smelled odors while MBONs or DANs are blocked (Yamagata et al., 2016; Ueoka et al., 2017). Therefore, the observed defect in some of dTrpA1 shibire experiments (e.g. Figure 3A and 6F) could be because flies formed aversive memory of yeast odors. I suggest repeating at least a few key results in a learning mutant background; i.e., repeat shibire and dTrpA1 experiments in Figure 3 and 6 in rutabaga2080 mutant background.</p></disp-quote><p>The changes in food-seeking behavior we observed when we activated or blocked DANs are unlikely a result of olfactory learning. In the six DANs we have shown to regulate food-seeking behavior, four of them—PPL1-α3, PPL1-α′2α2, PPL1-γ2α′1, and PPL1-γ1pdec—have been shown to implant aversive olfactory memories when their activation is paired with odors (Aso and Rubin, 2016). In our study, we found that activation of PPL1-α3, PPL1-α′2α2, and PPL1-γ2α′1 DANs promotes rather than inhibits food-seeking behavior. Therefore, our findings are the opposite of what would be expected if the flies had formed aversive memories to yeast odors. The memory formation argument is plausible for PPL1-γ1pdec, and it is unclear what types of memory can be induced when pairing odors with the activation of PAM-β2β′2a and PAM-β′2a (the other two DANs that promote food-seeking behavior identified in our study). We have performed additional experiments to directly test whether artificially induced olfactory learning has any impact on our food-seeking assays. We paired yeast odor with the activation or silencing of PPL1-γ1pdec, PAM-β2β′2a, and PAM-β′2a DANs for 2 min and tested food-seeking behavior shortly thereafter. We found that this pre-conditioning of yeast odor has no effect on food-seeking behavior, arguing that olfactory learning plays a minimum role in our study (revised Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We have also done the same experiments for MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ and found that pre-conditioning yeast odor with the silencing of MBON-γ1pedc&gt;αβ has no effect on food-seeking behavior either (revised Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We did not perform the <italic>rutabaga</italic> experiment because we have shown that DAMB is critical for hunger-driven food-seeking behavior and the cAMP pathway has been shown to be downstream of DAMB (Himmelreich et al., Cell Report 2017; Han et al., Neuron 1996).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Description of the assay and quantification of flies' behavior are insufficient.

We have performed additional experiments by scoring flies as on target whenever they touched the food drop and found that it does not affect our conclusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For all the behavioral experiments with RNAi, expression of receptors in the targeted cell types and its knockdown by RNAi should be shown. Otherwise, authors should significantly tone down conclusions regarding RNAi experiments, and explicitly write that RNAi experiment does not necessarily prove expression of the targeted gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not check the expression of receptors due to a lack of appropriate antibodies. However, most of the RNAi lines we used in our study have been published in other studies (see Table 1). Nevertheless, we have repeated all our RNAi knockdown experiments with a second set of RNAi lines and found the same results (revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Figure 8—figure supplement 1, Figure 11—figure supplement 3 and Figure 12—figure supplement 1). We have also included in this revised manuscript RT-PCR data showing the knockdown efficiency of the RNAi lines (revised Figure 6—figure supplement 3). I believe the replication of the behavioral phenotypes with this second set of RNAi lines greatly strengthens our conclusion that the DANs receive rich inputs of hunger and satiety signals. However, as suggested by the reviewer, we have added a note stating that expression of these receptors in the DANs remains to be established (subsection “DANs are differentially regulated by hunger and satiety signals”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) I did not understand the authors' explanation regarding why the response of some MBONs required for the yeast-seeking are suppressed upon starvation (Figure 4).</p></disp-quote><p>We have offered more explanations (subsection “Hunger tunes the response of MBONs to yeast odor”) and added a putative model (revised Figure 14) to illustrate how this might work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This study used only yeast odor, and thus generalization to &quot;food odors&quot; should be done with more care; it is questionable if MBONs identified in this study are required for other food odors like vinegar.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated our MBON and KC experiments with vinegar and banana odors and found that these neurons are also required for flies to seek these two food odors (revised Figure 4).
