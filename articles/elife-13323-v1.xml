However, several studies have suggested significant problems with the current system of grant peer review. One problem is that the number of reviewers is typically inadequate to provide statistical precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kaplan et al., 2008</xref>). Researchers have also found considerable variation among scores and disagreement regarding review criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mayo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Graves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdoul et al., 2012</xref>), and a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model of 18,959 applications to the NIH found evidence of reviewer bias that influenced as much as a quarter of funding decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although there is general agreement that peer review can discriminate sound grant applications from those containing serious flaws, it is uncertain whether peer review can accurately predict those meritorious applications that are most likely to be productive. An analysis of over 400 competing renewal grant applications at one NIH institute (the National Institute of General Medical Sciences) found no correlation between percentile score and publication productivity of funded grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2013</xref>). A subsequent study of 1492 grants at another NIH institute (the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) similarly found no correlation between the percentile score and publication or citation productivity, even after correction for numerous variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Danthi et al., 2014</xref>). These observations suggest that once grant applications have been determined to be meritorious, expert reviewers cannot accurately predict their productivity.</p><p>In contrast, a recent analysis of over 130,000 grant applications funded by the NIH between 1980 and 2008 concluded that better percentile scores consistently correlate with greater productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Agha, 2015</xref>). Although the limitations of using retrospective publication/citation productivity to validate peer review are acknowledged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lindner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lauer and Nakamura, 2015</xref>), this large study has been interpreted as vindicating grant peer review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mervis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Williams, 2015</xref>). However, the relevance of those findings for the current situation is questionable since the analysis included many funded grants with poor percentile scores (&gt;40th percentile) that would not be considered competitive today. Moreover, this study did not examine the important question of whether percentile scores can accurately stratify meritorious applications to identify those most likely to be productive.</p><p>We therefore performed a re-analysis of the same dataset to specifically address this question. Our analysis focused on subset of grants in the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Agha, 2015</xref>) that were awarded a percentile score of 20 or better: this subset contained 102,740 grants. This percentile range is most relevant because NIH paylines (that is, the lowest percentile score that is funded) seldom exceed the 20th percentile and have hovered around the 10th percentile for some institutes in recent years.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Publication and citation productivity in relation to percentile score</title> <p>A median of 6 publications was supported per grant. A plot of publication productivity versus percentile score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) shows a wide range of publication productivity at any given percentile score with no significant difference in productivity between any adjacent cohorts. A plot of citation productivity versus percentile score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) shows similar variability in productivity. Applications with percentile scores of 2 or better generated significantly more citations than applications receiving poorer scores; however, this was not true for applications receiving scores of 3 or higher. Although it was not possible to adjust citation numbers according to the year of award, a previous analysis of the dataset found that cohort effects relating to fiscal year did not influence the relationship between percentile score and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Agha, 2015</xref>). While our re-analysis confirms that there is a correlation between percentile score and publication or citation productivity for applications with scores in the top 20 percentiles, the correlation is quite modest (slope = â0.132 Â± 0.005 publications and â9.6 Â± 0.337 citations for each percentile score increment, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0078), suggesting that the overall ability of review groups to predict application success is weak at best. A random forest model indicated that only ~1% of the variance in productivity could be accounted for by percentile ranking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that all of the effort currently spent in peer review has a minimal impact in stratifying meritorious applications relative to what would be expected from a random ranking.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13323.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Publication and citation productivity in relation to percentile score.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of publications acknowledging support from grants within five years of grant approval (from PubMed) versus the percentile score: the bar shows the mean number of publications for all grants with that percentile score.

Substantial overlap is evident between percentile scores for grants in the upper and lower halves based upon both publication productivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and citation productivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): for example, if only half of applications could be funded, a grant in the top half of applications based on citations would only have a 58% chance of being funded if decisions were based on percentile scores.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13323.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Grants stratified on the basis of publication and citation productivity for different percentile scores.</title><p>Graphs showing, for percentile scores of 20 or better, the number of grants in the top half (left bar) and bottom half (right right) of grants on the basis of publications (<bold>A</bold>) and citations (<bold>B</bold>).

This may contribute to a pervasive sense of arbitrariness with regard to funding decisions and dissatisfaction with the peer review system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pagano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fang and Casadevall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Costello, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Germain, 2015</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, these findings contradict the notion that peer review can determine which applications are most likely to be productive. The excellent productivity exhibited by many projects with relatively poor scores and the poor productivity exhibited by some projects with outstanding scores demonstrate the inherent unpredictability of scientific research. The data also suggest that current paylines are inadequate to fund the most productive applications and that considerable potential productivity is being left on the table at current funding levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that percentile scores and publication/citation productivity are not necessarily independent. Citation practices have evolved over time, and citations per paper approximately doubled between 1980 and 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wallace et al., 2009</xref>). This may have contributed to greater citation productivity for more recent grants, which would tend to have more favorable percentile scores than older ones, as paylines have declined over time, resulting in a correlation between percentile score and citation productivity that is unrelated to the discriminatory ability of the peer review process. In addition, applications that are funded despite scoring worse than the payline tend to be funded later in the fiscal year and are often subject to budgetary reductions that could adversely impact their future productivity. According to a report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), 13% of R01 applications funded in fiscal years 2003â2007 were exceptions with scores worse than the payline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">GAO, 2009</xref>). This may be an additional contributing factor to the correlation between percentile score and publication and citation productivity that is not indicative of peer review discrimination.</p><p>These observations have important implications for the grant peer review system. If reviewers are unable to reliably predict which meritorious applications are most likely to be productive, then reviewers might save time and resources by simply identifying the top 20% and awarding funding within this group on a random basis or according to programmatic priorities. In this regard, we refer to our recent suggestion that the NIH consider a modified lottery system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang and Casadevall, 2014</xref>) and note that the New Zealand Health Research Council has already moved to a lottery system to select proposals for funding in its Explorer Grants program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Health Research Council of New Zealand, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In summary, while our analysis confirms that peer review has some ability to discriminate between the quality of proposals based on citation productivity over the entire range of percentileÂ scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li and Agha, 2015</xref>), this does not extend to the critical range of percentile scores between 3 and 20, whichÂ isÂ the most relevant subset of applications at current paylines. Furthermore, the best science is not necessarily receiving support under the present system since most applications in this percentile range, whether above or below current paylines, are indistinguishable with regard to citation productivity. The manner in which scarce research funds are allocated deserves greater attention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A database derived from 102,740 research project (R01) grants funded by the NIH from 1980 through 2008 was obtained from Danielle Li (Harvard University) and Richard Nakamura (NIH Center for Scientific Review).
