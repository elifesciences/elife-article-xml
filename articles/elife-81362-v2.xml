The model BMC is the carboxysome that encapsulates enzymes for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation to increase efficiency and is found in many autotrophic bacteria, such as cyanobacteria. Despite their importance in the global carbon cycle, little is known about how carboxysomes are spatially regulated. We recently identified the two-factor system required for the maintenance of carboxysome distribution (McdAB). McdA drives the equal spacing of carboxysomes via interactions with McdB, which associates with carboxysomes. McdA is a ParA/MinD ATPase, a protein family well studied in positioning diverse cellular structures in bacteria. However, the adaptor proteins like McdB that connect these ATPases to their cargos are extremely diverse. In fact, McdB represents a completely unstudied class of proteins. Despite the diversity, many adaptor proteins undergo phase separation, but functional roles remain unclear. Here, we define the domain architecture of McdB from the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942, and dissect its mode of biomolecular condensate formation. We identify an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that modulates condensate solubility, a central coiled-coil dimerizing domain that drives condensate formation, and a C-terminal domain that trimerizes McdB dimers and provides increased valency for condensate formation. We then identify critical basic residues in the IDR, which we mutate to glutamines to solubilize condensates. Finally, we find that a condensate-defective mutant of McdB has altered association with carboxysomes and influences carboxysome enzyme content. The results have broad implications for understanding spatial organization of BMCs and the molecular grammar of protein condensates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain many millions of protein molecules that must be in the right place at the right time to carry out their roles.

Although bacteria lack extensive lipid–membrane systems, recent reports have shown that proteinaceous bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are a widespread strategy for compartmentalization in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutter et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, BMCs are nanoscale reaction centers where key enzymes are encapsulated within a selectively permeable protein shell. The best studied BMC is the carboxysome, found within cyanobacteria and other autotrophic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yeates et al., 2008</xref>). Carboxysomes encapsulate the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) with its substrate CO<sub>2</sub> to significantly increase the efficiency of carbon fixation. Carboxysomes serve as a paradigm for understanding BMC homeostasis, including assembly, maintenance, permeability, and spatial regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kerfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yeates et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, to engineer efficient carbon-fixing organisms, efforts to express functional carboxysomes in heterologous hosts are ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flamholz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An important aspect of BMC homeostasis is spatial regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Savage et al., 2010</xref>). We recently identified the two-protein system responsible for spatially regulating carboxysomes, which we named the maintenance of carboxysome distribution (McdAB) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacCready et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacCready et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCready et al., 2021</xref>). McdA and McdB function to prevent carboxysome aggregation, thereby ensuring optimal function and equal inheritance upon cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacCready et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCready et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, McdA is an ATPase that forms dynamic gradients on the nucleoid in response to an adaptor protein, McdB, which associates with carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacCready et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCready et al., 2021</xref>). The interplay between McdA gradients on the nucleoid and McdB-bound carboxysomes result in the equal spacing of carboxysomes down the cell length of rod-shaped bacteria. This mode of spatial regulation by McdA is typical for the widespread and well-studied ParA/MinD family of positioning ATPases, of which McdA is a member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hakim et al., 2021</xref>). ParA/MinD ATPases spatially organize an array of genetic- and protein-based cargos in the cell, including plasmids, chromosomes, the divisome, flagella, and other mesoscale complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lutkenhaus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>). While ParA/MinD ATPases are highly similar in sequence and structure, the partner proteins that act as adaptors and link the ATPases to their respective cargo are highly diverse, largely due to partners providing cargo specificity. Indeed, McdB represents an entirely new class of adaptor proteins, and it is therefore unknown how McdB interacts with itself, McdA, and carboxysomes to confer specificity, or how these interactions are regulated. Bioinformatic analyses show that McdAB systems also exist for several other BMC types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCready et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, an understanding of the biochemical properties of McdB, and how these properties influence its behavior in vivo, are important next steps to advancing our knowledge on the spatial regulation of carboxysomes and BMCs in general.</p><p>From our initial studies in the model cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 (<italic>Se7942</italic>), we found that McdB self-associates in vitro to form both a stable hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacCready et al., 2021</xref>) and liquid-like condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacCready et al., 2020</xref>). However, the domain architecture of McdB and the regions required for its oligomerization and condensate formation are unknown. Our understanding of how proteins form biomolecular condensates has rapidly developed over the past decade. Briefly, biomolecular condensates are the result of molecules having demixed out of solution to form a dense, solvent-poor phase that exists in equilibrium with the soluble phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mittag and Pappu, 2022</xref>). This process occurs under a specific set of conditions where protein–protein interactions are more favorable than protein–solvent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). A biochemical understanding of how proteins form condensates in vitro has led to a deeper understanding of how this process facilitates subcellular organization in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dignon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azaldegui et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, characterizing the underlying chemistries for diverse biomolecular condensates has led to the development of these condensates as synthetic tools to engineer cytoplasmic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peeples and Rosen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lasker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Viny and Levine, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a major focus of this report is to characterize the biochemistry of McdB, including its condensate formation, and link these properties to the spatial regulation of carboxysomes in vivo.</p><p>Here, we define a domain architecture of <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB, identify the domains contributing to oligomerization and condensate formation, and discover a potential interplay between these two modes of self-association. We then create a series of point mutations that allow us to fine-tune the solubility of McdB condensates both in vitro and in vivo without affecting McdB structure or oligomerization. Finally, we use this mutation set to identify in vivo phenotypes that relate specifically to the ability of McdB to form condensates and associate with carboxysomes. The findings have implications for the use of carboxysomes in synthetic biology approaches, designing biomolecular condensates, and general BMC biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural predictions generate a low-confidence α-helical model for <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB</title><p>We first set out to determine the <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB crystal structure. However, McdB displayed robust phase separation across a range of buffer conditions, making crystal trials thus far unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next turned to I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) to generate structural models, which predicted the McdB secondary structure to be predominantly α-helical but with a disordered N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). I-TASSER also generates full-length atomic models of the target sequence that are consistent with its secondary structure predictions via multiple sequence alignments using top matches from the protein databank (PDB). The top 3 models were once again almost entirely α-helical, with the top model also showing a disordered N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). But ultimately, the top 10 PDB matches identified by I-TASSER aligned poorly with McdB, with each alignment showing low sequence identity (&lt;20% on average) and low-quality scores (<italic>Z</italic>-scores &lt;1 on average) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As a result, the top 3 final models generated by I-TASSER all have poor confidence scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These findings are not surprising in context with our previous bioinformatic analyses showing that cyanobacterial McdBs are highly dissimilar to other characterized proteins at the sequence level, potentially related to the high disorder content of McdBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacCready et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Echave et al., 2016</xref>).

B and C were most stable, representing an ~11 kDa fragment that remained undigested for 12 hr. This strong protection against trypsin is consistent with our CD data, which showed high resilience to heat denaturation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>We next subjected bands A, B, and C to N-terminal sequencing to determine the location of these stably folded regions in McdB.

Therefore, the first 18 amino acids at the N-terminus were digested within the first minute to produce band A, and further digestion progressed slowly from the C-terminus to produce bands B and C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>).

The mNG-McdB[−3] strain, on the other hand, displayed carboxysome aggregates. However, it is important to note that McdA is a ParA/MinD family ATPase, which typically interact with their adaptor proteins via basic resides in the N-terminus of the adaptor protein, analogous to McdB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radnedge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ravin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barillà et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ah-Seng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghasriani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schumacher et al., 2021</xref>).

Indeed, when quantifying the intensity ratio of carboxysome-associated McdB to that of the whole cell, McdB[−3] showed a significant deviation in the ratio that was independent of McdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

But with McdB[−3], RbcS-mTQ intensity decreased, even with McdA deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Together, these data show that McdB[−3] increases the carboxysome-bound to soluble McdB ratio and decreases Rubisco content in carboxysomes. These phenotypes are not explained by the loss of interaction with McdA, and are therefore potentially linked to defects in McdB condensate formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we generate an initial structural model of <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB based on several empirical and predictive approaches. We define a tripartite domain architecture with an N-terminal IDR, a stable CC domain, and a CTD consisting of several α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We show that the CC dimerizes McdB and the CTD trimerizes the dimer, resulting in a trimer-of-dimers hexamer. The IDR had no impact on oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Next, we found that McdB forms condensates via pH-dependent PSCP, where condensates show time-dependent viscoelastic properties and McdB forms pH-dependent clusters at concentrations far below the observed <italic>c</italic><sub>sat</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using truncations, we found that the CC domain drives condensate formation, the IDR modulates solubility, and the CTD provides further valency. Therefore, all three domains are required for achieving wild-type levels of condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We then identified positive residues in McdB important for stabilizing condensates. By performing scanning mutagenesis in both the IDR and CTD, we show that while mutations to the CTD destabilize the McdB hexamer, substituting out basic residues in the IDR solubilized condensates without affecting McdB structure or oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings allowed us to design a series of mutants where the net charge of the IDR tuned McdB condensate solubility both in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Lastly, we found that a solubilized McdB mutant, McdB[−3], impacts the carboxysome-bound to soluble McdB ratio in the cell, as well as Rubisco content in carboxysomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Overall, we determined McdB domain architecture, its oligomerization domains, regions required for condensate formation, and how to fine-tune condensate solubility, allowing us to link McdB condensate formation to potential functions in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB domain structure and self-association.</title><p>The central coiled-coil (CC) domain is necessary and sufficient for dimerization and driving condensate formation.

Substituting basic residues (K/R) in the IDR to glutamines (Q) can tune condensate solubility in vitro without affecting McdB oligomerization.

For many proteins, IDRs have been shown to be necessary and sufficient for driving condensate formation to a degree that is comparable to the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muiznieks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shapiro et al., 2021</xref>). The IDR of McdB, on the other hand, did not form condensates even at high protein concentrations and in the presence of a crowder. Furthermore, while deleting the IDR did not prevent McdB condensate formation, substituting only six basic residues in the IDR with glutamines solubilized condensates both in vitro and in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In line with our findings, recent models have described how charged residues within IDRs can serve as key modulators of protein phase separation via mediating interactions with the solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fossat et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fossat et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Glutamine-rich regions are known to be involved in stable protein-protein interactions such as in CCs and amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiumara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Michelitsch and Weissman, 2000</xref>), and expansion of glutamine-rich regions in some condensate-forming proteins leads to amylogenesis and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kokona et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, one potential caveat here is that introduction of glutamines may lead to amylogenesis for McdB. However, when we introduced glutamines into the IDR of McdB, solubility was increased both in vitro and in vivo without any impact on hexamerization. These findings are especially striking for a condensate-forming protein as glutamines are generally thought to stabilize and coarsen protein condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>). On the contrary, we see that increased glutamine content can solubilize condensates and is therefore largely context dependent. These findings expand our understanding of the molecular grammar of biomolecular condensates.</p><p>Oligomerization has also been found to influence protein condensate formation. For example, some proteins require oligomerization to provide the multivalency needed to form condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marzahn et al., 2016</xref>), where some IDRs only induce condensate formation when fused to an oligomerizing domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bracha et al., 2018</xref>). In some cases, oligomerization domains, like CCs, drive condensate formation and are modulated by other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramirez et al., 2023</xref>), similar to our findings here with McdB. Such is the case for the bacterial protein PopZ, where an oligomerization domain forms condensates with solubility modulated by an IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peeples and Rosen, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Truncated proteins have been useful in the study of biomolecular condensates. But it is important to note that using truncation data alone to dissect modes of condensate formation can lead to erroneous models since entire regions of the protein are missing. However, data from our truncation and substitution mutants were entirely congruent. For example, deletion of the CTD or substitutions to this region caused destabilization of the hexamer to a dimer, and deletion of the IDR or substitutions to this region caused solubilization of condensates without affecting hexamer formation. Furthermore, it should be noted that the McdB constructs used in our in vitro assays were free from fluorescent proteins, organic dyes, or other modifications that may influence phase separation. Therefore, the observed material properties of these condensates have full dependence on the McdB sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>McdB homologs have polyampholytic properties between their N- and C-termini</title><p>In our previous bioinformatic study, we found that McdB homologs possess features that enable condensate formation, including intrinsic disorder, low hydrophobicity, biased amino acid compositions, and multivalency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacCready et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, we also found that McdB proteins were potentially polyampholytes, with biphasic charge distributions between the NTD and CTD flanking the CC domain. For <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB, the N-terminal IDR has a pI of 10.8 and the CTD has a pI of 6.8, suggesting a potential electrostatic interaction between the two termini. The reason for such a shared feature was not obvious, but we proposed this polyampholytic nature was important for McdB self-association. A structure of the CC domain of a plasmid-encoded McdB-like protein from the cyanobacterium <italic>Cyanothece</italic> sp. PCC 7424 displayed an antiparallel association to form a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schumacher et al., 2019</xref>). Antiparallel dimerization of the CC domains of <italic>Se7942</italic> McdB would align these oppositely charged extensions. Consistently, our truncation data provide evidence suggesting a condensate-stabilizing interaction between the N-terminal IDR and the CTD. Condensates from the IDR + CC construct, which lack the CTD, were highly dynamic. But with the CTD present, condensates fused slowly. We were unable to dissect how the CTD contributes to condensate formation as substitutions to the CTD caused hexamer destabilization. However, these results have set the stage for several future studies that will (1) probe the orientation of McdB subunits within the hexamer, (2) determine how basic residues in the IDR influence McdB condensate formation at a molecular level, and (3) identify residues in the CTD that may influence condensate formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Considerations for McdB condensate formation in vivo</title><p>Investigating biomolecular condensates is particularly challenging in bacteria, largely because of resolution limits that require a combination of techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azaldegui et al., 2021</xref>). These methods will certainly advance our understanding of McdB function in vivo. To this end, we began with biochemical approaches to identify mutation sets that affect condensate solubility in vitro and investigated the effects of these mutations in vivo. By mutating positively charged residues in the IDR of McdB to glutamines, we were able to solubilize condensates and shift McdB molecules into the dilute phase both in vitro and in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Surprisingly, this same mutation set seemed to have an opposite effect in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> cells, where the dilute phase was diminished and carboxysome-associated McdB foci became brighter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The findings strongly suggest that McdB condensate formation is not required for foci formation in vivo when colocalizing with carboxysomes. Instead, our data suggest that phase separation may negatively regulate carboxysome binding. In vitro, condensate formation represents a major form of McdB self-association, sequestering away a large portion of McdB molecules into self-enriched condensates where they have a lessened interaction with the surrounding solvent. In vivo, these self-associations may similarly serve to regulate the amount of McdB free to interact with their carboxysome binding sites. For instance, if the positively charged N-terminal IDR of McdB interacts with the negatively charged CTD, and the CTD is also required for carboxysome binding, this association may interfere with carboxysome binding. Thus, by greatly reducing the tendency of McdB to self-associate, we may be increasing the amount of McdB free to interact with its carboxysome binding sites. We find such a model attractive as it provide a means for McdB to be pH regulated; an important factor in carboxysome biology as described below. To test this model, going forward, we will need to determine the region and residues of McdB required for carboxysome association and determine how this association relates to McdB condensate formation and its polyampholytic properties.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>pH as a potential regulator for McdB condensate solubility and its association with carboxysomes</title><p>In carbon-fixing organisms, the collection of processes that contribute to efficient carbon fixation are referred to as the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM). The development of a model for the cyanobacterial CCM has provided insight into how different features, such the presence of carboxysomes, affect overall carbon capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mangan and Brenner, 2014</xref>). It was shown that incorporation of a pH flux into CCM models provides values more consistent with experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>). This updated ‘pH-aware’ model suggests that the carboxysome lumen maintains a lower pH than the cytoplasm via Rubisco proton production; with the cytoplasm being ~pH 8.5 and the carboxysome lumen being ~pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mangan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show pH as a major regulator of McdB condensate solubility in vitro. Furthermore, we report a potential link between McdB condensate solubility and regulating both the carboxysome-bound fractions of McdB as well as Rubisco content within carboxysomes. We speculate that intracellular differences in pH may influence McdB self-association and thus regulate carboxysome binding as described in our model in the previous section.</p><p>Future studies will determine the nature of McdB association with carboxysomes, and how condensate formation influences this association. For example, we have shown that McdB strongly associates with carboxysome shell proteins via bacterial two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacCready et al., 2018</xref>). It is attractive to speculate that McdB undergoes pre-wetting interactions with the 2D surface of the carboxysome shell, which then nucleates surface-assisted condensation. Such 2D interactions would significantly impact McdB phase boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ditlev, 2021</xref>). It is also possible that McdB phase separation directly modulates carboxysome fluidity and Rubisco content. Carboxysomes were traditionally thought of as paracrystalline, but recent data in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> show that carboxysome biogenesis begins with Rubisco forming a condensate with its linker protein CcmM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, our bacterial two-hybrid assays have shown that, in addition to shell proteins, McdB also interacts strongly with CcmM. It is therefore possible that McdB and its phase separation activity influences carboxysome composition, fluidity, and function through interactions with the Rubisco-CcmM condensate. Such a model helps explain defects in Rubisco loading in our condensation-deficient McdB stain. Teasing apart the stable protein–protein interactions between McdB and carboxysomes from the dynamic processes governing condensate solubility will therefore be of significant importance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Partner proteins of ParA/MinD ATPases form condensates with functional implications</title><p>McdA is a member of the ParA/MinD family of ATPases that position a wide array of cellular cargos, including plasmids, chromosomes, and the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lutkenhaus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Funnell, 2016</xref>). A partner protein acts as the adaptor, linking the positioning ATPase to its respective cargo. McdB is the adaptor protein that links McdA to the carboxysome. Here, we show that McdB forms condensates both in vitro and in vivo, and the solubility of these condensates influences the nature of McdB association with carboxysomes. Intriguingly, condensate formation by other adaptor proteins has been proposed to play important roles in mediating interactions with other cargos positioned by ParA/MinD ATPases. For example, ParA ATPases are responsible for the spatial regulation of chromosomes and plasmids that are bound by the adaptor protein ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lutkenhaus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vecchiarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Funnell, 2016</xref>). The exact nature of the interaction between ParB and DNA remains a vibrant area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Debaugny et al., 2018</xref>), but recent reports show that ParB–DNA complexes behave as dynamic, liquid-like condensates both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babl et al., 2022</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guilhas et al., 2020</xref>), implementing condensate formation as an underlying mechanism. Another example is the co-complex of adaptor proteins, PomX and PomY, for the ParA/MinD ATPase called PomZ. PomXYZ is responsible for spatially regulating division sites in some bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schumacher et al., 2017</xref>). A recent study has shown that PomY forms condensates that nucleate GTP-dependent FtsZ polymerization, suggesting a novel mechanism for positioning cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramm et al., 2022</xref>). It is intriguing to speculate why such disparate adaptor proteins could use condensate formation as an underlying mechanism in localizing to vastly different cargos. The ability to undergo changes in density at specific locations and times within the cell may confer an advantage to these highly dynamic spatial regulation systems.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Tunable protein condensates as useful tools for synthetic biology</title><p>A useful property of biomolecular condensates is the ability to regulate enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Flynn and Mittag, 2021</xref>). Specific chemistries within condensates can affect the degree to which certain metabolites and enzymes are soluble within the dense phase. Thus, condensates can serve as reaction centers that regulate the overall metabolism of a cell by transiently altering the activities of key reactions. For example, it has been shown that certain scaffolding proteins can form phase separated condensates with Rubisco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oltrogge et al., 2020</xref>).

Complete gene insertions and absence of the wild-type gene were verified via PCR, and cultures were removed from antibiotic selection prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Live cell fluorescence microscopy and analysis</title><p>100 µl of exponentially growing cells (OD750 ∼ 0.7) were harvested and spun down at 4000 rcf for 1 min and resuspended in 10 µl fresh BG-11. 2 µl of the resuspension were then spotted on 1.5% UltraPure agarose (Invitrogen) + BG-11 pad on a 35-mm glass-bottom dish (MatTek Life Sciences). All fluorescence and phase-contrast imaging were performed using a Nikon Ti2-E motorized inverted microscope controlled by NIS Elements software with a SOLA 365 LED light source, a ×100 objective lens (Oil CFI Plan Apochromat DM Lambda Series for Phase Contrast), and a Photometrics Prime 95B back-illuminated sCMOS camera or Hamamatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 LTS camera. mNG-McdB variants were imaged using a ‘YFP’ filter set (C-FL YFP, Hard Coat, High Signal-to-Noise, Zero Shift, excitation: 500/20 nm [490–510 nm], emission: 535/30 nm [520–550 nm], dichroic mirror: 515 nm). RbcS-mTQ-labeled carboxysomes were imaged using a ‘CFP’ filter set (C-FL CFP, Hard Coat, High Signal-to-Noise, Zero Shift, excitation: 436/20 nm [426–446 nm], emission: 480/40 nm [460–500 nm], dichroic mirror: 455 nm). Chlorophyll was imaged using a ‘TexasRed’ filter set (C-FL Texas Red, Hard Coat, 583 High Signal-to-Noise, Zero Shift, excitation: 560/40 nm [540–580 nm], emission: 630/75 nm 584 [593–668 nm], dichroic mirror: 585 nm).</p><p>Image analysis including cell segmentation, quantification of foci number, intensities, and spacing were performed using Fiji plugin MicrobeJ 5.13n (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacCready et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ducret et al., 2016</xref>). Cell perimeter detection and segmentation were done using the rod-shaped descriptor with default threshold settings. Carboxysome foci detection was performed using the point function with tolerance of 700 and the sharpen image filter selected. McdB foci detection was performed using the smoothed foci function with tolerance of 100, <italic>Z</italic>-score of 3, and the minimum image filter selected. PCCs were calculated using ImageJ plugin JaCoP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>), and reported values represent means and standard deviations from &gt;10,000 cells over 10 fields of view.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: W. Seth Childers (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that there are numerous issues that have come up in the evaluations provided by all three reviewers. Several key experiments and the integration of the three strands of investigation are missing and must be included for the revision to be deemed to be fully responsive to the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 raises numerous specific issues pertaining to the design of the experiments, interpretations, and the potential for alternative approaches, analyses, and inferences. Please pay close attention to each of these concerns.</p><p>2) Likewise, Reviewer 2 is concerned about the inadequacy of some of the measurements, and the need for revisiting some of the analyses and inferences.</p><p>Please provide detailed, point-by-point responses to all the comments and concerns raised by all three reviewers, with particular attention to the more guarded assessments of reviewers 1 and 2.</p><p>3) It appears that there are several strong statements that should be reconsidered and either modified or eliminated. Please do so in the revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be very helpful to go down a systematic investigation to set up various topologies for the dimers and hexamers and rule in or rule out the types of interactions that contribute to the oligomerization vs. networking transitions. It is likely that the sub-saturated solution is not restricted to dimers and hexamers. There likely are other oligomers, possibly even higher order ones present that contribute to the networking transition above a threshold concentration. The shape of the phase boundary obtained from concentration, [salt], and pH titrations is of significant import for understanding the driving forces for phase separation. The use of crowders, especially PEG, is going to lead to confounding interpretations, that are best avoided by judicious use of a range of deletion constructs, or better yet, systematic mutagenesis directed toward the full-length protein. At this juncture, there is considerable circumstantial evidence pointing to a contribution of electrostatic interactions between the N- and C-termini and how this occurs in cis vs. trans is what needs resolution.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1B: A potential reason for the discrepancy between i-TASSER prediction of a helical region in the n-terminal and your trypsin assay is that small fragments might be too small to be identified on a gel. Please make this point clear.</p><p>2. The cell images in Figure 6 suggest that mCh-McdB[-3] is not expressed in most cells.

It is difficult to interpret the graphical representation of the mutant in Figure 5B. Please add a label next to each graphic.</p><p>4. In the discussion, the authors write Lines 415-156: &quot;it is attractive to speculate that coating carboxysomes with a viscous, pH-sensitive McdB phase may influence the diffusivity of carboxysome shells to protons.&quot; If McdB coats carboxysomes, it would be useful to comment on 2D vs. 3D phase separation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) In the modeling (Figure 7), the authors proposed that the N-terminus of McdA functions as a MORF. This has the potential to open up an exciting avenue of study. However, the experimental support is underdeveloped. I would recommend either removing it from this study or developing it with more experimental support if the authors prefer to keep it in this study.</p><p>a. For example, the authors could leverage their purified McdB glutamine variants and δ-IDR variant for in vitro McdA-McdB binding assays.</p><p>b. A MORF requires a change from unstructured to structured, and this data may be harder to obtain. However, the authors would be in a stronger position to speculate it's a MORF with in vitro binding data (or reference it if published elsewhere).</p><p>c. If the N-IDR regulates both phase separation of McdB and interacts with McdA, it raises intriguing questions the authors suggest in their discussion. Does McdA enhance or diminish McdB's phase separation? How might this fit into the in vivo model of McdA-McdB function in the spatial control of carboxysomes (McdA regulates McdB phase separation versus just being a client that does not impact phase separation)?</p><p>(2) What is the measured or estimated copy number of McdB in cells?

A plot of foci intensity vs. total cell intensity would provide further evidence that the assemblies are concentration-dependent and account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in McdB levels.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dissecting the phase separation and oligomerization activities of the carboxysome positioning protein McdB&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by David Ron (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but we find that the discussion should be revised to better reflect the main findings and to be constrained by the findings. Reviewer three made specific proposals for revisions that were endorsed in the editorial consultation. Since, no additional data will be required, we expect the requested revisions to be undertaken efficiently and look forward to a revised version, fit for publication.</p><p>Overall, the study substantially improved the manuscript during this revision, addressing many of the reviewer's concerns. These major improvements include:</p><p>1) The authors provide a new study in Figure 8, examining how and McdB[-3] variant that does not phase separate or interact with McdA impacts carboxysome homeostasis. Given that this variant impacts both phase separation and McdA binding, the effect of McdB[-3] was examined in a McdA null background. From these experiments, they conclude that phase separation contributes to its association with carboxysomes and influences carboxysome enzyme content.</p><p>2) At Reviewer 1's suggestion, the authors implemented a dynamic light scattering study that suggested the presence of higher-ordered intermediated below csat in a pH-dependent manner. This new preliminary data allows the authors to discuss the role of networking and percolation. Additionally, the authors examined the time-dependent viscoelastic properties of McdB. This allowed the authors to discuss the phenomena more deeply than simply LLPS.</p><p>3) The authors more carefully studied csat and observed small condensates at 2 µM. This brings some confidence that concentrations may be low enough to drive phase separation in vivo, albeit higher than the authors' estimate of csat in cells.</p><p>4) The authors removed some of the weaker parts of the text: The q-rich assignment, the study of a SLIM. This critically leaves behind a more robust core of the paper for consideration.</p><p>Some issues pointed out by the reviewers are unresolved:</p><p>1) Orientation of the dimers,</p><p>2) Topology of the hexamer,</p><p>3) Reliance on PEG inducers for deletion constructs, but not full-length,</p><p>4) N- and C-termini interactions as cis or trans. While unanswered, the authors altered the scope to consider the consequences of variants in vivo.</p><p>Overall, I remain enthusiastic about this study. The study represented a substantial scope of work that would interest the carboxysome and bacterial cell biology communities. However, based on adding new experiments in Figure 8, I have some additional questions for the authors to consider.</p><p>1) One potential conclusion from Figure 8 is that the interaction with McdA and phase separation are not required for foci formation in vivo. This is discussed a bit in lines 357-359. However, the reader could benefit from being discussed more directly that foci formation does not require phase separation. The subcellular localization mechanism, at least for McdB[-3], seems to occur through carboxysome binding and is consistent with the authors past two-hybrid assays. So, in this case we cannot use foci formation in vivo as evidence of McdB phase separation. The new experiments in Figure 8 were overall impactful and raised several new questions:</p><p>a. In the discussion, the authors claim evidence of in vivo condensate formation. However, I think Figure 8 may provide some evidence to counter that model. If McdB formed a condensate, one prediction might be that the McdB[-3] variant that cannot phase separate might increase the dilute phase soluble fraction. In contrast to this prediction, the authors found that variants with reduced phase separation in vitro caused a substantial decrease in the dilute phase concentration in vivo (Figure 8). Can the authors explain their model for this unexpected finding and rationalize how it is consistent with phase separation in vivo? My only thought was that when the McdB phase separates, it cannot fully occupy all carboxysome binding sites. If you eliminate the phase separation of McdB, then McdB can occupy the carboxysome binding sites leading to increased foci intensity.</p><p>b. As an alternative model might, the region mutated in McdB[-3] regulate three distinct functions: phase separation, McdA binding, and negative regulation of carboxysome binding. Mutation could enhance carboxysome binding if this region also negatively regulates carboxysome binding. Perhaps this is connected to the &quot;polyampholytic properties between their N- and C-termini&quot; pointed out by the authors. To address this potential, can the authors discuss what is known about how McdB binds to carboxysomes? Can the authors provide or point out any evidence to rule out this model? If not, it may be worth discussing this as an alternative model.</p><p>c. I'd encourage the authors to be more cautious in interpreting condensate formation in vivo (Lines 407,431,478). It's a clear and robust possibility in Synechococcus elongatus but not rigorously tested yet. For ParB, I felt the combination of studies in Ptacin et al. PNAS 2014, Guilhas et al. Mol Cell 2020, and Babl et al. JBC 2022 provided good minimal support for in vivo condensate formation of ParB. This may require a larger scope of work: in vitro FRAP, single molecular tracking, hexanediol/lipoic acid experiments, etc. Is the subcellular localization mechanism different for McdB and McdB[+3]? Perhaps superresolution imaging could distinguish the McdB coating of the carboxysome versus a larger condensate bound to the carboxysome (experiments similar to Ptacin et al. PNAS 2014 superresolution imaging in Figure 4B) if McdB and McdB[+3] displayed protein assemblies adjacent to the carboxysome that might support in vivo phase separation of McdB. In contrast, if both assemblies appear to colocalize with the carboxysome surface uniformly, that might suggest McdB coats the carboxysome surface (potentially still as a 2D-constrained condensate). Given this enormous and challenging scope, perhaps a section on the challenges of annotating in vivo McdB condensates would be helpful to the reader. A description of approaches the authors would like to see to make a definitive assignment.</p><p>2) The impact on carboxysome loading was an interesting observation. Are there other potential reasons to explain why McdB-3 impacts carboxysome loading? Does phase separation facilitate the loading and packaging of the enzymes? Is it possible that McdB-3 impacts the protein expression levels of RbcS-mTQ, which is the root cause of reduced RbcS-mTQ foci intensity in carboxysomes? Can the authors provide a total cell intensity analysis of RbcS-mTQ for the studied strains to address this possibility?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81362.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer 1 raises numerous specific issues pertaining to the design of the experiments, interpretations, and the potential for alternative approaches, analyses, and inferences.

We have tried several antibodies against McdB, and a few were good enough to detect the presence of McdB, but not quantifiably. We therefore believe in vivo McdB levels are low (sub-μM), and definitely lower than the range we previously used in our in vitro studies. We now include a titration of McdB at lower concentrations than we had in the previous version of our report (Figure 3). We see that McdB can form condensates in vitro at concentrations lower than 2 µM, and in the presence or absence of different crowding agents (Figure S4) and across a range of buffering conditions (Figures 5, S5). Certainly, its interactions with other proteins in vivo will affect its phase behavior, but the robust formation of condensates in vitro shows McdB can form them under many physiologically relevant conditions. Lastly, a major focus of the current report was to identify mutations in vitro that specifically affected condensate formation and not structure or oligomerization, then observe these in vivo, which we have included (Figure 8). The identification of phenotypes specifically linked to McdB condensate solubility suggests that McdB may utilize phase separation in vivo, regardless of the concentrations we used to identify mutation sets in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To compare circular dichroism spectra of different McdB constructs or estimate secondary structure content, it's best to normalize the raw millidegrees data to mean residue molar ellipticity (Figure 1A, 2B, S5).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have normalized the spectra in Figures 2 and S3 where we are comparing constructs of significantly different size and weight. The comparisons yield the same conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 6, to bolster the conclusions of the SDS-PAGE gel showing increased expression at longer times, the authors should consider analyzing their existing microscopy data (Figure 6A) on the single cell level. A plot of foci intensity vs. total cell intensity would provide further evidence that the assemblies are concentration-dependent and account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity in McdB levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the microscopy combined with the quantification of the proportion of cells with foci (Figure 7AB) and the SDS-PAGE quantification (Figure 7CD) is good evidence towards our conclusions. The error bars in these quantifications (Figure B and D) also account for the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in these analyses. The issue with a plot of foci intensity versus total cell intensity is that the majority of cells, particularly at low McdB concentration early on in the induction, have no foci at all. Therefore this type of analysis skews the data towards the fraction of the cell population containing foci. In addition, because McdB has a significant cytoplasmic fraction even when forming a focus, it if very difficult for MicrobeJ and other imaging analysis programs to differentiate between focus and cytoplasm; thus further introducing error in accurately distinguishing the two populations. The quantifications we currently provide are unbiased and population based. However, we agree this is a useful quantification when foci are always present and significantly brighter than the cytoplasmic fraction. We use the suggested analysis in Figure 8 where we look at McdB foci formation in <italic>S. elongatus</italic> cells. Thank you for the excellent suggestion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) One potential conclusion from Figure 8 is that the interaction with McdA and phase separation are not required for foci formation in vivo.

We agree that the in vivo results are complex and should certainly be discussed further. As suggested, it is possible that when McdB self-associates via phase separation, it is less available to occupy carboxysome binding sites. This is especially true if McdB is the limiting factor compared to carboxysome sites, which we assume to be true. We have added a new Discussion section titled “Considerations for McdB condensate formation in vivo” where this is discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.

If not, it may be worth discussing this as an alternative model.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. This is related to the model we describe in the point above. We speculate that the C-terminus of McdB is involved in self-association with the N-terminus via polyampholytic properties and also contains regions that may be responsible for interactions with carboxysomes. In this way, McdB self-association may compete against carboxysome binding and therefore negatively regulate it. We discuss this in the new Discussion section titled “Considerations for McdB condensate formation in vivo”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. I'd encourage the authors to be more cautious in interpreting condensate formation in vivo (Lines 407,431,478). It's a clear and robust possibility in Synechococcus elongatus but not rigorously tested yet. For ParB, I felt the combination of studies in Ptacin et al. PNAS 2014, Guilhas et al. Mol Cell 2020, and Babl et al. JBC 2022 provided good minimal support for in vivo condensate formation of ParB. This may require a larger scope of work: in vitro FRAP, single molecular tracking, hexanediol/lipoic acid experiments, etc. Is the subcellular localization mechanism different for McdB and McdB[+3]? Perhaps superresolution imaging could distinguish the McdB coating of the carboxysome versus a larger condensate bound to the carboxysome (experiments similar to Ptacin et al. PNAS 2014 superresolution imaging in Figure 4B) if McdB and McdB[+3] displayed protein assemblies adjacent to the carboxysome that might support in vivo phase separation of McdB. In contrast, if both assemblies appear to colocalize with the carboxysome surface uniformly, that might suggest McdB coats the carboxysome surface (potentially still as a 2D-constrained condensate). Given this enormous and challenging scope, perhaps a section on the challenges of annotating in vivo McdB condensates would be helpful to the reader. A description of approaches the authors would like to see to make a definitive assignment.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. It is certainly true that more studies are required to give a robust model on how McdB condensate formation is playing a role in vivo, and super-resolution techniques would of course be useful. We now mention this in the Discussion section “Considerations for McdB condensate formation in vivo” and also mention that while our biochemical approach was useful, it is only an initial step in developing the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The impact on carboxysome loading was an interesting observation. Are there other potential reasons to explain why McdB-3 impacts carboxysome loading? Does phase separation facilitate the loading and packaging of the enzymes? Is it possible that McdB-3 impacts the protein expression levels of RbcS-mTQ, which is the root cause of reduced RbcS-mTQ foci intensity in carboxysomes? Can the authors provide a total cell intensity analysis of RbcS-mTQ for the studied strains to address this possibility?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. One thing we failed to mention is that McdB not only interacts with carboxysome shells, but can also interact with a carboxysome core component, notably, CcmM. CcmM is the scaffolding protein that phase separates with Rubisco, and is thought to facilitate Rubisco loading into carboxysomes. Thus, it is possible that McdB phase separation affects Rubisco loading through interactions with CcmM. Starting on Line 495, We have added mention to this in the Discussion section “pH as a potential underlying regulator for McdB condensate solubility and its association with carboxysomes”:</p><p>“Future studies will determine the nature of McdB association with carboxysomes, and how condensate formation influences this association. For example, we have shown that McdB strongly associates with carboxysome shell proteins via bacterial two-hybrid assays (7). It is attractive to speculate that McdB undergoes pre-wetting interactions with the 2D surface of the carboxysome shell, which then nucleates surface-assisted condensation. Such 2D interactions would significantly impact McdB phase boundaries (66). It is also possible that McdB phase separation directly modulates carboxysome fluidity and Rubisco content. Carboxysomes were traditionally thought of as paracrystalline, but recent data in S. elongatus shows that carboxysome biogenesis begins with Rubisco forming a condensate with its linker protein CcmM (67). Intriguingly, our bacterial-two hybrid assays have shown that, in addition to shell proteins, McdB also interacts strongly with CcmM. It is therefore possible that McdB and its phase separation activity influences carboxysome composition, fluidity, and function through interactions with the Rubisco-CcmM condensate. Such a model helps explain defects in Rubisco loading in our condensation-deficient McdB stain. Teasing apart the stable protein-protein interactions between McdB and carboxysomes from the dynamic processes governing condensate solubility will therefore be of significant importance.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
