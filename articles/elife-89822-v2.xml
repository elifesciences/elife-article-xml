Our data reveal that the transforming growth factor-β superfamily member Activin A became very abundant during mouse and human bone fracture healing but was minimally detectable in intact bones. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that the Activin A-encoding gene <italic>Inhba</italic> was highly expressed in a unique, highly proliferative progenitor cell (PPC) population with a myofibroblast character that quickly emerged after fracture and represented the center of a developmental trajectory bifurcation producing cartilage and bone cells within callus. Systemic administration of neutralizing Activin A antibody inhibited bone healing. In contrast, a single recombinant Activin A implantation at fracture site in young and aged mice boosted: PPC numbers; phosphorylated SMAD2 signaling levels; and bone repair and mechanical properties in endochondral and intramembranous healing models. Activin A directly stimulated myofibroblastic differentiation, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in periosteal mesenchymal progenitor culture. Our data identify a distinct population of Activin A-expressing PPCs central to fracture healing and establish Activin A as a potential new therapeutic tool.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fracture healing</kwd><kwd>Activin A</kwd><kwd>proliferative progenitor</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR071946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pacifici</surname><given-names>Maurizio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AR074570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG069401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99AR078352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rux</surname><given-names>Danielle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activation of Activin A-expressing progenitor cells emerges as a pivotal mechanism in bone fracture healing, shedding light on a potential therapeutic avenue to augment bone repair processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bone is endowed with the ability to heal after fracture and does so effectively in the majority of, but not all, patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loi et al., 2016</xref>). Given its traumatic nature, a bone fracture triggers local hematoma formation followed by an inflammatory cascade that involves innate and adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Claes et al., 2012</xref>). These initial steps elicit the expansion and migration of the otherwise quiescent mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells within the periosteum that over time undergo differentiation into chondrocytes within the body of callus and osteoblasts at its peripheral ends. Subsequent remodeling of callus routinely leads to nearly scar-less bone healing. Thus, fracture healing replicates, and relies on, many of the processes of endochondral and intramembranous ossification through which the skeleton normally develops and grows prenatally and postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lefebvre and Bhattaram, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have aimed to clarify the character of the periosteal progenitors and their roles in the fracture repair process. Building on their earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matthews et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matthews et al., 2016</xref>), Matthews et al. characterized a αSMA-expressing slow-cycling, long-term, and self-renewing periosteal progenitor cell population that when ablated, impaired healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matthews et al., 2021</xref>). Another report provided evidence of a periosteum-resident Mx1+αSMA+ stem cell subpopulation that expressed chemokine CCL receptors needed for effective bone healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ortinau et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these and other advances, much remains unclear about the regulation of fracture repair and in particular: what factors set the repair process in motion and in what sequence they act; what distinguishable stages exist along the repair process and how cells move from one stage to the next; how the progenitors commit to separate differentiation lineages; and importantly for patient care, to what extent the progenitor cell’s repair capacity can be modified, corrected, or improved. Unbiased single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches have recently been used to characterize mesenchymal cells in marrow, delineating their regulation, functioning, and heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). The same approaches applied to the periosteum could elicit similar fundamental insights into the regulation and roles of progenitor cells in bone repair mechanisms. These discoveries would also hold high clinical significance and importance as such knowledge could be leveraged to mitigate healing deficiencies seen in about 5–10% of patients, leading to problematic and costly non-unions that are not fully addressed by current therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tzioupis and Giannoudis, 2007</xref>). These discoveries could also be combined from insights stemming from related fields of biomedical research to conceive novel and more potent therapeutic strategies.</p><p>One such field of related biomedical research is heterotopic ossification (HO). This pathological process consists of formation and local accumulation of extraskeletal bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pape et al., 2004</xref>). Its onset and progression are very similar to those occurring during bone fracture repair and involve local inflammation, recruitment of progenitor cells, chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, and deposition of bone. Recent studies from our laboratories and others have revealed that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily member Activin A has a previously unsuspected role in promoting HO in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundy et al., 2021</xref>). This protein is best known for its roles in inflammation where it is produced by activated macrophages and regulates cytokine production and profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Kretser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morianos et al., 2019</xref>). The protein has also been found to have pro-chondrogenic activity on human and mouse progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Djouad et al., 2010</xref>). Given these and other studies, we tested here whether Activin A is a regulator of bone fracture repair as well and may operate as a stimulator of that physiologic process. We demonstrate that local Activin A amounts are markedly increased during fracture healing in mice and patients. A comprehensive scRNA-seq analysis of periosteal mesenchymal lineage cells reveals that the Activin A-encoding gene <italic>Inhba</italic> was expressed in a novel progenitor cell population greatly and rapidly expanding during fracture healing. Systemic immunological interference with endogenous Activin A delayed fracture repair, whereas exogenously provided and locally applied recombinant protein promoted it. These data provide strong support for the important notion that Activin A regulates fracture repair and could offer an effective and easy-to-implement therapeutic tool to enhance it.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amounts and distribution of Activin A increase during fracture repair</title><p>To evaluate the participation of Activin A in fracture repair, we first asked whether its presence and distribution were altered during healing, using a standard endochondral tibia fracture model with 2-month-old WT mice. Immunofluorescent staining of intact control tibiae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Intact) showed that Activin A was detectable in only a few cells within the cambium layer of periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa</xref>) and in some bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab</xref>). Marrow cells normally expressing the Activin A-encoding gene <italic>Inhba</italic> included mesenchymal progenitors and inflammatory cells such as granulocytes, based on our previous scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Five days after fracture, the number and distribution of Activin A-positive cells had dramatically increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Fracture), and positive cells now included numerous fibroblastic-shaped cells within periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ac</xref>) and round-shaped early chondrocytes within the developing soft callus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ad</xref>) co-staining with Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Immunostaining of surgically retrieval bone specimens from patients showed that Activin A was scanty in connective tissues of intact iliac periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Intact) but abundant at fracture site of long bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Fracture). Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR Further analysis of these patient specimens showed a nearly threefold increase in <italic>INHBA</italic> mRNA at the fracture site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Here, we selected Col2a1-Cre;Gt(Rosa)26 tdTomato (Col2/Td) reporter mice because as our previous study indicated, Td+ cells in these mice are major contributors to fracture callus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). To establish the effectiveness of this transgenic approach to capture the overall cell populations involved in fracture repair, tibiae from 2-month-old Col2/Td mice were harvested at 5, 10, 15, and 30 days after fracture and processed for spatiotemporal delineation of Td+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In intact tibiae, the cortical bone surface was covered by a thin layer of periosteum mainly consisting of Td+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Aa, Ba</xref>). At day 5 post fracture, Td+ cells had greatly expanded in number to form the thickened periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ab, Bb</xref>). By day 10 when cartilage reached its peak soft callus development as shown by Safranin O staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Bc</xref>), all chondrocytes as well as neighboring fibrotic cells were Td+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ac</xref>). By day 15 when most cartilage was undergoing endochondral ossification, Td+ cells now constituted the majority of osteoblasts and osteocytes in the callus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ad, Bd</xref>). In the remodeling bone present by day 30, the new periosteum at the edge of callus mostly consisted of Td+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ae, Be</xref>). Colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assays of periosteal cells isolated from intact bones revealed that Td+ cells, but not Td− cells, were able to form cell colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Together, the data affirm the fact that the Col2/Td approach captures the overall mesenchymal cell populations taking part in fracture healing.</p><p>Having established the effectiveness of the approach, we proceeded to isolate periosteal cells from intact tibiae (termed day 0 cells) and from injured tibiae at days 5 and 10 post fracture and then sorted them for Td+ cells. The percentage of Td+ cells among freshly isolated cells increased from 2.8% at day 0 to 3.4% at day 5 and 8.5% at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Using the 10× Genomics approach, we sequenced 7,496, 7,535, and 10,398 Td+ cells from days 0, 5, and 10 samples, respectively, with a median of 3,462 genes/cell and 13,463 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)/cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We merged the resulting three datasets comprising an overall total of 25,429 cells that resolved into 16 cell clusters, including 6 clusters of periosteal mesenchymal lineage cells, 4 clusters of hematopoietic cells, 1 cluster of muscle cells, 1 cluster of synovial lining cells, 1 cluster of tendon cells, 1 cluster of endothelial cells (ECs), 1 cluster of Schwann cells, and 1 cluster of smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Td expression was detected in all clusters but was highest in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). There was basal Td expression in non-mesenchymal cells, which was also observed in previous scRNA-seq studies of bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells from our group and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhong et al., 2023</xref>).

Day 10 samples did not have these two clusters because only callus was dissected out for scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Given the focus of our study on mesenchymal lineage cells in callus, we digitally removed those clusters as well as other non-mesenchymal cells. As a result, the recalculated data identified six distinct mesenchymal cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Based on lineage-specific traits, clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6 represented early osteoblasts (EOB), osteoblasts (OB), chondrocytes (CH), and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCH), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cells in cluster 1 were characterized by several typical stem cell markers such as <italic>Cd34</italic>, <italic>Ly6a</italic> (Sca1), and <italic>Thy1</italic> (Cd90), suggesting that they represented mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). Cells constituting the expansive cluster 2 expressed the above stem cell markers at a very low level and expressed lineage-specific gene markers such as those of OBs and CHs at a low level as well. When the merged datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) were separated by time point, it became clear that cluster 2 cells markedly increased in number early from days 0 to 5, whereas chondrocytes (cluster 5), hypertrophic chondrocytes (cluster 6), and osteoblasts (clusters 3 and 4) expanded by day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, computational cell cycle analysis revealed that cluster 2 contained highly proliferative cells, particularly at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Several proliferation marker genes, such as <italic>Ccnd3</italic>, <italic>Cdk4</italic>, <italic>Cdc20</italic>, <italic>Cdca3</italic>, <italic>Mcm4</italic>, and <italic>Cepna</italic>, were highly expressed in cluster 2 at the day 5 time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

To test this thesis, we subjected 2-month-old WT mice to the same closed tibia fracture injury as above that heals via endochondral ossification. The animals were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received biweekly subcutaneous injections of nActA.AB [immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b) isotype at 10 mg/kg per injection] as in our previous study. The second group served as control and received injections of pre-immune IgG2b isotype antibody obtained from the same manufacturer and given at identical dose, route, and frequency. Based on the spatiotemporal patterns of fracture healing in this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), tibias from each group were harvested at 5, 7, 10, and 14 days after surgery to capture and analyze the cartilage and bone formation phases and at 6 weeks to measure the ultimate effectiveness of bone healing by mechanical tests. Histochemical analysis clearly showed that nActA.AB administration significantly reduced overall callus size and cartilage and bone areas at all time points post fracture (5, 7, 10, and 14 days) compared to isotype antibody controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>).

Immediately after fracture, a 50-μl aliquot of Matrigel containing recombinant Activin A was microinjected at the operated site; controls received Matrigel alone. Mice were then harvested at 5, 14, and 28 days from fracture to monitor the healing process.

In this model, woven bone formation is usually observed by day 7 post-surgery, and bone bridging and re-corticalization occur by day 21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, drill-hole surgery was carried out on femoral mid-shaft of 2-month-old mice. For loss-of-function tests, mice were given biweekly subcutaneous injections of nActA.AB or isotype control as above. For gain-of-function tests, a 50-μl aliquot of Matrigel containing up to 1 μg of recombinant Activin A was microinjected inside the medullary canal at the drill site; Matrigel alone was microinjected in companion controls.

Based on scRNA-seq-based trajectory analysis, the PPCs lie at the center of a developmental path that bifurcates and elicits the emergence of chondrocytes and osteoblasts within the callus over time (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Activin A expression and function in these and other cells appear to be critical for effective bone healing given that repair in both our endochondral and intramembranous mouse models was significantly delayed by systemic administration of Activin A neutralizing antibody. This key notion is reinforced by our findings that the same healing processes were boosted by local supplementation of recombinant Activin A. Indeed, the exogenous protein robustly enhanced pSMAD2 signaling levels within the fracture callus and promoted the acquisition of a myofibroblast-like phenotype by the progenitor cells and their subsequent chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Overall, our data and insights are very much in line with a previous study in rats in which local implantation of recombinant Activin A stimulated fracture repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakai et al., 1999</xref>). They also agree quite well with siRNA studies showing that endogenous Activin A is required for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of human marrow mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Djouad et al., 2010</xref>). However, we should mention fracture studies employing soluble neutralizing type IIA or IIB receptors that elicited different outcomes, possibly due to the ability of soluble receptors to interfere with not only Activin A but other superfamily members also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pearsall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puolakkainen et al., 2017</xref>). In sum, our study provides clear evidence that Activin A is an overall regulator and stimulator of the fracture repair process. The protein appears to act by promoting myofibroblastic, chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and ultimately bone healing, with the PPC population placed at the center of a developmental cascade aiding the progression of the overall process. Our data also establish Activin A as a potential therapeutic tool to enhance fracture repair.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Working model of Activin A roles in callus during progression of fracture healing.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89822-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Markers of Pi16+ cells from a recent single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study of fibroblasts are specifically expressed in the mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPC) cluster.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89822-fig8-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>Periosteal mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells are well known to be essential for fracture repair, but the sequential steps needed to turn them into reparative cells and mechanisms underlying this multifaceted phenotypic progression have remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loi et al., 2016</xref>). The distinct PPC population identified here occupies an intermediate developmental step along the repair cascade and possesses a myofibroblast-like character after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinz, 2016</xref>). Prior to fracture injury, the periosteum contains few PPCs, but fracture triggers a concerted response in which MPCs are rapidly activated to become PPCs, differentiating into chondrocytes and osteoblasts with time. Based on cell prevalence, the PPCs appear to represent the bulk of cells within the thickening periosteum a few days after fracture. Notably also, the PPCs express not only <italic>Inhba</italic> but also <italic>Acta2</italic> that encodes αSMA, a well-established marker of periosteal mesenchymal progenitors engaged in fracture callus development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grcevic et al., 2012</xref>). Using <italic>Acta2-CreER</italic> mice, the Kalajzic group recently demonstrated that αSMA+ cells constitute about 4% of Cd45−Ter119−Cd31− cells in homeostatic mouse periosteum and that DTA-mediated ablation of the cells severely reduces callus size after fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matthews et al., 2021</xref>). In the tissue injury and regeneration field, αSMA is often used as a marker of myofibroblasts, a cell population first discovered in skin wound healing studies and then identified as a key player in many tissue repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pakshir et al., 2020</xref>). A recent scRNA-seq study isolated fibroblast cell populations from 13 injured and diseased mouse tissues including bone, and identified an Lrrc15+ cell cluster that displays a αSMA+ myofibroblastic cell character and emerges only after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, Lrrc15 is also a marker for PPCs in our study. In addition, abundant αSMA+ stromal cells were recently reported to occur around the injury site after metal implant surgery in mouse tibiae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vesprey et al., 2021</xref>). In sum, acute injury resulting from bone fracture, metal implantation, or other insults appears to elicit a common and forceful repair response that is coupled to the emergence of progenitors with a myofibroblast-like phenotype. Ongoing studies are directed toward deciphering more precisely what roles PPCs perform in bone repair and what mechanisms ensure the controlled regression of the cells and the apparent loss of myofibroblastic-like features at later stages of facture healing.</p><p>Extensive studies have been performed previously to identify periosteal mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells that generate the callus in response to bone fracture. Those studies generally made use of one or a combination of markers to define progenitors by flow cytometry or lineage tracing approaches. Using an unbiased, comprehensive scRNA-seq approach that covers the entire mesenchymal lineage cell populations in periosteum, our study computationally identifies MPCs as the most primitive form of progenitors that give rise to other mesenchymal populations in both intact and fractured bones. Our data indicate also that most of the previously identified progenitor cell markers including Cd200, Cd105 (Eng), and Cd51 (Itgav) are broadly expressed amongst periosteal mesenchymal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Debnath et al., 2018</xref>). These MPCs appear to be quite similar to those in a recent study indicating that sorted Sca1+ and Cd90+ periosteal cells have high CFU-F potential and multi-differentiation abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matthews et al., 2021</xref>). They also share a stem cell gene profile including <italic>Ly6a</italic>, <italic>Thy1</italic>, <italic>Cd34</italic>, and <italic>Clec3b</italic> that is similar to that of early mesenchymal progenitors previously identified in mouse bone marrow mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). The recent global scRNA-seq study analyzing fibroblasts, defined as Pdgfrα+ cells, from 16 mouse tissues cited above showed that fibroblasts in all tissues, regardless of their states (steady and perturbed), contain a most primitive cell cluster termed Pi16+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, markers of Pi16+ cells (<italic>Pi16</italic>, <italic>Dpp4</italic>, <italic>Ly6c1</italic>, and <italic>Dpt</italic>) are also MPC markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), and MPC markers such as Ly6a and Cd34 are also highly and specifically expressed in Pi16+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>). Together, the above data and insights highlight the shared characteristics of fibroblast-like stem cells at different anatomic sites. It will be interesting to create CreER lines to trace MPCs in vivo and validate their primitive position relative to differentiation trajectories and developmental fate.</p><p>It has long been appreciated that Activin A is produced by inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Kretser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morianos et al., 2019</xref>). These cell populations are present at the bone repair site and are found to be essential for effective fracture repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mountziaris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kolar et al., 2010</xref>). Inflammatory cells present at the fracture repair site include neutrophils and macrophages and release a spectrum of inflammatory and chemotactic mediators including members of the TNF and IL protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loi et al., 2016</xref>). These and other proteins are thought to lead to recruitment of fibroblasts, MSCs, and skeletogenic progenitors from local sources, propelling the next phase of skeletal tissue repair production and deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerstenfeld et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstenfeld et al., 2003</xref>), but details remain scant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Loi et al., 2016</xref>). The previously described roles of Activin A in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Kretser et al., 2012</xref>) suggest that the protein may promote the initial inflammatory response needed for setting the repair process. Our data here and in a previous report from our labs show that Activin A is produced by skeletogenic cells and promotes bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundy et al., 2021</xref>). The present study builds on those findings and reveals more critically that <italic>Inhba</italic> becomes prominently expressed by the myofibroblast-like PPCs within the callus and that Activin A promotes chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in periosteal cells. The protein is also a product of chondrocytes within the healing callus. Together, previous studies and our current data lead to the important notion that Activin A could represent a regulatory and functional nexus linking inflammation to local skeletogenic responses in diverse cell populations and in turn, boosting fracture repair progression.</p><p>Activin A’s capacity to play such diverse biological roles could endow the protein with ideal characteristics as a therapeutic for fracture repair deficiencies. A variety of means have been tested in both animal studies and patients to improve fracture healing, but an effective and safe therapy is yet to emerge and be clinically applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Einhorn and Gerstenfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts and Ke, 2018</xref>). Anabolic therapies utilize exogenous agents such as members of the BMP, FGF, Wnt, or hedgehog protein families and may not be as effective as desirable because of their targeting a given step or a given population mainly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts and Ke, 2018</xref>). Activin A may prove more effective because of its early presence from the very onset of the fracture repair process and its activity through sequential populations, including our newly described myofibroblast-like node toward terminal differentiation of cartilage and bone cells. These paradigms remain to be fully tested in the future, particularly using genetic approaches in which <italic>Inhba</italic> could be conditionally ablated at different stages and different populations to delineate its function in each. Similarly, our loss of function data using the Activin A neutralizing antibody could be influenced by systemic action away from the fracture site. These are limitations of the current study that will need to be tackled directly in future studies. Nonetheless, the spectrum of biological and physiologic action by Activin A and the appreciable promotion of fracture repair we demonstrate here provide a rational foundation and premise for the investigation of Activin A for clinical application.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Since we did not detect any gender difference in fracture healing using these mice, a mixture of male and female 2-month-old mice were used for periosteal cell isolation, scRNA-seq, and histological analyses. For mice receiving a fracture, closed transverse fractures were made on right tibiae via a blunt guillotine with a pre-inserted intramedullary pin for stabilization as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).

For systemic antibody treatment, mouse monoclonal neutralizing antibody against Activin A (nActA.AB, Biolegend, 693604) or pre-immune control IgG2b isotype (Biolegend, 400377) were subcutaneously injected twice per week (10 mg/kg) after fracture. This antibody was utilized in our previous study on HO in which we showed that it is specific for Activin A and does not interfere with Activin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mundy et al., 2021</xref>). For recombinant Activin A implantation treatment, the protein (R&amp;D Systems, 338-AC-010, 1 µg) was mixed with growth factor-reduced, phenol red-free Matrigel (Corning, 356231) per 50 μl total aliquot volume.

The remaining bone fragments were digested in 2 mg/ml collagenase A and 2.5 mg/ml trypsin. Cells from the first 3 min of digestion were discarded and cells from a subsequent 30 min of digestion were collected as periosteal cells. For samples harvested on day 10 after fracture, the tibiae were dissected free of surrounding tissues, and fracture calluses were cut off using a surgical blade and cut into small pieces. The fragments were digested in 2 mg/ml collagenase A and 2.5 mg/ml trypsin for 1 hr and collected as whole callus cells. For sorting, cells were resuspended into fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer containing 25 mM 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and sorted for Td<sup>+</sup> cells using Influx B or Aria B (BD Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>scRNA-seq of periosteal mesenchymal cells</title><p>We constructed three batches of single-cell libraries for sequencing using sorted periosteum Td<sup>+</sup> cells from day 0 before fracture (<italic>n</italic> = 5 mice, 3 males and 2 females), day 5 after fracture (<italic>n</italic> = 6 mice, 4 males and 2 females), and day 10 after fracture (<italic>n</italic> = 6 mice, 3 males and 3 females). Approximately 20,000 cells were loaded each time into Chromium controller (V3 chemistry version, 10X Genomics Inc), barcoded and purified as described by the manufacturer, and sequenced using a 2 × 150 pair-end configuration on an Illumina Novaseq platform at a sequencing depth of ~400 million reads.

Standard Seurat pipeline was used for filtering, variable gene selection, dimensionality reduction analysis, and clustering. Doublets or cells with poor quality (genes &gt;7000, genes &lt;1000, or &gt;10% genes mapping to mitochondrial genome) were excluded. Expression was natural log transformed and normalized for scaling the sequencing depth to a total of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> molecules per cell. Seurat cell cycle scoring function were used to analyze cell proliferation, proliferative cells were defined as cells in G2M or S phase. First identify the top 2000 variable genes by controlling for the relationship between average expression and dispersion. Then, expression matrix were scaled by regressing out cell cycle scores (G2M.Score and S.Score). Statistically significant principal components (PC) were selected as input for UMAP plots. For the integrated dataset, batch integration was performed using Harmony (version 1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). Different resolutions for clustering were used to demonstrate the robustness of clusters. In addition, differentially expressed genes within each cluster relative to the remaining clusters were identified using FindMarkers. Sub-clustering was performed by isolating the mesenchymal lineage clusters using known marker genes, followed by reanalysis as described above. Mesenchymal lineage cells, excluding tenocytes and synovial fibroblasts, were selected for sub-clustering and reanalysis. Gene ontology analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>To computationally delineate the developmental progression of periosteal mesenchymal cells and order them in pseudotime, we performed the trajectory analysis using Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Street et al., 2018</xref>).

A semi-automated contouring method was used to determine the callus perimeter and to analyze the callus outside the preexisting cortical bone. All images were first smoothed by a Gaussian filter (sigma = 1.2, support = 2.0) and then applied by a threshold corresponding to 30% of the maximum available range of image gray scale values to distinguish mineralized tissue from unmineralized and poorly mineralized tissue. Callus region surrounding cortical bone was contoured for trabecular bone analysis. Based on µCT images, 6 weeks fracture samples were assigned fracture healing scores according to an 8-point radiographic scoring system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An and Friedman, 1999</xref>). This is a sum of scores from three categories: periosteal reaction (0–3), bone union (0–3), and remodeling (0–2). Scoring was determined empirically by two independent experts who were blinded to treatment allocation. To analyze bone healing after drill-hole injury, the cortical defect area and the intramedullary area were contoured separately for trabecular bone analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mechanical testing</title><p>Tibiae at 6 weeks post fracture were harvested for mechanical testing using an Instron 5542 (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Tibiae were positioned so that the loading point was at the fracture site. A load speed of 1.8  mm/min was applied midway between two supports placed 10  mm apart.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Hiroshi Takayanagi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ugur Ayturk (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a generally well-executed set of study, the data from which are appropriate and largely supports the conclusions. The manuscript would be strengthened by convincingly demonstrating that the PPCs are the primary mediator of Activin A actions during fracture repair.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Questions and concerns:</p><p>1. Multiple pieces of data show Inhba/ACTIVIN A expression in a number of other cell types, but a majority of the language pins all of the responses to ACTIVIN A as coming from the PPCs and disregarding the other non-mesenchymal cell types. For example, in Sup. Figure 1 Inhba expression is quite high in the granulocyte clusters (13, 14, 15). While PPC produced ACTIVIN A is likely a strong participant, further knock-out data in the PPCs and other cell types of would be required to claim this. The final paragraph of the discussion includes this, but the language should be toned down throughout the results. If the language is to be kept, further cell specific KO data is required utilizing the Acta2 specific Cre KO of Inhba.</p><p>2. Please ensure the proper formatting for genes/proteins is correct throughout the manuscript (ie when referring to the protein ACTIVIN A should be all caps).</p><p>3. With the neutralizing antibody usage, how do you know it is specifically targeting the mesenchymal cells (page 13 top paragraph)? Only giving percentages of cells stained for pSMAD2 and aSMA does not explicitly demonstrate that these PPCs are the responsible party in decreasing fracture healing parameters. Co-staining as well as assessing potential decrease in pSMAD2 staining in other cell types may shed light on ACTIVIN A functions in other cell types.</p><p>4. What is the expression pattern of the ACTIVIN A receptor? This may allow for further conclusions. Additionally, in the in vitro MPC sorted rACTIVIN A experiments, markers of myofibroblast emerge after treatment and in the chondrogenic/osteogenic media there is further differentiation upon treatment. Are the authors suggesting there is a self-feedback mechanism on the PPCs from their own ACTIVIN A expression?</p><p>5. Are cells in the bone only responsive to ACTIVIN A signaling after injury, or could there be effects of the protein in an uninjured setting?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Lutian Yao et al. have found that TGF-b family member Activin A is expressed in proliferative progenitor cells (PPCs) which was identified in the tibia by single cell analysis. They also demonstrated that PPCs gain myofibroblasts feature after fracture. They found that Activin A can stimulates proliferation and differentiation of periosteal progenitors and promote chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during fracture healing process. The authors have combined the fracture model with single cell analysis to investigate the function of Activin A during the bone healing process. Overall, the discovery from this study has important implications for the bone healing process during fracture. However, several important questions remain to be clarified in this manuscript. Moreover, the mechanistic insight of this manuscript still needs to be enhanced.</p><p>1. In Figure 2D, the authors only showed the cell cycle stage for the populations they identified. The expression of cell proliferation marker also needs to be provided to further prove the proliferative feature of PPCs.</p><p>2. In Figure 2F and supplemental figure 6, the velocity analysis did not clearly show the trajectory of EOB. The authors should explain this.</p><p>3. In Figure 3F, the staining of Activin A is confusing. Which color represents Activin A?</p><p>4. The authors have shown that Activin A can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of periosteal progenitors in Figure 4. What is the mechanism behind this?</p><p>5. The authors have demonstrated that Activin A can accelerate the fracture healing process. What is possible role of TGFb signaling in this process?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below are some specific comments and questions for the authors:</p><p>– It is unclear from Figure 1A if mesenchymal progenitors in bone marrow express Activin A. Based on the single cell RNA-seq data, it is possible that the majority of labeled marrow cells are granulocytes. This can be checked with higher magnification imaging of slides co-stained with CD31 (as the progenitors will likely be pericytes) or better yet LEPR.</p><p>– &quot;Since almost all cells in the thickened periosteum at day 5 are Td+, this observation suggests that muscle-derived cells do not significantly contribute to the early stage of fracture healing&quot;. Not sure if your data supports this conclusion. Whatever portion of muscle cells participate in fracture healing, they may not express Col2-cre at baseline but start expressing it shortly after they are mobilized and differentiating, making it difficult to distinguish them from cells with periosteal or marrow origin in your system. Also, fibroadipogenic progenitors (if they are Td+) can be difficult to spot at the magnification the data are presented. Have you checked intact muscle tissue with FACS for Td+ cells?</p><p>– I am not sure if it is possible to call your cell collections exclusively &quot;periosteal&quot;, given the anatomically broad recombination profile. The Methods sections suggests that the intact bones were not crushed, and it seems that the cell clusters do not include LEPR+/CAR cells, which are both reassuring. However, such control is difficult (or perhaps not even possible) when dealing with developing fracture callus.</p><p>– &quot;Particularly relevant to the present study was the finding that compared to MPCs, PPCs highly expressed Inhba after fracture (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 7B). Note that chondrocytes also highly expressed Inhba, consistent with the immunostaining results shown in Figure 1. However, their number was much lower than PPCs in early callus (Supplementary Figure 4B), suggesting that PPCs are the main source of activin A in early fracture healing.&quot; The violin plot in Figure 3C alone does not support this statement. There appears to be a remarkable increase in Inhba expression in chondrocytes (which is consistent with Figure 1A-B), but less so in other cells. Further, SuppFig4B presents an estimate of cell counts, which might very well be biased by the efficiency of the flow cytometer and/or 10X platform, when comparing fibroblast-like cells and chondrocytes.</p><p>– &quot;Based on scRNA-seq data, we sorted Cd45-Cd31- Ter119-Cd34+ (Lin-/Cd34+) cells and Cd45-Cd31-Ter119-Cd34- (Lin-/Cd34-) cells to represent MPCs and PPCs, respectively.&quot; Cluster-specific quantification of Cd34 expression (either via violin or scatter plots) should be depicted to justify this approach.</p><p>– &quot;To test this possibility, we isolated tibial periosteal mesenchymal progenitors…&quot; Are you referring to Td+ cells from the intact bones of Col2-Cre mice?</p><p>– &quot;These data clearly suggest that activin A targets mesenchymal progenitors in early fracture and that suppressing activin A impairs fracture healing.&quot; Activin A inhibition clearly disrupts fracture healing, but most of these individual results can also be explained by changes in chondrocytes, rather than PPCs, at the cellular level. This could perhaps be addressed by analyzing other modes of injury, such as cortical drill holes, that heal mainly through intramembranous ossification.</p><p>– &quot;…is expressed highly in a previously unidentified PPC population emerging shortly after fracture…&quot; This claim requires further support, as the uniqueness of the PPC population is unclear. These cells likely have at least some overlap with those described by others, such as Matthews et al. (i.e. alphaSMA) or Shi et al. (i.e. Gli1), and Col2-Cre could simply be another marker/handle for the same transient myofibroblast population during fracture healing.</p><p>– &quot;…fibroblasts in all tissues, regardless of their states (steady and perturbed), are derived from a primitive cell cluster termed Pi16+ cells…&quot; Buechler et al., identified two transcriptionally distinct populations of fibroblasts, that can be distinguished by Pi16 or Col15a1 expression, among other markers. Although both populations are found in various types of tissues, it is unclear whether the other tissue-specific fibroblasts are derived from them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89822.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a generally well-executed set of study, the data from which are appropriate and largely supports the conclusions.

We also agree that our study does not provide direct evidence that PPCs are the primary mediator of Activin A actions during fracture repair.

We recently received <italic>Inhba</italic> floxed mice from Dr. Martin Matzuk at Baylor University <sup>(1)</sup> and are in the process of validating the line. Because it would take a long time to perform the needed conditional gene knockout studies, we have followed the Reviewer’s advice and have toned down our language throughout the manuscript. Specifically, we include chondrocytes as another source of Activin A in the fracture callus and we re-wrote the first paragraph of the Discussion. We hope those changes address this concern fully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please ensure the proper formatting for genes/proteins is correct throughout the manuscript (ie when referring to the protein ACTIVIN A should be all caps).</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for not making sure that genes/proteins are formatted correctly throughout the manuscript but we do so now. With regard to Activin A, however, we would respectfully ask to keep its format as is (i.e. Activin A). This is the way in which the protein is customarily identified, including in recent studies such as Latres et al., Nat Commun. 2017 Apr 28:15153 <sup>(2)</sup> and Ramachandran et al., EMBO J. 2021 Jul 15;40(14):e106317 <sup>(3)</sup>. This would allow us to fit the literature in a seamless manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Only giving percentages of cells stained for pSMAD2 and aSMA does not explicitly demonstrate that these PPCs are the responsible party in decreasing fracture healing parameters. Co-staining as well as assessing potential decrease in pSMAD2 staining in other cell types may shed light on ACTIVIN A functions in other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate, and are thankful for, this comment. Given that the antibody is administered systemically, it is of course not possible to know if it specifically targeted the mesenchymal cells. As per Reviewer’s suggestion, we have calculated the percentage of pSMAD2+ cells within αSMA+ and αSMA- cell populations and found that after antibody administration, the percentage of pSMAD2+ cells within PPCs decreases but the percentage of pSMAD2+ cells within non-PPCs remains the same, suggesting that PPCs are a major target of antibody treatment. Thus, we have revised the corresponding portion of the Results as follows:</p><p>“To gain insights into whether the systemic nActA.AB administration affected the PPCs, we performed qRT-PCR and immunostaining analyses on early fracture samples from wild type mice as above. At day 7 post fracture, nActA.AB administration reduced the number of cells positive for phosphorylated SMAD2 (pSMAD2) through which Activin A normally signals intracellularly <sup>(4)</sup>, suggesting the effectiveness of neutralizing antibody treatment (Figure 5E, F). Interestingly, the number of PPCs positive for αSMA and the percentage of pSMAD2+ cells within PPC population were significantly decreased, while the percentage of pSMAD2+ cells within non-PPCs remained the same. These data were further confirmed by reduced gene expression of <italic>Acta2</italic> and <italic>Inhba</italic> in fracture callus after nActA.AB administration (Figure 5G). Taken together, our results clearly suggest that the PPCs were the primary responsive cell type to Activin A in early fracture and that systemic interference of Activin A action by nActA.AB treatment impaired fracture healing.”</p><p>Furthermore, we similarly calculated the percentage of pSMAD2+ cells within αSMA+ and αSMA- cell populations in the callus after recombinant Activin A implantation and obtained the opposite results. Together, these complementary experiments strengthen our overall conclusions regarding the importance of Activin A in fracture repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What is the expression pattern of the ACTIVIN A receptor? This may allow for further conclusions. Additionally, in the in vitro MPC sorted rACTIVIN A experiments, markers of myofibroblast emerge after treatment and in the chondrogenic/osteogenic media there is further differentiation upon treatment. Are the authors suggesting there is a self-feedback mechanism on the PPCs from their own ACTIVIN A expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate these comments and queries. We now include the expression patterns of Activin A receptors in Figure 3 —figure supplement 8C and include the following sentences in the Results:</p><p>“Activin A binds to type II receptors (ActRIIA or ActRIIB) to recruit and phosphorylate type I receptors (ALK4 or ALK7) for initiating its intracelluar signaling <sup>(4)</sup>. UMAP plots suggested that genes encoding these receptors (<italic>Acvr2a, Acvr2b, Acvr1b</italic>, and <italic>Acvr1c</italic>, respectively) were expressed in all mesenchymal progenitor populations and <italic>Acvr2a</italic> expression was enriched in MPCs (Figure 3 —figure supplement 8C).”</p><p>These receptor expression patterns suggest that Activin A can act on most if not all mesenchymal subpopulations within the fracture callus, with a possible preference toward MPCs. Future experiments knocking out individual receptor in vitro and in vivo could further illustrate the exact cellular target(s) of Activin A during bone healing.</p><p>Regarding the interesting comment about a self-feedback mechanism, we do not have direct data sustaining or refuting such thesis. However, we describe in the first paragraph of Discussion a previous study on human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro showing that siRNA-mediated downregulation of endogenous <italic>INHBA</italic> expression resulted in inhibition of chondrogenesis and osteogenesis <sup>(5)</sup>. The study provided clear evidence that the endogenous protein is needed for skeletogenic cell differentiation and may operate in a self-feedback manner. We hope to have described these results and their implications more clearly now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Are cells in the bone only responsive to ACTIVIN A signaling after injury, or could there be effects of the protein in an uninjured setting?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We performed µCT on the contralateral uninjured bones and found that administration of neutralizing antibody did not appreciably alter trabecular and cortical bone structure within the duration of our study. The data suggest that Activin A may not be essential for normal bone homeostasis, at least short-term. These data are now included as Figure 5 —figure supplement 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study, Lutian Yao et al. have found that TGF-b family member Activin A is expressed in proliferative progenitor cells (PPCs) which was identified in the tibia by single cell analysis.

The authors have combined the fracture model with single cell analysis to investigate the function of Activin A during the bone healing process. Overall, the discovery from this study has important implications for the bone healing process during fracture. However, several important questions remain to be clarified in this manuscript. Moreover, the mechanistic insight of this manuscript still needs to be enhanced.</p><p>1. In Figure 2D, the authors only showed the cell cycle stage for the populations they identified. The expression of cell proliferation marker also needs to be provided to further prove the proliferative feature of PPCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and thank the Reviewer for raising this important issue. We now include violin plots of cell proliferation makers as Figure 2 —figure supplement 5 to address the Reviewer’s comment and strengthen our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2F and supplemental figure 6, the velocity analysis did not clearly show the trajectory of EOB. The authors should explain this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good point. Based on the data in Figure 2F and Figure 2 —figure supplement 7, it appears quite clear that the MPCs serve as very early progenitors and give rise to PPCs, in turn developing into OBs (osteoblasts) and CHs (chondrocytes) over further time. RNA velocity also predicted that EOBs (early osteoblasts) not only develop into OBs as one would expect but may also contribute to the PPC population. Because these developmental trajectories are of course based on computational analysis, we feel we cannot speculate more as to their mechanistic basis and implications. We hope this explanation is sufficient for the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 3F, the staining of Activin A is confusing. Which color represents Activin A?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Activin A stain is in white. In the previous submission, we had identified the images by writing “Activin A” in black outside. For clarity, we now identify the images by writing “Activin A” in white inside, thus in the same color as the stain itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors have shown that Activin A can stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of periosteal progenitors in Figure 4. What is the mechanism behind this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a pertinent question. For the purpose of the present study, we did not directly test the cellular, biochemical and molecular mechanisms that could mediate and regulate Activin A action on the differentiation of periosteal progenitors. Based on literature, the binding of Activin A to one of its high affinity type II receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) recruits and phosphorylates one of its low affinity type I receptors (ActRIs) -ALK4 and ALK7- with ALK4 being the predominant one. Once activated, ActRI phosphorylates Smad2 and 3 to form a heteromeric complex with Smad4, which transfers to the nucleus and interacts with cofactors to regulate the transcription of target genes <sup>(6)</sup>. This canonical signaling pathway mediates major biological actions of Activin A on cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, repair, and apoptosis <sup>(7,8)</sup>. Activated Smad complex also induces a negative feedback mechanism through the inhibitory Smad7 <sup>(9)</sup>. Depending on cell types and physiological conditions, Activin A can also regulate noncanonical MAP kinases (p38, ERK, and <italic>JNK</italic>) <sup>(10-14)</sup>. In addition, intrinsic antagonists for Activin A signaling have been identified, including Inhibin, follistatin (FST), FST-like 3 (FSTL3), Cripto, BAMBI etc. <sup>(15)</sup>. It is our plan to identify the downstream pathways mediating Activin A action on periosteal progenitors in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors have demonstrated that Activin A can accelerate the fracture healing process. What is possible role of TGFb signaling in this process?</p></disp-quote><p>As the Reviewer correctly points out, the TGFβ pathway has long been known to regulate and promote fracture healing <sup>(16,17)</sup>, with circulating levels of TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 as indicators of ongoing fracture repair <sup>(18)</sup>. It has also been found that excessive levels of TGFβ can impair progenitor cell function and inhibit bone fracture healing <sup>(19)</sup>. Thus, the TGFβ pathway has very important roles in bone healing but needs to be fine-tuned. It will be interesting to figure out in the future in what manner and to what extent TGFβ proteins and Activin A may interact to promote repair and whether they act on the exact same population(s) or stage(s) of the healing process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below are some specific comments and questions for the authors:</p><p>– It is unclear from Figure 1A if mesenchymal progenitors in bone marrow express Activin A.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we did not observe Td+ cells in the muscle from Col2/Td mice.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Fluorescent image of a <italic>Col2/Td</italic> tibia shows no Td signal in the neighboring muscle tissue.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89822-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I am not sure if it is possible to call your cell collections exclusively &quot;periosteal&quot;, given the anatomically broad recombination profile. The Methods sections suggests that the intact bones were not crushed, and it seems that the cell clusters do not include LEPR+/CAR cells, which are both reassuring. However, such control is difficult (or perhaps not even possible) when dealing with developing fracture callus.</p></disp-quote><p>We do very much agree that it is difficult to establish the exact nature and origin of the isolated cell populations. Because the dissected tibiae at day 0 and day 5 were sealed with agarose at each epiphyseal end prior to protease digestion and cell isolation, we are confident that marrow cells were not included in our samples. At the day 10 time points, we dissected out the callus mass microsurgically, avoiding the marrow area and surrounding tissues as much as possible. Note that the fracture was stabilized with intramedullary pins. Given the space the pin occupies, bone marrow area at the fracture region was much smaller than that in the intact bone. In addition, our previous study identified Adipoq-expressing marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs) in the bone marrow <sup>(21)</sup> but not at the periosteal surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). Interestingly, we detected very few Adipoq+ cells in our fracture scRNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3B</xref>), further confirming that cells we analyzed were largely if not exclusively periosteal, with few or no bone marrow cell contamination.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Adipoq+ cells are absent at mouse periosteum.</title><p>(A) Immunofluorescent image of an intact tibiae from <italic>Adipoq-Cre Td</italic> mice stained with Endomucin (Emcn, an endothelial cell marker).

Note that chondrocytes also highly expressed Inhba, consistent with the immunostaining results shown in Figure 1. However, their number was much lower than PPCs in early callus (Supplementary Figure 4B), suggesting that PPCs are the main source of activin A in early fracture healing.&quot; The violin plot in Figure 3C alone does not support this statement. There appears to be a remarkable increase in Inhba expression in chondrocytes (which is consistent with Figure 1A-B), but less so in other cells. Further, SuppFig4B presents an estimate of cell counts, which might very well be biased by the efficiency of the flow cytometer and/or 10X platform, when comparing fibroblast-like cells and chondrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is absolutely correct. To address these very important points, we have rectified our description of the data and have modified our conclusions to include possible roles of the protein in diverse cell populations. One reason for our emphasizing the likely important roles of Inhba/Activin A in the progenitor cell populations is that as mentioned above, there is clear evidence of the protein’s role in MSC differentiation (for example, Djouad et al., 2010 cited above <sup>(5)</sup>). To date however, Activin A roles in chondrocytes remain largely unclear, necessitating future studies. We agree also that there may be a bias in flow efficiency for different populations. Again, we have dealt with all these pertinent and important issues by toning down our conclusions and entertaining other possibilities. Please also see our response to Reviewer 1 comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Based on scRNA-seq data, we sorted Cd45-Cd31- Ter119-Cd34+ (Lin-/Cd34+) cells and Cd45-Cd31-Ter119-Cd34- (Lin-/Cd34-) cells to represent MPCs and PPCs, respectively.&quot; Cluster-specific quantification of Cd34 expression (either via violin or scatter plots) should be depicted to justify this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Point well taken. The UMAP of Cd34 expression pattern is now included in Figure 2 —figure supplement 6B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;To test this possibility, we isolated tibial periosteal mesenchymal progenitors…&quot; Are you referring to Td+ cells from the intact bones of Col2-Cre mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the confusion. We actually used WT C57Bl/6 mice for these experiments. This detail is now included in Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;These data clearly suggest that activin A targets mesenchymal progenitors in early fracture and that suppressing activin A impairs fracture healing.&quot; Activin A inhibition clearly disrupts fracture healing, but most of these individual results can also be explained by changes in chondrocytes, rather than PPCs, at the cellular level. This could perhaps be addressed by analyzing other modes of injury, such as cortical drill holes, that heal mainly through intramembranous ossification.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much thank the Reviewer for this constructive advice and suggestions. To address this issue, we performed drill hole experiments on WT C56Bl/6 mice and treated them with subcutaneous injections of nActA.AB or implanted them with Matrigel/Activin A mixture at the hole site. MicroCT scanning clearly showed that bone healing in the hole region was delayed in the nActA.AB-treated group but accelerated in the recombinant Activin A-implanted group. As the Reviewer pointed out, bone repair after drill-hole is mainly through intramembranous ossification. Thus, these additional results provide evidence that compared with chondrocytes, PPCs could be more important in Activin A-mediated bone healing. These data are now included as Figure 7 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;…is expressed highly in a previously unidentified PPC population emerging shortly after fracture…&quot; This claim requires further support, as the uniqueness of the PPC population is unclear. These cells likely have at least some overlap with those described by others, such as Matthews et al. (i.e. alphaSMA) or Shi et al. (i.e. Gli1), and Col2-Cre could simply be another marker/handle for the same transient myofibroblast population during fracture healing.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the Reviewer and have removed the “previously unidentified” terminology in the current revised manuscript. The Reviewer is also correct that the PPCs identified in our study are likely to be related to the αSMA+ cells discovered by the Matthews et al. study. In their <italic>eLife</italic> article <sup>(22)</sup>, the authors concluded that αSMA identifies long-term, slow-cycling and self-renewing osteochondroprogenitors in adult periosteum as functionally important participants in bone formation and fracture healing. In our scRNA-seq datasets, however, <italic>Acta2</italic> mainly marks the PPCs after fracture and it is thus possible that the PPCs are a more specific subset amongst the populations identified by Matthews et al. Future experiments are needed to clarify these important points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;…fibroblasts in all tissues, regardless of their states (steady and perturbed), are derived from a primitive cell cluster termed Pi16+ cells…&quot; Buechler et al., identified two transcriptionally distinct populations of fibroblasts, that can be distinguished by Pi16 or Col15a1 expression, among other markers. Although both populations are found in various types of tissues, it is unclear whether the other tissue-specific fibroblasts are derived from them.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this critical advice and for raising these points. As the Reviewer realizes, Buechler et al. stated the following in their article:</p><p>“In the steady state, slingshot lineage inference identified trajectories that emerged from the Pi16+ cluster, passed through the Col15a1+ cluster, and ended at specialized clusters.</p><p>In the perturbed state, universal Dpt+Pi16+ fibroblasts maintained the highest expression of stemness-associated genes (Extended Data Figure 8x). Lineage inference identified trajectories from Dpt+Pi16+ through Dpt+Col15a1+ and then on to perturbation-specific, activated Cxcl5+ and Lrrc15+ clusters or the Adamdec1+ cluster (Extended Data Figure 8y). We tested whether universal fibroblasts give rise to LRRC15+ myofibroblasts using a subcutaneous [tumor] model in the DptIresCreERT2;Rosa26LSLYFP mouse. We found that 52 ± 7% of LRRC15+ myofibroblasts were YFP+ in DptIresCreERT2ki/ki mice (Figure 3d, Extended Data Figure 8z–b′). This indicates that Dpt-expressing cells marked before [tumor] implantation can differentiate into LRRC15+ myofibroblasts”.</p><p>These authors’ statements clearly implicate the stemness of Pi16+ cells. However, we agree with the Reviewer that they did not provide sufficient evidence that all fibroblast populations derive from Pi16+ cells. Thus, we modified our own sentence as follows:</p><p>“Fibroblast populations present in all tissues regardless of physiologic state (steady and perturbed) contain a most primitive cell cluster termed Pi16+ cells”.</p><p>Interestingly, Col15a1 is expressed in both MPCs and PPCs in our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>), further demonstrating that fibroblasts (or mesenchymal lineage cells) in periosteum share characteristics of fibroblast populations present in other tissues.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>UMAP plot of <italic>Col15a1</italic> in the merged fracture dataset.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89822-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>References:</p><p>1.
