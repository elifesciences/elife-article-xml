presequence and are imported by the TIM23 complex (presequence translocase) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The voltage-regulated Tim23 channel constitutes the actual protein-import pore wide enough to allow the passage of polypeptides with a secondary structure. In this study, we identify amino acids important for the cation selectivity of Tim23. Structure based mutants show that selectivity is provided by highly conserved, pore-lining amino acids. Mutations of these amino acid residues lead to reduced selectivity properties, reduced protein import capacity and they render the Tim23 channel insensitive to substrates. We thus show that the cation selectivity of the Tim23 channel is a key feature for substrate recognition and efficient protein import.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28324.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of animals, plants and other eukaryotic organisms contain compartments known as organelles that play many different roles. For example, compartments called mitochondria are responsible for supplying the chemical energy cells need to survive and grow. Two membranes surround each mitochondrion and energy is converted on the surface of the inner one.</p><p>Mitochondria contain over 1,000 different proteins, most of which are produced in the main part of the cell and have to be transported into the mitochondria. A transport protein called Tim23 is part of a larger group or ‘complex’ of proteins that helps to import many other proteins into the mitochondria. This complex sits in the inner membrane, with the Tim23 protein forming a large, water-filled pore through its core that provides a route for proteins to pass through the membrane.</p><p>Proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids. The proteins transported by the complex containing Tim23 all have a short chain of amino acids at one end known as an N-terminal presequence. However, it is not clear how the inside of the Tim23 channel identifies and transports this presequence to allow the right proteins to pass through the inner membrane.</p><p>Denkert, Schendzielorz et al. studied the normal and mutant versions of a Tim23 channel from yeast to find out which parts of the protein are involved in detecting the N-terminal presequence after it enters the pore. The experiments show that there are several amino acids in Tim23 that play important roles in this process. Furthermore, mitochondria containing mutant Tim23 channels, that are less able to identify the N-terminal presequence, are impaired in their ability to import proteins.</p><p>Tim23 proteins in humans and other organisms also contain most or all of the specific amino acids identified in this study, suggesting that the findings of Denkert, Schendzielorz et al. will also apply to other species. Furthermore, the experimental strategy used in this study could be adapted to investigate transport proteins in other cell compartments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>protein trafficking</kwd><kwd>Tim23</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial biogenesis</kwd><kwd>membrane channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1190</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meinecke</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rehling</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR1905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denkert</surname><given-names>Niels</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Channel characteristics of the presequence translocation pore have a direct impact on protein import into the mitochondrial matrix.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Double membrane bounded mitochondria import over 1000 different proteins synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Endo and Yamano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Different targeting signals direct the proteins into one of the four mitochondrial sub-compartments: outer membrane (OM), intermembrane space (IMS), inner membrane (IM) and matrix. Approximately, 70% of these mitochondrial proteins are synthesized with an N-terminal presequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vögtle et al., 2009</xref>), which directs them across the OM. Once threaded through the OM, the presequence directs preproteins to the presequence translocase (TIM23 complex), located in the inner boundary membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbot and Meinecke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>). The TIM23 complex transports precursor proteins across the inner membrane, or, if they contain additional sorting signals, inserts them into the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van der Laan et al., 2007</xref>). The membrane potential (ΔΨ) across the energy coupling inner membrane exerts an electrophoretic force on the positively charged presequences, thereby providing energy for the translocation of preproteins. ΔΨ is necessary and sufficient for membrane insertion of IM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van der Laan et al., 2007</xref>), whereas full translocation of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix depends on additional energy provided by the ATP consuming presequence translocase-associated import motor PAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Neupert and Brunner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schendzielorz et al., 2017</xref>). The TIM23 complex consists of the channel forming Tim23 subunit and its homolog Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohret et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maarse et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meinecke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ryan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, the receptor protein Tim50 as well as Mgr2 are constitutive subunits of the presequence translocase, whereas Tim21 is specific to the TIM23 complex in the absence of the PAM motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ieva et al., 2014</xref>). Tim23 was identified as the central pore-forming component of the TIM23 complex by electrophysiological characterization of purified Tim23 as well as patch-clamp analyses of inner membrane derived vesicles, depleted of Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>). Tim23 forms a voltage-activated, water-filled pore with a diameter of 1.3–2.4 nm. To maintain the permeability barrier of the inner membrane it is voltage-regulated by the Tim50 receptor and shows sensitivity towards presequence peptides and full-length preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meinecke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>). Many electrophysiological features of purified Tim23, such as voltage-gating, substrate sensitivity and selectivity, were also found in measurements of the TIM23 complex. The role of Tim17 is less clear, though recent studies suggest it might be involved in channel regulation within the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramesh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite its channel dimension, which would allow the simultaneous passage of multiple ions, Tim23 shows a clear preference to conduct cations over anions. Since its discovery this selectivity was speculated to be important to recognize and transport positively charged presequences through the channel. The lack of high-resolution 3D structures on the one hand, and the missing amphipathic character of the predicted transmembrane helices hindered the possibility to construct structure based mutants to investigate the molecular nature and physiological importance of the basic electrophysiological characteristics of the Tim23 channel. In recent years efforts have been made to overcome this issue. Fluorescent mapping has allowed for the first time to show which amino acid residues of the transmembrane helices of Tim23 are likely facing the aqueous channel lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identify pore-lining amino acids of the Tim23 channel that contribute to ion selectivity. Mutations of these highly conserved amino acids specifically affect the channels selective properties while leaving other electrophysiological characteristics intact. Yeast cells expressing mutant Tim23 channels with decreased selectivity show growth defects and are impaired in the import of mitochondrial proteins. On the protein level, selectivity reduction leads to a highly decreased sensitivity towards substrates. Our data provide evidence for the idea that the biophysical properties of protein-conducting Tim23 channel are essential for its physiological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the physiological function of highly conserved, pore-lining amino acid residues of Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>) from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vivo</italic>, we employed mutants based on substitution of amino acids in the second transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells with chromosomal deletion of <italic>TIM23</italic>, rescued by a <italic>URA3</italic>-containing plasmid carrying wild type <italic>TIM23</italic>, were transformed with plasmids carrying the <italic>HIS3</italic> gene as a selection marker and either a wild type copy of <italic>TIM23</italic> or <italic>TIM23</italic> mutant alleles.

Interestingly, in a wide screen for basic electrophysiological parameters we found that a number of mutants (<italic>Tim23<sup>N150A</sup>, Tim23<sup>A156L</sup>, Tim23<sup>Y159A</sup></italic>) that showed growth defects exhibited a significantly reduced reversal potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which translates to a severe reduction of the channels cation preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), while other parameters remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). The strongest reduction was observed for Tim23<sup>N150A</sup>, where the selectivity dropped down to 33% of wild type level. A slightly weaker reduction in cation preference (between 50–70% of wild type level) was observed for Tim23<sup>G153A</sup>, Tim23<sup>A156G</sup>, Tim23<sup>A156L</sup>, Tim23<sup>Y159A</sup> and Tim23<sup>N160A</sup>. All residues with decreased selectivity are highly conserved between Tim23 in different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To analyze if the observed growth defects could be directly linked to altered channel characteristics or if they were secondary effects, we examined the integrity of the TIM23 complex in the inner membrane. Mitochondrial lysates of all mutants and wild type were analyzed for steady state protein levels of Tim23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Reduced levels of Tim23 were found for the mutants Tim23<sup>L155A</sup>, Tim23<sup>A156L</sup>, Tim23<sup>Y159A</sup> and Tim23<sup>N160A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 5, 7, 8 and 9). Tim23<sup>L155A</sup>, Tim23<sup>A156L</sup>, Tim23<sup>Y159A</sup> all showed impaired growth phenotypes, which might result from decreased Tim23 levels. To gain more insight into TIM23 complex integrity of the mutants we performed co-immunoprecipitation of wild type and all mutants using antibodies against Tim23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, TIM23 and PAM subunits could be efficiently co-purified. The altered levels of some subunits (for example Tim17 and Tim50) can probably be attributed to decreased Tim23 levels in mitochondria. As an alternative approach, we analyzed TIM23 complex integrity of selected mutants by size exclusion chromatography.

To test this, we analyzed the channel response of wild type Tim23 and Tim23<sup>N150A</sup> to presequences in single-channel experiments. As a substrate we used a peptide corresponding to the presequence of Cox4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison and Schatz, 1986</xref>), a subunit of the cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, which is well characterized to study import processes and signal recognition biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lytovchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulz et al., 2011</xref>) and channel excitation electrophysiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lohret et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meinecke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramesh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van der Laan et al., 2007</xref>). The presequence peptide was titrated in increasing concentrations to the intermembrane space corresponding side of bilayer-incorporated wild type or Tim23<sup>N150A</sup> channels and current was recorded at constant holding potentials after each titration step. Tim23 reacted to higher holding potentials by partial or complete closing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B,E and F</xref>), which could mask presequence-induced activity increase or change channel behavior. Hence, we aimed to minimize such secondary effects by recording at lower holding potentials. We applied voltages of +80 mV, where the channel stayed primarily in an open state even during prolonged exposure but reacts to presequence activation. Wild type Tim23 showed a distinct activity increase, characterized by fast gating (flickering), after addition of Cox4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B and C</xref>). While Tim23<sup>N150A</sup> also responded with an increased gating frequency to Cox4 addition, the effect was drastically reduced in comparison to wild type Tim23. Where wild type Tim23 channels could be activated to a relative increase in gating frequency of factor 50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, black curve), the gating frequency of Tim23<sup>N150A</sup> only changed by a factor 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, red curve), resulting in an 88% reduction of voltage-activated gating from wild type to mutant Tim23. To further prove that the relative reduction in gating frequency did not originate from e.g. a higher baseline of gating frequency of Tim23<sup>N150A</sup> compared to wild type Tim23, we analyzed absolute gating frequencies in the absence of substrate peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Although the basic channel characteristics have been described to some extend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meinecke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>), the physiological relevance of these parameters as well as the molecular mode of function of the import pore are still enigmatic. Due to lack of structural information the current understanding is little more than that at the heart of the TIM23 complex a water-filled pore facilitates the passage of preproteins across the inner membrane.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of Tim23’s ion-selectivity to link biophysical properties of the import channel to its physiological function. We report the identification of pore-lining amino acids that contribute to the channels cation selectivity. Interestingly, we found that a number of different residues are involved in discriminating between ions. All amino acids detected to be important for channel selectivity are strictly conserved in evolution, suggesting an essential role for the selectivity in protein transport across the inner membrane. In recent studies these residues were successfully cross-linked to preproteins <italic>in transit</italic>, showing their accessibility and exposure to the channel lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>). Our results imply that selectivity is not necessarily provided by a confined restriction zone within the channel but rather by specific channel surface characteristics throughout the length of the pore, which facilitate the passage of certain ions over others. Such a mechanism was proposed for other large pores to explain their selective properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Im and Roux, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kutzner et al., 2011</xref>). Even though these reports were mainly made for β-barrel proteins, the similarity of the electrophysiological properties between some β-barrel pores, like Tom40 or Sam50, and α-helical import pores, like Tim23 or Tim22, makes it appealing to speculate that the selectivity of these pores has a similar molecular nature. Most of the detected selectivity mutants in our study showed impaired growth. As an outlier Tim23<sup>G153A</sup> shows a mediocre reduction in selectivity while growth is relatively unaffected and we therefore hypothesize that a certain impairment of the selective properties can be compensated. We rigorously excluded mutant forms of Tim23 that showed decreased mitochondrial steady state levels or with a compromised TIM23 complex assembly and hence could not be used to link <italic>in vitro</italic> single-channel results with <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in organello</italic> experiments. This led to the identification of Tim23<sup>N150A</sup>, which is expressed and assembled as wild type Tim23. The potential across the inner membrane is unaffected in cells expressing Tim23<sup>N150A</sup>. In line with the uncompromised mitochondrial fitness, all channel parameters, especially Tim50<sup>IMS</sup> voltage-regulation, but selectivity and substrate sensitivity, are comparable with wild type Tim23. Importantly, mitochondria containing Tim23<sup>N150A</sup> channels showed significantly reduced import capacity for matrix proteins. We therefore conclude that the drastically reduced selectivity renders Tim23 channels insensitive towards positively charged substrate peptides, which in turn explains the reduced import rates of preproteins. The position of the amino acid substitution N150A is found close to the beginning of transmembrane helix 2 and is therefore located at the matrix side of the channel. This suggests that the decreased substrate sensitivity characterized by an inactive, slowly gating channel in the presence of prepeptides cannot be explained by binding and activation of the substrate to the IMS side of the channel. Instead the substrate has to reach deep into the channel to be affected by a mutation at the matrix side. Similar to what was described for Tom40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahendran et al., 2012</xref>), the active, fast-gating Tim23 is therefore likely a transport competent state of the channel, triggered by peptides in transit within the channel that are discriminated by the channels selective properties. A decreased selectivity of Tim23 leads to an inability to be activated and therefore directly to decreased import rates.</p><p>The strategy used in this study allowed us to link the biophysical properties of a protein translocase to its physiological function. While water-filled pores were identified at the heart of most organellar translocation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">du Plessis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harsman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meinecke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sjuts et al., 2017</xref>), only basic channel characteristics were described in most cases. A correlation between the fascinating electrophysiological properties of these large pores and their physiological function remained circumstantial evidence. It was for example speculated for almost 20 years, that the cation selectivity of the Tim23 channel is important for recognition or transport of positively charged presequences, though no direct evidence was reported. Interestingly, many translocation pores show partially similar electrophysiological properties. Although structurally diverse, Tim23, Tim22, Tom40 and Sam50 all display comparable channel diameters and a preference for cations. The molecular nature of these characteristics as well as their physiological importance will be highly important problems to tackle in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p><italic>Sc</italic>Tim23 wild type and mutants were expressed from the plasmid pET10N containing an N-Terminal His<sub>10</sub>-Tag in <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3).

Isolation of mitochondria was handled as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schendzielorz et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Import of precursor proteins</title><p>For import of [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine labeled precursors into isolated mitochondria, proteins were translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, WI, USA). Reaction was performed in import buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM MOPS/KOH pH 7.2, 80 mM KCl, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM methionine and 3% fatty acid-free BSA) supplemented with 2 mM ATP and 2 mM NADH. To stop the import reaction, membrane potential was disrupted using final concentration of 1 µM valinomyin, 8 µM antimycin A and 20 µM oligomycin and samples were Proteinase K (PK, 20 µg/ml) treated for 10 min on ice. PK was inhibited with 2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) for 10 min on ice; mitochondria were pelleted, washed with SEM (250 mM sucrose, 20 mM MOPS pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA) and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Import and assembly of the ADP/ATP carrier protein (AAC) via TIM22 was performed using the standard protocol and further analyzed by Blue Native PAGE and autoradiography as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schulz et al., 2011</xref>). Import of Cox12 via MIA was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gornicka et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, in addition to the standard protocol the reticulocyte lysate was diluted 1:2 in saturated ammonium sulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and precipitated on ice. The pellet was resuspended in 8 M urea, 10 mM DTT, 30 mM MOPS, pH 7.2 and then added to mitochondria in import buffer without BSA. The Cox12 import reaction was stopped with 25 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and PK.</p><p>Quantifications were performed using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare, NJ, USA) using a rolling ball background subtraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Protein complex isolation</title><p>TIM23 complex isolation was carried out essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herrmann et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, mitochondria were resuspended to 1 mg/ml in solubilization buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol (w/v), 1 mM PMSF, 1% digitonin) and kept on ice for 20 min. Insoluble parts were removed by centrifugation at 14000 x g for 10 min and supernatant was incubated with Tim23-specific antibodies cross-linked to Protein A sepharose beads. After 30 min of binding on a rotating wheel at 4°C and 5x washing with 500 µl washing buffer (solubilization buffer with 0.3% digitonin), samples where eluted with 50 µl 0.1 mM glycine pH 2.8 (neutralized with 5 µl 1 M Tris base).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Membrane potential measurements</title><p>Membrane potential was measured using 3,3’-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5)). Mitochondria were resuspended in buffer containing 600 mM sorbitol, 1% (wt/vol) BSA, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 mM KPi, pH 7.4 to a concentration of 166 µg/ml. Changes in fluorescence were assessed with a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, JP) at room temperature with excitation at 622 nm, emission at 670 nm and slits of 5 nm. Components were added to the cuvette in the fowling order: 500 µl of buffer, DiSC<sub>3</sub>(5), 83 µg of mitochondria, 1 µM valinomycin. To compare relative differences in membrane potential, the difference in fluorescence before and after addition of valinomycin was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Complex characterization by size exclusion chromatographie</title><p>Mitochondria were solubilized as described for protein complex isolation, with 2 mg/ml instead of 1 mg/ml, and 50 µl were loaded to a Superose 6 increase 3.2/300 and eluted in solubilization buffer containing 0.3% digitonin. The first 1250 µl were discarded, the following 750 µl were collected in 50 µl fractions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Quantifications were performed using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare, NJ, USA) using a rolling ball background subtraction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Robert Rucktäschel for technical assistance with size exclusion chromatography.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nikolaus Pfanner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Andre Schneider (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Protein translocation across or into the mitochondrial inner membrane is mediated by an N-terminal presequence in conjunction with the TIM23 complex. While its central component, Tim23 is believed to form a protein-conducting channel, the molecular mechanisms of preprotein translocation through the channel remain largely unknown. Denkert et al. characterize a panel of nine Tim23 variants whose second transmembrane helices contain point mutations. The growth on non-fermentable carbon sources of four of these mutants is reduced at elevated temperature. Six mutants exhibit a reduction in cation selectivity when analyzed by electrophysiological methods. The mutant N150A, which showed the greatest reduction and also exhibited a growth phenotype, was selected for further analysis. A very detailed electrophysiological analysis shows that besides the cation selectivity no other channel parameters were altered in the N150A mutant. This study establishes a link between the reduced import activity observed in isolated mitochondria and the reduced presequence-induced gating caused by the altered cation selectivity of the recombinant Tim23 import channel.</p><p>This is a highly interesting study that combines in organello and biophysical approaches.

We now show mitochondrial steady state levels of Tim23 including a quantification that clearly shows decreased Tim23 levels in all mutants we previously excluded. Despite all efforts, we could not provide a reliable BN-PAGE analysis of TIM23. It appears that this is due to a lack of suitable antibodies. As an alternative approach, we performed co-immuno precipitations of Tim23 in all strains and analysed if TIM23 and PAM subunits can be co-purified (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The new results are in line with our initial observation. We agree that a second suitable mutant would have been desirable, nonetheless detailed analysis of mitochondria carrying the varying Tim23 mutants didn’t provide a suitable strain. We repeated the steady state analysis of Tim23 in the various mitochondria and, as stated before, the levels of Tim23<sup>L155A</sup>, Tim23<sup>A156L</sup>, Tim23<sup>Y159A</sup> and Tim23<sup>N160A</sup> were significantly reduced and therefore excluded from further experiments.
