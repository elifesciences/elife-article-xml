nervous system is important for animal physiology and behaviors, and its disturbance has been linked with many neurodevelopmental disorders. The synaptic transmission efficacy can be modulated by the environment to accommodate external changes, which is crucial for animal reproduction and survival. However, the underlying plasticity of synaptic transmission remains poorly understood. Here we show that in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the male environment increases the hermaphrodite cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which alters hermaphrodites’ locomotion velocity and mating efficiency. We identify that the male-specific pheromones mediate this synaptic transmission modulation effect in a developmental stage-dependent manner. Dissection of the sensory circuits reveals that the AWB chemosensory neurons sense those male pheromones and further transduce the information to NMJ using cGMP signaling. Exposure of hermaphrodites to the male pheromones specifically increases the accumulation of presynaptic CaV2 calcium channels and clustering of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors at cholinergic synapses of NMJ, which potentiates cholinergic synaptic transmission. Thus, our study demonstrates a circuit mechanism for synaptic modulation and behavioral flexibility by sexual dimorphic pheromones.</p></abstract><kwd-group

animal physiology and behaviors. The disturbance of synaptic transmission has been linked with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the past decades, researchers have identified numerous genes encoding synaptic proteins that are linked with neurodevelopmental disorders, and their mutations cause the dysregulated synaptic transmission in human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Homozygosity Mapping Consortium for Autism et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Autism Sequencing Consortium et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geisheker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Neale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">C Yuen et al., 2017</xref>), including <italic>SHANK3, NRXN</italic>, and <italic>NLGN</italic> for autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levinson and El-Husseini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orefice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Südhof, 2008</xref>), <italic>MECP2</italic> for Rett’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Orefice et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>FMR1</italic> for Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Olmos-Serrano et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>UBE3</italic> for Angelman syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Judson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wallace et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The process of synaptogenesis occurs in the early postnatal developmental period and can be modulated by the environment. The effects of synaptic modulation could persist until adulthood and cause a lifelong impact. Various environmental contexts can modulate synaptic transmission and behaviors through experience-dependent plasticity, which provides a critical and conserved mechanism to generate animal behavior diversity and adaption. Among the environmental contexts, social interaction, such as the density of the conspecifics sharing the same habitat, represents one of the most important environmental conditions that modulate animal physiology and behaviors to meet the ever-changing environment and internal needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>). For example, social isolation of rats during the critical period of adolescence enhances long-term potentiation of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whitaker et al., 2013</xref>). Besides that, maternal separation has been found to have a profound lifelong influence on animal models at a mature stage of life. It causes habenula hyperexcitability, AMPA receptors delivery, and synaptic plasticity defects in the developing barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miyazaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tchenio et al., 2017</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism on how social interaction modulates synaptic transmission remains elusive.</p><p>There are many ways in which social interaction can influence neural development. Pheromone effects between conspecifics are strong drivers that modulate behaviors and alter physiology, allowing appropriate responses to particular social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liberles, 2014</xref>). These effects are often sexually dimorphic. Mouse pups elicit parental care behaviors in virgin females, for instance, but promote infanticidal behaviors in virgin males through pheromonal compounds (submandibular gland protein C and hemoglobins) and physical traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isogai et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans)</italic>, a family of glycolipids called ascarosides function as the pheromones to mediate social interactions. Males and hermaphrodites secrete several ascarosides in different amounts that elicit sexual dimorphic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Butcher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srinivasan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Srinivasan et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the male-enriched ascr#10 induces attraction behavior in hermaphrodites, but causes aversion behavior in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Izrayelit et al., 2012</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether and how specific pheromone-mediated effects are involved in neurodevelopmental processes, including synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission.</p><p>Here, we show that the male environment increases the cholinergic synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites, decreasing hermaphrodite’s locomotion activity and promoting mating efficiency. The male-specific pheromones (ascarosides) mediate these effects in a sexually dimorphic manner. Such ascaroside-mediated modulation of the cholinergic synaptic transmission is developmental stage dependent. We further used various neuron-type-specific ablation experiments to confirm that these male-specific pheromone signals are received and processed by the AWB chemosensory neuron pair in hermaphrodites. Upon reception, AWB neurons transduce the information to the NMJ using cGMP signaling. Furthermore, we used multiple reporter fusion constructs to show that the male-specific pheromones cause increased calcium channel accumulation and acetylcholine receptor (AchR) clustering at cholinergic synapses. Collectively, our work elucidates how individuals sense and adapt to the social environment, providing insights into how pheromones regulate the development and function of the nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The male environment modulates synaptic transmission at the hermaphrodite NMJ</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> has two sexes: XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The somatically female hermaphrodites can produce hermaphrodite progeny by self-fertilization (although rare males are generated through spontaneous X chromosome loss), whereas in the presence of males, they are also able to mate with males to give rise to equal ratios of hermaphrodites and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Hermaphrodites generated by self-fertilization or by crossing share the same genetic background but develop in distinct environments (i.e., in the presence or absence of males). Therefore, it provides an excellent system to study how social interaction modulates the establishment and maintenance of synaptic transmission during development. We selected the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ as a model to examine the male environment’s effects on synaptic transmission. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ includes body-wall muscles that receive synaptic inputs from both excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</xref>). The coordination of excitatory and inhibitory innervations guarantees <italic>C. elegans</italic> sinusoidal movement. In the presence of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as aldicarb, the breakdown of acetylcholine is prevented, and acetylcholine accumulates over time at synapses. As a result, worms become paralyzed due to hyper-excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahoney et al., 2006</xref>). The timing of the paralysis is influenced by the inhibitory innervations from GABAergic neurons that counteract acetylcholine’s excitatory effect and delay paralysis. The percentage of paralyzed worms over time can be used as a measurement of excitatory versus inhibitory synaptic transmission ratio (E/I ratio) at the NMJ. As a result, the alteration of sensitivity to aldicarb reflects the changes in NMJ synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vashlishan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The male excretome increases cholinergic synaptic transmission at hermaphrodite NMJ.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproduction.

We found that around 39.8% of hermaphrodites from self-fertilization were paralyzed after 70 min’ exposure to aldicarb. In contrast, almost all of the hermaphrodites from crossing were paralyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating that hermaphrodites obtained by crossing are more sensitive to aldicarb. Thus, the NMJ E/I ratio is increased in crossed hermaphrodites than those obtained by self-fertilization.</p><p>There are three possible explanations for the observed differences in NMJ synaptic transmission in crossed hermaphrodites: first, it could be a parental inheritance effect, such as RNA transgenerational transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcazar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rechavi et al., 2011</xref>); second, it could be caused by direct contact with males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>); third, male metabolites secreted into the environment could modulate hermaphrodite development. To rule out the potential effects of parental inheritance and male contact, we directly exposed hermaphrodites from self-fertilization to medium conditioned by either the male or the hermaphrodite environment since egg stage. The conditioned medium was prepared by collecting cultures of <italic>him-5</italic> mutants containing around 40% males (male-conditioned medium) or wild-type hermaphrodites alone (hermaphrodite-conditioned medium). Both conditioned media contain metabolites secreted by 30,000 young adult worms during 3 hr cultivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After growing hermaphrodites in the conditioned medium, we found that the hermaphrodites cultured in the male-conditioned medium became paralyzed earlier than those in the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (80.31% vs. 61.11% paralyzed after 70 min’ exposure to aldicarb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result suggests that the effect of the male environment on hermaphrodite NMJ is mediated by male-secreted metabolites. In the following experiments, we directly used the male-conditioned medium and hermaphrodite-conditioned medium unless otherwise specified.</p><p>We then analyzed muscle excitability as another independent measure of synaptic transmission changes at the NMJ. Previous work has shown that the body-wall muscle at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NMJ receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Richmond and Jorgensen, 1999</xref>). When the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission ratio increases at the NMJ, the excitability of muscle cells should increase. To verify the increased excitability of the body-wall muscle, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 in muscle cells (under the <italic>myo-3</italic> promoter) and the channelrhodopsin variant Chrimson in VB and DB motor neurons (under the <italic>acr-5</italic> promoter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescence changes reflect calcium influx and excitability in the GCaMP3-expressing cells. We found that the baseline GCaMP3 fluorescence is higher in hermaphrodites grown in the male-conditioned medium compared with those grown in the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium, suggesting relatively higher resting muscle excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we excited the VB and DB cholinergic motor neurons via optogenetic activation of Chrimson with red light (wavelength at 640 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) and observed significantly increased GCaMP3 fluorescence intensity potentiation (assessed as ΔF/F) in hermaphrodites grown in the male-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). These results indicate that the male excretome environment causes increased excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission ratio and muscle excitability at the NMJ of hermaphrodites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The acetylcholine transmission rate at the NMJ is potentiated by the male excretome environment</title><p>The increased E/I ratio could be caused by either increased cholinergic transmission or decreased GABAergic transmission. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) at the NMJ. We found that the mEPSC frequency was significantly increased in hermaphrodites from male-conditioned medium compared to those from hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>), but the mEPSC amplitude was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,J</xref>). When we examined inhibitory postsynaptic currents, we detected no significant differences in mIPSC frequency and amplitude between hermaphrodites from male- or hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–M</xref>). The electrophysiology data suggest that potentiation of acetylcholine transmission rate mainly contributes to the observed increase in the E/I ratio at the NMJ of hermaphrodites in the male excretome environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The male excretome environment increases the hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission during the juvenile stage</title><p>To delineate whether there are any critical developmental windows for the observed synaptic transmission modulation by the male environment, we transferred hermaphrodites to male-conditioned medium at a series of different developmental stages (egg, L1 [24 hr after egg], L2–L3 [36 hr after egg], and mid-L4 [48 hr after egg]). We then measured synaptic transmission in young adults with the aldicarb assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We found that hermaphrodites leaving the male excretome environment at the young adult stage still showed an increased sensitivity to aldicarb compared with those in the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (66.3% vs. 42.0% at 70 min). The effect was comparable to that in hermaphrodites sustained in the male environment (78.0% vs. 42.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that the maintenance of the elevated cholinergic synaptic transmission rate at the hermaphrodites NMJ does not require a sustained male excretome environment in adults. In contrast, we observed that the hermaphrodite leaving the male-conditioned medium at the mid-L4 stage presented similar aldicarb sensitivity to those from the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (37.7% vs. 42.0% at 70 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together, these data support the notion that the male environment exposure at a critical period (the L3–L4 stage) is required for the modulation of hermaphrodites NMJ cholinergic synaptic transmission.</p><p>The aforementioned experiments were carried out using the Bristol N2 strain. To determine whether the male excretome environment's effect is conserved in other <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, we studied several natural variations, including the Australian strain AB3, the Hawaiian strain CB4856, and the Madison strain TR389. We observed that the male-conditioned medium accelerated animal paralysis in the CB4856 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, 59.7% vs. 20.7% after 60 min of aldicarb) and the AB3 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, 52.8% vs. 28.6% after 80 min of aldicarb), but not in the TR389 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, 68.46% vs. 60.99% after 130 min of aldicarb). Thus, although the effect of the male environment does exist in other natural <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, exceptions do exist, as in the TR389 strain.</p><p>Two possibilities could account for this lack of a modulator effect: TR389 males may not be able to secrete the modulator ascarosides; alternatively, TR389 hermaphrodites cannot sense and respond to the modulator ascarosides. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we grew Bristol N2 hermaphrodites in the TR389 male-conditioned medium and compared their synaptic transmission by aldicarb sensitivity with those maintained in N2 and TR389 hermaphrodite-conditioned medium. The three groups presented similar sensitivity to aldicarb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, TR389 hermaphrodites grown in the N2 male-conditioned medium showed significantly increased sensitivity to aldicarb compared to those in the N2 hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To study the physiological significance of male excretome modulation, we tested its effect on hermaphrodite’s egg-laying behaviors and mating abilities. We calculated the brood size of hermaphrodites from hermaphrodite- and male-conditioned medium, and observed no significant differences between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Successful mating was scored when more than three male progenies were generated in the mating plate. The results showed that hermaphrodites from TR389 male-conditioned medium had higher mating efficiency compared to those from hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), which is consistent with previous research that the male environment reduces hermaphrodite exploration and increases mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2019b</xref>).

We hypothesized that the observed effects of the male environment on hermaphrodite cholinergic synaptic transmission at the NMJ may be mediated by male-specific ascarosides. Ascarosides are derivatives of 3,6-dideoxysugar ascarylose, and their biosynthesis requires several dehydrogenases, including DAF-22, which β-oxidizes and shortens long-chain fatty acids to generate bioactive medium- and short-chain ascarosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).

The inability of the <italic>daf-22</italic> male environment to modulate hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission suggests that male-specific ascarosides do contribute to the observed modulatory effects on synaptic transmission.</p><p>The pheromone effects are often sexually dimorphic. To study whether the male-specific ascarosides also modulate male NMJ synaptic transmission, we compared the aldicarb sensitivity of males grown in the hermaphrodite- and male-conditioned media. We did not observe aldicarb sensitivity differences in males from hermaphrodite- and male-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since males can secrete those modulatory pheromones themselves, we took advantage of <italic>daf-22</italic> mutant males that have the defects in pheromone production.

These results indicate that male-specific ascarosides cannot modulate synaptic transmission in males, suggesting a sexually dimorphic effect of those male-specific ascarosides.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> ascarosides comprise a complex mixture of ascaroside derivates that vary according to their side chains; there are saturated, α,β-unsaturated (e.g., α,β double-bond), and β-hydroxylated (e.g., β-hydroxylated side chain) derivatives. Hermaphrodites and males are known to accumulate distinct types and quantities of these various ascarosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). To identify the ‘modulator ascarosides’ that function in the observed modulation of the hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission, we first analyzed the TR389 strain, which recalls appearing unable to secrete the modulator ascarosides.</p><p>To further determine the identity of the modulator ascarosides, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analyses to compare the excretomes among N2 hermaphrodite cultures (containing N2 hermaphrodites only), N2 male cultures, <italic>daf-22</italic> male cultures, and TR389 male cultures (all of the male cultures contains around 35% males) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We collected and analyzed culture media samples with UPLC-MS and found that ascr#10 was enriched in both the N2 male and TR389 male cultures relative to the N2 hermaphrodite cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Izrayelit et al., 2012</xref>). We also observed that the <italic>daf-22</italic> male cultures lacked most of the short- and medium-chain ascarosides, and accumulated the long-chain ascarosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), confirming the role of DAF-22 in dehydrogenating and shortening ascaroside side chains.</p><p>Next, reasoning that the modulator ascarosides should be enriched in N2 male-conditioned culture, we compared the UPLC-MS profiles of N2 male cultures with the N2 hermaphrodites and the TR389 male cultures. The medium-chain β-hydroxylated ascarosides were substantially increased in the N2 male cultures compared to the N2 hermaphrodite cultures and TR389 male cultures. Specifically, the significantly enriched β-hydroxylated ascarosides in N2 males included C13, C14, and C15 ascarosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, we detected no significant changes between the N2 and TR389 male cultures for saturated ascarosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results implicate that the medium-chain β-hydroxylated ascarosides may act as the male modulator ascarosides.</p><p>Pursuing this with a genetic approach, we acquired a mutant of the known ascaroside synthesis enzyme DHS-28; previous analysis of the <italic>dhs-28</italic> mutant hermaphrodite metabolome has shown that these animals accumulate β-hydroxylated medium-chain ascarosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). We conducted aldicarb assays to compare the E/I ratios of <italic>dhs-28</italic> cultures with those of N2 hermaphrodites grown in the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium. As expected, <italic>dhs-28</italic> mutant hermaphrodites were more sensitive to aldicarb compared with N2 hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We also tested hermaphrodites of other known ascaroside synthesis mutants, including <italic>maoc-1</italic> and <italic>acox-1.1 –</italic> which are known to accumulate saturated and α,β-unsaturated side-chain ascarosides <italic>–</italic> but found that <italic>maoc-1</italic> mutants present slightly increase of aldicarb sensitivity than the wild type, and <italic>acox-1.1</italic> mutants were indifferent from the wild type for their sensitivity to aldicarb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the male ascaroside effects on <italic>dhs-28</italic> mutants, which could accumulate β-hydroxylated medium-chain ascarosides themselves. The result showed that <italic>dhs-28</italic> hermaphrodites cannot be modulated by male ascarosides by presenting comparable aldicarb sensitivity when in hermaphrodite- and male-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These experiments with ascaroside biosynthesis mutants establish that environmental enrichment of β-hydroxylated medium-chain ascarosides increases the hermaphrodite NMJ E/I ratio, thereby supporting that these specific ascarosides may function as NMJ cholinergic synaptic transmission modulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>AWB sensory neurons are involved in sensing the modulator ascarosides and transmit signals to the NMJ through cGMP signaling</title><p>Pheromone signals in the environment are detected and integrated by chemosensory neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ludewig and Schroeder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Srinivasan et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, there are 11 pairs of chemosensory neurons that can respond to pheromone signals (ASE, AWC, AWA, AWB, ASH, ASI, ADF, ASG, ASJ, ASK, and ADL). To identify the specific chemosensory neurons sensing the modulator ascarosides, we used a miniSOG (mini Singlet Oxygen Generator)-induced genetic ablation strategy. miniSOG is an engineered fluorescent protein that can generate singlet oxygen upon blue light illumination. Targeting miniSOG to mitochondria can lead to singlet oxygen accumulation in mitochondria, which induces rapid and efficient cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qi et al., 2012</xref>). To examine the genetic ablation efficiency, we coexpressed mCherry and miniSOG in the chemosensory neurons under the control of the <italic>flp-21</italic> promoter and quantified the miniSOG ablation efficiency based on the percentage of live neurons labeled by mCherry before and after induction of cell death. To optimize the ablation protocol, we tested continuous blue light stimulation at a power of 57 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> over different periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that 15 min’ stimulation resulted in complete loss of mCherry signals in around 47.8% of neurons and a dramatic reduction of mCherry signals in 26.1% of neurons, whereas stimulation for 30 min or 50 min led to complete loss of mCherry signals in almost 80% of neurons and faint residual expression of mCherry signals in 20% of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Considering both the ablation efficiency and the stimulation time, we chose 30 min of continuous blue light stimulation for our standard ablation procedure.</p><p>We screened all the 11 pairs of chemosensory neurons based on miniSOG-induced genetic ablation of hermaphrodites at the late L1 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We grew hermaphrodites in male-conditioned or hermaphrodite-conditioned medium following ablation of each specific chemosensory neuron type, and measured their sensitivity to aldicarb. Ablation of the AWB (<italic>str-1</italic> promoter driving miniSOG) neuron pair in hermaphrodites blocked the increased sensitivity to aldicarb following exposure to the male-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>, 45.6% vs. 43.4% at 80 min). In contrast, the increased aldicarb sensitivity in the male-conditioned medium remained when any other chemosensory neurons were ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–G</xref>). To further confirm the requirement of AWB in sensing the modulator ascarosides, we compared the locomotion of AWB-ablated hermaphrodites from male- and hermaphrodite-conditioned medium. Our data showed that ablation of AWB neurons decreased the locomotion velocity in hermaphrodites from the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium. In addition, ablation of AWB neurons blocked the decreased velocity by the modulator ascarosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We specifically expressed the channelrhodopsin variant CHIEF in AWB neurons and administered blue light illumination in the presence of all-trans retinal (ATR) to activate AWB neurons throughout the L4 stage. We observed decreased aldicarb sensitivity in animals fed with ATR (ATR+ light- vs. ATR− light−). Nevertheless, hermaphrodites with activated AWB neurons during the L4 stage showed higher sensitivity to aldicarb than controls without blue light activation (ATR+ light+ vs. ATR+ light−) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This effect is absent in the groups lacking ATR (ATR− light+ vs. ATR− light−) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, activation of ASJ/ASI neurons or other amphid wing neurons like AWA and AWC cannot increase aldicarb sensitivity, and the hermaphrodites with AWA neurons activation even present slightly decreased aldicarb sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings confirm that activation of the AWB chemosensory neuron pair in hermaphrodites is sufficient to modulate the NMJ synaptic transmission.</p><p>In order to test whether AWB neurons directly sense those modulator ascarosides, we monitored intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics upon male excretomes stimulation by expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP6f in AWB neurons. We found that the AWB neurons elicited a rapid and robust calcium transient responding to the male excretomes. However, no responses were detected by stimulation with the hermaphrodite excretomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). Collectively, the data support that AWB neurons directly respond to the male-specific modulator ascarosides.</p><p>We next explored which signaling molecules in AWB neurons mediate their responsivity to the modulator ascarosides. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, most chemical odors are perceived upon their binding to specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) located in chemosensory neurons; these receptors subsequently activate downstream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liberles, 2014</xref>). The G protein ODR-3 and the cGMP-gated channels TAX-2 have been implicated in chemosensory signal transduction in AWB neurons. We first examined the NMJ E/I ratio in <italic>tax-2</italic> and <italic>odr-3</italic> mutant hermaphrodites. We observed no differences in sensitivity to aldicarb for <italic>tax-2</italic> mutant hermaphrodites upon exposure to the male-conditioned or hermaphrodite-conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In the <italic>odr-3</italic> mutants, we even observed a decreased aldicarb sensitivity in hermaphrodites from male-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), suggesting that the ability to mediate the downstream signaling effects of modulator ascarosides and increase NMJ E/I ratio is disrupted in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>). Further supporting this, complementing TAX-2 expression in AWB neurons rescued the increased aldicarb sensitivity phenotype of hermaphrodites grown in the male-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Expression of TAX-2 in ASI and ASJ neurons had no such rescue effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The increased sensitivity to aldicarb was also rescued by ODR-3 complementation in AWB neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Together, these results establish that the cGMP signaling pathway in AWB chemosensory neurons transmits male-specific modulator ascaroside signals to the NMJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Excitatory postsynaptic receptor clustering is increased in hermaphrodites exposed to the male environment</title><p>The steps of the synaptic transmission process include presynaptic vesicle fusion, neurotransmission, and neurotransmitter binding to postsynaptic receptors. The increased cholinergic synaptic transmission rate at the hermaphrodite NMJ induced by the modulator ascarosides could reflect changes in any of these steps. We first examined whether any NMJ synaptic structures were altered, specifically by labeling cholinergic synapses via expression of a RAB-3-GFP fusion protein in DA and DB cholinergic motor neurons (using the <italic>unc-129</italic> promoter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colavita et al., 1998</xref>). DA and DB neurons are known to receive synaptic inputs in the ventral nerve cord and to form NMJs with the body-wall muscle in the dorsal nerve cord, and this results in the formation of puncta comprising presynaptic RAB-3 proteins that can be observed at DA/DB axon terminals in the dorsal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colavita et al., 1998</xref>).

At cholinergic synapses, the hermaphrodites from the male-conditioned medium had a slight but significant increase in puncta signal intensities for the nAchRs compared to those from the hermaphrodite-conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

Therefore, we inspected CaV2 calcium channel localization and abundance at presynaptic elements in hermaphrodites grown in either hermaphrodite- or male-conditioned medium. To visualize endogenous CaV2 at excitatory or inhibitory synapses separately, we utilized the split GFP complementary system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabantous et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kamiyama et al., 2016</xref>).

We further demonstrate that hermaphrodite sense and process these male-specific pheromones by AWB chemosensory neurons using the cGMP signaling. At the hermaphrodite NMJ, presynaptic calcium channel localization and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor clustering are elevated by exposure to male-specific pheromones, resulting in an increased cholinergic synaptic transmission.

Interestingly, the male-enriched pheromones increase the acetylcholine transmission specifically in hermaphrodites but not in males, suggesting sexual dimorphism in the regulation of NMJ synaptic transmission. This could be mediated by sex-specific neuronal circuits that are composed of either sex-specific or sex-shared neurons to process and transmit male pheromone signals to NMJ. A <italic>C. elegans</italic> male has 385 neurons, whereas a hermaphrodite has 302 neurons. The majority of male-specific neurons are localized in the male tail and are involved in the complex mating behaviors. There are several hermaphrodite-specific neurons in the nervous system, including VC and HSN motor neurons, which are mainly required for reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee and Hallem, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emmons, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García and Portman, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, several sex-shared neurons, including motor neurons, AWA, AWC, and ASK chemosensory neurons, DVA mechanosensory neurons, as well as AVA interneurons, could contribute to sex-specific neural circuits by mediating attraction and aversion behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee and Hallem, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer and Hobert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fagan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mowrey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Narayan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). Our results identified that AWB chemosensory neurons mediate a sexually dimorphic modulation of NMJ synaptic transmission. Further studies will be required to unravel the downstream neural circuits, including interneurons and premotor neurons, that function to process the modulator ascaroside signals to modulate NMJ synaptic transmission. Another possibility for this sexual dimorphic modulation is from sexually dimorphic hormone signaling pathways, such as vasopressin/oxytocin and their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that pheromones modulating hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission are enriched in N2 males. Previous studies have reported various male-specific ascarosides, including ascr#10 and indole containing ascarosides (IC-ascarosides, especially icas#3 and icas#9). However, our data indicate that ascr#10 and indole IC-ascarosides are unlikely the modulator ascarosides. First, ascr#10 levels are comparable in N2 and TR389 males. Second, previous work has established that ASI and ASK sensory neurons are required for hermaphrodites to sense ascr#10 and IC-ascarosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2016</xref>), whereas we find that ASI and ASK neurons are dispensable for hermaphrodites to sense the modulator ascarosides. In contrast, our UPLC-MS data strongly suggest that the medium-chain β-hydroxylated ascarosides (C13, C14, and C15) may mediate this effect. Although we provided extensive genetic evidence, we have not experimentally confirmed that these specific ascarosides are sufficient to modulate hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission.</p><p>Previous studies by Brunet and Murphy labs have shown that male pheromone exposure affects animal health and shortens hermaphrodite life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maures et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shi and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). Here our data suggest that it might be different mechanisms to modulate longevity and NMJ synaptic transmission. In previous research, they found that exposure of hermaphrodite to male pheromones at the beginning of their life (day 1) or sexual maturity (day 4) had a similar effect on hermaphrodites’ life span. However, we showed that L3–L4 is a critical developmental stage for modulation of hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission by male pheromones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Distinct male-specific pheromones may mediate the effects on longevity and NMJ. Further studies should be carried out to identify the specific ascaroside pheromones in males.</p><p>Our work demonstrates that early pheromone environment exposure has a long-term effect on synaptic transmission. We suspect that the observed effects may be mediated through endocrine signaling pathways, such as DAF-7/TGF-β and DAF-2/insulin, which are known to drive both epigenomic and transcriptional changes. In this light, recent studies have shown how pheromone exposure can inhibit learning behavior by disrupting the balance between two insulin-like peptides, ins-16 and ins-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Further studies are required to characterize whether endocrine system components like insulin signaling molecules are involved in regulating synaptic transmission in response to male-specific ascarosides.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Presynaptic calcium channels as neuromodulation targets</title><p>Our results show that modulator pheromones regulate hermaphrodite NMJ cholinergic transmission by altering the presynaptic localization of calcium channel CaV2 at cholinergic synapses. These results support that CaV2 calcium channels can be viewed as potential targets for environmental modulation of the synaptic transmission. At synapses, CaV2 channels are known to form large signaling complexes in the presynaptic nerve terminal that are responsible for calcium influx and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolphin and Lee, 2020</xref>). Numerous studies have verified causal relationships for calcium channel mutations and polymorphisms in neuropsychiatric diseases, including ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nanou and Catterall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zamponi, 2016</xref>). Our previous studies identified a synaptic retrograde signal mediated by autism-linked proteins that regulate CaV2 presynaptic localization to alter excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we present the important evidence that the presynaptic calcium channel CaV2 could also be a target of social interaction modulation to shift the synaptic excitation and inhibition balance. These results support the idea that changes in presynaptic calcium channel localization could be impactful in some forms of ASD.</p><p>How might changes in chemosensory neuron activity contribute to presynaptic calcium channel localization? Our results suggest that it is not a general change of CaV2 expression levels because we observed increased presynaptic localization at cholinergic synapses but not at GABAergic synapses. We suspect that the specific synaptic recruitment of CaV2 is somehow potentiated by the modulator ascarosides. Previous studies have suggested that protein interactions are required for cell-surface localization of calcium channels as well as their docking at the active zone. It is therefore possible that pre-synapse specific proteins that are only present at cholinergic synapses may act downstream of the chemosensory circuits to regulate the surface localization of CaV2 channels.</p><p>Collectively, our findings reveal a novel mechanism through which pheromones in the environment modulate synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission in the nervous system. Beyond suggesting that calcium channels may be a shared target for both genetic and environmental modulation during development, our study lays a foundation for studies into the signaling and cell-specific functions underlying neurodevelopmental dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>OP50</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:WB-STRAIN:OP50">WB-STRAIN:OP50</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Sequence information is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pPD49.26</td><td>Addgene <break/>(Andrew Fire)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/1686/">https://www.addgene.org/1686/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pPD95.75</td><td>Addgene (Andrew Fire)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/1494/">https://www.addgene.org/1494/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCFJ910</td><td>Addgene <break/>(Erik Jorgensen)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/44481/">https://www.addgene.org/44481/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>CZ14527</td><td>Yingchuan B.

After worms reached the young adult stages, they were collected and washed three times with M9 buffer to remove bacteria. To further remove the bacteria in the gut, the worms were then placed in M9 buffer in a shaker (150 rpm) at 20°C for 30 min and rinsed three times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Subsequently, worm-secreted metabolites were collected by incubating the worms in ddH<sub>2</sub>O in a shaker (150 rpm) for 3 hr with a density of 30,000 worms/ml. Afterward, the worms were removed by settling on ice for 5 min. The metabolites were filtered through 0.22 μm filters, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C.

For Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence imaging in AWB, the neurons were exposed under fluorescent excitation light for 30 s before recording, to eliminate the light-evoked calcium transients. During the recording process, for the first 5 s, we gave the M9 solution and then switched hermaphrodite excretome or male excretome for 30 s, removing extract liquid from 35 s and washing for 25 s.

Using a powerful combination of electrophysiology, behavioral analysis, optogenetics, genetic ablations, and imaging, the authors provide evidence that media conditioned by <italic>C. elegans</italic> males increases the E/I balance. Their results suggest that exposure during a critical period in late larval development is required for this effect; that exposure to conditioned media increases mEPSC frequency at the NMJ; that the effect is likely due to ascaroside pheromones; that these pheromones may be detected by the AWB neurons; that exposure to conditioned media changes pre- and post-synaptic CaV2 and AChR abundance, respectively; and that the CaV2 channel unc-2 is required for the physiological and behavioral effects of conditioned medium. A number of important issues remain unclear, such as the molecular identity of the relevant pheromone(s), whether these molecules are directly sensed by AWB, and whether changes at the NMJ are direct results of pheromone detection or are instead indirect changes that occur secondary to other changes in physiology that male pheromones can elicit in hermaphrodites. Nevertheless, the paper reports interesting and surprising findings that provide new insight into social and sexual interactions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the roles of pheromones in modulating physiology and behavior.</p><p>1. A very significant concern (perhaps a fatal flaw) is that essential information about the methods and details of the experiments are lacking. Without these, it becomes impossible to assess the validity of the experimental design and interpretation. In particular, it is unclear how conditioned media (CM) was prepared and what method was used to expose animals to it. If the liquid culture method on p. 29 was used to prepare CM, this likely makes much of the data in the paper uninterpretable. Because these cultures are grown for 7 days, they likely differ greatly in the number of animals as well as their population structure (relative numbers of different larval stages, dauers, and adults of various ages). These cultures are also susceptible to bacterial and fungal contamination and cause animals significant stress. As such, direct comparisons of the activity of CM from N2, him-5, and daf-22 CM is highly problematic, as any of the above could account for differences in its activity. Without knowing that CM was prepared from a defined number of animals of defined ages, it's impossible to draw conclusions about the basis for the differential effects of CM. The absence of any experiments with synthetic ascarosides compounds these concerns.</p><p>2. Statistics and data presentation. Not enough information is provided to understand how aldicarb sensitivity was statistically evaluated (it's particularly hard to understand the apparent significant differences in the results shown in 4C). Further, scatter plots need to be provided in place of the histograms shown in Figures1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and supplementary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors identify a fascinating and novel phenotype in hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (measured using aldicarb response) and locomotion behavior are altered by the presence of male <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors demonstrate that this change is due to pheromones released from males, and that exposure to males during development is temporally dependent. The authors also do a preliminary dissection of what pheromones mediate the phenotype, the sensory circuitry required for this phenotype, and some mechanistic analysis at the NMJ. While the work is appropriate in scope and would be exciting for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, a number of the major conclusions of the manuscript are hard to evaluate due to lack of important experimental and statistical methodology and a number of crucial experiments lacking rigorous controls.</p><p>1. Detailed descriptions of experimental methodology and statistical analyses are lacking for some of the most crucial experiments and thus a number of the major findings are not able to be evaluated in a rigorous manner.</p><p>Aldicarb assays – specifics on aldicarb plate is needed- &quot;Briefly,1 mM aldicarb was added to the NGM plate&quot;. Variability between aldicarb plates is common and often mentioned in <italic>C. elegans</italic> literature, thus specific details are needed to evaluate how plates were made and maintained, and controls need to be included for experiments in order to evaluate and compare results. Specific details on what values were compared using t-test for aldicarb assays is unclear and needs to be described (eg. on a single time point?).</p><p>Conditioned media experiments – This reviewer could find no method descriptions for conditioned media experiments- How was male and hermaphrodite conditioned media made and administered to worms? This is critical for many of the experiments and is especially important to know for male-conditioned media generated from non-him mutant strains (daf-22, N2, and TR389).</p><p>2. Appropriate controls are missing in many experiments or are shown in separate graphs making it hard for reviewers/readers to assess phenotypes compared to positive and negative controls, or to evaluate if mutant or transgenic worms have phenotypes in control conditions. Examples include Figure 2D-F, Figure 3C, Figure 4C-L, Figure 7A-E</p><p>3. The results in Figure 2 demonstrate temporal dependence, however, to conclude that L4 is the important stage (&quot;exposure of the male environment in the entire L4 stage is critical for modulation of the NMJ synaptic transmission in hermaphrodites&quot; &quot;male environment exposure at a critical period (the L4 stage) is required for the modulation of hermaphrodites NMJ cholinergic synaptic transmission.&quot;) would require exposure to male-conditioned media during only the L4 stage, as well as after larval development (adult only exposure to male-conditioned media). Some effects shown here could be explained by duration of exposure. An ANOVA should be performed to allow readers to compare between all timepoints for both herm and male conditioned media conditions.</p><p>4. For the figure and section &quot;Excitatory postsynaptic receptor clustering is increased in hermaphrodites exposed to the male environment&quot; – fluorescence intensity is not a good measure of synaptic structure or clustering. Additional markers beyond rab-3 (e.g. cla-1) are needed to evaluate presynaptic morphology and ideally pre and post synaptic clustering experiments would include quantification of the number or size of synaptic puncta.</p><p>5. The analysis of ascarosides in male vs herm conditioned media identifies a subset of &quot;modulator ascarosides&quot; and the genetic experiments suggest these may be responsible for the phenotype of male conditioned media. However, without testing the direct effect of the ascarosides on the phenotype, the wording of subsequent results and experiments throughout needs to be toned down (&quot;Thus, the modulator ascarosides cause increased postsynaptic receptor clustering at excitatory synapses in hermaphrodites.&quot;, &quot;These findings collectively indicate that the modulator ascarosides specifically promote accumulation of CaV2 calcium channel at excitatory cholinergic synapses, and the increased CaV2 calcium channel abundance account for the potentiated cholinergic synaptic transmission at NMJ.&quot;, etc). This is mentioned by the authors in discussion, but needs to be applied to the Results sections (&quot;Although we provided extensive genetic evidence, we have not experimentally confirmed that these specific ascarosides are sufficient to modulate hermaphrodite NMJ synaptic transmission.&quot;).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Qian et al., describes mechanisms how <italic>C. elegans</italic> male pheromones mediate sexually dimorphic impact on synaptic transmission at the NMJ and thus locomotive behaviors. First, the authors found that the male environment, which represents a male-conditioned medium, increases NMJ excitation and inhibition balance of hermaphrodites by specifically increasing cholinergic transmission but not GABAergic transmission, resulting in decreased locomotive activities in hermaphrodites. Then they identified a critical period (the L4 larval stage) required for modulation of the male-conditioned medium on NMJ synaptic transmission in hermaphrodites. Second, by performing candidate mutant test and LC-MS analysis, they identified chemical components in the male-conditioned medium, which are the medium-chain β-hydroxylated ascaroside pheromones. These pheromones appeared to be sensed by the AWB chemosensory neurons and transmitted via cGMP signaling. Finally, they showed that hermaphrodites exposed to the male-conditioned medium exhibit increased postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor clustering as well as increased presynaptic CaV2 calcium channel localization at NMJ.</p><p>Overall, I think this is a very interesting story, with novel findings and implications about the pheromone-mediated behavioral plasticity in this important model organism. There are a couple of places where I think the authors could fill gaps in the story that would make it more complete and logically compelling.</p><p>Several major points that need to addressed and improved include;</p><p>1. Authors should test whether chemically synthesized ascarosides, including at least C13 and C14, individually and in a mixture, recapitulate effects of the male-conditioned medium on aldicarb assay as well as electrophysiology experiment. Without these data, it is hard to assure that these pheromones mediate it.</p><p>2. Authors claimed that the AWB chemosensory neurons detect these pheromones and mediate effects of male-conditioned medium mainly by performing cell-ablation and mutant studies. Nowadays, it is quite common to do Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments using genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors, which make a solid conclusion that AWB neurons detect these pheromones.</p><p>3. Authors have not addressed or discussed at all why male affects hermaphrodite locomotion. Is mating efficiency or physiology such as egg-laying of hermaphrodites altered in the male environment?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Male pheromones modulate synaptic transmission at the <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromuscular junction in a sexually dimorphic manner&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Piali Sengupta (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor (Doug Portman), and also seen by previous reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers feel that your manuscript has been significantly improved by the inclusion of new data and clarification of some of technical points. However, there are several additional points that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined by Reviewer #2. In particular, please be sure to address each of the four major comments noted by Reviewer #2 in your resubmission. None of these require new experiments, but instead can be addressed by carrying out additional statistical tests and/or editing the text.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This revised manuscript is very exciting, and will be of interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have included many revisions and new experiments that make the revised manuscript rise to the level of publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in terms of rigor and novelty. There are a few changes that would further improve clarity on some experiments.</p><p>1. While the authors have included much more detail on statistical analysis and methods, it should be clearly stated exactly what comparison the p-values represent for aldicarb assays (eg. Figure 1b- all time points? One timepoint?).</p><p>2. Figure 2C. Please provide p-value comparing L4 out vs adult out.</p><p>3. The experiment in figure 4E appears to show the addition of ATR lowers aldicarb sensitivity and that light exposure rescues this. P-values comparing all conditions should be included. While ATR can impact behavior and does not necessarily take away from the finding, the wording should be altered to reflect if there are differences between the non-ATR controls and the ATR and ATR + light condition.</p><p>Pg 15 line 21 &quot;Hermaphrodites with activated AWB neurons during the L4 stage showed higher sensitivity to aldicarb than controls without blue light activation (Figure 4E).&quot;</p><p>This statement suggests that the final bar is higher than all control bars, which is not shown statistically.</p><p>4. In Figure 4D, it appears that the velocity of worms with AWB ablation is reduced in both the herm- and male-cond compared with no light controls. Please provide p-values comparing all conditions, and if the herm-cond AWB ablation is reduced compared with no light herm-cond, please alter the wording of the statement below to reflect this data.</p><p>&quot;Pg 15 line 14. Our data showed that AWB neurons ablation blocked the decreased velocity by the modulator ascarosides (Figure 4D).&quot;</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Although they could not perform the experiment with synthetic chemicals (this is very challenging and I accepted their explanation), the authors have addressed most of my concerns and improved the manuscript considerably.

One of them may play a significant role, or they could synergistically modulate hermaphrodites NMJ. Considering this possibility, together with the consideration of time and cost, we did not synthesize and test these b-hydroxylated mediumchain ascarosides.

The results in Figure 2 demonstrate temporal dependence, however, to conclude that L4 is the important stage (&quot;exposure of the male environment in the entire L4 stage is critical for modulation of the NMJ synaptic transmission in hermaphrodites&quot; &quot;male environment exposure at a critical period (the L4 stage) is required for the modulation of hermaphrodites NMJ cholinergic synaptic transmission.&quot;) would require exposure to male-conditioned media during only the L4 stage, as well as after larval development (adult only exposure to male-conditioned media). Some effects shown here could be explained by duration of exposure. An ANOVA should be performed to allow readers to compare between all timepoints for both herm and male conditioned media conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We added two additional temporal conditions in Figure 2: L4 out (get out of male-conditioned medium at L4 stage) and adult out (get out of the male-conditioned medium at the adult stage) (Figure 2A, 2C, and supplementary Figure 2E).

For the figure and section &quot;Excitatory postsynaptic receptor clustering is increased in hermaphrodites exposed to the male environment&quot; – fluorescence intensity is not a good measure of synaptic structure or clustering.

The analysis of ascarosides in male vs herm conditioned media identifies a subset of &quot;modulator ascarosides&quot; and the genetic experiments suggest these may be responsible for the phenotype of male conditioned media.

First, the authors found that the male environment, which represents a male-conditioned medium, increases NMJ excitation and inhibition balance of hermaphrodites by specifically increasing cholinergic transmission but not GABAergic transmission, resulting in decreased locomotive activities in hermaphrodites. Then they identified a critical period (the L4 larval stage) required for modulation of the male-conditioned medium on NMJ synaptic transmission in hermaphrodites. Second, by performing candidate mutant test and LC-MS analysis, they identified chemical components in the male-conditioned medium, which are the medium-chain β-hydroxylated ascaroside pheromones. These pheromones appeared to be sensed by the AWB chemosensory neurons and transmitted via cGMP signaling. Finally, they showed that hermaphrodites exposed to the male-conditioned medium exhibit increased postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor clustering as well as increased presynaptic CaV2 calcium channel localization at NMJ.</p><p>Overall, I think this is a very interesting story, with novel findings and implications about the pheromone-mediated behavioral plasticity in this important model organism. There are a couple of places where I think the authors could fill gaps in the story that would make it more complete and logically compelling.</p><p>Several major points that need to addressed and improved include;</p><p>1. Authors should test whether chemically synthesized ascarosides, including at least C13 and C14, individually and in a mixture, recapitulate effects of the male-conditioned medium on aldicarb assay as well as electrophysiology experiment. Without these data, it is hard to assure that these pheromones mediate it.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that successful identification of the specific ascarosides will significantly improve the paper. However, our current data only support that the b-hydroxylated medium-chain ascarosides, such as the C13, C14, and C15, are the potential modulator pheromones. One of them may play a significant role, or they could synergistically modulate hermaphrodites NMJ. Considering this possibility, together with the consideration of time and cost, we did not synthesize and test these b-hydroxylated mediumchain ascarosides. We hope the reviewer could agree with us, and we will try to work on it in our future paper.</p><p>We revised our results and conclusion to a weaker statement.
