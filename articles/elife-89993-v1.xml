function and guide enduring plasticity. Neuronal activation promotes expression of an immediate early gene (IEG) program comprised primarily of activity-dependent transcription factors, which are thought to regulate a second set of late response genes (LRGs). However, while the mechanisms governing IEG activation have been well studied, the molecular interplay between IEGs and LRGs remain poorly characterized. Here, we used transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to define activity-driven responses in rat striatal neurons. As expected, neuronal depolarization generated robust changes in gene expression, with early changes (1 hr) enriched for inducible transcription factors and later changes (4 hr) enriched for neuropeptides, synaptic proteins, and ion channels. Remarkably, while depolarization did not induce chromatin remodeling after 1 hr, we found broad increases in chromatin accessibility at thousands of sites in the genome at 4 hr after neuronal stimulation. These putative regulatory elements were found almost exclusively at non-coding regions of the genome, and harbored consensus motifs for numerous activity-dependent transcription factors such as AP-1. Furthermore, blocking protein synthesis prevented activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, suggesting that IEG proteins are required for this process. Targeted analysis of LRG loci identified a putative enhancer upstream of <italic>Pdyn</italic> (prodynorphin), a gene encoding an opioid neuropeptide implicated in motivated behavior and neuropsychiatric disease states. CRISPR-based functional assays demonstrated that this enhancer is both necessary and sufficient for <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription. This regulatory element is also conserved at the human <italic>PDYN</italic> locus, where its activation is sufficient to drive <italic>PDYN</italic> transcription in human cells. These results suggest that IEGs participate in chromatin remodeling at enhancers and identify a conserved enhancer that may act as a therapeutic target for brain disorders involving dysregulation of <italic>Pdyn</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>enhancer</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1DA039650</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA053743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA054714</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH114990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32NS061788</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of activity-dependent transcriptional changes in striatal neurons reveals a conserved functional enhancer for prodynorphin.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Experience-dependent cellular adaptations within the brain circuits that control motivated behaviors are critical for learning, memory, and long-term behavioral change. In psychiatric disorders such as drug addiction, these cellular changes are hijacked to drive maladaptive behavioral changes that promote drug seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mews et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adinoff, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, mutations that alter the function of activity-dependent transcription factors have been implicated in a host of neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ebert and Greenberg, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Adaptations to novel stimuli are regulated by temporally and functionally distinct activity-dependent transcriptional programs. For example, various forms of neuronal activation result in the rapid induction of immediate early genes (IEGs), including transcription factors such as <italic>Fos</italic> (aka c-Fos), <italic>Npas4</italic>, and <italic>Nr4a2</italic>. These genes follow a temporally dynamic profile, with elevated expression within 1 hr of a stimulus and rapid return to baseline levels. In contrast, the same stimuli promote expression of a more delayed gene expression program, termed late response genes (LRGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>). This set of genes includes kinases, neurotrophic factors, and neurotransmitter receptors. Current models of activity-dependent gene expression suggest that these distinct transcriptional waves work together to promote enduring cellular and behavioral adaptations.</p><p>While genes within the IEG expression program are required for cellular and behavioral changes following stimulation, the exact mechanisms by which they contribute to LRG expression and the functional consequences of this process remain poorly characterized. Recent evidence suggests that chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers is a key event linking LRGs to IEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Su et al., 2017</xref>). In non-neuronal systems, AP-1, an activity-dependent transcription factor consisting of <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Jun</italic> family members, directly contributes to chromatin remodeling at LRG enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>). However, despite ample evidence for activity-dependent transcription of AP-1 members in multiple brain regions and cell types, understanding the nature and functional consequences of LRG induction remains a challenge for several reasons. First, emerging evidence has revealed that different classes of neurons induce distinct LRG programs in response to the same neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spiegel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roethler et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallegos et al., 2022</xref>). Second, different types of stimuli may give rise to non-overlapping constellations of IEG transcription factors, which could promote activation of distinct LRGs to tune neuronal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, even where chromatin remodeling has been identified at candidate enhancers near LRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2014</xref>), the consequences of this remodeling have not been concretely linked to transcriptional activation of candidate LRGs.</p><p>Here, we used next-generation sequencing approaches to characterize temporally distinct, activity-dependent transcriptomic and epigenomic reorganization in cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons, an in vitro model containing many cell types implicated in learning, motivation, reward, and substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Savell et al., 2020</xref>). These experiments comprehensively characterized activity-responsive genes in both the IEG and LRG expression programs in striatal neurons, and revealed a temporal decoupling between IEG activation and activity-dependent chromatin remodeling. Further functional studies suggest that translation of IEGs is necessary for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, and that sites of chromatin opening are enriched for AP-1 transcription factor motifs. Combining transcriptional and epigenomic profiling allowed us to identify a putative enhancer upstream of the prodynorphin (<italic>Pdyn</italic>) gene locus that is conserved in the human genome. CRISPR-based activation and repression experiments provided functional validation that this region serves as a <italic>Pdyn</italic> enhancer in both rat neurons and dividing human cell lines. Collectively, these results highlight the mechanisms through which neuronal activity promotes gene expression changes to modify neuronal function, and have relevance for brain disease states characterized by alterations to this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of temporally and functionally distinct transcriptional programs following neuronal depolarization</title><p>Activity-dependent transcriptomic and epigenomic reorganization has been heavily implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as drug addiction. Previously, our laboratory established cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons as an in vitro model for studying activity-dependent processes as these cultures contain the same cell types affected by drugs of abuse in the rat ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Savell et al., 2020</xref>). To characterize IEG and LRG expression programs in this model system, we performed RNA-seq following neuronal depolarization with 10 mM KCl for 1 or 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Following 1 hr of depolarization, we identified 207 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; defined as genes with an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 and |log2FoldChange| &gt; 0.5). Notably, ~75% of these genes were upregulated by KCl, including activity-dependent transcription factors such as <italic>Npas4</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Fosb</italic>, <italic>Fosl2</italic>, and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, 4 hr of depolarization resulted in significant transcriptomic reorganization, with 1680 genes identified as DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). DEGs upregulated by KCl at this timepoint included the opioid propeptide <italic>Pdyn</italic>, as well as the voltage-gated potassium channel <italic>Kcnf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Interestingly, overlap between 1 hr DEGs (putative IEGs) and 4 hr DEGs (putative LRGs) primarily occurred when IEGs such as <italic>Fos</italic> were upregulated at both 1 and 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

While not in the top 10 cellular component GO terms, âNucleusâ, âNucleoplasmâ, and âTranscription regulatory complexâ are also significantly enriched in the 4 hr DEGs. However, 4 hr DEGs, or LRGs, were also enriched for cellular component terms such as âSynapseâ and âNeuron projectionâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), suggesting that these DEGs encode proteins required for cellular adaptations to stimulation. Molecular function GO term analysis found overlap between IEGs and LRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>), with both IEG-specific and overlapping molecular function GO terms including transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, LRG molecular function GO terms were distinct and included âvoltage gated channel activityâ and âG-protein-coupled receptor bindingâ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that striatal neuron depolarization induces temporally and functionally distinct gene expression programs that can be classified as IEGs and LRGs.</p><p>Given that most LRGs emerged only after 4 hr of KCl depolarization, we next sought to determine whether this was due to the length of the depolarization stimulus or the time since stimulus onset. Striatal neurons were again treated with 10 mM KCl for 1 hr, followed by either a media wash off (replacement with conditioned media) or no wash off for 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1d</xref>). Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for a representative IEG (<italic>Fos</italic>) and a representative LRG (<italic>Pdyn</italic>) revealed that while <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA began to return to baseline in the wash off (1 hr stimulation) condition, <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA was equally elevated in response to 1 hr KCl (followed by 3 hr wash off) and 4 hr KCl stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1e, f</xref>). Additionally, we found that both <italic>Fos</italic> and <italic>Pdyn</italic> expression were significantly elevated by 4 hr treatment with a variety of other stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g, h</xref>), including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and forskolin (FSK, an adenylyl cyclase activator). Moreover, the overall level of <italic>Pdyn</italic> mRNA was correlated with the level of <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA across individual replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1i</xref>), suggesting a direct link between IEGs and LRGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activity-dependent chromatin remodeling primarily occurs in non-coding genomic regions</title><p>In non-neuronal systems, LRG induction is dependent on activity-dependent chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>). To identify the potential mechanisms governing transcriptomic reorganization following 4 hr of depolarization, we first sought to identify whether activity-dependent chromatin remodeling occurs in striatal neurons. Cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons were treated with 10 mM KCl for 1 or 4 hr and assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by next-generation sequencing (ATAC-seq) libraries were prepared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Strikingly, 1 hr of depolarization did not induce any chromatin remodeling that passed genome-wide cutoffs for statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). However, 4 hr of depolarization-induced genome-wide chromatin remodeling with 5312 differentially accessible regions (DARs, defined as regions with adjusted p-value &lt;0.05), all of which become more open with depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

To understand whether activity-dependent chromatin remodeling preferentially occurred in non-coding genomic regions, we calculated the odds ratio of enrichment for all 4 hr DARs in comparison to baseline peaks identified in vehicle treated samples that did not overlap 4 hr DARs (termed âvehicleâ peaks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Activity-regulated DARs were depleted in coding regions and promoters, but were enriched in intergenic and intronic regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

To test if this enhancer is sufficient for upregulation of <italic>PDYN</italic> transcription in human cells, we transfected HEK-293T cells with plasmids to express dCas9-VPR machinery and sgRNAs targeting the conserved region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). Transcriptional activation of the conserved DAR was sufficient to upregulate human <italic>PDYN</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7h</xref>).

These experiments characterized a well-studied IEG expression program, which consisted primarily of activity-dependent transcription factors, as well as a delayed LRG expression program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1aâc</xref>). While IEGs are required for cellular and behavioral adaptations, they control this process through the transcriptional regulation of LRGs. LRGs are both functionally and temporally distinct from IEGs. IEGs primarily encode transcription factors and co-activators, while LRGs encode opioid peptides, transporters, and other proteins involved in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>). For example, FOS regulates transcriptional activation of the LRG <italic>Scg2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yap et al., 2021</xref>), a gene that encodes several neuropeptides that regulate inhibitory plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Iwase et al., 2014</xref>). IEGs, such as <italic>Fos</italic>, may regulate LRGs by their involvement in activity-dependent chromatin remodeling, as <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA induction is required for activity-dependent chromatin remodeling in dentate gyrus following neuronal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Our results highlight how this process modulates the expression of prodyorphin, a neuropeptide with critical functions in the striatum. Furthermore, our work defines the dynamic nature of activity-dependent chromatin accessibility changes in striatal neurons using comprehensive approaches.</p><p>Surprisingly, analysis of both transcriptomic and epigenomic data revealed a temporal decoupling between transcriptional activation of IEGs and chromatin remodeling. While 1 hr of depolarization was sufficient to induce hundreds of transcriptional changes, genome-wide chromatin remodeling was only observed following 4 hr of depolarization. This result contrasts with previously published studies that observed genome-wide chromatin remodeling in the mouse dentate gyrus following 1 hr of electroconvulsive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Su et al., 2017</xref>), or in hippocampal excitatory neurons following seizure induction with kainic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez-Albert et al., 2019</xref>). Differences in the temporal dynamics of activity dependent chromatin remodeling could be due to differences in both the cell type of interest (hippocampal vs. striatal neurons), as well as the type of stimulation (e.g., electroconvulsive stimulation vs. depolarization). Nevertheless, our studies agree in that a significant proportion of regions undergoing remodeling become more accessible following stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). While it is known that IEGs engage in activity-dependent chromatin remodeling at LRGs in other brain regions and cell types, this process has seldom been studied in an addiction-relevant cell type such as striatal neurons. Additionally, drugs of abuse engage IEGs in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Savell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertran-Gonzalez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guez-Barber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hope et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graybiel et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moratalla et al., 1993</xref>), and interference with IEG induction prevents subsequent cellular and behavioral adaptations caused by psychoactive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kelz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlezon et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, investigation of IEG-dependent chromatin remodeling at enhancers regulating addiction-relevant LRGs is important for understanding how rapid gene expression changes might result in persistent cellular and behavioral adaptations.</p><p>The accepted model of activity-dependent transcription posits that LRG activation is dependent on IEGs. To this point, blocking <italic>Fos</italic> mRNA induction via shRNA in the dentate gyrus is sufficient to significantly attenuate activity-dependent chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Su et al., 2017</xref>). These data demonstrate that <italic>Fos</italic> is required for some level of chromatin remodeling in the brain but does not provide evidence regarding the mechanisms through which it is involved. In non-neuronal cells, AP-1 acts as a pioneer factor at genomic enhancers by guiding the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex to target regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wolf et al., 2023</xref>). Our data suggest a similar mechanism may regulate activity-dependent chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers in neurons. First, AP-1 motifs and ÎFosB-binding sites are significantly enriched within 4 hr DARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3bâd</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1e</xref>). Second, blocking translation of IEGs, which include a significant number of AP-1 family members, completely blocks activity-dependent chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c, d</xref>). Thus, we speculatively propose a model in which neuronal stimulation results in the transcription and translation of AP-1 family members. These AP-1 family members then interact with the SWI/SNF complex to induce chromatin remodeling at genomic enhancers. However, while AP-1 is thought to aid in enhancer selection, it is expressed in a non-cell type-specific manner and must choose from over 1 million potential AP-1 motifs in the genome. Thus, additional factors must be present to ensure precise cell type-specific responses to activity. The use of the HOMER database allowed us to explore the enrichment of over 400 additional transcription factor motifs, including ISL1, an MSN-selective transcription factor. ISL1 is significantly enriched in DARs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c, d</xref>). The combined enrichment of AP-1 and ISL1 at 4 hr DARs suggests that cell type-specific transcription factors may be working in conjunction with activity-dependent transcription factors to induce chromatin remodeling. We envision three possible mechanisms through which cell type-specific transcription factors may be involved in this process. First, population-specific transcription factors may be directly interacting with AP-1 or chromatin remodeling complexes to induce remodeling at these sites. Second, ISL1 may stochastically bind these regions, resulting in specific temporal windows in which AP-1 might bind in a cooperative fashion. Finally, because cell type-specific transcription factors are often activated during development, they may epigenetically alter potential binding sites proximal to AP-1 motifs, resulting in a preferential targeting of these AP-1 motifs at later timepoints. Any of these mechanisms would allow distinct cell types to induce specific LRG programs, even with homogenous IEG activation, and ultimately enable the same stimulus to produce different cellular adaptations in different cell types.</p><p>Multiple studies have demonstrated that most regions undergoing activity-dependent chromatin remodeling are genomic enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2014</xref>). Analysis of 4 hr DARs from this study identified a significant enrichment for DARs in non-coding regions and a depletion in coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d, e</xref>), suggesting that activity-dependent chromatin remodeling in striatal neurons is also occurring at genomic enhancers. These data also demonstrate a distinction between the chromatin profiles of IEG and LRG enhancers. IEG enhancers are âpoisedâ at baseline, while LRG enhancers are largely inaccessible in without stimulation. For example, enhancers within the <italic>Fos</italic> locus are accessible in both vehicle- and KCl-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), while the <italic>Pdyn</italic> enhancer is only accessible with neuronal depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In addition, LRG enhancers contain motifs for activity-dependent transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3aâe</xref>) and are dependent on de novo protein translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c, d</xref>). While LRG enhancers become accessible only with activity, both IEG and LRG enhancers are in non-coding regions of the genome and are marked by specific histone modifications like H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carullo and Day, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carullo et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>While the enrichment of DARs in putative enhancer elements is intriguing, we also wanted to understand whether enhancers regulate nearby LRGs. To do this, we identified a DAR upstream of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> TSS that may serve as a functional enhancer. This region is also accessible in the adult rat NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). Furthermore, this region is co-accessible with the <italic>Pdyn</italic> promoter and has the highest level of accessibility in Drd1- and Grm8-MSNs, suggesting that the enhancer is functional in vivo and may exhibit some level of cell type specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>). However, a larger dataset containing more nuclei will be needed to test for any drug-specific chromatin remodeling at this region. CRISPR-based functional assays demonstrated that the DAR upstream of the <italic>Pdyn</italic> TSS serves as a genomic enhancer that is necessary, sufficient, and specific for transcription of <italic>Pdyn</italic>. We were particularly interested in <italic>Pdyn</italic> because it encodes the dynorphin neuropeptides that are agonists for the kappa opioid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chavkin et al., 1982</xref>). The kappa opioid receptor system has been the target of several antagonists that reduce drug-taking behaviors in pre-clinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prisinzano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zamarripa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavkin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Valenza et al., 2020</xref>). Identification of a novel genomic enhancer for <italic>Pdyn</italic> would represent a novel therapeutic target. Furthermore, <italic>Pdyn</italic> is regulated by dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke et al., 1998</xref>) and drugs of abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlezon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jenab et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corchero et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piechota et al., 2012</xref>), and polymorphisms and structural variants within the human <italic>PDYN</italic> gene locus are associated with drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yuferov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, one polymorphism affects an AP-1-binding site within the <italic>PDYN</italic> gene promoter, which may result in less <italic>PDYN</italic> transcription and an increased risk for cocaine dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yuferov et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the identification of a functional, conserved enhancer for <italic>PDYN</italic> in the human genome provides a novel potential therapeutic target capable of regulating stimulus-dependent changes in <italic>PDYN</italic> expression while leaving constitutive expression patterns unaltered. Future experiments should investigate whether this conserved enhancer element mediates reward-related behaviors and cellular adaptations.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified and characterized temporally distinct waves of transcription and chromatin remodeling in striatal neurons.

Targeted analysis of LRG loci identified a genomic enhancer that is necessary, sufficient, and specific for <italic>Pdyn</italic> transcription. This enhancer is conserved in the human genome and represents a novel therapeutic target for modulation of the kappa opioid receptor system. Continued functional validation of putative enhancer regions within this dataset may provide additional therapeutic targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male or female adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Hartford CT) were co-housed in pairs in plastic filtered cages with nesting enrichment in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-approved animal care facility maintained between 23 and 24Â°C on a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle with ad libitum food (Lab Diet Irradiated rat chow) and water.

BigWig files were generated with deeptools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">RamÃ­rez et al., 2016</xref>) (v3.5.1). QC metrics were collected and reviewed with MultiQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ewels et al., 2016</xref>) (v1.11). For ATAC-seq libraries from cultured rat embryonic striatal neurons, peaks were called using MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) (v 2.1.1.20160309) callpeak with options - -qvalue 0.01 - -gsize 2626580772 - -format BAMPE. Differential accessibility analysis was performed with Diffbind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ross-Innes et al., 2012</xref>) (v3.8.4). DARs were defined as regions with an adjusted p-value &lt;0.05. Reads within peaks were counted using the dba.count() function with options bParallel = TRUE, summits = 250, bUseSummarizeOverlaps = TRUE, and score = DBA_SCORE_TMM_READS_FULL_CPM. Motif enrichment was investigated using HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>) (v4.11.1) findMotifsGenome.pl. Motif enrichment was calculated by dividing the total number of motifs identified within a defined bin and then dividing by the bin size (50 bp). This number was further divided by the peak set size (5312). This normalization ensures histograms can be compared even when generated with different bin sizes or peak sets with a significantly higher or lower number of peaks included. Dimensionality reduction of motif enrichment across all DARs was conducted using the umap package in R (v2.10.0) to calculate 10 UMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) components with custom options min_dist = 1e-250, n_neighbors = 30, and n_components = 10. UMAP values were used to cluster points with the hdbscan() function of the dbscan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hahsler et al., 2019</xref>) package (v1.1â11) with minPts = 150.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pseudotime</title><p>Pseudotime calculations were performed using Monocle v3_1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2019</xref>) and Seurat v4.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). A Seurat object containing Drd1-MSNs from male and female adult Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single cocaine injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>) was subject to the standard dimensionality reduction and clustering workflow using 17 principal components and a resolution value of 0.2. Annotation, counts metadata, and cell barcode information were extracted from the Seurat object and reconstructed into a Monocle v3 cds object using new_cell_data_set(). Rather than reclustering, the UMAP coordinates were extracted from the Seurat object and added to the Monocle object. The trajectory graph was created using learn_graph() and the root cell was chosen in the âinactivatedâ population that expressed <italic>Drd1</italic> and <italic>Htr4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>).

Dynamically expressed genes were found using findDynGenes(), and a p-value threshold of 0.05 was used to filter for significance. Transcription factors for <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> were downloaded from AnimalTFDB4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2023</xref>) used to construct an initial static network using reconstructGRN(). Epoch uses a Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) model to infer relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and transcription targets (TGs) using transcriptomic information and calculated pseudotime values. A process which Epoch terms as âcrossweightingâ was then performed to filter out indirect relationships or non-logical connections. Next, a dynamic network was extracted by fractionating the <italic>Drd1</italic> cells by âepochsâ, which is based on pseudotime. TFâTG relationships were ranked using PageRank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brin and Page, 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-nucleus dissociation</title><p>Flash-frozen NAc tissue was added to a tube containing 500 Î¼l lysis buffer (1 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.4, 1 mM NAc, 0.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01% Tween-20, 0.01% Igepal in nuclease-free water, 0.001% Digitonin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]), homogenized using a motorized homogenizer and RNase-free pestle, and incubated on ice for 5 min. Samples were then pipette mixed 15Ã and incubated on ice for an additional 10 min. Following lysis, four samples from same sex and treatment were grouped into a single sample, and 2 ml chilled wash buffer (10 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NACl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20) was added. Samples were then passed through 70 and 40 Î¼M Scienceware Flowmi Cell Strainers. Samples were then centrifuged at 250 rcf for 5 min at 4Â°C. Supernatant was removed and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of chilled wash buffer (10 mM TrisâHCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NACl, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20). 100 Î¼l of sample was then stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D and used to set a representative gate for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This gate was then used to purify nuclei further. Following FACS, samples were spun at 250 rcf for 10 min at 4Â°C to remove any remaining debris. Samples were then loaded into individual wells of the Chromium NextGem Single Cell Chip using four of the eight available wells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>snATAC-seq alignment and object construction</title><p>10Ã Genomics snATAC-seq libraries were generated from male and female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed injected with 20 mg/kg cocaine (or saline control) once daily for 7 days. snATAC-seq data were aligned to the mRatBN7.2/Rn7 reference assembly using cellranger-atac v2.1.0 and the procedure outlined by 10Ã Genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Satpathy et al., 2019</xref>). Analysis of the cellranger-atac output was analyzed using Signac v1.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stuart et al., 2021</xref>) and Seurat v4.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hao et al., 2021</xref>).

The groups were then merged into one object based on a common set of features and the standard Signac dimensionality reduction and clustering workflow was performed using 2:30 dimensions and a resolution value of 0.2. Data were then integrated with the snRNA-seq data from the same samples. Common anchors between the two were used to predict and label the cell types present in the snATAC-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Co-accessibility analysis</title><p>Detection of cis-coaccessible sites in the snATAC-seq data was performed using Cicero v1.3.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pliner et al., 2018</xref>) and Monocle v3_1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). The finalized snATAC-seq Seurat object was first converted into a Monocle3 cds object and then converted into a Cicero object.

The authors compare 1hr and 4hr transcriptomes to see both rapid and late response genes. When they look at ATAC-seq data they see no changes in accessibility at 1hr but strong changes at 4hr. The differentially accessible sites were enriched for the AP-1 site, suggesting regulation by Fos-Jun family members, and consistent with the requirement for IEG expression, anisomycin blocked the increase in accessibility. To test the functional importance of this regulation the authors focus on a putative enhancer 45kb upstream of the activity-induced gene encoding the neuromodulator dynorphin (Pdyn). To test the function of this region, the authors recruited CRISPRi to the site, which blocked KCL-dependent Pdyn induction, or CRISPRa, which selectively increased Pdyn expression in the absence of KCl. Finally the authors reanalyze other human and rat datasets to show cell-type specific function of this enhancer correlated to Pdyn expression.</p><p>The idea that stimuli that induce expression of Fos in neurons can change accessibility of regulatory elements bound from Fos has been shown before, but almost all the data are from hippocampal neurons so it is nice to see the different cell type used here. The most interesting part of the study is the identification of the Pdyn enhancer because of the importance of this gene product in the function of striatal neurons. Overall the conclusions appear to be well supported by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89993.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study aims to characterize transcriptional and epigenetic activity-dependent striatal neuronal adaptations using rat primary cultures, a model still poorly characterized up to date. In addition, the authors aim to interrogate regulatory mechanisms that could modulate the expression of a highly-striatal enriched gene responding to neuronal activation in striatal neuronal cells, the Pdyn gene.</p><p>Among the major strengths of the article there is the generation of high quality neuronal RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data in rat striatal neuronal cells in basal level and upon neuronal activity, a experimental setup that has not been so characterized as other more common ones such as mouse hippocampal neuronal cells. In this model, the authors clearly demonstrate the need of protein translation to induce the transcriptional waves of late response genes. In addition, the functional characterization of an enhancer of the Pdyn gene might be of great interest for translational applications in which alterations of this gene might be occurring in neurological disorders.</p><p>On the other hand, the manuscript presents some limitations to be considered. One of the major points in this regard is that, at least in part, some of the conclusions reached by the study related to the induction of particular transcriptional programs upon neuronal activation, the changes in chromatin state, and the need of protein translation for proper induction of LRGs have been already previously described in the literature, affecting the novelty of the study. However, it is needed to be mentioned, that these previous studies were not conducted using the same model (rat striatal neurons), which can make some differences in the final outputs. The other major cautionary point in the study is the selection of the time point for distinguishing early versus late response genes, as the short difference in time and the overlap of part of the transcriptional signature between them suggest that the transcriptional waves are somehow partially overlapping (also probably in part because of the recurrent stimulation of the primary cultures with KCl), which could result in missing part of the late-response genes.</p><p>Despite this, the conclusions raised in the study are well supported by the data generated in it.</p><p>In summary, the study presents a useful set of transcriptomic and epigenomic data of activity-dependent striatal neuronal programs in rats, which will be of great use for the scientific community working in this not so well characterized model. In addition, the characterization of a Pdyn distal regulatory genomic region involved in its transcriptional regulation, both at basal levels and upon neuronal activation in this particular system, can present translational relevance for striatal disorders such as Huntington's disease or other neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89993.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This work contributes to the literature characterizing early and late waves of transcription and associated chromatin remodeling following neuronal depolarization, here in cultured embryonic striatum. While they find IEG transcription 1 h after depolarization, they find chromatin remodeling is slower (opening at the 4 h time point). While this is not the first paper to describe chromatin changes in response to neuronal activity, this paper ties previous findings all together in one place using novel sequencing analyses and visualizations. Previous work has found remodeling occurring at the 1 h time point, so the lack of differences at that early time point in the current study needs to be better understood and the &quot;temporal decoupling&quot; described by authors should be further explored. Differences may be due to chromatin at IEG regulatory regions already being open in embryonic tissue (here) vs generally more closed in adult tissue (previous), or due to previous studies using protocols to specifically silence neurons prior to activation. The authors next show that the chromatin remodeling that occurs at the late (4 h) stage is largely in putative regulatory regions of the genome (rather than gene bodies), and is dependent on translation, which validates and extends the prior literature. The authors then transition from genome-wide basic neuroscience to focus on a specific gene of interest, prodynorphin (Pdyn), and a putative enhancer they identify from their chromatin analysis. They target CRISPR-activating and -inhibiting complexes to the putative enhancer and demonstrate that accessibility of this locus is necessary and sufficient for Pdyn transcription. They then show that at least one PDYN enhancer is conserved from rodents to humans, and is only activity-regulated in human GABAergic but not glutamatergic neurons. Finally, the authors generate snATAC-seq and show Pdyn gene and enhancer activity is also cell-type-specific in rat striatum.

Our specific responses to individual reviewer comments are provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>Public review</p><p>Weaknesses: The timing and the location of the accessibility changes are meaningfully different from other similar studies, which should be discussed. The authors provide good data for the function of a single enhancer near Pdyn, but could contextualize this with respect to other regulatory elements nearby.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have expanded our discussion of the differences between chromatin accessibility changes observed in this study and those found in prior reports in different systems. These differences are also addressed in extended detail below. Unfortunately, limitations on resources and time prevented a deeper exploration of additional candidate enhancers near the Pdyn locus. However, we believe our efforts to characterize an activity-dependent enhancer in the Pdyn locus provides a useful starting point, and future studies may seek to more completely define the contributions of nearby regulatory elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations For The Authors</p><p>1. At 1hr after stimulation in previous papers (Su 2017 which is reference #8 of FernandezAlbert Nat Neurosci. 2019 October ; 22(10): 1718-1730.) there are large increases in accessibility directly over the IEGs, consistent with the concerted transcription of these genes following stimulation. It is surprising that the authors do not see this here, either at 1hr or at 4hr. This difference in results needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this discrepancy to our attention. Indeed, Su et al. 2017 and Fernandez-Albert et al. 2019 both describe increases in chromatin accessibility at IEG promoters. There are several experimental differences that could be contributing to differences between our study and previously published studies. Two major reasons include the developmental timepoint of the tissue/cells and the cell type/brain region that is being assayed. Su et al. assayed chromatin accessibility in ex vivo slices containing the dentate gyrus from adult mice, while Fernandez-Albert et al. assayed chromatin accessibility in forebrain principal neurons of adult mice following kainic acid injection. Bulk ATAC-Seq experiments described in the present manuscript were generated from cultured embryonic rat striatal neurons. Additionally, baseline chromatin accessibility seems to be significantly different between forebrain principal neurons studied in Fernandez-Albert et al. 2019 and the current study. For example, in Figure 3a of Fernandez-Albert et al. 2019, the Npas4 gene body is not accessible in a saline treated animal. In vehicle treated, cultured embryonic rat striatal neurons, the Fos gene body and associated enhancers are accessible at baseline (Fig. S3), and do not increase with KCl depolarization.</p><p>We have expanded our discussion of this discrepancy in the discussion section of the revised manuscript, and included additional citations addressing this difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is also somewhat surprising that the authors see almost no regions that show changes in accessibility at 1hr and then a very large number of differentially accessible regions at 4hr. This is quite different from the more rapid changes shown for example in Figure 7f in the human GABA neurons even though these are also studies in culture with rapid calcium channel opening. Can the authors speculate on the reason for the difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Many previously published studies that use cultured neurons include a pre-treatment in which spontaneous neuronal activity is inhibited with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (SanchezPriego et al. Cell Reports, 2022; Kim et al. Nature, 2010; Malik et al. Nature Neuroscience, 2014). The Sanchez-Priego et al. Cell Reports manuscript also blocked NMDA receptor activity with the competitive NMDAR antagonist D-AP5 for 12 hours prior to depolarization. Rapid changes in chromatin accessibility observed in other studies at &lt;1 hour timepoints could be due to prior silencing of the cells and subsequent reduction in the accessibility and transcriptional activity of IEGs. Decreased baseline accessibility and transcriptional activity of IEGs can be observed in Figure 1a of Malik et al. 2014, which displays ChIP-Seq tracks for both RNA pol II and H3K27ac. At baseline, H3K27ac and RNA pol II enrichment is low throughout the Fos locus. Subsequent depolarization of silenced neurons drives accessibility and transcription of the Fos gene and associated enhancers. In contrast, we found accessible chromatin at Fos enhancer elements at baseline (without stimulation; Fig. S3).</p><p>The experiments described in the current study do not include any pre-treatment with tetrodotoxin or D-AP5, and thus the neurons are expected to be spontaneously active. This baseline electrophysiological activity may result in increased accessibility and transcription at IEG loci, which ultimately makes it difficult to identify activity-dependent increases in IEG accessibility at timepoints &lt;1 hour. Furthermore, a previously published manuscript from our lab (Carullo et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 2020) conducted ATAC-seq on cultured embryonic rat cortical, hippocampal, and striatal neurons and found that transcribed enhancers for IEG loci (including Fos) had decreased chromatin accessibility following depolarization when compared to vehicle treatment. These differences in experimental design (including cell type, model organism, developmental timepoint, and treatment paradigm) may all contribute to differences in the temporal dynamics of chromatin remodeling between the current manuscript and previously published studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Experimentally it can be challenging to repress a single enhancer and show a significant effect on gene regulation which makes the repression in Fig 6c somewhat unexpected. There are several regions near Pdyn that show activity-dependent changes in accessibility in the human cells (Fig. 7e) and presumably in the rat neurons too (Fig. 5a shows a few but most of the intervening region is cut out). Did the authors target any of these other regions?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the identified regulatory element upstream of the Pdyn TSS because it met several criteria that we determined are important for characterizing LRG enhancers. These criteria are outlined in the Results: â(1) located in non-coding regions of the genome, (2) inaccessible at baseline and accessible following depolarization, and (3) inaccessible when depolarization was paired with protein synthesis inhibition.â Indeed, ATAC-seq experiments presented in the current study demonstrate that thousands of genomic regions undergo reprogramming, and many of these regions meet these criteria (including additional loci near Pdyn). However, we lacked the time and resources to systematically investigate all other enhancers, and did not target any other regions within the Pdyn locus. While many enhancers may regulate a single gene, the identified enhancer seems to be particularly important for activity-dependent Pdyn gene expression. Importantly, CRISPRi-based repression of this enhancer (Fig. 6c) did not reduce basal Pdyn expression as compared to a non-targeting control, but completely blocked stimulus-dependent induction of Pdyn transcription. We believe this is a useful starting point, and future studies may seek to more completely define the contributions of nearby regulatory elements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors should clarify in the methods or figure legends the number of independent replicate libraries for each experiment and were the RNA and ATAC libraries made from the same or different experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have clarified the number of replicates in the methods as outlined below. Additionally, RNA and ATAC libraries were generated from different experiments, and this information is also now included in the methods.</p><p>Within the ATAC-Seq library preparation and analysis methods section: âATAC-seq libraries were generated from experiments independent of the RNA-seq experiments.

Syst. Biol., 2022; and also reviewed by Yap and Greenberg, Neuron, 2018). In addition, it is not so obvious why to focus on Pdyn gene regulatory regions among the thousands of genes upregulated and with modified chromatin landscape after neuronal activation. The authors highlight three particular traits of this gene as the reason to choose it, but those traits are probably shared by most of the genes that are part of the LRGs set.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments, and have included these important publications as citations in our manuscript. With over 5,000 differentially accessible chromatin regions following KCl stimulation, it was not possible to follow up on all regulatory regions or linked genes in a rigorous way. Therefore, we selected a target candidate enhancer near the Pdyn locus for mechanistic studies. In addition to the criteria highlighted in the manuscript, we chose this locus due to decades of literature establishing the importance of prodynorphin in the striatum, and the role of this gene in human neuropsychiatric diseases. We would argue that this increases the relevance of more detailed exploration of this gene, and makes our results applicable to a broader pre-existing literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the methodological level, some attention should be put into the timings chosen for generating the data. The authors claim that these time points (1h and 4hrs) identify the first (i.e IEGs) and second (i.e LRGs) waves of transcription. However, at 4hrs the highest over-expressed genes are still IEGs, as shown in the volcano plots of Figure 1B and 1C, showing a high overlap with up-regulated genes found at 1h (Figure 1D). This might suggest that the 4hrs time point is somewhere in between the first and second wave of transcription, probably missing some of the still-to-be-induced LRGs of the latest one.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the depolarization applied in RNA-seq and ATAC-seq experiments is continuous, it was not unexpected to find IEGs present at both 1 h and 4 h timepoints. The revised manuscript contains a new experiment (Fig. S1d-f) demonstrating that a shorter depolarization period (1 h KCl followed by a 3 h wash off period) also induces Fos mRNA, but to a much lower extent than 4 h continuous stimulation. In contrast, both short (1 h) and long (4 h) depolarization periods induce Pdyn to equivalent levels when measured at 4 h after the onset of the stimulus. These experiments support our conclusion that LRGs require a temporal delay, and not simply extended stimulation. Nevertheless, the reviewer is correct that a 4 h timepoint may potentially miss some LRGs that are induced even later. We plan to explore the full timecourse of LRG induction in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, while only prosed as a suggestion, the assumption that from the data generated in this article, we can envision a mechanism by which AP-1 family of transcription factors interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is going too far, as no evidence is provided implicated SWI/SNF in the data presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>While speculative in the current context, we felt that it was important to highlight this prior literature to identify potential mechanisms that may link IEGs (specifically, AP-1 members) to chromatin remodeling machinery. We have altered this section of the discussion to emphasize that this link is speculative in the context of neuronal chromatin remodeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors</bold></p><p>1. I couldn't find the number of replicates generated for each dataset, neither for RNA nor for ATAC-seq. It could be worth adding these data to the figure legends or in the material and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. The number of replicates generated for each dataset are now included in the methods section (see response to Reviewer #1, comment #4 above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 1D, Gene Ontology terms appear significant only for each of the individual datasets. While this might be expected for the 1h time-point, the 4hrs time-point comprises a big extent of the genes up-regulated at 1h as well, and it is surprising no term related to chromatin or transcription regulation appears as significant. Is this due to the fact that the analysis has been conducted with two separated lists of genes and only the top terms are shown without crossing the data? This could be misleading for the reader and maybe a comparative GO term analysis might be better such as using CluterProfiler or similar tools, that might allow for real comparison of terms enriched in each dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. For Figure 1d, GO term analysis was conducted with two separated gene lists, each consisting of timepoint-specific upregulated DEGs. Thus, 772 genes were included for the analysis of 4 h GO terms and 39 genes were included for the analysis of 1 h GO terms. Previously, comparisons of cellular component GO terms included in the current study only included the top 10 GO terms. The revised manuscript contains an updated analysis that compares all enriched GO terms and identifies that three of the top 10 cellular component GO terms for the 1 h gene set are also identified as significantly enriched in the 4 h gene set. We have revised the graph in Fig. 1f to reflect this updated analysis. Overall, our conclusions (that 1 h and 4 h DEG sets fall into distinct functional categories) remains supported by this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 3D, the graphs show the density of motifs within the DARs in units of&quot;Motifs/Kb/peak&quot; while the x-axis represents the peaks coordinates from -500bp to +500bp. It is not clear to me how this graph is generated and how within 1000bp the profiles can reach values of 18-20 Motifs/Kb/peak. Could this be clarified?</p></disp-quote><p>The motif enrichment score was calculated by identifying the number of total motifs within defined 50bp genomic bins surrounding the center of the DAR regions. HOMER builds enrichment histograms that normalize motif presence to set size (e.g., number of peaks or DARs), and also to genomic space (base pairs). While HOMERâs default histogram represents motifs/bp/peak, we converted this to motifs/kb/peak for ease of interpretation. However, to avoid confusion we have returned the y axis labels to the default HOMER settings (motifs/bp/peak). The normalization and units for this graph have been clarified in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 4C the newly generated ATAC-seq data is just &quot;targeted&quot; analyzed, showing global tendencies are maintained between the initial generated data and this one. It could be interesting, however, to see the number of DARs obtained in these conditions, especially to see if some DARs are observed in the Anisomycin condition that might be translation-independent.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment described in Figure 4 was designed to both validate the 5,312 DARs and understand the role of protein translation in activity-dependent chromatin remodeling. One way to begin identifying translation-independent DARs is to compare the DMSO + Vehicle group to the Anisomycin + KCl group. With this comparison, any 4 h DAR that has increased accessibility in the Anisomycin + KCl group may be translation-independent as pretreatment with anisomycin did not prevent chromatin remodeling. After conducting this analysis, we identified a very small percentage (3.44%) of 5,312 4 h DARs that still exhibited significantly increased accessibility when pre-treated with Anisomycin. This small number is consistent with the robust effects of anisomycin on KCl-dependent remodeling shown in Fig. 4c-d. However, to confirm that these were in fact translation-independent activity-regulated DARs, we would need to perform direct comparison of chromatin accessibility between neurons pre-treated with Anisomycin and then treated with either vehicle or KCl. Since we did not include an anisomycin only group in experiments in Fig. 4, we cannot confidently claim whether this 3.4% of DARs are translationindependent. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting avenue of future exploration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3</bold></p><p>Public review</p><p>1. Throughout the paper, the authors emphasize a &quot;temporal decoupling&quot; of transcriptional and chromatin response to depolarization, based on a lack of significant chromatin changes at 1h, despite IEG transcription. However, previous publications show significant chromatin remodeling at 1h (e.g. Su et al., NN 2017 in adult dentate gyrus) or 2h (Kim et al., Nature 2010; Malik et al., NN 2014 in cultured embryonic cortical neurons). The discussion briefly mentions this contrast, but it remains difficult to conclude decisively whether there is temporal decoupling when such decoupling is not found consistently. If one is to make broad conclusions about basic neural chromatin response to depolarization, it would be ideal to know under which conditions there is temporal decoupling, or if this is a region-specific phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, prior studies referred to in our manuscript have identified chromatin remodeling at earlier timepoints than we identified here. As addressed above (Reviewer #1, comments 1 &amp; 2), it is possible that this discrepancy arises due to the difference in experimental model system, differences in the type of stimulation applied, pretreatment protocols used to silence neurons prior to activation, or even differences in developmental stage. Differences in each of these parameters make it difficult to make straightforward comparisons between datasets and results in this manuscript. It is possible that other cell types induce IEGs more quickly (or more robustly) in response to stimulation, which could lead to earlier chromatin remodeling. However, the common patterns of chromatin reorganization (e.g., the fact that changes are enriched at AP-1 motifs and are found in intergenic regions at putative enhancers) lend support for the idea that the transcriptional waves identified here can also be found in other cell types and in other contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The UMAP analysis is a novel way to probe transcription factor enrichment, but it's unclear what this is actually showing. The authors sought to ask whether &quot;DARs could be separated based on transcription factor motifs in these regions.&quot; However, the motifs present in any genomic stretch are fixed based on genomic sequence, so it seems like this analysis might be asking whether certain motifs are more likely to be physically clustered together in the genome, in activity-regulated regions (rather than certain transcription factors acting in concert, as is implied in discussion). While still potentially interesting, this analysis does not seem to give much additional insight into activity-dependent chromatin remodeling beyond the motif enrichment analysis already performed. Nevertheless, to draw stronger conclusions, it would be necessary to compare clustering to a random set of genomic regions of the same length/size to interpret the clustering here. It would also be useful to know whether the ISL1 motif is also enriched in ubiquitously accessible genomic regions in the striatum (and not just DARs).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional analysis is needed to explore enrichment of various transcription factor motifs and activity at differently accessible regions of the genome. The motif enrichment analysis in Figure 3 demonstrated the types of motifs that were enriched in DARs (Fig. 3a-c), the overall degree of enrichment (Fig. 3c), and the distribution of those motifs across DAR sites (Fig. 3d). This analysis allowed us to understand whether motifs for cell-defining transcription factors like ISL1 are enriched uniquely in DARs, or are also found in other regions that are accessible at baseline (see direct comparisons between vehicle/baseline peaks and DARs in Fig. 3d). However, these approaches represent enrichment across all DARs as group, and do not show TF presence/absence at any specific DAR. The UMAP analysis presented in Figure 3e allowed identification of DAR clusters based on the presence or absence of specific transcription factor motifs, and allowed us to represent specific DARs in a reduced two-dimensional space. Because this analysis identifies the existence of distinct motifs within single DARs, it allowed us to speculate as to the possibility of transcription factor cooperation within DARs, or the meaning of DAR clusters that appear to be defined by specific motifs (e.g., KLF10 in Fig. 3f). Given the information that this adds to the initial analyses, we argue that its inclusion in the manuscript is useful and potentially informative for generating follow-up hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors identify late-response gene enhancers by 3 criteria. However, only Pdyn was highlighted thereafter. How many putative DARs met these three criteria in striatum? Only Pdyn?</p></disp-quote><p>As illustrated in Figures 2 and 4, nearly all of the DARs in our dataset met these criteria, which included presence in non-coding genomic regions, increase in accessibility following stimulation, and prevention of chromatin accessibility changes by protein synthesis inhibition. We did not mean to indicate that the Pdyn locus was unique in this way. In addition to the criteria highlighted in the manuscript, we chose this locus due to decades of literature establishing the importance of prodynorphin in the striatum, and the role of this gene in human neuropsychiatric diseases. We would argue that this increases the relevance of more detailed exploration of the regulator mechanisms that control expression of this gene, and makes our results applicable to a broader pre-existing literature. The revised manuscript includes additional experiments that examine Pdyn expression changes in response to different stimuli, which help to justify the focus on this gene from the beginning of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations For The Authors</p><p>1. Figure 1 volcano plots show a scatter primarily in the up-regulated portion at both the 1-h and 4-h time points. However, the Venn diagrams show largely similar numbers of up- and downregulated genes at the 4-h time point. Is the clustering of down-regulated genes tighter/more overlapping? If so, semi-translucent volcano dots or some acknowledgment of the visual discrepancy would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. Down-regulated genes are clustering tighter on the volcano plot due to smaller fold changes. This visual discrepancy is acknowledged by the numeric indicators of up- and down-regulated genes in the upper left-hand corner of the volcano plot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

In Figure 2E, why are the enrichments exactly opposite, especially given these are two different types of input (all baseline peaks vs DARs)?</p></disp-quote><p>Odds ratios were calculated by comparing baseline peaks (i.e., ATAC-seq peaks identified in vehicle treated cells) to KCl-induced DARs. This allowed us to identify the enrichment of DARs in specific genomic annotations in comparison to the genomic features that are accessible at baseline, rather than making comparisons to random probe sets or genomic space dedicated to these distinct annotations. This analysis identified that relative to baseline peaks, DARs are significantly depleted in coding regions of the genome and enriched in non-coding regions of the genome. However, given this analysis we agree that it does not make sense to graph both the vehicle (baseline) and DARs on this graph, given that enrichment of each set is determined relative to the other (creating the reciprocal enrichment in this panel).
