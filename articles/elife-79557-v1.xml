Sensorimotor circuits are thus tasked with integrating diverse external and internal cues relevant to these needs to generate context-appropriate behaviors. However, the mechanisms that underlie this integration are largely unknown. Here, we show that a wide range of states and stimuli converge upon a single <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> olfactory neuron to modulate food-seeking behavior. Using an unbiased ribotagging approach, we find that the expression of olfactory receptor genes in the AWA olfactory neuron is influenced by a wide array of states and stimuli, including feeding state, physiological stress, and recent sensory cues. We identify odorants that activate these state-dependent olfactory receptors and show that altered expression of these receptors influences food-seeking and foraging. Further, we dissect the molecular and neural circuit pathways through which external sensory information and internal nutritional state are integrated by AWA. This reveals a modular organization in which sensory and state-related signals arising from different cell types in the body converge on AWA and independently control chemoreceptor expression. The synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal’s overall state. Our findings suggest a general model in which sensory- and state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals’ sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>integration</kwd><kwd>behavioral states</kwd><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Srinivasan</surname><given-names>Jagan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007457</institution-id><institution>JPB Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS104892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1845663</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flavell</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Thus, virtually all animals exhibit long-lasting internal states that reflect their physiology and experience and in turn influence sensorimotor processing. For example, an animal’s nervous system might respond to the recent absence of food sensory cues and a metabolic energy deficit by generating a neural representation of hunger, which in turn alters a wide range of feeding-related behaviors. In real-world environments, an animal’s nervous system is responsible for evaluating a number of needs simultaneously to prioritize behavioral outputs – such as avoiding predation while seeking food – to ensure that all needs are ultimately met. The biological underpinnings of these complex, integrated state-dependent behavioral changes remain poorly understood.</p><p>Decades of experimental work has identified neuronal populations that can induce internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flavell et al., 2022</xref>). For example, NPY/AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus drive behavioral changes typical of hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>), neurons in the lamina terminalis drive those typical of thirst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnson and Gross, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oka et al., 2015</xref>), and subpopulations of neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus drive aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kruk et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, P1 interneurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can trigger a state of social arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hindmarsh Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>), and serotonergic NSM neurons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> can trigger dwelling states during foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ji et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>). These devoted cell populations appear to respond to state-relevant inputs and elicit a suite of behavioral changes that comprise the state. However, animals can exhibit more than one state at a time, like hunger, stress, or aggression. Therefore, the sensorimotor pathways that implement specific motivated behaviors, such as approach or avoidance of a sensory cue, must integrate information about multiple states to adaptively control behavior. Previous work has revealed that neuromodulators and hormones can convey state information to sensory circuits to allow for state-specific sensorimotor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horio and Liberles, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Root et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sayin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takeishi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yapici et al., 2016</xref>), but how diverse state-related inputs are integrated by these circuits remains unclear.</p><p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, whose nervous system consists of 302 defined neurons with known connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>), exhibits a wide range of state-dependent behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flavell et al., 2020</xref>).

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuromodulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>) allow these states to influence sensorimotor circuits: the effects of hunger are mediated by amines and insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Skora et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takeishi et al., 2020</xref>); stressors induce the release of tyramine and neuropeptides that alter behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Rosa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>); and bacterial infection induces the release of <italic>daf-7</italic>/TGFβ, which promotes bacterial lawn leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). The well-defined behavioral states of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, together with its relatively simple sensorimotor circuits, make it an attractive system to decipher how animals generate sensorimotor behaviors that reflect an integration of their states.</p><p>Sensorimotor processing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> originates in primary sensory neurons that detect odorants, tastants, touch, temperature, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iliff and Xu, 2020</xref>). Each of the 16 chemosensory neuron pairs expresses a multitude of chemoreceptors, which are predominantly G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferkey et al., 2021</xref>). Detection of odorants or tastants evokes changes in sensory neuron activity that are transmitted to downstream interneurons and motor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalasani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>). Several chemosensory neurons, such as AWA and AWC, primarily detect appetitive cues, while others, including ASH, detect aversive cues. However, chemosensory processing can be modulated by internal state and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell and Gordus, 2022</xref>). For example, insulin signaling drives a hunger-dependent switch in thermotaxis behavior by modulating the AWC sensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takeishi et al., 2020</xref>). Associative learning can drive changes in salt or temperature preference by altering presynaptic release from the ASE and AFD neurons that detect these respective stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohno et al., 2017</xref>). Neuromodulation of sensory interneurons also impacts sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, internal states have been shown in some cases to modulate gene expression in chemosensory neurons. Starvation alters the expression of the <italic>str-234</italic> chemoreceptor in ADL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruner et al., 2014</xref>) and the diacetyl receptor <italic>odr-10</italic> in AWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ryan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wexler et al., 2020</xref>). Infection and starvation can modulate <italic>daf-7/</italic>TGFβ expression in ASJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hilbert and Kim, 2017</xref>). This work suggests that changes in chemosensory neuron gene expression are well-poised to underlie state-dependent changes in sensorimotor processing and likewise represent a plausible locus of state integration.</p><p>Here, we show that the olfactory neuron AWA integrates multiple streams of information to regulate chemoreceptor expression and dictate state-dependent food-seeking behavior. State-dependent ribotagging reveals that the expression of chemoreceptor genes is disproportionately elevated in AWA following food deprivation. We find that AWA chemoreceptor expression is controlled by both the sensory and metabolic components of food, as well as physiological stress. The state-dependent chemoreceptor <italic>str-44</italic> confers responsiveness to the putative food odors butyl acetate and propyl acetate and promotes starved-like foraging behaviors when expressed at high levels in AWA. Further, we delineate the neural and molecular pathways that underlie convergent signaling to AWA, identifying signaling pathways from other sensory neurons to AWA, a gut-to-brain metabolic pathway that signals to AWA, and a physiological stress pathway. These pathways act in a modular fashion and each contribute independently to the levels of AWA chemoreceptor expression. Our results reveal how diverse external and internal cues – nutritional state, stress, and sensory environment – converge at a single node in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system to allow for an adaptive sensorimotor response that reflects a complete integration of the animal’s states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diverse external and internal cues regulate chemoreceptor expression in the AWA olfactory neuron</title><p>As an unbiased approach to identify neural mechanisms that underlie state-dependent behavioral changes, we performed molecular profiling of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons in well-fed versus food-deprived animals. We selected 3 hr of food deprivation as our time point because it is sufficient to induce many feeding-related behavioral changes, including alterations in food approach, encounter, and exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>), while remaining a relatively mild metabolic insult. To obtain a ‘snapshot’ of gene expression while animals were in a specific state, we used pan-neural ribotagging. This method permits cell-specific purification of actively translating mRNAs from animals that are flash frozen within minutes after removal from plates. We expressed an HA-tagged ribosomal subunit in all neurons, purified the tagged mRNA-ribosome complexes from fed and 3-hr fasted adult animals, and sequenced the isolated mRNAs and whole-animal input RNA (see ‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McLachlan and Flavell, 2019</xref>). High-depth mRNA sequencing of ribotag samples allowed us to detect mRNAs that were being actively translated in as few as a single pair of neurons. We performed three independent biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and confirmed the enrichment of pan-neural mRNAs in ribotag samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We examined the genes whose expression was most dramatically altered by fasting: 802 genes were increased by more than fourfold in the fasted condition compared to the fed condition, while 647 were decreased by more than fourfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As is shown, adding PA14 odors on the lid of the plate increased <italic>str-44</italic> reporter fluorescence beyond the levels in fasted controls, similar to when animals consumed PA14.

We found that these chemoreceptors are distributed across all neurons in the amphid sense organ, suggesting that fasting induces broad changes in olfactory coding by sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, gray bars). To determine whether any sensory neurons exhibit a disproportionate change in chemoreceptor expression profile after fasting, we normalized the counts of upregulated receptors to the overall number of chemosensory GPCRs expressed by each neuron. We found that the AWA olfactory neuron expressed a significantly greater proportional enrichment of upregulated GPCRs than expected if chemoreceptors genes were upregulated uniformly across neuron types (24/133 chemoreceptors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green bars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that AWA chemoreceptor expression levels are particularly sensitive to food deprivation.</p><p>To directly monitor the sites of chemoreceptor expression, we generated in vivo transcriptional reporters by inserting a t2a-mNeonGreen fluorescent reporter at the C-termini of several chemoreceptor genes via CRISPR-based gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As our ribotagging results suggested that these genes were upregulated after fasting, we compared mNeonGreen fluorescence for each of these chemoreceptors in fed and 3 hr fasted animals. For the <italic>str-44</italic> and <italic>srd-28</italic> chemoreceptor genes, we observed very little fluorescence in fed animals, but a significant increase specifically in AWA in fasted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; confirmation by co-expression of an AWA marker in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As a point of comparison, expression of a mNeonGreen reporter inserted into the well-characterized AWA-specific chemoreceptor <italic>odr-10</italic> was detectable in fed animals and displayed only a small, nonsignificant increase after fasting, consistent with the fact that it was only mildly upregulated by fasting in our ribotagging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). As a negative control, we generated a reporter for the serotonin receptor <italic>ser-7</italic>, a GPCR in a different gene family whose expression was not altered in our ribotagging data, and observed that its expression was not affected by fasting. This suggests that the t2a-mNeonGreen transgene does not aberrantly confer fasting-dependent regulation. Overall, these reporter gene results provide a close match to our ribotagging data. These data suggest that fasting causes an upregulation of chemoreceptors in the AWA olfactory neuron.</p><p>Because the approximately fivefold increase in <italic>str-44</italic> expression upon food deprivation was particularly reliable and we were able to identify odorants that activate STR-44 (see below), we focused our experiments on this chemosensory GPCR. Depriving animals of their bacterial food for 3 hr impacts them in two ways: it leads to a change in metabolic state due to decreased ingestion, and it causes a change in sensory experience due to the removal of food sensory cues. To determine which of these effects influence <italic>str-44</italic> expression, we exposed animals to food cues under conditions where they were unable to ingest the food. First, we exposed animals to bacteria treated with aztreonam, which inhibits cell division and renders the bacteria too large to consume. This manipulation led to a level of <italic>str-44</italic> expression that was intermediate to well-fed and fasted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This suggests that the ingestion of bacteria is necessary to fully suppress <italic>str-44</italic> expression, but also that non-nutritive components of the bacteria, such as volatile odorants, can partially suppress <italic>str-44</italic> expression. However, aztreonam treatment may also alter mechanosensory or chemical properties of the bacterial lawn, and therefore the sensory experience of the animal is not strictly identical to the untreated lawn. Therefore, we also used a second approach in which we exposed animals to food that was placed on the lid of the plate, rendering it inaccessible to the animal. As expected, this manipulation also produced a level of <italic>str-44</italic> expression that was intermediate to well-fed and fasted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that both food sensory cues and the actual ingestion of food act to suppress olfactory receptor expression in AWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>In the wild, <italic>C. elegans</italic> interact with and ingest diverse microbial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Samuel et al., 2016</xref>) that differ both in the odors that they emit and their metabolic contents. Given that AWA chemoreceptor expression is regulated by both sensory and metabolic cues, we hypothesized that AWA chemoreceptor expression might be modulated not just by the presence or absence of bacteria, but also by exposure to different bacterial food sources. To test this, after raising animals on the standard laboratory diet of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (OP50), we transferred them to plates where they were able to consume different bacterial species for 3 hr. We sampled representative bacterial strains from five different genuses: <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> (JUb19), <italic>Pantoea</italic> (BIGb0393), <italic>Comamonas</italic> (DA1877), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (PA14)<italic>,</italic> and <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> (MYb71). Indeed, the levels of <italic>str-44</italic>::mNeonGreen reporter expression were increased significantly compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 controls when animals were exposed to <italic>Comamonas</italic> DA1877 or <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> PA14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), two species that are naively attractive to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). These changes could be due to differences in sensory cues and/or metabolic contents of these bacteria. By comparing the above results to conditions where DA1877 and PA14 were inaccessible on the lid of the plate, we found that the odors had differential effects on chemoreceptor expression. Relative to fasted controls, PA14 odor increased <italic>str-44</italic> reporter expression, whereas DA1877 odor suppressed <italic>str-44</italic> expression. Thus, the effect of PA14 exposure may be driven by volatile odors while the effect of DA1877 exposure may be driven by ingestion and/or physical contact with the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Together, these data suggest that exposure to different bacterial odors and metabolic contents impacts the expression of AWA olfactory receptors.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether AWA chemoreceptor expression is exclusively controlled by feeding-related signals or, alternatively, whether it is impacted by a broader set of external and internal cues. Thus, we also examined whether the addition of aversive/stressful stimuli influenced <italic>str-44</italic> expression. We chose to use a mild osmotic stressor (300 mOsm growth media versus 150 mOsm in normal media) that modulates <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior, but does not adversely impact animal growth rates or viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). We found that animals fasted in the presence of this physiological stressor displayed <italic>str-44</italic> expression that was significantly suppressed relative to fasted controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, the <italic>ser-7</italic>::mNeonGreen control reporter was unaffected by this mild osmotic stressor, indicating that these effects are not due to generic downregulation of GPCRs or diminished expression of mNeonGreen in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that rather than relying on food-related signals alone, diverse external and internal cues converge on AWA to coordinately regulate the expression of the <italic>str-44</italic> chemoreceptor. Given that our ribotagging analysis identified &gt;20 putative AWA chemoreceptors impacted by fasting, it is possible that many AWA chemoreceptors display similar gene expression changes in response to various states.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The state-dependent chemoreceptor STR-44 acts in AWA to detect the attractive odors propyl acetate and butyl acetate</title><p>We next sought to understand how convergent signaling onto AWA might allow animals to generate context-appropriate sensorimotor responses. Therefore, we focused on examining how the state-dependent AWA chemoreceptors influence <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensorimotor behaviors. AWA is an olfactory neuron that drives attraction to volatile odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferkey et al., 2021</xref>). To identify odors that activate the state-dependent chemoreceptors, we generated strains that ectopically expressed either <italic>str-44</italic> or <italic>srd-28</italic> in the nociceptive sensory neuron ASH and asked whether this could confer repulsion to odors previously shown to activate AWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Larsch et al., 2013</xref>). To reduce native responses to these odors, we performed these experiments in a genetic background with an <italic>odr-7</italic> mutation, which inactivates AWA, and a <italic>tax-4</italic> mutation, which prevents sensory transduction in other olfactory neurons. We tested olfactory behavior using a chemotaxis assay, measuring movement toward or away from each of the tested odors. Due to their genetic background, we predicted that these animals would generally have neutral responses to the tested odors. However, if an odor were a ligand for the <italic>str-44</italic> or <italic>srd-28</italic> receptor, then expression of that receptor in ASH should drive a repulsive response to the odor. As expected, the ASH::<italic>str-44</italic> and ASH::<italic>srd-28</italic> strains had neutral responses to most tested odors, indistinguishable from the <italic>odr-7;tax-4</italic> control strain. However, the ASH::<italic>str-44</italic> strain was significantly repulsed by two structurally similar esters, propyl acetate and butyl acetate, suggesting that <italic>str-44</italic> chemoreceptor expression in ASH is sufficient to confer detection of these two odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The ASH::<italic>srd-28</italic> strain did not generate any significant responses to the odors tested, suggesting that <italic>srd-28</italic> may detect other odors that we did not test here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Wild-type animals were strongly attracted to both of these odors. However, <italic>odr-7</italic> mutants lacking AWA had significantly decreased responses to these odors, indicating that AWA is necessary for navigation to propyl and butyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Based on these results, we examined whether AWA calcium responses to butyl and propyl acetate were state-dependent. We measured AWA GCaMP signals while delivering 10 s pulses of odor via microfluidic delivery. Consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Larsch et al., 2013</xref>), AWA calcium levels increased in response to the addition of either butyl or propyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, AWA calcium responses to the cues detected by the <italic>str-44</italic> chemoreceptor are potentiated in fasted animals, when <italic>str-44</italic> is expressed at high levels. Because AWA can detect butyl and propyl acetate in the fed state, when <italic>str-44</italic> levels are often undetectable, we expect that multiple chemoreceptors contribute to detection of these odorants. In addition, we have not ruled out that other fasting-upregulated chemoreceptors in AWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) may also contribute to the fasting-induced potentiation of the response to propyl and butyl acetate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>STR-44 expression drives state-dependent enhancement of behavioral preference for the attractive odor butyl acetate</title><p>We hypothesized that animals’ behavioral responses to <italic>str-44</italic>-sensed odors would be modulated by the states and stimuli that alter <italic>str-44</italic> expression levels, and that direct perturbations of <italic>str-44</italic> expression would also impact behavior. To test this, we used a modified food choice assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Worthy et al., 2018</xref>) in which animals choose between two small and equidistant lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 bacterial food. We placed a spot of butyl acetate adjacent to one lawn, and as a control, placed a spot of ethanol adjacent to the other lawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We chose to use this assay instead of chemotaxis because fasted animals display generically reduced movement in the presence of single odorants but display robust movement in food choice assays. At high concentrations of odor, both fed and fasted animals were attracted to the food lawn with butyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, at lower odor concentrations, fasted animals were significantly more likely than fed animals to approach the food lawn with butyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that fasted animals display increased sensitivity to the attractive odor butyl acetate, consistent with the increased expression of the butyl acetate receptor <italic>str-44</italic> in fasted animals. To test whether increased expression of <italic>str-44</italic> could directly drive increased sensitivity to butyl acetate, we generated a strain that overexpresses <italic>str-44</italic> under a constitutive AWA promoter, driving overexpression in both fed and fasted animals. Indeed, well-fed animals from this strain were significantly more likely to approach the butyl acetate food lawn compared to well-fed wild-type animals, phenocopying the fasted state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We also tested whether the fasting-induced increase in butyl acetate sensitivity requires AWA and/or <italic>str-44. odr-7</italic> mutants lacking a functional AWA did not display a fasting-induced increase in butyl acetate attraction, suggesting that AWA is required for this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In addition, <italic>str-44;srd-28</italic> double mutants displayed an attenuated behavioral response where their attraction to the butyl acetate lawn was similar in fed and fasted conditions, suggesting that <italic>str-44</italic> and/or <italic>srd-28</italic> are necessary for normal fasting-induced enhancement of butyl acetate preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> displays an AWA-dependent increase in sensitivity to butyl acetate upon fasting and that expression of the fasting-upregulated AWA chemoreceptor <italic>str-44</italic> can drive increased sensitivity to this odor.</p><p>We next examined whether other manipulations that increase or decrease <italic>str-44</italic> expression could likewise modify butyl acetate sensitivity. Since the presence of mild osmotic stress blocks the upregulation of <italic>str-44</italic> in AWA during fasting, we examined whether this manipulation also blocks the fasting-induced increase in butyl acetate sensitivity. Indeed, when we tested fasted animals undergoing osmotic stress, they were no more likely to approach the butyl acetate food lawn than well-fed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Together with the direct manipulations of <italic>str-44</italic> levels described above, these results suggest that the level of <italic>str-44</italic> expression in AWA, which is set via the integration of multiple states, drives butyl acetate sensitivity. More broadly, these results are consistent with the notion that integrated state-dependent changes in the expression of <italic>str-44</italic> and potentially other chemoreceptors may alter sensory responses to specific odors, allowing animals to modulate their navigation based on the sum of their recent experience and physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>AWA responses to food are influenced by internal state, and the state-dependent olfactory receptors drive enhanced responses to food</title><p>In natural environments, <italic>C. elegans</italic> encounter complex mixtures of olfactory stimuli rather than monomolecular odorants, so we next asked whether the response of AWA to bacterial odors is influenced by the same states that modify AWA chemoreceptor expression. Previous studies have shown that AWA responds to bacterial volatiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zaslaver et al., 2015</xref>), which are complex mixtures of heterogeneous odorants, including esters like butyl and propyl acetate. To examine state-dependent AWA calcium responses to food odor gradients, we performed AWA GCaMP imaging in freely moving fed or fasted animals as they navigated toward a lawn of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Across conditions, AWA displayed notable calcium peaks as animals navigated toward the food lawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These responses mostly occurred when animals were in close proximity to the food lawn and when they were moving up the odor gradient toward the food.

Thus, we utilized an assay of bacterial food exploration during foraging. Fasted animals reduce their locomotion on a food lawn compared to fed animals, reflecting increased exploitation of a food source after fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that fed animals that overexpress <italic>str-44</italic> in AWA would behave as if they were fasted, much like in the above food choice experiments. Indeed, we observed that overexpressing <italic>str-44</italic> and <italic>srd-28</italic> in AWA led to a marked decrease in exploration in the fed state, mimicking the behavior of fasted wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This effect on movement was only observed in the presence of bacterial food as the same overexpression strain displayed wild-type speed in the absence of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, increasing <italic>str-44</italic> and <italic>srd-28</italic> expression in AWA is sufficient to alter food-driven changes in locomotion, partially mimicking the behavior of fasted animals. Taken together with the above results, these data suggest that AWA calcium responses to bacterial food are enhanced by fasting, and that increased expression of the fasting-induced olfactory receptor <italic>str-44</italic> results in fasted-like behavioral responses to food. Overall, the behavioral studies that we have carried out indicate that state-dependent modulation of AWA chemoreceptor expression, in particular <italic>str-44</italic> expression, alters the animal’s sensorimotor behaviors related to food navigation and foraging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Signaling from a set of food sensory neurons to AWA regulates <italic>str-44</italic> expression</title><p>We next sought to understand the mechanisms by which AWA integrates diverse external and internal cues to influence sensorimotor behaviors. Our overall approach was to first determine the molecular and neural pathways that convey each sensory stimulus or state to AWA and then examine how they interact. We first examined how food sensory cues influence AWA olfactory receptor expression. We examined <italic>str-44</italic>::mNeonGreen reporter fluorescence in <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants that have defective sensory transduction in many food-responsive sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferkey et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, AWA sensory transduction does not require <italic>tax-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferkey et al., 2021</xref>). Well-fed <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants exhibited a striking increase in <italic>str-44</italic> expression compared to wild-type controls, with expression levels even greater than wild-type fasted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Correspondingly, well-fed <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants exhibited increased attraction to the STR-44-sensed odor butyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). A potential concern is that an increase in <italic>str-44</italic> expression may occur if a mutation reduces food intake; however, we found that <italic>tax-4</italic> animals displayed normal feeding rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows normal feeding rates for <italic>tax-4</italic> and all other mutants/transgenics with elevated <italic>str-44</italic> expression in fed animals).

Chemogenetic silencing of AWB, BAG, ASI, AQR/PQR/URX, or ASK via a histamine-gated chloride channel (HisCl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pokala et al., 2014</xref>) led to a significant increase in <italic>str-44</italic> expression in well-fed animals, whereas ASJ silencing had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; feeding controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; histamine controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In fasted animals, chemogenetic silencing did not further increase <italic>str-44</italic> expression except in ASK, and silencing of ASI reduced <italic>str-44</italic> expression relative to fasted controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), which may reflect distinct requirements for ASI in fed versus fasted states. Genetic ablation of AWC and ASE via <italic>ceh-36</italic> mutation also had no effect on <italic>str-44</italic> expression in fed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>; see also for additional mutants and transgenics that corroborate these findings). These data indicate that a defined set of <italic>tax-4</italic>-expressing neurons inhibit AWA <italic>str-44</italic> expression in well-fed animals. Notably, each of the neurons that inhibit <italic>str-44</italic> expression have been previously shown to detect food sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferkey et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that food sensory cues are detected by AWB, BAG, ASI, AQR/PQR/URX, and ASK, which signal to AWA to inhibit <italic>str-44</italic> expression while animals are feeding.</p><p>In principle, these food sensory neurons could signal to AWA through neuropeptide release and/or synaptic outputs onto downstream circuit components that in turn synapse onto AWA. We separately examined these possibilities. Among the neuropeptidergic pathways, the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway (IIS) has been most prominently linked to feeding state, and several of the food sensory neurons that regulate <italic>str-44</italic>, such as ASI, release insulin peptides. Insulin acts primarily through the <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murphy and Hu, 2013</xref>). Activation of <italic>daf-2</italic> alters gene expression by inhibiting the <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO transcription factor, which is also a target of other cellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Landis and Murphy, 2010</xref>). Loss of the <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin receptor also caused a strong de-repression of <italic>str-44</italic> and a corresponding increase in butyl acetate attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). Conversely, <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants showed nearly abolished <italic>str-44</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin receptor and <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO are broadly expressed, so we next examined where they function. Expression of the <italic>daf-2</italic> cDNA specifically in AWA rescued <italic>str-44</italic> expression to wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Expression of the <italic>daf-16a</italic> cDNA specifically in AWA rescued <italic>str-44</italic> expression, albeit not completely; expression of this cDNA in all tissues yielded the same result, suggesting that additional isoforms of <italic>daf-16</italic> are required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, we determined that <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants respectively increase and decrease <italic>srd-28</italic> expression in AWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Together, these results suggest that <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>daf-16</italic> act in AWA to regulate olfactory receptor expression.</p><p>We also examined whether other neuropeptide signaling pathways could influence <italic>str-44</italic> expression. Most neuropeptides act on GPCRs that couple to the G proteins Gao/<italic>goa-1</italic>, Gas/<italic>gsa-1</italic>, or Gaq/<italic>egl-30</italic>, which are all natively expressed in AWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we mimicked the activation of neuropeptide receptors in AWA via AWA-specific expression of constitutively active versions of these G proteins and examined the impact on <italic>str-44</italic> expression. AWA-specific expression of Gao/<italic>goa-1(gf</italic>) or <italic>acy-1(gf),</italic> a key Gas/<italic>gsa-1</italic> effector, drove a robust increase in <italic>str-44</italic> expression, whereas expression of Gaq/<italic>egl-30(gf</italic>) had only a mild effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This suggests that activation of specific G protein signaling pathways in AWA can influence <italic>str-44</italic> expression and raises the possibility that additional neuropeptides that act through these canonical pathways regulate <italic>str-44</italic>.</p><p>We next tested whether sensory habituation in AWA is a suitable explanation for the odor-driven reduction in <italic>str-44</italic> expression. We exposed wild-type animals to the <italic>str-44</italic> odorants butyl acetate or propyl acetate during 3 hr of either feeding or fasting and measured <italic>str-44</italic> expression. If habituation explains this effect, we would expect that exposure to these odorants would reduce <italic>str-44</italic> expression in fasted animals. However, we observed no differences between odor-exposed animals and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>str-44</italic> expression levels are not modulated by activation of the STR-44 receptor.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether the food sensory neurons could feasibly signal to AWA via action on downstream neural circuits. AWA receives strong synaptic input (&gt;3 synapses) from three neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> wiring diagram: ASI, one of the food sensory neurons that represses <italic>str-44</italic> expression; and AIA and AIY, which are second-order neurons in the chemosensory circuit that together receive synaptic inputs from all five of the food sensory neurons that inhibit <italic>str-44</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether AIA and AIY are required for proper <italic>str-44</italic> regulation, we inactivated these cells via expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTx). Synaptic silencing of AIA led to a significant decrease in <italic>str-44</italic> expression in fasted animals, whereas synaptic silencing of AIY had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In addition, direct chemogenetic silencing of AWA also inhibited <italic>str-44</italic> expression, suggesting that modulating AWA activity itself can influence <italic>str-44</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; histamine controls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To distinguish between a direct effect of AWA activity on intracellular gene expression and a feedback effect of reduced AWA synaptic transmission, we also measured <italic>str-44</italic> expression in animals expressing TeTx in AWA. Inhibition of synaptic release from AWA had no effect on <italic>str-44</italic> expression, suggesting that AWA activity autonomously controls AWA chemoreceptor levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data suggest that a sensory circuit consisting of several food sensory neurons and their downstream synaptic target AIA regulates AWA chemoreceptor expression. Taken together with the above results, these data reveal that several signaling mechanisms – insulin signaling, G-protein signaling, and activity-dependent signaling – allow a defined set of food sensory neurons to regulate olfactory receptor expression in AWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>rict-1</italic>/TORC2 signaling in the intestine signals to AWA to underlie metabolic regulation of AWA chemoreceptor expression</title><p>In addition to food sensory signals, our experiments suggest that the actual ingestion of food influences chemoreceptor expression in AWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). We therefore sought to identify pathways that link physiological fasting to <italic>str-44</italic> expression levels in AWA. Monoaminergic neuromodulators including serotonin and octopamine can act as internal signals of food availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Srinivasan et al., 2008</xref>), so we examined <italic>cat-1</italic>/VMAT mutants, which are defective in the release of these neuromodulators.

Likewise, <italic>pdfr-1</italic> animals lacking PDF neuropeptide signaling, which acts in opposition to serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>), displayed normal <italic>str-44</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We next examined whether changes in internal fat stores, which can impact nervous system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Witham et al., 2016</xref>), influence <italic>str-44</italic> expression. However, mutations that disrupt the ability of the animal to store fat (<italic>mxl-3,</italic> MAX transcription factor) or metabolize triglycerides (<italic>atgl-1</italic>, adipose triglyceride lipase) did not alter <italic>str-44</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In addition, loss of the essential TORC2 component <italic>rict-1</italic>/Rictor led to a robust increase in <italic>str-44</italic> expression in fed and fasted animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and a corresponding behavioral phenotype, increasing butyl acetate attraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). <italic>rict-1</italic> is broadly expressed, but several of its metabolic functions require expression in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soukas et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, we found that the elevated <italic>str-44</italic> expression in <italic>rict-1</italic> mutants was fully rescued by expression of a <italic>rict-1</italic> cDNA in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, TORC2 signaling in the intestine is a key repressor of <italic>str-44</italic> expression in AWA. Consequently, <italic>rict-1</italic> may be part of a pathway that detects internal nutritional state information and modulates AWA chemoreceptor expression.</p><p>To identify additional components of the TORC2 signaling pathway that regulates <italic>str-44</italic>, we performed a feeding RNAi screen against known members of the TORC2 pathway (<italic>akt-1</italic>, <italic>let-363</italic>, <italic>pkc-2</italic>, <italic>sgk-1</italic>, <italic>sinh-1</italic>, and <italic>skn-1</italic>). Of these, <italic>sgk-1(RNAi</italic>) and <italic>pkc-2(RNAi</italic>) produced an elevation of <italic>str-44</italic> expression similar to <italic>rict-1(RNAi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The TORC2 complex is known to phosphorylate and activate <italic>sgk-1</italic> and <italic>pkc-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that <italic>rict-1</italic> likely acts through these effectors to suppress <italic>str-44</italic> expression in AWA. We also examined whether loss of any of these genes could suppress the elevated <italic>str-44</italic> expression in <italic>rict-1</italic> mutants and found that <italic>skn-1(RNAi</italic>) reduced <italic>str-44</italic> expression in this background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous findings showing that <italic>skn-1</italic> encodes a transcription factor, homologous to Nrf1/2, that is inhibited by <italic>rict-1</italic> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ruf et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these experiments reveal that the nutrient sensing TORC2 pathway functions in the intestine to regulate olfactory receptor expression in AWA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The pathways that converge upon AWA control olfactory receptor expression and behavior in a modular manner</title><p>The experiments above identify molecular and neural pathways that allow external and internal cues to influence olfactory receptor expression in AWA. To understand how AWA integrates these signals, we next examined how they interact. We first investigated the pathways that were implicated in crosstalk from food sensory neurons to AWA. Given that the food sensory neurons that inhibit <italic>str-44</italic> expression release insulin peptides, and that the insulin pathway in AWA also influences <italic>str-44</italic> expression, we tested whether the sensory neurons signal to AWA via DAF-2/DAF-16 signaling. Indeed, the elevated expression of <italic>str-44</italic> in <italic>tax-4</italic> sensory-defective mutants or in animals with the ASI sensory neuron silenced was suppressed by the loss of the <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO transcription factor, a key target of the insulin pathway and other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This suggests that elevated <italic>str-44</italic> expression due to inactivation of food sensory neurons requires downstream <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO signaling. We also found that the enhanced expression of <italic>str-44</italic> caused by hyperactive <italic>goa-1</italic> signaling in AWA was fully suppressed by a <italic>daf-16</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, silencing of AWA, which reduces <italic>str-44</italic> expression in wild-type animals, had no effect in a <italic>daf-2</italic>/InR mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these experiments indicate that food sensory neurons signal to AWA via DAF-2-DAF-16 insulin signaling. Changes in AWA activity and G protein signaling that modulate <italic>str-44</italic> expression also depend on the DAF-2-DAF-16 pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Food sensory signals, gut-to-brain metabolic signals, and stress pathways act in a parallel, modular fashion to control <italic>str-44</italic> expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative expression of <italic>str-44</italic>::T2A-mNeonGreen in wild-type, <italic>daf-16, tax-4, tax-4;daf-16, ASI::HisCl.

Interestingly, we found that a <italic>rict-1;daf-16</italic> double mutant displayed a phenotype matching <italic>daf-16</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This suggests that modulation of <italic>str-44</italic> expression by the intestinal TORC2 pathway requires downstream <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO signaling in AWA. Given that <italic>rict-1</italic> and <italic>daf-2</italic> act in parallel (the <italic>rict-1;daf-2</italic> double mutant phenotype is more severe than that of the single mutants), <italic>rict-1</italic> likely modulates <italic>daf-16</italic> function through a noninsulin pathway. Together, these results identify several parallel pathways that converge on AWA to control <italic>str-44</italic> expression. These pathways appear to act in a modular manner where they can each independently influence chemoreceptor expression (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Regulation of <italic>str-44</italic> by several of these stimuli depends on <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO, suggesting that it might serve as a molecular locus of integration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Animals respond to sensory cues by generating behavioral responses that reflect their ongoing needs and states. Yet how sensorimotor circuits integrate diverse cues relevant to these needs and modulate their function accordingly is poorly understood. We find that a single <italic>C. elegans</italic> olfactory neuron integrates multiple states and stimuli to influence its expression of olfactory receptors, which in turn alters the animal’s food-seeking behaviors. Several molecular and neural pathways that originate in different cell types throughout the body converge on AWA to regulate olfactory receptor expression: crosstalk from other sensory neurons, metabolic signals from the gut, and pathways that signal physiological stress. Our behavioral findings show that the synthesis of these signals by AWA allows animals to generate sensorimotor responses that reflect the animal’s overall state. These results suggest a general model in which sensory- and state-dependent transcriptional changes at the sensory periphery modulate animals’ sensorimotor responses to meet their ongoing needs and states.</p><p>We found that AWA olfactory receptor expression reflects recent sensory stimuli, metabolic state, and physiological stress. Recent sensory stimuli are detected by a set of food sensory neurons – ASI, ASK, AWB, BAG, or AQR/PQR/URX – that inhibit AWA olfactory receptor expression in the presence of food. Our data suggest that one possible route of signaling involves the food sensory neurons synapsing onto a second-order neuron in the circuit, AIA, which in turn synapses onto AWA. In addition, sensory neurons may release insulin-like peptides that can activate the DAF-2 insulin receptor in AWA. Given that our experiments suggest a surprisingly high level of crosstalk among the sensory neurons, one possibility is that AWA chemoreceptor expression may reflect the integration of activity across the full chemosensory circuit.</p><p>AWA also integrates metabolic signals from the gut. The TORC2 complex that responds to nutrient levels in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Donnell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soukas et al., 2009</xref>) appears to regulate an as yet unidentified gut-to-brain signaling pathway that impacts AWA olfactory receptor expression. The TORC2 pathway has been shown to impact <italic>daf-28</italic>/insulin-like peptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Donnell et al., 2018</xref>). However, the <italic>rict-1</italic> mutation enhances <italic>str-44</italic> expression in the <italic>daf-2</italic>/InR mutant, suggesting that <italic>rict-1</italic> also operates through an unidentified pathway that is independent of the insulin pathway.</p><p>Our data are most consistent with a framework in which diverse signaling pathways converge on AWA chemoreceptor expression to allow animals to generate sensorimotor behaviors that may vary across environmental conditions. The modulation of chemoreceptor expression in AWA is unlikely to be explained by a simple homeostatic mechanism in which the purpose of altering chemoreceptors would be to keep AWA activity at a target set point. If this mechanism were in effect, then direct inhibition of AWA activity would be expected to increase the expression of excitatory chemoreceptors; however, we found the opposite to be the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Sensory habituation alone is unlikely to be an explanation for the data as exposure to <italic>str-44</italic> odorants does not modify <italic>str-44</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, our results cannot be explained by a model where <italic>str-44</italic> expression simply tracks AWA activity as we find that the high expression level of <italic>str-44</italic> in fasted <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants was not reduced by inhibiting AWA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Although this study focuses largely on two state-dependent chemoreceptors that are expressed in one sensory neuron, our results suggest that &gt;100 olfactory receptors undergo similar state-dependent regulation across multiple classes of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, previous work has shown that the GPCRs <italic>odr-10</italic> and <italic>srh-234</italic> undergo feeding state-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wexler et al., 2020</xref>). As <italic>C. elegans</italic> have a relatively small number of olfactory neurons, receptors are an attractive site for sensory flexibility. Consistent with this notion, chemoreceptor genes are frequent targets of evolution that drive naturally occurring changes in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nei et al., 2008</xref>). Multiple odorants typically activate a single olfactory receptor. Thus, changing the expression of only a few genes could alter responses to many odors. In their natural environment, <italic>C. elegans</italic> are found in soil, compost, or ripe/rotting fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frézal and Félix, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the odors that we identified as ligands for STR-44, propyl and butyl acetate, are major components of the aroma of ripe fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">López et al., 1998</xref>). We also found that <italic>str-44</italic> and <italic>srd-28</italic> drive AWA responses to bacterial odor mixtures. Fruit odors and bacterial odors can both suggest the presence of nearby food to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The broad tuning of STR-44 to these food and food-adjacent stimuli may allow fasted animals to maximize their chances of encountering food. We expect that other chemoreceptors will be modulated in a similar fashion to control sensory neuron responses and stimulus-specific foraging behaviors.</p><p>In addition, we found that a large number of non-chemoreceptor neuronal genes are differentially expressed in response to fasting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This result complements previous findings that changes in gene expression are widespread following fasting and in mutants lacking fasting-responsive transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harvald et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that other genes in our dataset contribute to feeding state-dependent changes in neuronal activity and behavior.</p><p>Our results suggest a potential mechanism by which animals can generate behaviors that reflect an integration of multiple ongoing needs and states. Individual states, like hunger or mating drive, are represented by devoted cell populations that impact many aspects of behavior. For animals to generate behaviors that reflect their overall state, signals from diverse sources need to be integrated by the sensorimotor circuits that implement motivated behaviors. We find that convergent signaling onto neurons in sensorimotor circuits modulates gene expression and thus alters circuit function over long timescales. The inputs onto AWA that convey state information arise from a variety of cell types throughout the body but converge on the <italic>daf-16</italic>/FOXO transcription factor in AWA that controls gene expression. We found that these parallel pathways act in a modular fashion where they can each independently influence chemoreceptor expression, which likely allows animals to adaptively tune their expression of chemoreceptors depending on the sensory cues, stressors, and nutrients in the environment. It is likely that many other neurons in the sensorimotor circuits of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other animals similarly integrate a wide range of state-relevant inputs to modify their gene expression programs and functional properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type Bristol N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>odr-7(ky4</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sengupta et al., 1994</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CX4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>odr-7(ky4);

This was chosen due to previous work on PA14 inducing aversive olfactory learning that used this same concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Feeding with aztreonam-treated bacteria</title><p>To aztreonam-treat bacteria, a standard OP50 culture was diluted fivefold in LB with 5 μg/mL aztreonam and grown overnight at 37°C with gentle agitation. Bacteria were then plated on NGM plates with 10 µg/mL aztreonam. Bacteria were allowed to grow overnight at room temperature, then visually inspected for filamentous growth before animals were plated for the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>RNA interference screen</title><p>Animals were fed on bacteria containing RNAi feeding vectors from the Ahringer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamath et al., 2003</xref>) (for <italic>unc-22, akt-1, skn-1, rict-1,</italic> and <italic>let-363</italic>) or ORFeome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rual et al., 2004</xref>) (for <italic>sinh-</italic>1, <italic>sgk-1</italic>, and <italic>pkc-2</italic>) libraries. Bacteria were plated in a uniform lawn on 6 cm NGM plates with the addition of 25 μg/mL carbenicillin and 1 mM IPTG. To avoid maternal effect, embryonic lethality, and early developmental defects from RNAi, as well as starvation associated with standard L1 synchronization, <italic>str-44</italic>::T2A-mNeonGreen animals were allowed to lay eggs on standard NGM plates seeded with OP50, then the hatched progeny were washed with M9 onto feeding RNAi plates at L1-L2 stage. Animals were imaged as young adults (~2 days later) only when <italic>unc-22</italic> positive control plates produced twitching animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chemotaxis assays</title><p>Chemotaxis assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann et al., 1993</xref>). Assays were conducted on square grid plates of assay agar, poured the night before the assay. Assays were conducted in a 22°C incubator set to 40% humidity. One-day-old adult animals were washed off growth plates using S. Basal buffer, then washed twice more with S. Basal and once with water. A total of 50–200 animals were placed on the chemotaxis plates. Two 1 μL spots of odor were placed on one side of the plate, and two 1 μL spots of ethanol on the opposite side (ethanol was used as the dilutant for all odors). Two 1 μL spots of 1 M sodium azide were placed on either end of the plate to paralyze animals at the odor source. Animals navigated the plate for 60 min (except 90 min for the <italic>tax-4; odr-7</italic> worms and those in that background, as their locomotion was slower). Plates were then placed in a 4°C cold room to arrest movement. The assay was scored by counting animals that arrived at the odor, at the control ethanol spot, or elsewhere in the plate. This was used to calculate a Chemotaxis Index (#<sub>odor</sub> – #<sub>ethanol</sub>)/(#<sub>odor</sub> + #<sub>ethanol</sub> + #<sub>other</sub>). Worms in the center of the assay plate that did not move from their starting position were excluded.</p><p>Odor concentrations used were as follows: 1:1000 diacetyl, 1:1000 methyl pyrazine, 10 mg/mL pyrazine, 1:10 butyl acetate, 1:10 propyl acetate, 1:100 hexyl acetate, 1:100 ethyl acetate, and 1:100 isoamyl acetate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Calcium imaging in freely moving animals</title><p>In vivo calcium imaging of AWA::GCaMP2.2b in freely moving animals was carried out on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S microscope with a ×2/0.10NA Plan Apo objective and an Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus sCMOS camera. Blue light application to animals from an X-Cite 120LED system was 10 ms for each exposure, at a frame rate of 10 fps. For these experiments, slides were prepared by placing a 2 μL drop of OP50 (OD600 = 2) on a minimally thick NGM pad, then a custom cut PDMS corral was placed on the pad. Five animals were picked (without food) to the center of the corral (off food) and covered with a coverslip, then immediately imaged. Animals began outside the field of view of the objective lens and were allowed to freely navigate into the bacterial lawn within the field of view. Individual slides were imaged for no longer than 30 min. Background-subtracted intensity values for AWA were extracted from each video frame using custom ImageJ macros, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). Food patch encounter frames were manually annotated. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as (fluorescence – baseline)/baseline, where fluorescence is a 10 frame (1 s) moving median and baseline is the 5th percentile fluorescence throughout the recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Calcium imaging during odor delivery in immobilized animals</title><p>Imaging of neurons was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chute et al., 2019</xref>). AWA::GCaMP2.2b animals were picked as larval stage 4 (L4) hermaphrodites the day prior to imaging and singled onto an NGM plate seeded with OP50. The animals were kept at 20°C for 16 hr. The next day they were imaged as young adults. Animals were loaded into a modified PDMS olfactory chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reilly et al., 2017</xref>) only allowing the animal’s nose to be subjected to the solution. Well-fed worms were transferred directly from the NGM plate into the chip. Fasted animals were transferred to an unseeded NGM plate 3 hr prior to imaging and then transferred into the chip. Animals were imaged under ×40 magnification for two 30 s trials. Each trial consisted of a 5 s period prior to stimulation, a 10 s odor pulse, and a 15 s recording post stimulation. The recording was performed in Micro-Manager recording TIFF stacks at 10 frames/s, exciting the neuron with blue light at 470 nm. A minimum of 10 animals (or 20 trials) was captured for each condition.</p><p>The solutions used for imaging were all made in S. Basal (100.103 mM NaCl, 5.741 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4,</sub> 44.090 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.0129 mM cholesterol in H<sub>2</sub>O). The solvent control solution was 1 mM tetramisole, 0.3 µM fluorescein in S. Basal. The flow control solution, not exposed to the worm but controlling the movement of the solutions in the olfactory chip, was 1 mM tetramisole, 0.6 µM fluorescein in S. Basal. The stimuli were 10<sup>–6</sup> propyl acetate or butyl acetate, prepared by serial dilutions in solvent control solution.</p><p>Images were analyzed using ImageJ software. For AWA imaging, the fluorescence change in the soma was measured and selected as the region of interest. The fluorescence of an equally sized region of interest was captured from the background. The fluorescence of the background was then subtracted from the neuron for each frame to obtain background-subtracted fluorescence. F/F<sub>0</sub> was then calculated by dividing each frame by F<sub>0</sub> (average fluorescence from seconds 2–3 of each trial). This adjusted F/F<sub>0</sub> value was corrected to be the percent change in fluorescence by the following equation: (F/F<sub>0</sub> – 1) * 100%.</p><p>The maximum change in fluorescence was calculated for each trial. The maximum value for the ‘Pre’ is defined as the maximum percent change in fluorescence from 0.0 to 4.9 s. The ‘Stim’ period was 5.0–15.0 s. The ‘Post’ period was 15.1–29.9 s.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of neuronal genes whose expression is altered by fasting.</title><p>Table of genes that are upregulated or downregulated in neurons in fasted animals.

and chemosensory responses to shifts in food availability. The authors show that prolonged fasting broadly alters gene expression in food-sensing neurons, thereby altering foraging behavior and chemosensory responses to food. The fasting-induced genes include many chemoreceptors, one of which mediates responses to specific volatile components of food. Finally, they show that food controls expression of a fasting-induced chemoreceptor via multiple external (i.e., sensory) and internal (potentially metabolic) cues.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79557.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/002pd6e78</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Crickmore</surname><given-names>Mike</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03vek6s52</institution-id><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.27.489714">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.27.489714v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mike Crickmore (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers consider the work well executed and nicely presented. Major concerns address a few outstanding issues to clarify or strengthen specific points in the manuscript, all of which should be easily achieved.</p><p>1. The authors provide several results supporting the idea that increased str-44 and srd-28 expression drive fasting-induced changes in AWA chemosensory responses to food and foraging behavior. The authors should revise the text to indicate that other fasting regulated AWA genes may also contribute to these changes. Alternatively, if they want to more strongly implicate STR-44 and SRD-28's function, they should analyze the effect of mutations inactivating these chemoreceptors on fasting-induced changes in AWA responses and foraging behavior.</p><p>2. The authors argue that the presence of food inhibits STR-44 expression via increased insulin signaling. Specifically, they suggest that a specific insulin-like ligand (DAF-28) mediates the inhibitory effects of food on STR-44 expression (Figure 4C). These results should be interpreted more cautiously. The daf-28(sa191) mutation used in this analysis is not a loss of function allele. Instead, this dominant allele constitutively induces the unfolded protein response in the ASI neuron (Kulalurt, 2013). Thus, the phenotype observed in this strain may not result from a simple loss of ASI secretion of DAF-28. This analysis also does not indicate which cell type (ASI or other neurons) produces DAF-28 to inhibit STR-44 expression.</p><p>3. DAF-16/FOXO transcriptional activity in AWA is argued to be a node of convergence for multiple signals regulating STR-44 expression. However, transgenes expressing DAF-16 selectively in AWA did not fully rescue the daf-16 mutant defects (Figure 4C). The authors should revise the text to indicate that DAF-16 may function in both AWA and other cell types to regulate str-44 expression. Alternatively, the author could strengthen the DAF-16 site of action analysis by using other techniques for AWA-specific knockout, knockdown, or proteolytic degradation.</p><p>4. The authors distinguish between different components of food (volatile odors, taste, mechanosensory responses, and nutrient value) by using different food sources, inedible (aztreonam treated) food, and exposure to food on the lid of petri dishes. While generally supportive of their conclusions, the authors should describe other potential interpretations of these results. For example, the sensory experience of chemically treated bacteria or food on the petri lid may not be strictly identical to swimming in a bacterial lawn.</p><p>5. Throughout the text, the authors propose that food inhibition of STR-44 expression is a consequence of convergent food-associated chemosensory cues and internal state (i.e. hunger or metabolic changes). It would be helpful for the readers if the authors more clearly explained these competing ideas for how food regulates STR-44 expression and behavior. Which specific phenotypes suggest that worms exhibit &quot;hunger&quot; rather than long-term sensory adaptation to food deprivation? Which results most strongly support the idea of an internal state regulating STR-44 expression (rictor function in the intestine)? Which results most strongly indicate that fasting-induced metabolic changes are relevant?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I don't love rescaling the Y-axis, but see why the authors feel the need to do it.

Here below are a few specific points that should be addressed to clarify the manuscript and potentially further strengthen the scientific conclusions:</p><p>1. Since a major claim of the proposed signalling model is to place DAF-16 as a downstream convergence node of multiple pathways, the authors should determine if DAF-16 works only in AWA for regulating str-44 expression. At present, this view is supported by an AWA-specific rescue of daf-16 mutation. However, the effect seems to be partial, which leaves open the possibility that DAF-16 might also work in additional tissues. The authors should consider the following two experiments: (i) use a control rescue with daf-16 promoter, to see if a full rescue can be obtained; (ii) perform an AWA-specific knockdown of daf-16.</p><p>2. Data in Figure 3 Supplement 1 and Figure 4B, should be presented and statistically analysed together, in order to highlight the fasting effect. The opposing behavior of ASI in fed versus food deprived will then need to be discussed (and the scheme in Figure 4G, reconsidered).</p><p>3. Line 40, remove 'recent' as long-lasting internal states could reflect experiences across timescales.</p><p>4. Figure 1F, FigS1F: Without the experiment with inedible bacteria for various strains the authors cannot dissect the contribution of odor and metabolic components. In line 195, 'metabolic' word should be removed because the effect on food could be due to nutrient value plus touch (sensory effect) of food. In addition, the authors should keep in mind (and warn the reader) that it is virtually impossible to judge if the sensory experience of an odor coming from the lid or from the contacting bacterial mass is really identical. Even if no convincing alternative is available, it is perhaps still slightly regrettable that aztreonam-based and related experiments aiming at dissecting the mode of action of food are becoming standards in the field, because most of them are very difficult to control and interpret. The conclusions need to be phrased very cautiously.</p><p>5. To conclusively show that STR-44 and SRD-28 detect odors in AWA, authors should perform calcium imaging of AWA in response to food or relevant odors either in freely moving or immobilized worms, comparing wt and these GPCR mutants.</p><p>6. Figure 4C, 5B, 6A, 6C: the representation of statistical comparison is confusing and should be improved.</p><p>7. Figure 4E: the authors partially blocked str-44 induction when inhibiting AWA activity using HisCl channel. This indicates that AWA depolarisation is partially required, but cannot distinguish between direct effects of autonomous cell activity (including, e.g., ensuing intracellular calcium signaling) and indirect effects implicating cell-to-cell communication and a potential feedback loop (such as via AIA). To discriminate between these two possibilities, the authors should also block synaptic transmission of AWA using TeTx to dissect potential feedback mechanisms that could change str-44 expression.</p><p>8. Figure 4G: no data are provided that support the notion that DAF-28 actually originates from ASI in the regulation of str-44. Figure and text should be revised accordingly, or AWA-specific daf-28 manipulation experiments should be carried out.</p><p>9. Line 388, authors should refer to the data source that was used to conclude about AWA connectivity.</p><p>10. Most of the mechanisms dissected in the study act to inhibit the increase of str-44 expression on food. The result of raga-1 mutation is particularly intriguing. Do authors think TORC-1 dependent positive signal could alter the expression of str-44 after starvation? To further dissect the contribution of TORC-1 vs TORC-2 authors can perform a choice test experiment (Figure 5D in rict-1, raga-1 fed and starved condition). Authors should at least discuss the contribution of &quot;positively acting&quot; pathways that may be activated upon starvation. At present, the manuscript seems to be somewhat biased toward inhibitory pathways engaged in food.</p><p>11. The 'lateral signaling' nomenclature in this context, even if broadly and explicitly defined by the authors, might be misleading. Indeed, the impact of sensory neurons could be largely mediated by ascending feedback from AIA (it would be unconventional to consider AIA to be lateral to AWA). There are precedents for this type of ascending feedback (see PMC2937567, for example), and no data in the present study seems to exclude this possibility. The fact that AIA::TeTx nearly abolishes fasting-evoked str-44 expression increase (perhaps the most effective cell-specific manipulation reported in the article) is also compatible with this view. Actually, it seems that the layout of the model in Figure 4G was created with this idea in mind. The authors should provide a deeper discussion about this aspect, and re-consider the use of the 'lateral signaling' terminology, which evokes a more direct mode of action. In this context, the experiment suggested above under point 7 might be really helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors conclude that str-44 is a chemoreceptor for propyl acetate and butyl acetate, the conclusion could be strengthened by conducting the chemosensory assays using an str-44 mutant which would show that mutations only impair propyl acetate and butyl acetate attraction.</p><p>Similarly, using str-44 mutants for the calcium imaging experiments would strengthen the conclusion that the responses to cues detected by the receptor is responsible for the increase in activity in AWA of fasted animals (Figure 2C, D).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79557.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers consider the work well executed and nicely presented.

The authors provide several results supporting the idea that increased str-44 and srd-28 expression drive fasting-induced changes in AWA chemosensory responses to food and foraging behavior. The authors should revise the text to indicate that other fasting regulated AWA genes may also contribute to these changes. Alternatively, if they want to more strongly implicate STR-44 and SRD-28's function, they should analyze the effect of mutations inactivating these chemoreceptors on fasting-induced changes in AWA responses and foraging behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We substantially revised the text to indicate that other upregulated genes may contribute to fasting induced changes in AWA activity and animal behavior, wherever relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors argue that the presence of food inhibits STR-44 expression via increased insulin signaling. Specifically, they suggest that a specific insulin-like ligand (DAF-28) mediates the inhibitory effects of food on STR-44 expression (Figure 4C). These results should be interpreted more cautiously. The daf-28(sa191) mutation used in this analysis is not a loss of function allele. Instead, this dominant allele constitutively induces the unfolded protein response in the ASI neuron (Kulalurt, 2013). Thus, the phenotype observed in this strain may not result from a simple loss of ASI secretion of DAF-28.
