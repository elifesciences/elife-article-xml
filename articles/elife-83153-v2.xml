polyadenylation yields many mRNA isoforms whose 3’ termini occur disproportionately in clusters within 3’ untranslated regions. Previously, we showed that profiles of poly(A) site usage are regulated by the rate of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II (Geisberg et al., 2020). Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates confer an upstream-shifted poly(A) profile, whereas fast Pol II strains confer a downstream-shifted poly(A) profile. Within yeast isoform clusters, these shifts occur steadily from one isoform to the next across nucleotide distances. In contrast, the shift between clusters – from the last isoform of one cluster to the first isoform of the next – is much less pronounced, even over large distances. GC content in a region 13–30 nt downstream from isoform clusters correlates with their sensitivity to Pol II elongation rate. In human cells, the upstream shift caused by a slow Pol II mutant also occurs continuously at single nucleotide resolution within clusters but not between them. Pol II occupancy increases just downstream of poly(A) sites, suggesting a linkage between reduced elongation rate and cluster formation. These observations suggest that (1) Pol II elongation speed affects the nucleotide-level dwell time allowing polyadenylation to occur, (2) poly(A) site clusters are linked to the local elongation rate, and hence do not arise simply by intrinsically imprecise cleavage and polyadenylation of the RNA substrate, (3) DNA sequence elements can affect Pol II elongation and poly(A) profiles, and (4) the cleavage/polyadenylation and Pol II elongation complexes are spatially, and perhaps physically, coupled so that polyadenylation occurs rapidly upon emergence of the nascent RNA from the Pol II elongation complex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>3' end formation</kwd><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>transcriptional elongation</kwd><kwd>cleavage/polyadenylation machinery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM30186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Struhl</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Struhl</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bentley</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cleavage/polyadenylation, the process generating mRNA 3' ends, is linked at the nucleotide level to the position of RNA polymerase II, indicating a spatial coupling so polyadenylation occurs rapidly upon emergence of the nascent RNA from the Pol II elongation complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 3’ ends of eukaryotic mRNAs are generated during the process of transcriptional elongation by cleavage of the nascent transcript downstream of the coding region followed by addition of a poly(A) tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Proudfoot et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tian and Manley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>). Formation of 3’ ends is mediated by a multiprotein cleavage/polyadenylation (CpA) complex that performs both steps. Alternative polyadenylation gives rise to many 3’ mRNA isoforms differing by the position at which the poly(A) tail is added. The poly(A) profile of a typical yeast gene has ~50 mRNA isoforms with 3’ endpoints occurring within an ‘end zone’ of ~200 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). The 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) is a modular entity that is sufficient to determine the poly(A) profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lui et al., 2022</xref>). Although mRNA isoforms with neighboring 3’ ends usually have similar properties, they can differ dramatically with respect to mRNA stability, structure throughout the 3’ UTR, and association with Pab1, the poly(A)-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moqtaderi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although polyadenylation occurs at numerous sites within the 3’ UTR, it rarely occurs within coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>) and introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berg et al., 2012</xref>), even though these are usually much larger. This apparently paradoxical observation has implications for the specificity and mechanism of the CpA machinery, and hence, the poly(A) profile. Polyadenylation in yeast cells is associated with a degenerate sequence motif consisting of a long AU-rich stretch, followed by short U-rich sequences that flank several A residues immediately downstream of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo and Sherman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>). It has been suggested that long AU-rich stretches, which are not encountered until after coding regions, are important for restricting polyadenylation to 3’ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lui et al., 2022</xref>). In metazoan mRNAs, an AAUAAA sequence is specifically recognized by the CpA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schönemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), and it contributes significantly to determining where polyadenylation occurs. However, given its high frequency in the transcriptome, AAUAAA cannot be the only determinant of poly(A) sites.</p><p>The large number of 3’ mRNA isoforms for individual genes indicates that the CpA machinery has relatively low sequence specificity. In addition, as previously noted and shown explicitly here, 3’ isoform endpoints tend to occur in clusters within the 3’ UTR. Such clustering, which is related to microheterogeneity, is usually explained by imprecision of the CpA machinery in the vicinity of a sequence recognition element (e.g. AAUAAA) and/or a preferred cleavage site.</p><p>Polyadenylation is intimately connected to the process of transcriptional elongation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nag et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pinto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortazar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goering et al., 2021</xref>), and transcriptional pausing increases polyadenylation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yonaha and Proudfoot, 1999</xref>). An intact RNA tether between RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the poly(A) site is required for efficient 3’ end processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rigo et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, cleavage of the nascent mRNA not only leads to polyadenylation but is also the key step that initiates the processes of transcriptional termination and subsequent export of polyadenylated mRNAs from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Connelly and Manley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">West et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2006</xref>). In general, each nascent mRNA molecule is cleaved and polyadenylated just once, so the poly(A) profile represents an ensemble of independent events. However, at some human genes, it has been suggested that longer isoforms can be retained in the nuclear matrix and be processed into shorter poly(A) isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). In considering the link between elongation and polyadenylation, a key issue is the location of elongating Pol II, and hence, the length of accessible RNA at the time of cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation.</p><p>The poly(A) profiles of most yeast genes are altered in cells expressing Pol II derivatives with altered elongation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geisberg et al., 2020</xref>). In all cases, the same poly(A) sites are used but to different extents. Two slow Pol II mutants each cause a 5’ shift in poly(A) site use, with the slower mutant giving rise to a greater upstream shift. In contrast, each of two fast Pol II mutants causes a 3’ shift in preferred poly(A) sites, although the magnitude of this shift is less pronounced, and fewer genes are affected. These altered poly(A) profiles are due to the Pol II elongation rate because strains with reduced Pol II processivity but normal elongation rates have poly(A) profiles indistinguishable from wild-type strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geisberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yague-Sanz et al., 2020</xref>). Yeast cells undergoing the diauxic response have poly(A) profiles remarkably like those mediated by slow Pol II mutants, indicating the physiological relevance of Pol II elongation rate to poly(A) profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geisberg et al., 2020</xref>). Transcription slows down in the vicinity of poly(A) sites, suggesting a functional link between 3’ end processing and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parua et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortazar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eaton et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, elongation rate in metazoans affects alternative poly(A) site choice, with slow Pol II mutants favoring the use of more upstream sites, consistent with a ‘window of opportunity’ model of poly(A) site choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goering et al., 2021</xref>). However, the fine structure of metazoan poly(A) site clustering and how it is affected by elongation speed have not been investigated.</p><p>The shifts in poly(A) profiles in strains expressing fast or slow Pol II mutants could occur gradually or in jumps throughout the 3’ UTR. Here, we address these possibilities by measuring the ratio of 3’ mRNA isoform levels in the speed-mutant vs. the wild-type Pol II in yeast and human cells. Unexpectedly, in both organisms, the mutant:wild-type ratio of isoform expression changes steadily on a nucleotide basis within isoform clusters, whereas it is only minimally changed between clusters. In yeast cells, DNA sequence preferences 13–30 nt downstream of isoform clusters suggest that DNA sequence elements can affect Pol II elongation, subsequent polyadenylation, and the formation of 3’ mRNA isoform clusters. In human cells, Pol II occupancy increases just downstream of poly(A) sites, suggesting a linkage between reduced elongation rate and isoform clusters. Taken together, our results suggest a spatial, and perhaps physical, coupling between the CpA and Pol II elongation complexes, such that cleavage and polyadenylation occur almost immediately upon emergence/accessibility of the RNA from the Pol II elongation complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3’ mRNA isoforms frequently occur in clusters of closely-spaced poly(A) sites</title><p>The poly(A) profile of an individual gene is defined by the relative steady-state expression levels of all of its 3’ mRNA isoforms.

In yeast, 3’ mRNA isoform endpoints occur across a ~200 nt window within the 3’ UTR. Within this ‘end zone’, visual inspection suggests that isoforms are not randomly distributed but rather appear to occur in clusters of closely-spaced poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For reasons to become apparent, we formalize this observation by considering the likelihood of cluster formation in randomly distributed isoforms for each gene.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Isoforms in yeast 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) are clustered.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Polyadenylation profile of <italic>ATG27</italic>, a typical yeast gene, illustrating that major isoforms appear in clusters (represented as <italic>C<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>C<sub>2</sub>,</italic> and <italic>C<sub>3</sub></italic> in red lettering).

Our analyses are restricted to ‘major isoforms’ that are expressed at &gt;5% of the level of the gene’s most highly expressed isoform. Major 3’ isoforms account for &gt;97% of overall steady-state mRNA expression. The prevalence of clustered isoform endpoints in each 3’ UTR is far higher than that obtained by randomly distributing the same number of major isoforms over the same window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The same result is obtained when the definition of a cluster is changed by varying the maximal inter-isoform distance from three to seven nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, 3’ UTRs containing larger numbers of isoforms give rise to wider clusters but also to more complex cluster patterns that are exceedingly unlikely to be observed by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Compared to the poly(A) profile in wild-type cells, poly(A) profiles in slow Pol II strains (‘slow’: F1086S; ‘slower’: H1085Q) are shifted in an upstream (ORF-proximal) direction, whereas poly(A) profiles in fast Pol II strains (‘fast’: L1101S; ‘faster’: E1103G) exhibit subtle downstream shifts. Some genes shift poly(A) profiles in both fast and slow Pol II strains.

Within isoform clusters, both the ‘slower’:wild-type and the ‘slow’:wild-type ratios continuously decrease from the most ORF-proximal to the most ORF-distal isoforms; i.e., the most downstream isoform within a cluster typically has the lowest slow:wild-type ratio. Remarkably, these decreases in the slow:wild-type ratios occur continuously at the nucleotide level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, the intra-cluster slope is steeper (i.e. the ratio decreases more rapidly) in the strain with the ‘slower’ Pol II derivative as compared to the ‘slow’ derivative.

This observation strongly suggests a time dependence in which there is a limited opportunity for poly(A) site cleavage to occur at a given site in the RNA before Pol II continues its journey downstream. When the active site of Pol II is at a particular nucleotide location, the longer dwell time of a slow Pol II allows for a longer ‘window of opportunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley, 2014</xref>) for cleavage to take place at a potential poly(A) site on the extruded RNA. Faster Pol II, on the other hand, would have a shorter window of opportunity, leading to reduced cleavage at that site.</p><p>In general, every mRNA molecule that is cleaved and polyadenylated at a given site can no longer be polyadenylated at any site further downstream. Thus, on a population level, higher polyadenylation frequency at upstream sites means reduced use of downstream poly(A) sites, and lower polyadenylation frequency means increased use of downstream sites. An effect of Pol II elongation speed on cleavage at a given polyadenylation site therefore influences the use of downstream poly(A) sites. The conserved relationship between Pol II speed and poly(A) site choice within clusters suggests that Pol II elongation and polyadenylation are mechanistically linked at the nucleotide level.</p><p>The Pol II elongation rate has a small, distance-independent effect on the relative levels of isoforms that define the boundaries of adjacent clusters. This indicates that the time-dependent mechanism is linked to 3’ end processing and not Pol II elongation per se. Moreover, the upstream shift of isoforms between clusters in a slow Pol II mutant strain is nearly comparable (less than a twofold difference) to that of a single nucleotide within clusters. We do not understand why the magnitude of upstream shift increases slightly, but continuously, with increasing isoform spacings from one to five nucleotides. One possibility is the existence of low-level isoforms arising from inefficient CpA events that occur between major isoforms; these would increase the magnitude of the apparent shift in the same manner as occurs in isoform clusters.</p><p>The timing mechanism, although linked to poly(A) site selection, does not address (1) why poly(A) sites occur only at specific positions within the 3’ UTR, (2) why levels of 3’ isoforms in wild-type cells vary widely and without an obvious pattern (e.g. a simple linear decrease) across a given 3’UTR, and (3) why polyadenylation is very strongly biased to the 3’ UTR even though coding regions are typically much longer than 3’ UTRs. Thus, the timing mechanism that explains the nucleotide-level link between elongation and CpA operates in concert with specificity elements (e.g. the AAUAAA sequence in mammalian mRNAs) that govern where polyadenylation can occur.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evidence that cleavage/polyadenylation occurs soon after the RNA exits the Pol II elongation complex</title><p>The nucleotide-level linkage between Pol II elongation rate and polyadenylation suggests that production of a 3’ isoform depends on the position of elongating Pol II. Specifically, if Pol II has traveled too far downstream from a polyadenylation site, it is hard to imagine how the Pol II elongation rate would affect activity of the CpA machinery at that site. Once Pol II has traversed the region, the CpA machinery does not go back to the most upstream site but instead tracks with elongating Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Licatalosi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glover-Cutter et al., 2008</xref>) and uses sites further downstream within the same cluster. Conversely, if the CpA machinery misses earlier opportunities to act, downstream positions are available to be used as polyadenylation sites. In principle, Pol II speed could affect the poly(A) profile by changing the amount of time for a nascent transcript to adopt a CpA-cleavable pre-mRNA structure before the emergence of more sequence upon Pol II passage makes other structures possible. However, the overall nucleotide-level link strongly suggests a direct connection of poly(A) site choice to Pol II elongation per se.</p><p>The nucleotide-level coupling of Pol II elongation to poly(A) site choice strongly suggests that co-transcriptional cleavage of the nascent mRNA can, and often does, occur soon after RNA exits the Pol II elongation complex and becomes accessible to the CpA complex. If, on the other hand, the cleavage reaction was slow relative to Pol II elongation, we would not expect to see an effect of elongation rate on cleavage site selection at single nucleotide resolution when Pol II is located much farther downstream from the poly(A) site. Presumably, the region of newly extruded pre-mRNA is still in proximity to the elongating Pol II complex, but just far enough away to allow for efficient binding of the CpA machinery and cleavage of the nascent transcript. However, mere RNA accessibility upon exit from the Pol II elongation complex is not sufficient, because local sequences favorable for cleavage by the CpA machinery are also required. These considerations do not preclude cleavage when Pol II has traversed far downstream from the poly(A) site, but such events are very unlikely to be influenced by Pol II speed.</p><p>The conclusion that the CpA complex acts soon after RNA exits the elongation complex echoes two other observations. First, co-transcriptional splicing can occur almost as soon as the 3’ splice site emerges from the Pol II RNA exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oesterreich et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the integrator endonuclease complex docks to the RNA exit site and opens to cleave nascent RNA about 20 nucleotides from the Pol II active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fianu et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, several subunits including the catalytic core of the integrator (INTS9/11) and CpA (CPSF100/73) complexes are homologous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baillat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that stereo-specific cleavage of the nascent transcript at a preferred position relative to the RNA exit channel might be conserved. In all three co-transcriptional events – splicing, integrator cleavage, and CpA, the processing site may be acted upon almost immediately after the RNA is exposed after Pol II passage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for microheterogeneity of poly(A) sites</title><p>It has long been observed, and explicitly shown here, that endpoints of 3’ mRNA isoforms are clustered. The prevailing interpretation of such ‘microheterogeneity’ of poly(A) sites is that it reflects imprecise cleavage and polyadenylation in the immediate vicinity of a single poly(A) site. Imprecise cleavage occurs in vitro on purified RNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 1995</xref>), reflecting the intrinsic properties of the CpA complex. However, the intrinsic activity of the CpA complex on RNA templates, by definition, is independent of Pol II elongation, so imprecise cleavage cannot explain why relative levels of 3’ mRNA isoforms within a cluster are strongly affected by the Pol II elongation rate. On the contrary, intrinsic imprecision of the CpA complex should yield the same relative utilization of poly(A) sites in wild-type and mutant Pol II cells. This effect of Pol II elongation rate on neighboring 3’ isoform levels also suggests that different poly(A) sites within a cluster largely reflect the stereo-positioning of the CpA complex with respect to the RNA, not intrinsic imprecision of the complex at a single location. The arguments against imprecise cleavage/polyadenylation dependent on distinct locations of the CpA complex relative to Pol II are particularly strong for isoform clusters that span a large distance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>DNA sequence elements and Pol II slowdown may contribute to the poly(A) profile via isoform clustering</title><p>Although polyadenylation is initiated by RNA cleavage and involves RNA sequence elements in the 3’ UTR, the importance of Pol II elongation suggests the possibility that DNA sequence elements might contribute to the polyadenylation profile. For example, a hypothetical DNA sequence element might provide an obstacle to the advancing polymerase, which should favor cleavage and polyadenylation at sites immediately upstream. In yeast, a GC-rich region linked with sensitivity to the elongation rate is located 13–30 bp downstream of isoform clusters and immediately downstream of the DNA bound by the Pol II elongation complex. Thus, we speculate that Pol II has difficulty traversing some GC-rich regions, such that the increased dwell time at these regions leads to increased CpA activity and clustering of 3’ endpoints in locations where RNA becomes exposed upon Pol II passage.</p><p>In this view, nucleotide-level elongation of slow Pol II is more impaired than wild-type Pol II by these GC-rich regions, leading to a greater utilization of the most ORF-proximal isoforms (and a correspondingly faster decline in more distal isoform usage) within a cluster. Conversely, fast Pol II is less impaired by high GC content at +13 to +30, resulting in greater usage of distal isoforms within clusters. Interestingly, both naturally occurring and synthetic GC-rich sequences block elongating Pol II in vitro and in vivo, resulting in increased polyadenylation at upstream sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yonaha and Proudfoot, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yonaha and Proudfoot, 2000</xref>). Whatever the precise mechanism, our results also suggest that, in wild-type cells, DNA sequences that affect Pol II elongation contribute to the formation of 3’ isoform clusters.</p><p>In human cells, NET-seq analysis reveals increased Pol II occupancy 10–25 nt downstream of poly(A) sites, presumably reflecting decreased Pol II speed in this region. This local decrease in Pol II speed could be due to DNA sequences within this region. Alternatively, it might be caused by recognition of and/or tighter binding to the AAUAAA (and/or other element) by the CpA machinery, resulting in altered elongation properties of the Pol II machinery. By either mechanism, the reduction in Pol II elongation rate in this region would increase the Pol II dwell time, and hence, contribute to isoform clustering. Whatever the mechanism, increased Pol II occupancy (and hence, Pol II slowdown) is specific to CpA and is not observed at intronic AATAAA sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A model for the link between Pol II elongation and polyadenylation</title><p>As Pol II traverses the gene, there is a continuing decision to elongate further downstream or to cleave and polyadenylate the mRNA, and hence, begin the process of termination. Polyadenylation is largely restricted to the 3’ UTR, yet paradoxically, it occurs to various extents at many sites within the 3’ UTR. The polyadenylation decision depends on both RNA and DNA sequence elements, and it begins when the RNA exits from the Pol II elongation complex and becomes accessible to the CpA machinery.</p><p>To explain the nucleotide-level linkage between Pol II elongation and poly(A) site choice, we suggest that the two complexes are spatially, and likely physically, coupled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This stereochemical coupling implies that the Pol II elongation and CpA machineries are essentially traveling as a unit, consistent with genome association profiles and Pol II interaction studies of CpA factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Licatalosi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glover-Cutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carminati et al., 2022</xref>). In this context, cleavage would occur at a constrained (and possibly a fixed) distance from the position of the active site of elongating Pol II.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the link between Pol II elongation rate and poly(A) formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nucleotide-level link between Pol II elongation and cleavage/polyadenylation (CpA). As the Pol II machinery (dark blue) elongates the nascent RNA one nucleotide at a time, upstream sequences of the newly synthesized RNA strand become exposed, leading the CpA complex (gold) to cleave and polyadenylate the nascent RNA at preferred residues (purple). The Pol II and CpA machineries are spatially, and likely physically, coupled so that cleavage occurs at a constrained distance from the position of the active site of elongating Pol II (black arrow). (<bold>B</bold>) Gene-level view of CpA. Rapidly elongating Pol II (light blue) traverses the gene body and 3’ untranslated region (UTR) until it encounters an AT-rich region (gold) and/or a GC-rich stretch downstream of clusters (red), which cause it to slow down (dark blue). The nascent RNA (green) extruded out of the slowing elongating Pol II complex gets cleaved and polyadenylated (scissors) at one of the preferred positions within the cluster (purple). The Pol II complex then continues to elongate a short and unstable non-coding RNA that is endonucleolytically degraded by Xrn2 (gray) and eventually terminates at a downstream position (stop sign).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83153-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We imagine the CpA process as occurring in two steps: recognition followed by cleavage of the nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, upon transcriptional initiation, Pol II elongation (perhaps together with the CpA machinery) continues unabated until an RNA sequence element(s) in the nascent transcript is exposed and bound by the CpA machinery. RNA sequence elements recognized by the CpA machinery include AAUAAA in many metazoan mRNAs and possibly AU-rich stretches in yeast mRNAs, but other ill-defined sequences are also required for efficient binding such that polyadenylation discriminates efficiently between 3’ UTRs and coding regions. Recognition and hence binding by the CpA machinery to newly exposed sequence elements make the nascent RNA permissive for cleavage and subsequent polyadenylation. More efficient CpA binding functionally couples this complex to the elongating Pol II machinery, possibly slowing Pol II elongation to facilitate the RNA cleavage step.</p><p>Second, the coupled CpA and Pol II elongation machineries travel one nucleotide at a time, making a CpA decision at each nucleotide location. In the most extreme version of the model, the nucleotide location of the Pol II active site corresponds to a single nucleotide position where cleavage can occur. In a less stringent model, cleavage occurs within a short window that is determined by the location of the Pol II active site. The level of cleavage and polyadenylation at each position depends on the sequence in the vicinity of that position and the time that Pol II spends at the constrained downstream location. On a population basis, the level of cleavage and polyadenylation at a given position causes a corresponding reduction in the amount of elongating Pol II capable of polyadenylation at more downstream positions. If polyadenylation does not occur at a particular position, Pol II travels to the next position(s), having missed the opportunity for polyadenylation at positions farther upstream. Pol II speed mutants cause changes in the amount of time Pol II spends at each position, thus resulting in nucleotide-level shifts in polyadenylation patterns.</p><p>An interesting feature of this model is that CpA at a given site is inefficient, likely due to the short dwell time during which the Pol II elongation machinery is at the constrained location. As a consequence of this constraint, yeast and human genes typically have a large number of 3’ mRNA isoforms. We speculate that the nucleotide-level link between Pol II elongation and polyadenylation evolved to generate multiple 3’ isoforms that have different functional properties.</p><p>The above model does not explain the few atypical 3’ UTRs in yeast and human cells in which slow Pol II derivatives lead to a downstream shift, nor the 3’ UTRs and clusters whose poly(A) patterns are unaffected by Pol II elongation rate. In addition, and as discussed above, it does not exclude other mechanisms that could contribute to the poly(A) pattern. However, these alternative mechanisms do not explain the striking nucleotide-level relationship between Pol II elongation and polyadenylation. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the process modeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> makes a major contribution to the polyadenylation pattern in yeast and human cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Parental strain JGY2000 (<italic>MATa his3-∆0 leu2-∆0 met15-∆0 rpb1::RPB1-FRB rpl13::RPL13-FK512</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geisberg et al., 2014</xref>) and Pol II mutant strains JZY5 (‘slower’), JZY6 (‘slow’), JZY14 (‘fast’), and JZY15 (‘faster’) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geisberg et al., 2020</xref>).

Any read for which the first non-random nt was not a T, corresponding to an A at the 3’ end of the sequenced mRNA fragment, was discarded.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bin Tian (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address the single major concern noted by Reviewer #1 that relates to calculating cluster difference. This alternative analysis could uncover differences not noted in the initial submission.</p><p>2) Using modifications to the text and figures, please address the concerns of clarity raised by Reviewers #2 and #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors used the last cleavage site of one cluster and the first cleavage site of the downstream cluster to define usage differences between clusters. Because each cluster can be considered as one cleavage/polyadenylation site, they need to use all sites in each cluster to calculate between cluster differences. In other words, they need to use the sum/median for calculation instead of the last and first site of each cluster. Based on the examples presented in the paper, the sum/median-based calculation should be different than their last-first site calculation, and would probably show some trend for site usage changes between clusters.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1. Abstract: The meaning of &quot;at the nucleotide level&quot; when referring to the upstream and downstream shifts is not clear to me. Please elaborate.</p><p>2. Abstract: The sentence &quot;GC content in a region 13-30 nt downstream from isoform clusters is linked to Pol II elongation rate&quot; must be the other way around.</p><p>3. Results: The term &quot;nucleotide-level speed sensitivity&quot; is not clear to me. Explain the meaning of this.</p><p>4. Materials and methods: A reference for 3' READS is missing in the section &quot;Computational processing of data sets&quot;.</p><p>5. Since the speed of elongation of Pol II is central for the data obtained and conclusions drawn, it would be important to actually measure the speed of elongation by the slow, fast, and wt Pol II used in these studies within the genes analyzed. There are techniques estimating elongation rates within all expressed genes using DRB to &quot;synchronize&quot; transcription by loading Pol II onto genes and their pause sites followed by a release and metabolic labeling of nascent RNA. An example of this can be found in Veloso et al. Genome Research 26:896-905, 2014.</p><p>6. Figure 1A: It is not clear where the primary data for the frequency distribution of clusters in this figure is located. Please clarify. Are there error bars for the figure? Also, I thought that a &quot;cluster&quot; by definition must contain multiple isoforms so why can one isoform in the figure makes up a cluster? Please clarify.</p><p>7. Figure 2A: It would be helpful to have a gene map of the 3' end of gene SEC72 so that we could see where this region of clusters is located. What does the numbering of the X-axis refer to? How is the ratio on the bottom track related to the tracks above? They do not seem to line up for the SEC72 gene but they do for the CTR1 gene. Please explain.</p><p>8. Figure 2B: Looks like this data is repeated in Figure 3C where data for both fast and slow Pol II are presented, and it makes more sense there. Thus, Figures 2B and 3B could be deleted.</p><p>9. Figure 5: Are there error bars and estimates of significance for these figures?</p><p>10. Figure 6A: These data panels are difficult for me to interpret. Are we looking at 3' UTR regions of specific genes? What is the take-home message of these data?</p><p>11. Figure 6C: The statement &quot;DNA region linked to cluster formation lies immediately downstream of transcribing Pol II&quot; makes no sense to me since all the sequences within a transcribed gene will at some point be &quot;downstream of transcribing Pol II.</p><p>12. Figure 7A&amp;B: The reader is given very little help deciphering the meaning of these figures and what their significance is. Is it that the occupancy of wt or mutant Pol II is similar and that there is less occupancy at AT regions and accumulations of Pol II downstream of poly(A) sites but not in introns following AT-rich regions?</p><p>13. Figure 8: These illustrations need to be improved and made more professional looking.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, I found the study to be an excellent extension of the prior work. Having said this, my main concern is the clarity of the writing and figure presentation. The authors would benefit from clearly describing what is being done (and not relying on the reader to have read their prior paper) and making figures more clearly presented. Below, I provide suggestions.</p><p>1. I find figure 1 to be confusing. The text lays out relatively clear definitions of clusters and isoforms and the title of the Figure 1 legend states that yeast 3'UTRs are clustered – yet the data presented in Figure 1 are more focused on frequency and cluster patterns of genes rather than providing the reader with a visual representation of how clusters and isoforms are defined. Since much of the paper relies on histogram measurements of clustering (e.g. Figure 2A), can the authors add a panel in Figure 1 to show representative examples of clustering and isoforms – perhaps disparate representative examples?</p><p>2. Along the same lines of clarity, while I appreciate that this is a 'continued findings' manuscript derived from a previous paper, the authors immediately describe isoforms and clusters but fail to actually detail what type of experiment was conducted. The beginning of the results should briefly outline 3READS to make it clear what is being measured (similar to how figure 4 data is initially described but with more detail).</p><p>3. The two examples in Figure 2A are confusing to me. The CTR1 gene is crystal clear in my mind and agrees with the wording in the text, however, the SEC72 gene doesn't line up well and it seems that some peaks are ignored in the ratio plot. Also, a minor point, but it might make sense to create a dotted line in the ratio plot from 1.0 to denote unchanged.</p><p>4. Equally confusing is why the authors have selected showing two gene examples of the slower mutant compared to wt but are not showing the polyA patterns for the slow mutant for these genes as well. Given that 2b highlights differences at the genome scale, the authors should show gene-specific examples for both strains as well as wt.</p><p>5. For figure 2b, it is difficult to assess the statistical differences between slow and slower, which is important because the authors point out differences between the two as meaningful. Can the authors comment on the statistical significance and how that was calculated?</p><p>6. Comment #4 is applicable to the fast or faster mutants versus wt shown in Figure 3a. Examples of Fast, faster, and wt should be shown.</p><p>7. The authors comment at the end of the figure 4 results that 'importantly, the nucleotide-level decrease within clusters observed for R749…' but no data is shown to support this assertion. Can the authors construct a panel to represent why this claim is being made or simply remove the statement?</p><p>8. Figure 6C makes an important point but there is a lost opportunity by the authors to make this point pictorially clearer. The authors could consider having an outline of an RNAPII complex on the portion of the template protected (and increasing the flanking regions of the template in the figure). Also, there is a reference to identical or conserved Pol II contacts in the figure but the Results section makes no reference to this.</p><p>9. The authors contend that the occupancy of RNAPII just downstream of the READS PAS (the GC-rich region) of the slow mutant is reduced relative to wt (which I agree with) but the authors state that the 'control' intronic PASs present no such difference – I disagree and observe that the slow mutant has a similarly reduced occupancy in the absence of a GC rich region. Can the authors clarify? Perhaps statistics can be used to support these claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83153.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors used the last cleavage site of one cluster and the first cleavage site of the downstream cluster to define usage differences between clusters.

If a single C/P site results in a cluster of poly(A) sites, this would mean the C/P machinery is intrinsically imprecise. In that case, cleavage at that “single site” would be independent of the Pol II elongation rate and hence always give an identical pattern in the “slow”, “fast”, and WT Pol II contexts. Instead, we show that the Pol II elongation rate clearly affects poly(A) site usage at the nucleotide level, which indicates a tight positioning relationship between elongating Pol II and C/P.

Our previous paper (Geisberg et al., 2020) showed that the 2 “slow” mutants gave remarkably similar phenotypes over the transcriptome, but the effect of the “slower” mutant was slightly more pronounced than the “slow” mutant. Similarly, the 2 “fast” mutants gave remarkably similar phenotypes, with the effect of the “faster” mutant being slightly more pronounced than the “fast” mutant. These published results provide exceptionally strong evidence that the mutants are true Pol II speed mutants, and no further experiments are necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The isoform values represent the consolidation of biological replicates that we previously documented to be extremely highly correlated (R = 0.94; Geisberg et al. 2020).

Elevated Pol II occupancy downstream of poly(A) sites provides strong and independent evidence that polyadenylation and Pol II speed are linked.
