to explain brain folding. However, the cellular and physical processes present during folding have not been defined. We used the murine cerebellum to challenge folding models with in vivo data. We show that at folding initiation differential expansion is created by the outer layer of proliferating progenitors expanding faster than the core. However, the stiffness differential, compressive forces, and emergent thickness variations required by elastic material models are not present. We find that folding occurs without an obvious cellular pre-pattern, that the outer layer expansion is uniform and fluid-like, and that the cerebellum is under radial and circumferential constraints. Lastly, we find that a multi-phase model incorporating differential expansion of a fluid outer layer and radial and circumferential constraints approximates the in vivo shape evolution observed during initiation of cerebellar folding.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45019.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain has a characteristic pattern of ridges and grooves that make up its folded shape. Folds in the outer layer of the brain, known as the cortex, increase the surface area and make more space for cells to connect and form complex circuitries. Different models have been put forward to explain how these folds form during development. Examples include tension from cells pulling areas of the cortex together, or layers of the cortex growing at different rates, causing the cortex to buckle and create folds. Discriminating between these different models requires biological information about the cells and tissue of the brain at the start of the folding process. However, it has been difficult to extract this information when considering the development of the human brain in three dimensions.</p><p>Lawton et al. have overcome these difficulties by using a part of the mouse brain called the cerebellum as a simpler system. As in humans, the mouse cerebellum is a densely folded structure, sitting underneath the brain, that plays a major role in regulating movements, as well as cognition. The symmetrical structure of the mouse cerebellum means it can be analyzed in two dimensions, making it easier to track the mechanics of folding.</p><p>By applying the extracted biological data onto a mathematical model, Lawton et al. showed folding was driven by a combination of previously unknown features. For instance, that cells in the outer layer of the cerebellum grow faster than cells in the center, with cells growing uniformly across the outer layer. Other features include the fluid-like composition of the outer layer, which allows cells to move freely and regularly change position, and tensions surrounding the cerebellum mechanically straining its growth. Notably, the pattern of cells and tissue fibers in the cortex had no influence over these mechanical properties and provided no pre-indication of where the sites of folding would occur. The data collected deviates from other models, and has led Lawton et al. to propose a new explanation for how the brain folds, incorporating these newly found features.</p><p>Problems with brain folding during human development can lead to debilitating conditions. Applying this new model to folding disorders of the human brain could help scientists to understand how these folding defects arise.</p></abstract><kwd-group

has primarily focused on the human cerebral cortex and involved models of directed growth, axonal tension, or differential expansion of elastic materials that generate compressive forces to drive mechanical instabilities leading to folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tallinen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ronan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

Current elastic material models are able to create three-dimensional shapes strikingly similar to the final folds seen in the adult human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tallinen et al., 2016</xref>). A recent multi-phase model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Engstrom et al., 2018</xref>) that includes elastic and fluid-like layers, differential expansion and radial constraints takes into consideration that multiple factors could lead to folding in the developing brain. However, the cell and tissue level mechanics actually present at the initiation of folding have not been considered or defined, as technological limitations are significant in animals with a folded cerebrum.</p><p>The murine cerebellum has a simple alignment of 8–10 stereotypical folds along the anterior-posterior axis. Combined with the genetic tools available in mouse this allows for precise developmental interrogation to identify and analyze the in vivo cellular and tissue level behaviors driving growth and folding. The developing cerebellum is distinct from the cerebral cortex, as it has a temporary external granule cell layer (EGL) of proliferating granule cell precursors that cover the surface and generate growth primarily in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Legué et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Legué et al., 2016</xref>). During development a thickening occurs in the EGL at the base of each forming fissure, termed anchoring center (AC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>), whereas in the adult cerebellum the inner granule cell layer (IGL), generated by the EGL during the first two weeks of life, is thinnest at the ACs. Previous work on cerebellar folding utilized a tri-layer elastic model incorporating the EGL, the adjacent molecular layer, rich in axons and dendrites, and the IGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lejeune et al., 2016</xref>). However, neither the molecular layer nor the IGL are present when folding is initiated in the embryo. Therefore we argue that a bilayer system consisting of the EGL and underlying core, is a more appropriate approximation for cerebellar folding.</p><p>Here we show that cerebellar folding emerges from differential expansion between an un-patterned, rapidly expanding EGL and an underlying core. Additionally, we demonstrate that the measured stiffness differential, compressive forces, and the thickness variation in the EGL are all inconsistent with traditional elastic wrinkling models driven by differential growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expansion of the EGL is uniform, and fluid-like, and that the cerebellum is under radial and circumferential constraints when folding initiates. Lastly, we constrain the recent multi-phase model with our in vivo data and find we can capture the temporal shape evolution seen during mouse cerebellum folding initiation. The implications of our findings for human cerebral cortex folding are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tissue level mechanics drive folding</title><p>It is well known that differentially expanding bilayer systems can wrinkle to relax building stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Richman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hannezo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wiggs et al., 1997</xref>). We reasoned that in the cerebellum the EGL could behave as a quickly expanding outer layer and its attachment to a more slowly growing core could generate forces that result in a wrinkling-like phenotype. To test whether the cerebellum has differential expansion between the two layers, we measured the expansion of the EGL and the core during the time of initiation of folding from midline sagittal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>). Unlike the cerebral cortex, the unfolded murine cerebellum is a simple cylinder-like structure elongated in the medio-lateral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Szulc et al., 2015</xref>). All folds in the medial cerebellum (vermis) are aligned in the same axis allowing 2-D measurements to estimate expansion in the anterior-posterior axis of the vermis. Therefore the length of the surface of the EGL was used as a measure of the cerebellum surface area and the area of the core as an approximation of cerebellum volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), and measurements were made each day from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) through postnatal day 0 (P0). In cross-section the unfolded cerebellum approximates a semicircle, therefore we reasoned that if the cerebellum were to remain unfolded then the ratio of expansion between the length of the EGL and the area of the core should approximate the ratio of the circumference of a semi-circle to its area. Of significance, we found that at E16.5 and E17.5 the ratios of growth between the EGL and core closely approximated the expansion of a semi-circle. However, at E18.5 and P0 the expansion rate of the EGL was greater than the rate of core expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Thus we uncovered that the cerebellum does indeed go through a phase of differential expansion. We next determined whether differential expansion correlates with when folding occurs by calculating a folding index (the convex curvature of the EGL divided by the length of the EGL) at each stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2015</xref>). Indeed, we found that the cerebellum remains unfolded during the initial proportional expansion between the EGL and core and only folds when the differential expansion is initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). These results provide quantitative evidence that cerebellar folding involves tissue level mechanical forces arising from differential expansion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45019.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Initiation of cerebellar folding correlates with timing of differential expansion.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>), H and E stained midline sagittal sections of FVB/N mice at the indicated embryonic (<bold>E</bold>) and postnatal days (<bold>P</bold>).

Briefly, the initial resulting wrinkling instability defines the distance between folds as the initial sinusoidal undulations increase in amplitude to ultimately turn into lobules.

The resulting shape change was studied as a function of the ratio of the layer stiffness values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We found that to produce the observed number of folds (three in the semi-circular cerebellum and six in the circular model) at initiation of folding through wrinkling based models constrained by our measurements of the embryonic cerebellum, a large stiffness ratio was required of around 50. To map the stiffness contrast in the cerebellum we used scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) to measure the bulk modulus of the cerebellum daily from E16.5 to P18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) using established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rohrbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rohrbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rohrbach and Mamou, 2018</xref>). For small deformations, the instantaneous bulk modulus should linearly relate to the stiffness and, therefore, the ratio of the instantaneous bulk moduli should scale similarly to the ratio of stiffnesses (assuming the same Poisson’s ratio for the EGL and for the core, neither of which have been directly measured). While this qualitative approach and SAM tissue preparation protocols may not be able to produce the absolute values of the elastic properties of the tissues, it can give a reasonable indication of the relative stiffnesses of different parts in the cerebellum. Using this estimation, we found that the EGL has a slightly higher instantaneous bulk modulus than the core at all stages measured. Unsurprisingly, the ratio (~1.05:1) was not close to being sufficient to produce a folding wavelength similar to that in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Consistent with our finding, small modulus contrasts have been reported for other brain regions with multiple loading modes, such as shear, compression, and tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lejeune et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budday et al., 2017</xref>).

Thus, the EGL should have an ‘in-phase’ thickness variation. Without this feature, a purely elastic model – bi-layer based or even graded growth profile based – cannot be in mechanical equilibrium (in the quasistatic limit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Engstrom et al., 2018</xref>). However, we previously reported that the embryonic EGL is thickest in the ACs when folding initiates, that is it has an ‘out-of-phase’ thickness variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>). To validate this observation, we quantified the thickness variations in the EGL centered at the ACs present at E16.5–18.5. Not all cerebella have visible AC at E16.5. However in the subset that do and in the three ACs present at E17.5, the EGL was found to be 1.2–1.4 times thicker in the ACs than in the surrounding EGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i–l</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, the thickness ratio increased to 1.7 times at E18.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>). As described above, the final thickness variations of the IGL (as well as the molecular layer) of the cerebellar cortex are in-phase, just as the layers of the adult cerebral cortex. These results further show that traditional elastic wrinkling models cannot capture the initiation of cerebellum folding, and highlight the importance of making biological measurements at the time of folding rather than when it is complete.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Uniform outer layer expansion without a cellular pre-pattern</title><p>As elastic bi-layer models do not align with the biology of cerebellar folding, we looked for other drivers of morphometric changes.

Proliferation rates (S phase index) were measured in the EGL during folding initiation (E16.5 and E17.5) in the inbred FVB/N strain to reduce variation between samples. First we asked if the regions that will give rise to distinct sets of lobules have different rates of proliferation that could contribute to the larger and smaller sizes that the lobules ultimately attain. We focused on the anterior cerebellum that divides into a larger region with lobules 1–3 (L123) and smaller region (L45), as well as the central area that comprises lobules 6–8 (L678) of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>). The more posterior cerebellum does not consistently fold at this stage, thus measurements were not included. Interestingly, we found that the proliferation rates were similar in the three regions at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The EGL proliferation rate at E17.5 in L678 was slightly reduced compared to the L123 region, but no other differences were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Thus proliferation is uniform just before initiation of folding and the small difference found during folding does not correlate with lobule size. This result indicates that lobule size is not determined by modulating the levels of proliferation at the onset of folding. Rather, lobule size could be set by both the timing of invagination, and the distance between ACs as granule cell precursors in one lobule do not cross the surrounding ACs to contribute to an adjacent lobule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Legué et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45019.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>At folding initiation the EGL has uniform proliferation, cell size, and cell shape.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Low and high power images of immuno-histochemical (IHC) staining of sagittal cerebellar sections to measure proliferation in the lobules (<bold>L</bold>) indicated at 25 μm windows surrounding the ACs (stars).

We applied the model here to the initiation of cerebellar folding based on five primary assumptions. First, the core is an incompressible material (μ) as indicated by the bulk modulus measurements. Second the outer layer, that is the EGL, expands uniformly (k<sub>t</sub>) as shown by the proliferation rate. Third, the EGL is assumed to be a fluid-like material as demonstrated by the live-imaging of neighbor exchanges. Fourth, there is an elastic component radially to the entire cerebellum (k<sub>r</sub>), seen in the cutting and relaxation experiment and possibly mediated by radial glia. Fifth, the EGL is constrained towards a uniform thickness (β), possibly by Bergmann glia fibers spanning the EGL.

Together, this allowed for the generation of shape predictions at later developmental stages (E17.5 and E18.5) from the E16.5 starting approximation.

To test this possibility we measured the expansion of the EGL and the core of the individual lobule regions from E18.5 to P3.

Additionally, the outer layer has fluid-like properties and expands uniformly, and the growth creates a differential expansion between the outer layer and the core. Thus, traditional morphometric cellular behaviors such as changes in cell shape, size and proliferation do not direct where cerebellar folding initiates. Furthermore, our developmental interrogation revealed tissue moduli, mechanical constraints, and emergent thickness variations in the EGL that are fundamentally inconsistent with traditional elastic bilayer wrinkling models. Therefore our results call for a new understanding of brain folding.</p><p>By applying a multi-phase model constrained by our measured data we were able to capture the correct shape variations and number of folds at the onset of folding. Our new framework accounts for: the rapidly expanding fluid EGL, whose thickness is proposed to be regulated by Bergmann glial fibers, the slower growing incompressible core, and fibrous material in the form of glial fibers and possibly axons as well as the meninges that potentially provide radial and circumferential tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This multi-phase model of folding makes many new predictions. One such prediction is that adjusting the amount of tension spanning the cerebellum will change the degree of folding. Indeed, alterations of the cells that likely create tension-based forces could explain the dramatically disrupted folding seen in mouse mutants in which radial glia do not produce Bergmann glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Without Bergmann glia, the EGL would be expected to not form a layer with regular thickness and it should be more sensitive to variations in radial glial tension. Consistent with this prediction, mutants without Bergmann glia have more localized and less regular folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2014</xref>) Our combination of experimental studies and modeling thus provide new insights into cerebellar folding, including an underappreciated role for tension.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45019.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Uniform cell behaviors within a fluid-like EGL create differential expansion based folding approximated by a multiphase model with radial and circumferential tension.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of E16.5 cerebellum showing the EGL (dark purple) overlying the in incompressible core (light purple) with fibers (lines) of radial glia (closed ovals) and Bergmann glia (open ovals) crossing the cerebellum and the EGL.

(<bold>D</bold>) Since ACs hold their position in space, and compartmentalize the cells within the EGL, we propose that they behave as mechanical boundaries allowing local domains of differential expansion to arise and progressive folding to occur.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45019-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Under the new framework revealed by our measurements made in the developing mouse cerebellum, to approximate the observed shape changes in the murine cerebellum from E17.5 to E18.5 the ratio of the core stiffness over the radial tension must increase. Yet, the measured bulk modulus of the core shows no increase during development. Therefore a second prediction is that radial tension must decrease during development. While the cerebellum is crossed by many fibers at folding initiation, radial glial fibers are an attractive candidate to mediate this change in radial tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rahimi-Balaei et al., 2015</xref>). First, they span from the VZ to the surface of the cerebellum at E16.5. Additionally, during folding initiation the radial glia undergo a transition into Bergmann glia where they release their basal connection to the VZ and the cell body migrates towards the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mota and Herculano-Houzel, 2015</xref>). This transition could lead to a reduction in the global radial tension and thus would be consistent with our model prediction.</p><p>The mechanics underlying hierarchical folding remain an open challenge. However, our developmental data may provide a way forward. As ACs maintain their spatial positions, and as they compartmentalize granule cells within the EGL into the lobule regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Legué et al., 2015</xref>), we propose that they create fixed mechanical boundaries that divide the cerebellum into self-similar domains. These domains, with their similar physical properties to the initial unfolded cerebellum, can then undergo additional folding. Furthermore since ACs compartmentalize granule cells within the lobule regions, once separated the lobule regions can develop distinct characteristics, like the observed differential proliferation rates at E18.5. We speculate, therefore, that the folding patterns seen across cerebella in different species evolved by adjustment of global as well as regional levels of differential expansion and tension which ultimately mold the functionality of the cerebellum.</p><p>Finally it is interesting to note the similarities and differences between the developing cerebellum and the cerebral cortex. Radial glia span the entire cerebral cortex just as in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Götz et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, species with folded cerebrums have evolved outer radial glial cells for which the cell body leaves the ventricular zone to become positioned near the surface while retaining fibers anchored on the surface, similar to Bergmann glia in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung and Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reillo et al., 2011</xref>). While we have emphasized the notion of tension via glial fibers in the developing cerebellum, axonal tension has been discussed in the context of shaping the developing cerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Essen, 1997</xref>). Tissue cutting in the cerebral cortex of ferrets has revealed a similar tension pattern during folding as we found in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore submit that our work calls for a revival of the notion of how tension affects the shape of the developing cerebrum.</p><p>Unlike the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex is not divided into a simple bilayer system. However, outer radial glial cells proliferate, much like the GCPs of the EGL, to drive the expansion of the outer regions of the cerebral cortex around the time of initiation of folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nowakowski et al., 2016</xref>). Moving the zone of proliferation out from the VZ gives more space for the increased proliferation required in folding systems. The cerebellum, housing 80% of the neurons in the human brain may be an extreme example requiring the region of proliferation to be completely on the outer surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>). Constraining models of folding of different brain regions with developmental data will bring about a more accurate quantitative understanding of the shaping of the developing brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M.Musculus)</td><td>FVB/N</td><td>Jax Mice, The Jackson Laboratory</td><td>Jackson Labs Stock number: 001800</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(M.Musculus)</td><td>Atoh1-CreER</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Machold and Fishell, 2005</xref></td><td>Jackson Labs Stock number: 007684</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (M.Musculus)</td><td>Nestin-CreER</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Imayoshi et al., 2006</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (M.Musculus)</td><td><italic>Rosa26<sup>MTMG</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref></td><td>Jackson labs Stock number: 007676</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (M.Musculus)</td><td><italic>Rosa26<sup>Ai75</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daigle et al., 2018</xref></td><td>Jackson labs Stock number: 025106</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse monoclonal anti-P27</td><td>BD Pharmingen</td><td>610241</td><td>Dilution 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>A11122</td><td>Dilution 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rat monoclonal anti-GFP</td><td>Nacalai Tesque</td><td>04404–84</td><td>Dilution 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>Assay or Kit</td><td>EDU</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>C10340</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were performed following protocols approved by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cerebellar folding is initiated by mechanical constraints on a fluid-like layer without a cellular pre-pattern&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Both reviewers thought that your study of cerebellar folding in developing murine embryo addresses an important outstanding question in the field of developmental neuroscience. They considered your studies of tissue dynamics and cellular behavior analyses, as well as mathematical simulations as comprehensive and compelling. The observations that during the cerebellar folding initiation differential expansion is due to the outer layer of proliferating progenitors expanding faster than the tissue core and that the folding occurs without an obvious cellular pre-pattern, are particularly interesting. These and other observations challenge the existing models and allow putting forward the multi-phase wrinkling model. The manuscript should be of broad interest to developmental biologists, cellular biologist, neuroscientists and applied mathematicians.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the reviewers is concerned that in the model the missing two parameters μ/k<sub>r</sub> are constrained to scale linearly in time. There must be a second constraint to fix two parameters. The motivation behind linear scaling and the full choice of parameters should be more transparent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Many models were proposed to explain how brain folds. The elastic wrinkling models based on variations in stiffness, compressive forces, proliferation, and thickness has been used to explain the cerebellar folding. In this manuscript, Joyner and her colleagues challenged the folding models by measuring those values and cellar behaviors (e.g. cell shape, motility, and glial fibers) in mouse cerebella when the folding is initiated, and by mathematical simulation. They demonstrated via experimental data: (1) differential expansion and stiffness between the EGL vs. the core, (2) the EGL thickness at the anchoring centers (ACs) increases but not decreases during the folding initiation, (3) uniform proliferation in the EGL, (4) presence of horizontal and radial mechanical constrains, (5) fluid-like property of the EGL. With the mathematical simulation, they propose a novel multi-phase wrinkling model without introducing a cellular pre-pattern. They also explain the subdivisions after the initial folding (they termed hierarchical folding) when they consider ACs as mechanical boundaries. Although I am not familiar with mathematical simulation, I believe that they show enough evidence supporting their hypothesis. The no pre-pattern model was unexpected. The manuscript provides scientists in the research field of developmental biology and neuroscience with a novel idea for brain folding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The work by Lawton et al. investigates the mechanism behind cerebellar folding by conducting a nicely detailed analysis of the dynamics and mechanical properties of the contributing tissues. What drives brain folding has excited many researchers, developmental biologists, physicists and applied mathematicians alike. Yet, a detailed quantification of the tissue dynamics and tissue properties has so far been lacking. The authors unfold in their very timely contribution how predictions from models guided their quantification of tissue dynamics to step by step rule out any previous models of brain folding and eventually deduct the key ingredients that they consider in a finite element model. They very carefully constrain parameters of their model to then arrive at a very convincing and consistent mechanism of how cerebellar folding unfolds.</p><p>My only major concern is that in their model the missing two parameters μ/k<sub>r</sub> are constrained to scale linearly in time. There must be a second constraint to fix two parameters. The motivation behind linear scaling and the full choice of parameters should be more transparent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45019.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the reviewers is concerned that in the model the missing two parameters mμ/k<sub>r</sub> are constrained to scale linearly in time.

In the modeling community, it is quickly becoming the norm to reformulate a model in terms of dimensionless quantities, i.e. nondimensionalization. To do so, one works with dimensionless ratios of the parameters, thereby reducing the number of parameters to uncover a smaller set of quantities that the system depends on. In the manuscript, we also work with a nondimensionalized form of the model (i.e., we work in units where r<sub>0</sub>=1), and so only 5 dimensionless parameters are required to completely specify the model. These may be chosen as μ/k<sub>r</sub>, k<sub>r</sub>/k<sub>t</sub>, A<sub>t</sub>/r<sub>0</sub>, t<sub>0</sub>/r<sub>0</sub>, and q, as discussed in the Materials and methods section entitled “Details of Multi-phase model […]”. Thus, the quantity μ/k<sub>r</sub> should not be thought of as a ratio of two independent parameters, but rather a single dimensionless parameter. We indeed should have been more transparent about using the nondimensionalized version of the model, and we thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. The revised manuscript has language added to the section &quot;Details of multi-phase model […]&quot; to state explicitly that the nondimensionalized model is used to make the plots in Figure 6B-C as follows:</p><p>“Because we are primarily interested in shape changes, rather than size changes, a nondimensionalized model solution was used, i.e., we chose units where r<sub>0</sub>=1. This reduces the total number of parameters specifying the model to five dimensionless parameters.”</p><p>In re-reading this section, we also noticed a typo that may have been the source of some of the confusion. The fifth paragraph said &quot;Figure 5F&quot; where it should say &quot;Figure 6B-C&quot;. We apologize for this typo, we have fixed it in the revised manuscript, and hope this clarifies how the parameters in Figure 6B-C are chosen.</p><p>Regarding time-dependence, the model parameter μ/k<sub>r</sub> should be increasing over time because k<sub>r</sub> is decreasing over time, which we suggest in the Discussion can be attributed to the radial glia transitioning to Bergmann glia (see, e.g., Discussion, third paragraph). We assume linear scaling, because that is the simplest possible kind of scaling. That this is an assumption stated in both the legend to Figure 6 and in the section &quot;Details of multi-phase model […]&quot;. Having said that, Figure 6C illustrates that this assumption is not too unreasonable, at least concerning the agreement of the experimental and theoretical shape index.</p></body></sub-article></article>
