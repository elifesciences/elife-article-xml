These errors in Figures 1B, 2A, 2B, 3C, 3D, 4B and Figure 3-figure supplement 1 were caused during the assembly of the final Excel files for publication. Additionally, we identified several other errors that require correction. This includes an error in Figure 3D due to the incorrect calculation of standard error of <italic>rv0805</italic> expression in <italic>phoP</italic>-KD mutant [from 0.967 (original standard error) to 0.319 (corrected standard error)]. Errors in Figures 4A and 4C, where replicates of a few datasets were unintentionally omitted from the calculations, and one data set was utilized in plotting instead of using the average of three datasets. Minor corrections to the wording of two sentences within the Results section were incorporated for better clarity. None of the outcomes or conclusions of the manuscript are affected by the corrections. We sincerely apologise for the oversight.</p><p>This necessitated the changes to the Results, Materials and Methods, and Figure and legends as described below.
