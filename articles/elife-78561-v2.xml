This toxin has an unusual biology in that it is produced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi only when located within host cells. Once synthesized, the toxin is secreted to the lumen of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole from where it is transported to the extracellular space by vesicle carrier intermediates. Here, we report the identification of the typhoid toxin sorting receptor and components of the cellular machinery that packages the toxin into vesicle carriers, and exports it to the extracellular space. We found that the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor serves as typhoid toxin sorting receptor and that the coat protein COPII and the GTPase Sar1 mediate its packaging into vesicle carriers. Formation of the typhoid toxin carriers requires the specific environment of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi-containing vacuole, which is determined by the activities of specific effectors of its type III protein secretion systems. We also found that Rab11B and its interacting protein Rip11 control the intracellular transport of the typhoid toxin carriers, and the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23, and Syntaxin 4 their fusion to the plasma membrane. Typhoid toxin’s cooption of specific cellular machinery for its transport to the extracellular space illustrates the remarkable adaptation of an exotoxin to exert its function in the context of an intracellular pathogen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>typhoid fever</kwd><kwd>vesicle transport</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>bacterial toxins</kwd><kwd>intracellular pathogens</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhi</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI079022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galan</surname><given-names>Jorge E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110-2636-B-002 -014 -</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Shu-Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multidisciplinary approach provides a description of the exocytic pathway that exports <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi's typhoid toxin from infected cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi is the cause of typhoid fever in humans, a systemic disease that affects approximately 20 million people every year resulting in approximately 150,000 deaths worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buckle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dougan and Baker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mogasale et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parry et al., 2002</xref>). A related pathogen, <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Paratyphi A, causes a very similar disease in humans (paratyphoid fever) and is increasingly becoming more prevalent in certain areas of the world. Both serovars are restricted to the human host and no animal reservoir for these pathogens has been identified. The emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant strains of these pathogens, which are becoming endemic in different parts of the world, is a major concern as it is complicating the available therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chau et al., 2007</xref>). Although there are several vaccines available that confer partial protection to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection, there are no vaccines available for <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milligan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zuckerman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Typhoid toxin is a virulence factor that is encoded by both, <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A, but that is largely absent from other <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovars that cause self-limiting gastroenteritis (i.e. non-typhoidal serovars) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fowler and Galán, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galán, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haghjoo and Galán, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spanò et al., 2008</xref>). Homologs of the toxin are also present in a very limited number of serovars belonging to clade B that are rarely associated with disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Wiedmann, 2019</xref>), although these homologs exhibit different biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Typhoid toxin is an AB toxin with a very unusual architecture. Rather than one enzymatic ‘A’ subunit as seen in all other AB<sub>5</sub> toxins, typhoid toxin has two covalently linked A subunits (PltA and CdtB) linked to a pentameric ‘B’ subunit alternatively composed of PltB or PltC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2013</xref>). PltA is an ADP-ribosyl transferase with an unknown cellular target, and CdtB is an atypical deoxyribonuclease, which inflicts DNA damage on the intoxicated cells. Consistent with the human host specificity of both, <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Paratyphi A, the PltB subunit of typhoid toxin specifically recognizes acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)-terminated sialoglycans, which are almost unique to the human host since most other mammals display glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc)-terminated glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2013</xref>). A human volunteer study suggested that typhoid toxin does not appear to be required for the initiation of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibani et al., 2019</xref>). However, administration of typhoid toxin into animals engineered to display Neu5Ac-terminated sialoglycans reproduced many of the symptoms of severe typhoid, including various neurological symptoms, stupor, and profound leukopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fowler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), aspects of the disease that for ethical reasons could not be captured in the human volunteer study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibani et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A unique aspect of typhoid toxin is that it is only produced when <italic>S</italic>.

Once produced, the toxin is secreted from the bacteria to the lumen of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) through a novel dedicated protein secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geiger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodak and Galán, 2012</xref>), which has been recently proposed to be classified as type X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer et al., 2021</xref>). The toxin is then packaged within vesicle carriers, which transport it to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanò and Galán, 2012</xref>). The toxin then binds its specific Neu5Ac-bearing receptors, and after receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is transported to its intracellular destination via a specialized retrograde transport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). There is no pathway that can transport the toxin from its site of production within the SCV to its place of action within the same cell and therefore intoxication always requires the export of the toxin to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spanò et al., 2008</xref>). Very little is known about the exocytic pathway that transports the toxin from the SCV to the extracellular space. A single amino acid substitution in the glycan-binding site of PltB results in a toxin that remains trapped within the SCV after its secretion from the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). This observation suggests that toxin export requires a sorting event most likely mediated by a glycosylated receptor on the luminal side of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuolar membrane. However, the identity of such putative receptor is unknown.</p><p>Here, we report the identification of the typhoid-toxin sorting receptor and components of the cellular machinery involved in toxin-sorting, packaging, and exocytic transport to the extracellular space.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor as the typhoid toxin cargo receptor for sorting into vesicle transport carriers</title><p>To identify the putative typhoid toxin sorting receptor, we sought to identify typhoid-toxin interacting proteins in cultured human epithelial cells by affinity purification and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). As a negative control we used a mutant version of typhoid toxin that carries a single amino acid substitution in its PltB subunit (PltB<sup>S35A</sup>). This mutant cannot be packaged into vesicle carrier intermediates because this residue is critical for its interaction with its putative Neu5Ac-bearing sorting receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). The cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gary-Bobo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stalder and Gershlick, 2020</xref>) was identified as a prominent interacting protein with wild-type typhoid toxin but not with its PltB<sup>S35A</sup> mutant control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated HEK293T cells defective for CLTC (clathrin heavy chain), SEC23B (an inner coat protein of COPII), AP3B1 (AP3 subunit beta-1), and AP4M1 (AP4 subunit mu-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>), whose deficiency abrogates the assembly of their respective vesicle coats. We found that typhoid toxin expression as well as the toxicity of exogenously administered typhoid toxin was unaltered in all these cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>) indicating that the absence of the different coats did not affect the endosomal system in a manner that could interfere with the interpretation of the results.

We therefore investigated the contribution of Sar1 to typhoid toxin packaging into vesicle carriers by examining their presence in Sar1-deficient cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). We found a marked reduction in the levels of fluorescent puncta associated with toxin carriers in SAR1B-deficient cells infected with <italic>S</italic>.

Consistent with this observation, in comparison to the parental cell line, we found a significant decrease in the levels of typhoid toxin in the infection medium of SAR1B-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). If COPII plays a pivotal role in the formation of typhoid toxin export carriers, we reasoned that we should be able to observe its recruitment to the SCV and the formation of a complex of typhoid toxin and components of the COPII coat. We observed robust recruitment of Sec23 to the SCV, particularly at later times after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). To investigate the formation of a complex between typhoid toxin and COPII, HEK293T parental cells as well as CI-M6PR -/- derivatives transiently expressing GFP-tagged Sec23 were infected with wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhi or the <italic>∆spiA</italic> isogenic mutant (as a negative control) expressing FLAG epitope-tagged CdtB. The formation of a typhoid toxin/Sec23 complex was then investigated by co-immunoprecipitation.

This mutant strain is defective in the SPI-2 T3SS and consequently has an altered intracellular vacuole and is therefore unable to efficiently package typhoid toxin into vesicle transport carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the typhoid toxin-Sec23 complex could not be detected in cells lacking CI-M6PR, indicating that formation of the complex requires the presence of the toxin’s sorting receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that the packaging of typhoid toxin into vesicle carrier intermediates is dependent on COPII.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The transport of typhoid toxin vesicle carriers is dependent on Rab11B and its interacting protein RIP11</title><p>The transport of cargo proteins destined for targeting to other intracellular compartments or the extracellular space most often entails multiple steps, which requires a specific set of proteins that ensure the accuracy of cargo delivery. Among these proteins are Rab GTPases, which regulate vesicular transport to most cellular compartments, and are therefore excellent candidates to participate in the regulation of the exocytic transport of typhoid toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfeffer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stenmark, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhen and Stenmark, 2015</xref>). To identify Rab GTPases that could be potentially involved in typhoid toxin transport, we examined typhoid toxin transport in cell lines deficient in a subset of Rab-family GTPases (or its regulators) that have been previously implicated in various exocytic pathways. More specifically, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we generated cell lines deficient in Rab27A, Rab27B, Rab11A, Rab11B, and HPS4, a component of the BLOC3 complex which is an exchange factor essential for the function of both, Rab32 and Rab38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerondopoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The different cell lines were then infected with <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and the levels of typhoid toxin in the infection media, a direct measure of its export, were determined. We found that inactivation of Rab27A, Rab27B, Rab11A, and HPS4 did not alter the transport of typhoid toxin as demonstrated by the presence of equivalent levels of the toxin in the culture media as those observed in the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, cells defective in Rab11B (but not in its close homolog Rab11A) exhibited significantly reduced export of typhoid toxin to the extracellular media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), even though the levels of toxin expression in the infected cells were indistinguishable from those of the parent cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

In the case of Rab11B in particular, it has been shown that it regulates some exocytic events by interacting with Rab11-family-interacting protein 5 (Rab11-FIP5) also known as Rip11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horgan and McCaffrey, 2009</xref>). This effector has been shown to be involved in regulating vesicular transport from recycling endosomes to the apical plasma membrane, and in particular, in the regulation of insulin granule exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schonteich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sugawara et al., 2009</xref>).

In most exocytic pathways this step involves soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor-activating protein receptors (SNAREs), which mediate the fusion between the carrier vesicle and target membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goda, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Südhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). Depending on whether they are located in the vesicle or target membranes, SNAREs are referred to as v- or t-SNAREs, respectively. The identities of the trans-SNARE pairing ensure the specificity of the fusion process. We therefore hypothesized that a pair of v- and t-SNAREs must be involved in targeting typhoid toxin-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane. We reasoned that a good candidate t-SNARE to be potentially involved in typhoid toxin export would be SNAP23, which is ubiquitously expressed, localizes to the plasma membrane, and has been implicated in several exocytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kádková et al., 2019</xref>).

Here, we have investigated the mechanisms by which typhoid toxin is transported from the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole to the extracellular space. Through an affinity purification approach, we identified CI-M6PR as the typhoid toxin packaging receptor, which we found to be robustly recruited to the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole. This finding was surprising since it is well established that this receptor is excluded from the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-containing vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGourty et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these observations, we found that typhoid toxin is not packaged into vesicle carrier intermediates when expressed in <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium, indicating that the specific features of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole are essential for the formation of the typhoid toxin transport carrier, underlying the marked differences between the intracellular compartments that harbor these pathogens. The properties of the SCVs are determined by the activity of bacterial effectors delivered by either of its type III secretion systems, which differ significantly between <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. In fact, we found that expression in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi of SseJ, a <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium effector of its SPI-2 T3SS that is absent from <italic>S</italic>. Typhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kolodziejek and Miller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohlson et al., 2005</xref>), prevented the recruitment of CI-M6PR to the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole and the subsequent packaging of typhoid toxin into vesicle carrier intermediates. How the presence of SseJ prevents the intersection of the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole with CI-M6PR is not clear. It is known that through its acetyl transferase activity, SseJ modifies the lipid composition of the SCV membrane. This activity must be central for the exclusion of the CI-M6PR from the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole since expression of a SseJ catalytic mutant did not affect the recruitment of CI-M6PR to the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole, and did not interfere with typhoid toxin packaging. However, how modification of the lipid composition of the SCV membrane affects the trafficking of the SCV is unknown. These findings not only further highlight the differences between the intracellular compartments that harbor <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium but also indicate that typhoid toxin has evolved to adjust its biology to the intracellular biology of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi.</p><p>The engagement of the sorting receptor by typhoid toxin presumably initiates a packaging and budding event that leads to the formation of the vesicle carrier intermediates. We found that this step requires the activities of the coat protein complex COPII and the Sar1 small GTPase. Cells defective in SEC23B or SAR1B showed reduced levels of typhoid toxin carriers and toxin export to the extracellular space despite indistinguishable levels in the number of intracellular <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and the levels of typhoid toxin expression. Furthermore, consistent with the involvement of the COPII coat in the formation of toxin carriers, typhoid toxin was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with SEC23B, a COPII coat component. Importantly, formation of the SEC23B-COPII complex was significantly impaired in the absence of CI-M6PR indicating that the sorting receptor serves as a bridge between the toxin cargo and the coat complex. COPII coats are involved in the early secretory pathway, more specifically in the ER to Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCaughey and Stephens, 2018</xref>) suggesting that <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole must intersect with elements of the secretory pathway.</p><p>Our studies also identified other components of the membrane trafficking machinery that are presumably involved in the transport of the vesicle carriers from the SCV to the plasma membrane. In particular, we identified Rab11B as required for the efficient transport of typhoid toxin to the extracellular space. Although cells deficient in Rab11B showed reduced amount of toxin in the infection media, they showed normal levels of vesicle carrier intermediates. These results indicate that Rab11B must be involved in steps downstream from the vesicle transport budding from the SCV but upstream from the fusion of these vesicles to the plasma membrane. Rab11B has been implicated in various vesicle transport pathways to the plasma membrane including melanin exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tarafder et al., 2014</xref>). This observation is intriguing since the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole (but not the S. Typhimurium vacuole) recruits Rab32 and Rab38, which are involved in melanosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spanò and Galán, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spanò et al., 2016</xref>). However, we found that Rab32 and Rab38 are not required for typhoid toxin transport since cells deficient in HPS4, an essential component of their exchange factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerondopoulos et al., 2012</xref>), were unaffected in typhoid toxin transport. The mechanisms by which Rab11B may regulate typhoid toxin transport are unclear. However, we hypothesize that this GTPase may be involved in the movement of the typhoid toxin carriers along microtubule tracks. This hypothesis is based on the observation that Rab11B has been shown to modulate the exocytic transport of insulin granules at least in part by linking these transport carriers to kinesin motors, a function that requires the Rab11B effector Rip11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sugawara et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, cells lacking Rip11 exhibited reduced transport of typhoid toxin to the extracellular space although they showed normal levels of typhoid toxin transport carriers.</p><p>Finally, we identified the machinery that is required for the fusion of the typhoid toxin transport carriers to the plasma membrane. More specifically we found that the plasma membrane SNARE proteins SNAP23 and syntaxin 4 are required for typhoid toxin transport to the extracellular space. Consistent with their involvement in typhoid toxin transport, cells lacking SNAP23 or syntaxin 4 showed markedly reduced levels of typhoid toxin in the infection media. Importantly, consistent with their specific involvement in the fusion of the typhoid toxin vesicle carriers with the plasma membrane, SNAP23- or syntaxin 4-deficient cells showed increased levels of typhoid toxin carrier in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-infected cells. The SNAP23/STX4 complex has been shown to interact with the v-SNARE VAMP-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Röhl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Williams et al., 2014</xref>), and we found here that cells defective in VAMP-7 showed reduced levels of typhoid toxin in the extracellular media. Therefore, we propose that the fusion of the typhoid toxin vesicle carrier intermediates with plasma membrane is controlled by the plasma membrane t-SNAREs SNAP23 and STX4, and the typhoid toxin vesicle carrier v-SNARE VAMP7.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. For example, we have identified the CI-M6PR as the typhoid toxin sorting receptor, which the toxin engages through interactions with Neu5Ac-terminated sialoglycans on the receptor. It remains possible that in other cells, typhoid toxin sorting may be mediated by other Neu5AC-bearing receptors. However, the ubiquitous distribution of CI-M6PR suggests that this receptor is likely to play a major role in all cells. Another limitation to this study is that it was not comprehensive since the nature of the experimental system did not allow us to conduct a genome-wide screen for cellular factors involved in typhoid toxin export, which could have identified additional components. We have previously utilized such an approach for the study of the typhoid toxin incoming transport pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, like any approach relying on the introduction of mutations to study a phenotype, our study is vulnerable to effects caused by the mutations that may indirectly affect the phenotype under study. For example, as COPII is involved in export pathways from the endoplasmic reticulum, its mutation may result in off-target effects. Whenever possible, however, we have attempted to provide alternative pieces of evidence to support our conclusions.</p><p>In summary, our studies have unraveled the mechanisms by which typhoid toxin is transported from the SCV to the extracellular space. The export pathway, which has evolved to be specifically adapted to the biology of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi, has coopted cellular machinery involved in various secretory and exocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings reveal how vesicle trafficking pathways that are seemingly unconnected can be coopted by microbial pathogens to carry out a specific function.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for typhoid toxin export from <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi-infected cells.</title><p>Mediated by the action of effector proteins of its two type III secretion systems, <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi gains access to host cells and builds an intracellular niche that allows its replication and survival.

On the cell periphery, the vesicle carriers undergo exocytosis by fusing to the plasma membrane, a process mediated by SNARE proteins VAMP7 on the vesicle carriers and SNAP23 and STX4 on the plasma membrane.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-78561-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhi)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>cdtB</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18191792/">18191792</ext-link>; MicrobesOnline Database</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">STY1886</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>S</italic>.

The LPS stain was used to identify the area corresponding to the bacterial cell body and this area was used to obtain the bacterial-associated typhoid toxin fluorescence signal, which was substracted from the typhoid toxin-associated fluorescence. The remaining fluorescence was defined as the area of typhoid toxin carrier intermediates. The intensity of fluorescence associated with toxin carriers was normalized using the fluorescence-associated typhoid toxin within bacterial cells in the same field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunofluorescent staining of CI-M6PR in infected cells</title><p>Henle-407 cells infected with the different <italic>S</italic>.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Typhoid toxin sorting and exocytic transport from <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi infected cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ethel Bayer-Santos (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work needs a major revision prior to be be considered for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Despite being generally positive about the nature of this study, the reviewers have raised serious issues with this paper that they feel will take some time to address. While I am rejecting the paper as a result of this, I am broadly supportive of this manuscript and if you feel that you are able to address these issues, I will consider a newly submitted form of this paper that I will treat as a revised manuscript.</p><p>Among the shortcomings identified, the four points listed below would need to be addressed experimentally:</p><p>1. In order for you to conclude that COPII is required for SCV-plasma membrane trafficking they would have to show that 1) knockdown of sec23 does not have an indirect effect on M6PR by blocking its ER export – you could do this by examining the localization of M6PR at the TGN and endosomes by immunofluorescence microscopy and 2) COPII can mediate trafficking from the SCV You could do this by checking for co-localization of COPII components with the SCV or the typhoid toxin.</p><p>2. You should control for the possibility that secreted toxin undergoes proteolysis in cells lacking M6PR (or other proteins). If this is the case, then important conclusions might be unjustified.</p><p>3. You should complement the CRISPR KO cell lines described in this study with a plasmid expressing the deleted gene to confirm that the phenotype is not due to a random mutation acquired during the process. Alternatively, you could show same phenotype for independently generated mutants</p><p>4. The interaction between CdtB and Sec23 should be tested as control in the m6pr knockout background.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The typhoid toxin is produced by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever in humans. The toxin is secreted into the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV) of host cells, from where it must be transported to the extracellular space to carry out its action. In this manuscript by Chang et al. the authors investigate the pathway by which the typhoid toxin is trafficked out of the host cell. They use immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry to identify the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate (CI-M6PR) as a binding partner for the typhoid toxin and convincingly demonstrate its role as the typhoid toxin sorting receptor. In addition, they show that the Typhimurium effector SseJ blocks recruitment of CI-M6PR to the SCV, confirming that the expression of specific Type III secretion system effectors affects the environment of the SCV. They then use CRISPR/cas9 knockdowns to characterise other host trafficking proteins that are required for toxin export, including COPII, Sar1, Rab11B, Rip11, VAMP7, SNAP23 and Syntaxin 4. These data provide interesting insights into the requirements of host proteins for typhoid toxin export, but a single pathway is not convincingly established, as proteins identified have not been linked together in terms of interaction or dependency with respect to toxin secretion. In addition, the data need to be discussed in the context of established knowledge of eukaryotic trafficking pathways.</p><p>1. The results of this work should be discussed in the context of the large body of published work on intracellular trafficking. M6PR intracellular trafficking pathways have been well characterised with information on the signalling sequences found in its cytoplasmic tail, the adaptor proteins they interact with including AP1, AP2, GGAs, PACS<sup>-1</sup>, TIP47 and Rab9 and the specific steps of trafficking pathways that they are involved in. The authors should discuss how their data relates to these pathways. AP1 is known to interact with M6PR and to traffic to and from endosomes and should therefore be included in the screens or at least discussed with a clear reason for its omission. The authors should also comment on the fact that the CI-M6PR normally traffics from the TGN to both endosomes and the plasma membrane, which could provide a plausible pathway.</p><p>2. COPII mediates trafficking of proteins between the ER and the Golgi. As such its knockdown should block all export from the ER including that of M6PR. The authors should discuss their data in the context of this information. To be convincing the authors need to rule out any indirect effect caused by blocking ER export and demonstrate clearly that COPII mediates this atypical pathway. For example, it is important to know (1) if COPII is recruited to the SCV membrane in a toxin-dependent manner, (2) if COPII interacts with M6PR and (3) is such an interaction required for toxin export in a way that can be distinguished from general ER export?</p><p>3. In order to convincingly establish a pathway, the proteins identified should be linked experimentally. For example, does the interaction of the toxin with Sec23 depend on the presence of M6PR? Can the authors be certain that all identified proteins are involved in direct traffic from the SCV to the plasma membrane? AP4 knockdown also decreased toxin export. Can the authors rule out its involvement in a separate step of the pathway?</p><p>4. The relative toxin export assay is not a convincing measurement. <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and perturbation of mannose-6-phosphate receptor traffic have been shown to increase the secretion of proteases (PMID 32514074, 23162002), which could degrade extracellular secreted toxin. Why do the authors use an indirect assay for cell cycle arrest rather than western blot of supernatants? Western blot analysis should be used to determine if lower amounts in extracellular fractions can be rescued by protease inhibition. Can the authors discuss the relevance of an increased relative toxin export as seen after knockdown of AP3B1 and STX-11?</p><p>5. The screen of Typhimurium effectors is interesting – in relation to Typhimurium. But the results do not help understand the features of the Typhi SCV that result in CI-M6PR recruitment. Since the Typhi spiA mutant is defective in packaging toxin into transport carriers (Chang et al. 2016), is this mutant defective in recruiting CI-M6PR to the vacuole? Or is CI-M6PR recruitment simply part of a default phago-lysosomal pathway, as would occur with dead bacteria?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Their data well justify the authors' conclusions. The article provides an excellent example highlighting the adaptation of an exotoxin co-evolved in the context of the life cycle of an intracellular pathogen producing the toxin. One remaining question not addressed in this article is whether CI-M6PR's role as a sorting receptor for typhoid toxin is shared across different host cells. This question arises because the interaction between CI-M6PR and typhoid toxin PltB is through the glycan, N-acetylneuraminic acid, displayed on the glycosylated sorting receptor(s), suggesting a different glycoprotein might serve as a sorting receptor in other host cells. Nonetheless, this manuscript elegantly determined the detailed sorting and transport process of typhoid toxin occurring in S. Typhi-infected host cells, which is well-justified by the data presented in the manuscript.</p><p>1. One remaining question not addressed in this article is whether CI-M6PR's role as a sorting receptor for typhoid toxin is shared across different host cells. This question arises because the interaction between CI-M6PR and typhoid toxin PltB is through the glycan, N-acetylneuraminic acid, displayed on the glycosylated sorting receptor(s), suggesting a different glycoprotein might serve as a sorting receptor in other host cells. This can be addressed by investigating other cells relevant to S. Typhi infection. Alternatively, the authors can address this point in the Discussion, perhaps under a separate section &quot;Limitations of this study&quot; to help readers obtain a clearer understanding of the toxin trafficking pathway.</p><p>2. SseJ's role is demonstrated, which is absent in S. Typhi. In some places in the manuscript (i.e., Abstract and Result, page 2, lines 11-13, page 7, lines 16-18), the corresponding descriptions are a bit confusing, sounding like a SPI2 effector produced by S. Typhi plays a key role in the packaging process. Rephrasing some of the descriptions may be considered to help readers get the concept quickly.</p><p>3. Relating to SseJ's role, examining the altered expression and/or localization of OSBP and CI-M6PR on the SCV in various cases tested in the manuscript (i.e., S. Typhi-, S. Typhi+sseJ-, and S. Typhi+sseJS151A-infected host cells) is expected to strengthen the authors' point on the co-evolution of SPI2 effectors and typhoid toxin.</p><p>4. S. Figures S1, S2, S4, S7, and S8: All data from 2-3 independent experiments can be combined and presented as the main figures (as opposed to one representative data for the main figures and all the remaining data for supplementary figures).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Chang et al., authors identified the intracellular receptor (cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, CI-M6PR) of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi typhoid toxin , which is responsible for sorting this toxin out of the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV). This was a curious finding since it was well established by complementary studies using <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium that CI-M6PR does not colocalize with the SCV. The authors went on to determine the reason for such differences and identified the S. Typhimurium-specific T3SS effector SseJ as responsible for preventing the co-localization of CI-M6PR in SCVs.</p><p>The proteins playing a role in the exocytic pathway driving the export of typhoid toxin were also identified. After binding of the typhoid toxin to CI-M6PR in the lumen of the SCV, COPII and SarIB mediate the formation of export carries, which are transported to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on the GTPase Rab11B and its interacting partner RIP11. Lastly, the fusion of the carriers to the plasma membrane depends on the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23 and STX4.</p><p>This work answers a long-standing question in the field, and the author conclusions are well supported by a series of complementary experiments.</p><p>Some controls are missing in this version of the manuscript, which could provide strength to these findings.</p><p>In my opinion, the work would greatly beneficiate from live-imaging microscopy analysis showing the trafficking of typhoid toxin within infected or transfected cells. These data could complement the current methodology and make the article more interesting.</p><p>1) I think that it is important to complement all the CRISPR KO cell lines described in this study with a plasmid expressing the deleted gene to confirm that the phenotype is not due to a random mutation acquired during the process (either due to the technique itself or the selection of clones within the initial WT population). As all data was performed in HEK293T cells that transfect very well, this could be done relatively easily for CI-M6PR-/-; SEC23B-/-; Sar1B-/-; Rab11B-/-; Rip11-/-; SNAP23-/-; STX4-/-; VAMP7-/-.</p><p>2) The co-IP experiment shown in Figure 4I could be performed in the CI-M6PR-/- background. If the authors hypothesis is correct, one would expect that the interaction between CdtB and Sec23 (COPII) would be lost.</p><p>3) Although discussed in the text, Figure 6C is lacking statistical analysis. This should be included.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Typhoid toxin sorting and exocytic transport from <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi infected cells&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We also understand that the reviewer may feel that our data do not &quot;convincingly establish…a single pathway&quot; responsible for toxin export, and that the reviewer would also like to see our data &quot;interpreted in the context of established knowledge of eukaryotic trafficking pathways&quot;. The view of the reviewer is, understandably, &quot;basic cell biology-centric&quot;, a view fundamentally shaped by paradigms built through the study of &quot;model systems&quot; (for example EGF, transferrin, or GLU receptor, in the case of endocytic transport). It is important to note, however, that as those of us who have been in the field of &quot;cellular microbiology&quot; from the very early days like to say, &quot;bugs do not read the cell biology textbooks&quot;. As the reviewer would certainly understand, this makes the work of studying pathogens much harder because, although knowledge of cell biological process available is extremely useful, often we can't fit our observations into preestablished canons. &quot;Bugs&quot; don't let us do that… There are countless examples of cell biological processes modulated by microbial pathogens in ways that are &quot;unprecedented&quot;, and that deviate from established paradigms. This is actually one of the exciting aspects of the study of pathogens because &quot;unprecedented&quot; often times does not mean that bugs do it &quot;their way&quot; but rather, that the study of the canonical systems have missed that aspect of cell biology. In these cases, the studies not only illuminate microbial pathogenesis but also basic cell biology. This study falls somewhere in between… there are mechanistic aspects of typhoid toxin export that fit some previously established paradigm but there are aspects that clearly do not. Consequently, it is natural that the pathway does not neatly fit into a &quot;single pathway&quot;. It is &quot;the nature of the beast&quot;… Regardless, when appropriate, we have tried to place our findings in the context of previously described pathways. Again, we thank the reviewer for the thorough review of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Unfortunately, for a variety of reason, it is not possible to implement such screen for the study of typhoid toxin’s export pathway. Consequently, to identify components of typhoid’s toxin export pathway we conducted a more labor-intensive “gene candidate screen&quot;, which required the construction of more than 20 different knockout cells using CRISPR/Cas9, amounting to a major undertaking. Using this approach, it is practically impossible to probe every gene reported to be involved in some exocytic pathway. Therefore, we had to prioritize our study focusing on those genes that may be more likely to play a role in typhoid toxin export. For example, the identification of the CI-M6PR sorting receptor allowed us to narrow the set of candidates to investigate. Furthermore, we approached the study in a gradual manner so as to be able to use the information obtained from the examination of some candidates to select additional ones. As alluded by the reviewer, numerous adaptors and coat proteins have been shown to interact with CI-M6PR in different cellular compartments. Among them, and as indicated by the reviewer, are the adaptor proteins AP1 and AP2, which in the context of the sorting of CI-M6PR, have been shown to work in conjunction with clathrin. Since we found no involvement of clathrin in typhoid toxin sorting, we directed our attention to other adaptor/coat components known to be involved in the sorting of the CI-M6PR but in a clathrin-independent manner. We have clarified these issues in the text and expand our discussion of possible link between known CI-M6PR sorting pathways and typhoid toxin secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. COPII mediates trafficking of proteins between the ER and the Golgi. As such its knockdown should block all export from the ER including that of M6PR. The authors should discuss their data in the context of this information. To be convincing the authors need to rule out any indirect effect caused by blocking ER export and demonstrate clearly that COPII mediates this atypical pathway. For example, it is important to know (1) if COPII is recruited to the SCV membrane in a toxin-dependent manner, (2) if COPII interacts with M6PR and (3) is such an interaction required for toxin export in a way that can be distinguished from general ER export?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have shown that Sec23A is recruited to the <italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuole (SCV), particularly at later times after infection. This observation (shown in the revised manuscript as Supplementary Figure S17) is consistent with the involvement of COPII in the packaging and trafficking of typhoid toxin to the extracellular space. The luminal localization of typhoid toxin, which does not have any transmembrane domain, makes it highly unlikely that it could be involved in the recruitment of CI-M6PR or COPII to the SCV. Therefore, we have not examined this specific question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In order to convincingly establish a pathway, the proteins identified should be linked experimentally. For example, does the interaction of the toxin with Sec23 depend on the presence of M6PR? Can the authors be certain that all identified proteins are involved in direct traffic from the SCV to the plasma membrane? AP4 knockdown also decreased toxin export. Can the authors rule out its involvement in a separate step of the pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined whether the interaction between Sec23 and typhoid toxin is dependent on the presence of CI-M6PR (see revised Figure 4j). As discussed above, we found that in the absence of CI-M6PR, the formation of a complex between CdtB (a typhoid toxin component) and Sec23 was abrogated. This observation supports the notion that typhoid toxin, CI-M6PR and Sec23 form a complex. As indicated by the reviewer, the absence of AP4 resulted in a reduced level of typhoid toxin export. However, we did not observe a decrease in the formation of typhoid toxin transport carriers, suggesting a role for AP4 at some step of typhoid toxin export, downstream from its budding from the SCV, or an indirect effect on other aspect of typhoid toxin export. Whether the involvement of AP4 is direct or indirect is not clear at this point. The limitations of our study have now been specifically addressed in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The relative toxin export assay is not a convincing measurement. Salmonella infection and perturbation of mannose-6-phosphate receptor traffic have been shown to increase the secretion of proteases (PMID 32514074, 23162002), which could degrade extracellular secreted toxin. Why do the authors use an indirect assay for cell cycle arrest rather than western blot of supernatants? Western blot analysis should be used to determine if lower amounts in extracellular fractions can be rescued by protease inhibition. Can the authors discuss the relevance of an increased relative toxin export as seen after knockdown of AP3B1 and STX-11?</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that it has been reported that infection of cultured cells with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium results in a redistribution of the CI-M6PR and the release of proteases to the infection supernatant. However, we stressed that the intracellular biology of <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi is substantially different from that of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium. For example, although the Rab GTPases Rab29, Rab32, and Rab38 are readily and robustly recruited to the <italic>S.</italic> Typhi-containing vacuole, they are not recruited to the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-containing vacuole. This difference is specifically due to the absence in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi of two T3SS effector proteins (SopD2 and GtgE), which effectively prevent the recruitment of these GTPases to the <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium-containing vacuole (see for example PMID: 22042847, PMID: 23162001, PMID: 26867180, PMID: 32703879). More relevant to this study, we have shown here that in sharp contrast with <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium containing vacuole, CI-M6PR is readily and robustly recruited to the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-containing vacuole, although we did not observe the recruitment of lysosomal hydrolases (i. e. CI-M6PR recruitment was not due to the delivery of S. Typhi to lysosomes) (see Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, observations made with the study of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium vesicle trafficking cannot be directly extrapolated to <italic>S</italic>. Typhi. In any case, we have specifically addressed the reviewer's concern and found no evidence for the presence of extracellular proteases capable of degrading typhoid toxin (shown in the revised manuscript as Supplementary Figure S4).</p><p>The amount of toxin exported from infected cells is below the western blot detection limit under our experimental conditions. To be able to detect the toxin by western blot, the experiments would have to be scaled up in a manner that is not practical and susceptible to artifacts. Consequently, we had to use a more sensitive assay to detect typhoid toxin based on its biological activity. We are uncertain about the reasons why AP3B1- and STX-11-defective cells exhibit increased typhoid toxin export. We hypothesize that these proteins may be involved in alternative export pathways that may compete for cellular components involved in typhoid export but we do not have direct proof for this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The screen of Typhimurium effectors is interesting – in relation to Typhimurium. But the results do not help understand the features of the Typhi SCV that result in CI-M6PR recruitment. Since the Typhi spiA mutant is defective in packaging toxin into transport carriers (Chang et al. 2016), is this mutant defective in recruiting CI-M6PR to the vacuole? Or is CI-M6PR recruitment simply part of a default phago-lysosomal pathway, as would occur with dead bacteria?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct and, as expected, the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi <italic>∆spiA</italic> mutant is directed to lysosomes. However, in this compartment, as we have previously shown, the mere presence of CI-M6PR on the SCV is not sufficient for typhoid toxin packaging into vesicle carrier intermediates since packaging requires the intracellular environment of the wild-type SCV (see PMID: 27832592). We understand that there is some confusion on this issue since historically the <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium vacuoles have been assumed to be similar. However, as we have discussed above, the SCVs in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium infected cells are substantially different including differences in their ability to recruit the CI-M6PR, as well as substantial differences in the recruitment of at least 3 Rab GTPases. Stating the obvious, we would like to emphasize that the presence of the CI-M6PR on the wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhi SCV is not due to its traffic to lysosomes. Lysosomal hydrolases, for example, are not recruited to the wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhi containing vacuole (see Supplementary Figure S1). We have clarified this issue in the text and provided an additional Supplementary Figure to formally document this observation (see Supplementary Figure S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Their data well justify the authors' conclusions. The article provides an excellent example highlighting the adaptation of an exotoxin co-evolved in the context of the life cycle of an intracellular pathogen producing the toxin. One remaining question not addressed in this article is whether CI-M6PR's role as a sorting receptor for typhoid toxin is shared across different host cells. This question arises because the interaction between CI-M6PR and typhoid toxin PltB is through the glycan, N-acetylneuraminic acid, displayed on the glycosylated sorting receptor(s), suggesting a different glycoprotein might serve as a sorting receptor in other host cells. Nonetheless, this manuscript elegantly determined the detailed sorting and transport process of typhoid toxin occurring in S. Typhi-infected host cells, which is well-justified by the data presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Alternatively, the authors can address this point in the Discussion, perhaps under a separate section &quot;Limitations of this study&quot; to help readers obtain a clearer understanding of the toxin trafficking pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and it remains formally possible that typhoid toxin may engage alternative receptors in different cells. We have presented evidence that CI-M6PR appears to be the main receptor in intestinal Henle-407 and HEK293T cells, two rather different cell lines, which suggest that CI-M6PR is likely the main sorting receptor in several different cells, which is consistent with its ubiquitous expression. We have discussed this and other limitations of our study in the discussion session as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. SseJ's role is demonstrated, which is absent in S. Typhi. In some places in the manuscript (i.e., Abstract and Result, page 2, lines 11-13, page 7, lines 16-18), the corresponding descriptions are a bit confusing, sounding like a SPI2 effector produced by S. Typhi plays a key role in the packaging process. Rephrasing some of the descriptions may be considered to help readers get the concept quickly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have introduced the suggested editorial changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Relating to SseJ's role, examining the altered expression and/or localization of OSBP and CI-M6PR on the SCV in various cases tested in the manuscript (i.e., S. Typhi-, S. Typhi+sseJ-, and S. Typhi+sseJS151A-infected host cells) is expected to strengthen the authors' point on the co-evolution of SPI2 effectors and typhoid toxin.</p></disp-quote><p>Perhaps the reviewer missed the data, but we did compare the recruitment of CI-M6PR to the SCV of cells infected with wild-type <italic>S</italic>. Typhi and <italic>S</italic>. Typhi expressing either wild-type SseJ or its catalytic mutant SseJ<sup>S151A</sup>. We found that expression of wild type SseJ but not of its catalytic mutant prevented the efficient recruitment of CI-M6PR to the SCV. This led us to conclude that SseJ prevents the recruitment of CI-M6PR in a catalytic-dependent manner (see Figure 3e, Supplementary Figure S9, and Supplementary data set 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This was a curious finding since it was well established by complementary studies using Salmonella Typhimurium that CI-M6PR does not colocalize with the SCV. The authors went on to determine the reason for such differences and identified the S. Typhimurium-specific T3SS effector SseJ as responsible for preventing the co-localization of CI-M6PR in SCVs.</p><p>The proteins playing a role in xocyticc pathway driving the export of typhoid toxin were also identified. After binding of the typhoid toxin to CI-M6PR in the lumen of the SCV, COPII and SarIB mediate the formation of export carries, which are transported to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on the GTPase Rab11B and its interacting partner RIP11. Lastly, the fusion of the carriers to the plasma membrane depends on the SNARE proteins VAMP7, SNAP23 and STX4.</p><p>This work answers a long-standing question in the field, and the author conclusions are well supported by a series of complementary experiments.</p><p>Some controls are missing in this version of the manuscript, which could provide strength to these findings.</p><p>In my opinion, the work would greatly beneficiate from live-imaging microscopy analysis showing the trafficking of typhoid toxin within infected or transfected cells. These data could complement the current methodology and make the article more interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our work. We share the reviewer’s desire to visualize the trafficking of typhoid toxin in live cells. Unfortunately, despite a lot of effort we have not been able to do so, fundamentally, because we can’t get fluorescently tagged versions of typhoid toxin to be efficiently secreted to the bacterial periplasm, despite testing many different tags, some of which reported in the literature to be transported to the bacterial periplasm. This has been an insurmountable challenge that has so far eluded a solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) I think that it is important to complement all the CRISPR KO cell lines described in this study with a plasmid expressing the deleted gene to confirm that the phenotype is not due to a random mutation acquired during the process (either due to the technique itself or the selection of clones within the initial WT population). As all data was performed in HEK293T cells that transfect very well, this could be done relatively easily for CI-M6PR-/-; SEC23B-/-; Sar1B-/-; Rab11B-/-; Rip11-/-; SNAP23-/-; STX4-/-; VAMP7-/-.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we include the analysis of a least two independent clones of the CRISPR/Cas9 generated cell lines with deficiencies in different component of the export pathway (the data are shown in several new Supplementary Figures). We found no significant differences in toxin trafficking between the independent clones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The co-IP experiment shown in Figure 4I could be performed in the CI-M6PR-/- background. If the authors hypothesis is correct, one would expect that the interaction between CdtB and Sec23 (COPII) would be lost.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we compared the ability of CdtB (a component of typhoid toxin) to form a complex with Sec23 in the presence or absence of CI-M6PR. We found that in CIM6PR -/- cells, formation of the CdtB/Sec23 complex was impaired (these data are shown in a modified Figure 4). This observation further supports the premise that the CI-M6PR/COPII complex serves as cargo receptor for typhoid toxin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although discussed in the text, Figure 6C is lacking statistical analysis.
