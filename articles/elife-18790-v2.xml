NPAS1 and NPAS3 must each heterodimerize with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), to form functional transcription complexes capable of DNA binding and gene regulation. Here we examined the crystal structures of multi-domain NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT-DNA complexes, discovering each to contain four putative ligand-binding pockets. Through expanded architectural comparisons between these complexes and HIF-1α-ARNT, HIF-2α-ARNT and CLOCK-BMAL1, we show the wider mammalian bHLH-PAS family is capable of multi-ligand-binding and presents as an ideal class of transcription factors for direct targeting by small-molecule drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18790.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18790.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18790.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Transcription factors are proteins that can bind to DNA to regulate the activity of genes. One family of transcription factors in mammals is known as the bHLH-PAS family, which consists of sixteen members including NPAS1 and NPAS3. These two proteins are both found in nerve cells, and genetic mutations that affect NPAS1 or NPAS3 have been linked to psychiatric conditions in humans. Therefore, researchers would like to discover new drugs that can bind to these proteins and control their activities in nerve cells. Understanding the three-dimensional structure of a protein can aid the discovery of small molecules that can bind to these proteins and act as drugs. Proteins in the bHLH-PAS family have to form pairs in order to bind to DNA: NPAS1 and NPAS3 both interact with another bHLH-PAS protein called ARNT, but it is not clear exactly how this works.</p><p>In 2015, a team of researchers described the shapes that ARNT adopts when it forms pairs with two other bHLH-PAS proteins that are important for sensing when oxygen levels drop in cells. Here, Wu et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the earlier work – have used a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional shapes of NPAS1 when it is bound to ARNT, and NPAS3 when it is bound to both ARNT and DNA. The experiments show that each of these structures contains four distinct pockets that certain small molecules might be able to bind to. The NPAS1 and NPAS3 structures are similar to each other and to the previously discovered bHLH-PAS structures involved in oxygen sensing.</p><p>Further analysis of other bHLH-PAS proteins suggests that all the members of this protein family are likely to be able to bind to small molecules and should therefore be considered as potential drug targets. The next step following on from this work is to identify small molecules that bind to bHLH-PAS proteins, which will help to reveal the genes that are regulated by this family. In the future, these small molecules may have the potential to be developed into new drugs to treat psychiatric conditions and other diseases in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18790.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18790.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PAS domains</kwd><kwd>Neuronal PAS Proteins</kwd><kwd>bHLH-PAS proteins</kwd><kwd>ligand binding pockets</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>psychiatric disorders</kwd><kwd>drug discovery</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>Hypoxia-Inducible Factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS 1R01GM117013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rastinejad</surname><given-names>Fraydoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000183</institution-id><institution>Army Research Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rastinejad</surname><given-names>Fraydoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Detailed structural analysis of NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT complexes, and further comparisons with other bHLH-PAS protein structures, show that this family of mammalian transcription factors have distinct ligand-binding pockets within their molecular architectures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian bHLH-PAS transcription factors share a common protein architecture consisting of a conserved bHLH DNA-binding domain, tandem PAS domains (PAS-A and PAS-B), and a variable activation or repression domain.

In all these complexes, the conserved bHLH-PAS-A-PAS-B protein segments were visualized. While no internal cavities were reported within the CLOCK-BMAL1 architecture; we identified multiple hydrophobic pockets within HIF-1α-ARNT and HIF-2α-ARNT heterodimers. Discrete pockets were encapsulated within each of the four PAS domains of their heterodimers (two within ARNT and two within each HIF-α protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Beyond the first structural characterizations of NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT complexes presented here, we further addressed if ligand-binding cavities are a common feature of mammalian bHLH-PAS proteins. A comparison of these two structures with those of CLOCK-BMAL1, HIF-1α-ARNT and HIF-2α-ARNT heterodimers unveils the larger mammalian bHLH-PAS family as ligand binding transcription factors with internal pockets appropriate for the selective binding of lipophilic molecules and drug-like compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT architectures</title><p>We employed the contiguous bHLH-PAS-A-PAS-B segments of NPAS1, NPAS3 and ARNT proteins for our crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Therefore, we conclude that there are at least two distinct architectural forms within the mammalian bHLH-PAS family. Since the ARNT heterodimers form a larger group than the BMAL1 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we asked if other ARNT heterodimers rely on the same six domain-domain junctions we observed in NPAS1-ARNT, NPAS3-ARNT and HIF-α-ARNT heterodimers. We could experimentally interrogate the degree of architectural variation within the ARNT heterodimer class by using our panel of ARNT mutations that were able to block its heterodimerization with NPAS1 and NPAS3.</p><p>Using co-IP studies, we tested if these same ARNT mutations would disrupt its heterodimeric complexes with SIM1, NPAS4 and AHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The SIM1-ARNT heterodimer stability was indeed compromised by these ARNT mutations, indicating that this heterodimer shares the same overall architecture as NPAS1-ARNT, NPAS3-ARNT and the two HIF-α-ARNT heterodimers. However, NPAS4-ARNT and AHR-ARNT heterodimer stabilities were not impacted in the same manner by these ARNT mutations, particularly when the mutations were located to interfaces 3 and 4. Therefore, we believe there is greater architectural variation within ARNT heterodimer group than what has been crystallographically observed to date. A protein amino-acid sequence alignment further indicates that residues observed to stabilize domain-domain junctions in the NPAS1/3-ARNT and HIF-α-ARNT heterodimers are much more conserved in SIM1 than in NPAS4 and AHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).</p><p>The ARNT protein is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, but its paralog ARNT2 is more specifically enriched in brain and kidney tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirose et al., 1996</xref>). ARNT and ARNT2 have both unique and overlapping cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Keith et al., 2001</xref>), and ARNT2 has been suggested as the preferred physiological partner for Class I members SIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michaud et al., 2000</xref>) and NPAS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bersten et al., 2014</xref>). Since the amino-acid sequence identity at the bHLH-PAS region is nearly 80% between ARNT and ARNT2, and since all the ARNT residues observed to be participating at dimerization interfaces are fully conserved in ARNT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), we predict that ARNT2 heterodimers will display similar overall quaternary architectures as their ARNT counterparts. To test this prediction, we mutated two ARNT2 residues at each of the four dimer interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Compared with the ARNT mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), these corresponding ARNT2 mutations (both single and double ones) indeed had similar effects on the dimerization with not only SIM1 but also NPAS4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that ARNT2 indeed dimerizes with SIM1 and NPAS4 in the same way as ARNT does.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT cavities</title><p>In both HIF-1α-ARNT and HIF-2α-ARNT heterodimers, we previously identified hydrophobic pockets encapsulated within the two PAS domains of ARNT, and within the two PAS domains of each HIF-α protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Here we asked if NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT harbored similarly positioned pockets. NPAS1 and NPAS3 are genetically associated with a wide range of human neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kamnasaran et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pieper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stanco et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the discovery of ligand-binding cavities could lead to the future discovery of therapeutic molecules for these illnesses. We show that NPAS1 protein’s PAS-A and PAS-B domains do contain internal cavities with volumes measuring 190 Å<sup>3</sup> and 180 Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Similarly positioned pockets are seen in the NPAS3 protein, measuring 100 Å<sup>3</sup> and 230 Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Each of these PAS domains resembles a baseball catcher’s mitt, with the beta strands forming the palm and short alpha-helices forming the opposing thumb to enclose a central pocket.</p><p>Through heterodimerization, ARNT further brings its own two pockets to join each of its class I partners. We examined if the two ARNT pockets alter their shape when ARNT forms different heterodimeric complexes. We could not detect any major change in the cavity size or shape of ARNT’s PAS-A and PAS-B pockets, whether this protein was in a complex with HIF-2α or NPAS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). ARNT is ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and is predominantly nuclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reyes et al., 1992</xref>); whereas its class I heterodimerization partners are signal activated and/or tissue restricted. Therefore, the pockets located in NPAS1, NPAS3, HIF-1α and HIF-2α should allow more selective actions of therapeutic drugs than the pockets within ARNT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Variations in protein pockets</title><p>Our findings of two similarly positioned pockets within each of NPAS1, NPAS3, HIF-1α, HIF-2α and ARNT led us to consider if any other bHLH-PAS family members could also harbor putative ligand-binding cavities.

Therefore, we closely examined this structure and found that both CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins contained discrete pockets within each of their PAS-A and PAS-B domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>).

These molecules display significant variations in their chemical structures and sizes, but still bind with high affinities to AHR (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of 0.1–100 nM). High-affinity, multi-ligand binding can best be accounted for by the use of four discrete pockets within AHR-ARNT, as shown here for other ARNT heterodimers, than just one pocket as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pandini et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows side-by-side comparisons of the PAS-A and PAS-B pockets from multiple bHLH-PAS proteins. Importantly, each PAS domain relies on a constellation of different amino-acids to form its interior cavity, allowing the pockets to bind selectively to different repertoires of endogenous ligands. Moreover, within subgroups such as HIF-1α/2α, NPAS1/3, and SIM1/2, the proteins share pocket residues more closely with each other than they do between subgroups. This observation indicates close ligand preferences within subgroups, suggesting they could recognize similar metabolites or signaling molecules derived from the same biosynthetic pathway. Importantly, in all the PAS-A and PAS-B pockets, the amino-acid residues lining interior cavities are predominantly hydrophobic. This property would allow favorable van der Waals interactions with lipophilic ligands. The desolvation of hydrophobic ligands can further contribute to favorable energetics of ligand-binding inside these cavities.</p><p>The internal pocket volumes in the bHLH-PAS family (100–600 Å<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) are in-line with pocket sizes observed in other classes of ligand-binding proteins (100–1000 Å<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, we found that ligand binding can increase the size of pocket significantly.

These observations suggest a high degree of adaptability in PAS domain pockets, and should encourage future drug-discovery efforts seeking multiple classes of synthetic modulators for bHLH-PAS proteins. An analogy can be made with the nuclear receptor family, where diverse classes of small-molecules can bind to the same pocket, and ligand binding can expand pocket sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2010b</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previously, the nuclear receptors were believed to form the only transcription factor family in higher eukaryotes with conserved ligand binding capabilities. We showed here that the mammalian bHLH-PAS proteins constitute a second independent family of transcription factors with the appropriate and conserved molecular frameworks required for multi-ligand binding. Our findings are based on the direct crystallographic analysis of seven distinct bHLH family members (ARNT, HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NPAS1, NPAS3, CLOCK and BMAL1). In all these proteins, internal hydrophobic cavities were clearly observed within both their PAS-A and PAS-B domains. These PAS domains become interweaved in bHLH-PAS heterodimers through at least two highly distinct forms of architecture. Aside from the seven members we crystallographically examined, three additional members: AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stejskalova et al., 2011</xref>), HIF-3α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fala et al., 2015</xref>) and NPAS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dioum et al., 2002</xref>) are known to have ligand-binding capabilities associated with at least one of their PAS domains, bringing the experimentally confirmed number of ligand pocket containing members to ten. Our sequence-structure comparative analyses further implicate three more members: ARNT2, SIM1 and SIM2, as likely to harbor pockets due to considerable amino-acid conservations with ARNT and NPAS1.</p><p>Our unmasking of the wider bHLH-PAS protein family as a group of transcription factors with multi-ligand-binding capabilities should fuel the future search for their physiological and endogenous ligands. The protein pockets, in each case, make these factors ideally suited for applications of high-throughput screening campaigns to find small-molecule therapeutics for a variety of human diseases, including psychiatric illnesses, cancers and metabolic diseases. The distinctive amino-acid residues inside their pockets predict successful outcomes for screens seeking highly selective modulators for each protein. These pockets are also highly pliable and can accommodate significantly larger ligands than their empty volumes alone suggest.</p><p>The precise mechanism through which endogenous and/or pharmacologic ligands can modulate transcriptional activities of bHLH-PAS proteins has not yet been fully revealed, and could differ for each family member. For example, ligand binding to AHR can displace heat shock protein 90 and initiate the nuclear translocation of AHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Soshilov and Denison, 2011</xref>). Some small-molecule HIF-2α antagonists that bind to the PAS-B domain can disrupt the dimerization between HIF-2α and ARNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scheuermann et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond these initial observations to date, and without the availability of small-molecule tools to probe other bHLH-PAS proteins, the mechanistic links between ligand binding and transcriptional regulation remain to be discovered.</p><p>It is interesting that while dimeric nuclear receptors harbor two pockets in their functional architectures, the bHLH-PAS proteins present four distinct pockets. Notably a fifth pocket was also observed in HIF-2α-ARNT heterodimers, located between two subunits, allowing proflavine to promote subunit dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). The latter finding further suggests that crevices formed between the PAS domains within the quaternary architectures of family members could form additional ligand binding and modulation sites. The availability of so many distinctive pockets within bHLH-PAS proteins could allow a variety of biosynthetic or metabolic signals derived from cellular pathways to be integrated into a single unified functional response. Alternatively, each pocket may allow a bHLH-PAS protein to be the site of unique ligand within each cell-type. The identification and validation of endogenous ligands for this family will help define the genetic programs controlled by each bHLH-PAS member.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction and site-directed mutagenesis</title><p>For protein overexpression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, mouse NPAS1 (GenBank accession: AAI32114.1, residues 43–423) and NPAS3 (GenBank accession: AAI67248.1, residues 56–455) were cloned into the pSJ2 vector, respectively.

Proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). To prepare NPAS3-ARNT DNA-bound complexes, synthetic 21mer double-strand DNA (forward: 5’- GGCTGCGTACGTGCGGGTCGT-3’ and reverse: 5’-CACGACCCGCACGTACGCAGC-3’) was mixed with the heterodimeric proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Crystallization and X-ray data collection</title><p>Crystallization of the NPAS1-ARNT complex was carried out using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 16°C, by mixing equal volume of protein (4 mg/ml) and reservoir solution containing 2% Tacsimate pH 7.0, 3% PEG3350. Before flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, crystals were soaked in reservoir plus 30% glycerol as the cryoprotectant. NPAS3-ARNT-DNA crystals were grown at 16°C in sitting drops formed by equal volume of complex (4 mg/ml) and reservoir consisting of 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>F, 9% PEG 3350, and then transferred stepwise to cryoprotectant of 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>F, 10% PEG 3350 and up to 30% PEG 400 (5% increase each step) prior to flash freezing. Diffraction data were collected at the Argonne National Laboratory SBC-CAT 19ID beamline at 100 K.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Structure determination and refinement</title><p>The structures of NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT-DNA complexes were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014219">SCR_014219</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>), using the HIF-2α-ARNT structures (PDB: 4ZP4 and 4ZPK) as the search models.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, including Ronald M Evans (Reviewer #3) and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports a structural and biochemical characterization of two heterodimeric bHLH-PAS domain proteins, NPAS1-ARNT and NPAS3-ARNT, that probes differences in domain-domain arrangements among different subclasses of PAS proteins and identifies broad conservation of ligand-binding pockets that appear capable of binding a broad array of ligands. The structure of NPAS3-ARNT bound to the hypoxia response element (HRE) recognized by NPAS1 establishes the specificity and provides mechanistic insight into DNA binding by NPAS3. Mutations in NPAS1 and NPAS3 underlie varies psychiatric disordered, making these potential targets of drug discovery. A comparison of these structures with a previous structure of related family members, CLOCK and BMAL1, reveals that the latter may also contain previously unnoticed ligand-binding pockets, thereby suggesting that bHLH-PAS proteins may be considered a new class of ligand-regulated transcription factors. The in vivo relevance of these structures is supported by transcriptional reporter assays and protein co-immunoprecipitation studies, where mutations at domain-domain interfaces identified in the structures disrupt the heterodimeric protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, the differential effects of the mutations in ARNT on its interactions with the additional bHLH-PAS family members SIM1, NPAS4 and AHR provide insight into its function as a common co-receptor.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> is based on HRE-luciferase reporters. This data should be replaced with validated NPAS/ARNT consensi from one or more of the promoters/enhancers of bona fide NPAS target genes.</p><p>2) Mutations found in ARNT that disrupt SIM1 and NPAS4 dimerization should be introduced into ARNT2, and the IPs repeated. ARNT2 is their physiological partner, and this should be confirmed in the 293T assays, not simply inferred from sequence alignment.</p><p>3) While the authors draw a comparison between bHLH-PAS proteins and nuclear receptors as ligand binding transcription factors, the conformational changes induced by ligand binding in PAS domains appear subtle, raising questions on how endogenous and/or pharmacologic ligands targeting these pockets affect transcriptional activity. Some discussion on potential mechanisms would improve the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18790.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> is based on HRE-luciferase reporters.

A short paragraph is now included in the Discussion section about currently known mechanisms that relate ligand binding to changes in the functions of bHLH-PAS proteins (third paragraph). To more comprehensively explore the mechanisms that can relate ligand-binding to transcriptional regulation, one must first have in hand endogenous ligands (or synthetic tool compounds) for NPAS1, NPAS3 and other bHLH-PAS proteins. Unfortunately, almost all bHLH-PAS members remain “orphans” at this time, presenting a significant barrier to uncovering the full range of mechanisms that could relate ligand binding to changes in transcriptional activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
