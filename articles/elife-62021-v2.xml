The basis of SARM1 inhibition and its activation under stress conditions are still unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM maps of SARM1 at 2.9 and 2.7 Å resolutions. These indicate that SARM1 homo-octamer avoids premature activation by assuming a packed conformation, with ordered inner and peripheral rings, that prevents dimerization and activation of the catalytic domains. This inactive conformation is stabilized by binding of SARM1’s own substrate NAD+ in an allosteric location, away from the catalytic sites. This model was validated by mutagenesis of the allosteric site, which led to constitutively active SARM1. We propose that the reduction of cellular NAD+ concentration contributes to the disassembly of SARM1's peripheral ring, which allows formation of active NADase domain dimers, thereby further depleting NAD+ to cause an energetic catastrophe and cell death.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biochemistry</kwd><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>molecular neuroscience</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1425/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Opatowsky</surname><given-names>Yarden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>909/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Opatowsky</surname><given-names>Yarden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005201</institution-id><institution>Elsevier Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jack and Simon Djanogly Professorial Chair in Biochemistry</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaron</surname><given-names>Avraham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>I declare that the funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM shows that the NADase activity of SARM1 is allosterically inhibited by physiological concentrations of NAD+ that stabilizes an auto-inhibited conformation of SARM1, explaining how NAD+ depletion may inflict neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SARM1 (sterile α and HEAT/armadillo motif–containing protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mink et al., 2001</xref>) was first discovered as a negative regulator of TRIF (TIR domain–containing adaptor inducing interferon-β) in TLR (Toll-like receptor) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carty et al., 2006</xref>). SARM1 was later shown to promote neuronal death by oxygen and glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2007</xref>) and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Uccellini et al., 2020</xref>), while also having a protective role against bacterial and fungal infections in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couillault et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liberati et al., 2004</xref>). Subsequently, studies have demonstrated that SARM1 is also a key part of a highly conserved axonal death pathway that is activated by nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>).

The enzymatic activity requires a high local concentration of the TIR domains, as demonstrated by forced dimerization of TIR, which resulted in NAD+ hydrolysis and neuronal cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerdts et al., 2016</xref>). Also, the deletion of the ARM domain in SARM1, which interacts directly with TIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Summers et al., 2016</xref>), renders the ‘delARM’ construct constitutively active and leads to rapid cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>). How SAM domains cause TIR crowding became clearer in our recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>), where we showed that both hSARM1 (human SARM1) and the isolated tandem SAM<sup>1–2</sup> domains form octamers in solution. In this study, we used negative stain electron microscopy analysis of hSARM1 and determined the crystal structure (as did others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>]) of the SAM<sup>1–2</sup> domains – both of which revealed an octameric ring arrangement.</p><p>These findings imply that hSARM1 is kept auto-inhibited by the ARM domain in homeostasis and gains NADase activity upon stress conditions through the following: the infliction of injury (axotomy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>), oxidation (mitochondria depolarization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murata et al., 2013</xref>; oxidizing agents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Summers et al., 2014</xref>), metabolic conditions (depletion of NAD+, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>), or toxins (chemotherapy drugs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>). Whether and how all or some of these insults converge to induce SARM1 activation is still not completely understood. In this regard, little is known about the direct molecular triggers of SARM1 in cells, besides the potential involvement of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) and Ser-548 phosphorylation by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murata et al., 2018</xref>) in promoting the NADase activity of SARM1. Here, we present structural data and complementary biochemical assays to show that SARM1 is kept inactive through a ‘substrate inhibition’ mechanism, where the high concentration of NAD+ stabilizes the tightly packed, inhibited conformation of the protein. In this way, SARM1 activation is triggered by a decrease in the concentration of a cellular metabolite NAD+, rather than depending on the introduction of an activating factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cryo-EM visualization of purified hSARM1</title><p>For cryo-EM imaging, we generated a near-intact hSARM1 construct that lacks the N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal (<sup>26</sup>ERL…GPT<sup>724</sup>) and has a point mutation in the NADase catalytic site (E642Q). The resulting construct was expressed in mammalian cell culture and isolated to homogeneity using consecutive metal chelate and size exclusion chromatography steps.

The hSARM1<sup>E642Q</sup> octamer is 203 Å in diameter and 80 Å thick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The SAM<sup>1–2</sup> domains’ inner ring is the best resolved part of the map to which the high-resolution crystal structure (PDB code 6QWV) was fitted with minute adjustments. The TIR domains are the least defined part of the density map. Some parts of the TIR domain reach a local resolution of 6.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and therefore not revealing side chain positions. However, the availability of high-resolution crystal structures of isolated hSARM1 TIR (PDB codes 6O0R, 6O0U; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>) allowed their docking into the well-resolved secondary structure elements in the map with very high confidence. The ARM domains show intermediate map quality, with well-resolved secondary structures and bulky side chains. This allowed the building of a de-novo atomic model for the entire ARM, as no high-resolution structure or homology models of SARM1’s ARM are available. The entire atomic model is comprised of residues 56–700 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with an internal break at the linker that connects SAM<sup>2</sup> to the TIR domain. The structural analyses of the SAM domains and the SAM octamer ring assembly, as well as the atomic details of the TIR domain, are described in our previous study and by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>). The cryo-EM structure of the ARM domain reveals a closed crescent-shaped region, composed of seven three-helix ARM repeats spanning residues 60–400 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ARM topology is split into two interacting parts, designated ARM<sup>1</sup> (res. 60–303 with five ARM repeats) and ARM<sup>2</sup> (res. 322–400 with two ARM repeats) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The main ARM<sup>1</sup>–ARM<sup>2</sup> interaction interface is hydrophobic and involves helices α14 and α16 of ARM<sup>1</sup> and helices α1, α2, and α3 of ARM<sup>2</sup>. ARM<sup>1</sup> and ARM<sup>2</sup> are also interacting at the crescent ‘horns’ through the ARM<sup>1</sup>α2–α3 loop with the loop that connects ARM<sup>1</sup> with ARM<sup>2</sup> (res. 305–320). In the hSARM1 compact octamer, each ARM is directly connected via a linker (res. 400–404) to a SAM<sup>1</sup> domain. Also, each ARM is engaged in several non-covalent interactions with the same-chain SAM and with the clockwise neighboring SAM, when assuming a top view of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). Although neighboring ARM domains are closely packed, direct interactions between them seem to be limited, engaging a short segment of ARM<sup>1</sup> α9 with the α4–α5 loop of ARM<sup>2</sup> of the neighboring chain. Additional ARM–ARM interactions are indirect, mediated by the TIR domains. Each TIR binds the ARM ring via two sites, designated the ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ TIR docking sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The ‘primary’ is larger and engages the TIR helix αA and the EE loop with the ARM<sup>1</sup> α10, α10–α11 loop, and α13. The ‘secondary’ TIR docking site is smaller and involves the TIR BB loop and helix α7 of the counter-clockwise ARM<sup>1</sup> domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM structure of GraFix-ed hSARM1<sup>E642Q</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Selected representation of 2D class averages used for the 3D reconstruction.

While we have used the GraFix pretreatment to coerce the compact two-ring conformation, it seems that Bratkowski et al. employed a different strategy by selectively using a small subset (5.6%) of the initial picked particles to reconstruct their map. We assume that this was done to cope with the particle heterogeneity of purified SARM1. An obstacle we have encountered as well, where we observed that ~80% of the particles have a disordered outer ring.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The compact conformation of hSARM1 is inhibited for NADase activity</title><p>The GraFix-ed cryo-EM structure revealed a domain organization where the catalytic TIR subunits are separated from each other by docking onto the ARM peripheral ring. This assembly is dependent on the coupling of each TIR with two neighboring ARM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Since the NADase activity requires close proximity of several TIR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerdts et al., 2016</xref>), and possibly homo-dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>), we considered that the cryo-EM structure represents an inhibited conformation of SARM1, in which the TIR domains cannot form compact dimers and catabolize NAD+. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to weaken TIR docking to allow their nearing and subsequent NAD+ catalysis. To this end we designed amino acid substitutions at the ARM’s primary TIR docking site without compromising the protein’s structural integrity – particularly that of the TIR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Two pairs of mutations, RR216-7EE of ARM<sup>1</sup> helix α10 and FP255-6RR of ARM<sup>1</sup> helix α13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), were introduced, as well as the double mutant RR216-7EE/FP255-6RR. These constructs were transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells. The effect of these constructs on NAD+ levels and cell viability were monitored using a previously established resazurin fluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Essuman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>). The results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) show a rapid decrease in cellular NAD+ levels and 50% cell death within 24 hr after transfection of the FP255-6RR and double mutant. This toxicity level is similar to that of a hSARM1 construct missing the entire ARM domain ‘delARM’ (res. 409–724) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), proven to be toxic in neurons and HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>). This toxic effect was attributed to the removal of auto-inhibitory constraints imposed by the ARM domain. The RR216-7EE mutation has a weaker effect, probably due to the position of these amino acid residues at the margin of the TIR-ARM interface.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that hSARM1 inhibition requires ARM-TIR interaction through the ‘primary TIR docking site’. This conclusion is supported by other recently published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). We further calculated the surface conservation scores of SARM1 orthologs. The scores were color coded and plotted on the molecular surface of hSARM1 using the Consurf server (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashkenazy et al., 2016</xref>). The surface-exposed residues reveal a high level of conservation on both the ARM and TIR domain–binding interface. This indicates the biological importance of the interface and a possible conservation of its function in auto-inhibition among species. It was previously suggested that auto-inhibition of SARM1 is maintained by keeping SARM1 as a monomer, and that upon activation SARM1 assembles into a multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Figley and DiAntonio, 2020</xref>), very much like other apoptotic complexes. Our results show otherwise and explain how hSARM1 avoids premature activation even as a pre-formed octamer, while kept poised for rapid activation and response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Isolated hSARM1 is NADase active in vitro and inhibited by glycerol</title><p>As it became clear that the compact two-ring structure is inhibited for NADase activity, we considered whether the purified hSARM1, that was not subjected to GraFix and predominantly presents just the inner SAM ring in cryo-EM 2D averaging and 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), is active in vitro.

Moreover, a membrane-permeable NMN analogue activates SARM1 in cultured cells, leading to their death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore measured the effect of NMN supplement on the NADase activity of purified hSARM1 and found a moderate 30% increase in activity with 1 mM NMN, but none at a lower concentration of 200 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This demonstrates that the purified hSARM1 is mostly NADase active, even without NMN supplement, supporting the idea of a predominantly open conformation as seen in cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined what confines the GraFix-ed hSARM1 into the compact inhibited conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and measured the in vitro NADase activity in the presence of glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We found that glycerol reduces hSARM1 NADase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching 72% inhibition at 15% glycerol. In the GraFix preparation, we extracted hSARM1 from the gradient after it migrated to approximately 18% glycerol concentration. This is the position we used to image SARM1 in its inhibited compact conformation. It seems likely that this conformation is maintained after glycerol is removed, due to glutaraldehyde crosslinking which preserves the compact structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NAD+ substrate inhibition of hSARM1</title><p>Our results show that hSARM1 NADase activity is suppressed in cell culture, but much less so in vitro after being isolated. This prompted us to hypothesize that in the course of purification from the cytosolic fraction, hSARM1 loses a low-affinity cellular factor, responsible for inhibiting it in the cellular environment. SARM1 was previously shown to be activated in cell culture in response to metabolic, toxic, and oxidative stressors. We reasoned that the hypothesized inhibitory factor is a small molecule that is depleted under cellular stress conditions, and thus the inhibition of hSARM1 is released. To follow through on this hypothesis, we tested the impact of several small molecules, which are associated with the cell’s energetic state, with two in vitro parameters: hSARM1 NADase activity and structural conformation (visualized by cryo-EM). For instance, we already established that glycerol meets these two criteria, as it imposes hSARM1 compact conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and reduces NADase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Curiously, glycerol was found to occupy the active site of the hSARM1 TIR domain in a crystal structure (PDB code 6O0R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>]), directly linking structural data with enzymatic inhibition. However, the glycerol concentrations in which these in vitro experiments were conducted were very high (15–18% for the NADase activity assay and cryo-EM, and 25–30% in the X-ray crystal structure), that is,﻿ 2–4 M, which is considerably higher than the estimated sub 1 mM concentrations of intracellular physiological glycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Lin, 1983</xref>). Next, we considered ATP as a fit candidate to inhibit hSARM1, because ATP is the main energetic compound, with cellular concentrations between 1 and 10 mM, which is depleted prior to cell death and axonal degeneration. Indeed, we found that ATP inhibits the NADase activity of hSARM1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, it did not affect hSARM1 conformation as observed by 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

To measure NAD+ substrate inhibition of hSARM1, we used a fluorescent assay with a wide concentration range of the NAD+ analog, etheno-NAD (eNAD) (mixed 1:10 mol/mol with regular NAD+). eNAD fluoresces upon hydrolysis (ex. λ = 330 nm, em. λ = 405 nm). The results showed a bell-shaped curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) with the highest rate of hydrolysis at 100 µM NAD+ and a steady decrease in rate thereafter (at the higher concentrations). In addition, we used a direct reverse-phase HPLC monitoring of NAD+ consumption by hSARM1 compared with commercially available porcine brain NADase. While the rate of hydrolysis of porcine NADase was maintained between 50 µM and 2 mM NAD+, hSARM1 was almost completely inhibited at 2 mM NAD+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>2.7 Å resolution structure of NAD+ induced hSARM1 compact octamer</title><p>Following evidence for NAD+ substrate inhibition of hSARM1 by cryo-EM 2D classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) and enzymatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) assays, we pursued a 3D structure determination of hSARM1 complexed with NAD+ at inhibiting concentrations. hSARM1, supplemented by 5 mM NAD+, was imaged, reconstructed, and refined to 2.7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), resulting in an excellent map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The structure was largely identical to the GraFix-ed structure, further substantiating the validity of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Few structural differences can be observed between the NAD+ supplemented density map and that of the GraFix-ed hSARM1. The first difference is a 5 Å shift in the position of the distal part of the TIR domain, and the second is a rearrangement of the secondary structure at the region of the ‘crescent horns’, where the tips of ARM<sup>1</sup> and ARM<sup>2</sup> touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2A and B</xref>). In the same region, designated hereafter ‘ARM allosteric site’, an extra-density in the NAD+ supplemented map reveals the binding site of one NAD+ molecule, providing clear atomic details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). To probe into the function of the ARM allosteric site, we introduced point mutations, targeting three structural elements surrounding the NAD+ density. These elements were ARM<sup>1 </sup>α2, ARM<sup>1 </sup>α5–α6 loop, and the ARM<sup>1</sup>–ARM<sup>2</sup> loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a control, we introduced two other mutations in sites that we do not consider to be involved in hSARM1 inhibition or activation. We hypothesized that NAD+ binding at the ARM allosteric site stabilizes the ARM conformation by interacting with both ARM<sup>1</sup> and ARM<sup>2</sup>, thereby promoting the hSARM1 compact auto-inhibited structure. Therefore, mutations in the allosteric site, which interfere with NAD+ binding, would diminish auto-inhibition and allow hSARM1 activity in cell culture. Indeed, we found that two separate mutations in the ARM<sup>1 </sup>α5–α6 loop (L152A and R157E) and one in the opposite ARM<sup>1</sup>–ARM<sup>2</sup> loop (R322E) had a dramatic effect on hSARM1 activity, promoting cell death levels comparable to those induced by the ‘delARM’ ‘constitutively active’ construct, which is missing the entire ARM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Two mutations (D314A and Q320A), which are also located at the ARM<sup>1</sup>–ARM<sup>2</sup> loop but their side chains positioned away from the NAD+ molecule, did not induce hSARM1 activation. As expected, the control mutations E94R and K363A did not affect hSARM1 activity either. Surprisingly, mutating the bulky W103, which stacks with the NAD+ nicotinamide ring, into an alanine had only a small effect. Nevertheless, W103D mutation did have strong activating effect, leading to the notion that NAD+ contacts with the W103 side chain may be dispensable for the NAD+ inhibitory effect, but interference (as by the aspartate side chain) cannot be tolerated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>3D structure reveals an inhibitory ARM allosteric NAD+ binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Selected representation of 2D class averages used for the 3D reconstruction of hSARM1<sup>E642Q</sup> supplemented with 5 mM of NAD+.

The NAD+ directly interacts with the surrounding residues: the nicotinamide moiety is stacked onto the W103 side chain rings; the following ribose with L152 and H190; R110 forms salt bridge with phosphate alpha (proximal to the nicotinamide), while the beta phosphate (distal to the nicotinamide) forms salt bridges with R110 and R157. The map density at the distal ribose and adenosine moieties is less sharp, but clearly involves interactions with the ARM<sup>2</sup> R322, G323, and D326. In this way, activation by nicotinamide mononucleotide, that lacks the distal phosphate, ribose, and adenosine, can be explained by binding to ARM<sup>1</sup> while preventing the bridging interactions with ARM<sup>2</sup>.

This implies that there is more flexibility in the GraFix-ed structure. A likely reason for the difference in map homogeneity is that while the compact arrangement in the GraFix-ed structure is artificially imposed by high glycerol concentration, the NAD+ supplement seems to induce a more natural compact folding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our octamer ring structure of a near-intact hSARM1 reveals an inhibited conformation, in which the catalytic TIR domains are kept apart from each other, unable to form close homodimers, which are required for their NADase activity. This inhibited conformation readily disassembles and gains most of its potential activity during protein purification, substantiating our hypothesis that a low-affinity cellular factor inhibits hSARM1 is lost in purification. We have tested a few candidate molecules and found that NAD+ induces a dramatic conformational shift in purified hSARM1, from a disassembled outer ring to a compact two-ring structure, through binding to a distal allosteric site from the TIR catalytic domain. Point mutations in this distal site promoted hSARM1 activity in cultured cells and demonstrates their key allosteric role for inhibition of the NADase activity. We also found that hSARM1 is inhibited in vitro by NAD+ for NADase activity, demonstrating a ‘substrate inhibition mechanism’, as was also reported by another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Following these results, we propose a model for hSARM1 inhibition in homeostasis and activation under stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this model, we suggest that hSARM1 is kept inhibited by NAD+ through its allosteric site, located at the ARM domain ‘horns’ junction that induces the compact inhibited conformation. This state persists as long as NAD+ remains at normal cellular levels (these are controversial and range between 0.1 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cambronne et al., 2016</xref>] and 0.4–0.8 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Houtkooper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>]). However, upon a drop in the cellular NAD+ concentration below a critical threshold, such as in response to stress, NAD+ dissociates from the allosteric inhibitory site. This triggers the disassembly of the compact conformation and the dimerization of TIR domains, which enables TIR’s NADase activity and NAD+ hydrolysis. The consequence is a rapid decrease in NAD+ cellular levels, leading to energetic catastrophe and cell death.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model for hSARM1 inhibition and activation.</title><p>In homeostasis, the cellular NAD+ concentration is high enough and binds to an allosteric site that drives hSARM1 compact conformation. In this conformation, the catalytic TIR domains (red) are docked on ARM domains (yellow) apart from each other and unable to form close dimers required for NAD+ catalysis. When cellular NAD+ levels drop as a result of reduced NAD+ synthesis (e.g. inhibition of NMNAT1/2) or increased NAD+ consumption, the inhibiting NAD+ molecules fall off hSARM1, leading to the disintegration of the ARM-TIR outer ring assembly. Still held by the constitutively assembled SAM inner ring, the now-released TIR domains are at a high local concentration that facilitates their dimerization and ensued NADase activity. When released from allosteric inhibition, hSARM1 is only subjected to competitive inhibition such as by its products ADPR and NAM, which are not found in high enough concentrations to block its activity entirely. This leads to an almost complete consumption of the NAD+ cellular pool and to an energetic catastrophe from which there may be no return.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62021-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This model seems to be at odds with another suggested mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) in which, following axon injury, an increase in NMN concentration triggers SARM1 activation. Regardless of the question whether axon injury actually leads to lasting NMN levels elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>) or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>), we believe that the two models can be easily reconciled, at least in the limited scope of the in vitro enzymatic mechanism. It is likely that NMN, a moiety of NAD+, will form interactions with most of the ARM<sup>1</sup> residues as NAD+. By that, NMN will compete with NAD+ and prevent the formation of ARM<sup>1</sup>–ARM<sup>2</sup> NAD+ bridge, the latter stabilizing the inactive conformation of SARM1. Such NAD+ displacement would result with SARM1 NADase activation. Clearly, this will require high NMN concentrations to effectively compete-off the ARM<sup>1</sup>–ARM<sup>2</sup> bound NAD+. Indeed, we show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) that only 1 mM NMN (but not 0.2 mM) induces a moderate increase in SARM1 NADase activity at 50 µM NAD+.</p><p>This finding casts some doubt over the prospects for activation by NMN to be naturally occurring in vivo, as it consistently appears that NMN concentrations are not higher than 5 µM, and in any case 10–200 times lower than that of NAD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, while NMN could activate SARM1 in vitro in cultured cells engineered to over produce NMN, or by exogenous supplement of NMN or NMN analogs, it is less likely to occur in vivo, suggesting that the release of substrate inhibition due to the drop in NAD+ levels is the key event in SARM1 activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>SARM1</td><td>Imagene</td><td>uniprot Q6SZW1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293F</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat#R79007</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>CRL-11268</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (mammalian vector)</td><td>pEGFP-N1</td><td>Clontech</td><td/><td>modified</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Polyethyleneimine 40 kDa</td><td>Polysciences</td><td>PEI-MAX</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Resazurin sodium salt</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>R7017</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>NAD+</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>NAD100-RO</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>FMN</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>F8399</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ADH</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>A3263</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Diaphorase</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>D5540</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>BSA</td><td>ORNAT</td><td>B9001S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>eNAD</td><td>SIGMA</td><td>N2630</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MotionCorr2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2013</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Gctf</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang, 2016</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Cryosparc V2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Punjani et al., 2017</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SCIPION wrapper</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2020</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Warp</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tegunov and Cramer, 2019</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>CCP4</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Winn et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GESAMT</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krissinel, 2012</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MOLREP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Coot</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>REFMAC5</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murshudov et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>JLIGAND</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lebedev et al., 2012</xref></td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>cDNA generation and subcloning</title><p>Cloning of all the constructs was made by PCR amplification from the complete cDNA clone (Imagene) of hSARM1 (uniprot: Q6SZW1).

The movies were acquired for 7 s in counting mode at a flux of 7.06 electrons per Å2 s–1 (data collection 1: 3748 movies) or 6.83 electrons per Å2 s–1 (data collection 2: 4070 movies), giving a total exposure of ~50 electrons per Å2 and fractioned into 40 frames. A total of 7302 movies of the NAD+ supplemented grid sample were acquired for 4 s in counting mode at a flux of 7.415 electrons per Å2 s–1, giving a total exposure of ~40 electrons per Å2 and fractioned into 40 frames. For each data collection a defocus range from −0.8 μm to −2.8 μm was used. Using the SCIPION wrapper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez et al., 2020</xref>) the imported movies were drift-corrected using MotionCor2 and CTF parameters were estimated using Gctf for real-time evaluation. Further data processing was conducted using the cryoSPARC suite. Movies were motion-corrected and contrast transfer functions were fitted. Templates for auto-picking were generated by 2D classification of auto picked particles. For the GraFix-ed data, template-based auto-picking produced a total of 658,575 particles, from which 147,232 were selected based on iterative reference-free 2D classifications for reconstruction of the GraFix-ed structure. In the case of the NAD+ supplemented data, a total of 335,526 particles were initially picked, from which 159,340 were selected based on iterative reference-free 2D classifications for reconstruction. Initial maps of both GraFix-ed and NAD+ supplemented hSARM1 were calculated using ab initio reconstruction and high-resolution maps were obtained by imposing C8-symmetry in nonuniform 3D refinement. Working maps were locally filtered based on local resolution estimates.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>Talos Glacios in EMBL, Grenoble, France was used for data collection and the comparison of NAD+ supplemented and not-supplemented samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Frozen grids were loaded onto a 200kV Talos Glacios (ThermoFisher) electron microscope equipped with a Falcon3 direct electron-counting camera (ThermoFisher).

The model chosen for MR (molecular replacement) contained single polypeptide residues A406–A546 from the PDB 6qwv (SAM Model). Superposition of all available structures of the hSARM1 TIR domain (PDBs 6o0q, 6o0r, 6o0u, 6o0qv, and 6o1b) indicated different conformations of the protein main chain for the BB loop region (a.a 593–607). Two different MR models were prepared for the hSARM1 TIR domain. TIR Model 1 contained regions 562–592 and 608–700 of the high-resolution structure (PDB 6o1b). TIR Model 2 represented assembly of superimposed polyalanine models of all the available hSARM1 TIR domains. Models were positioned into the density map by MR with use of phase information as implemented in program MOLREP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010</xref>). The shell scripts of the MOLREP EM tutorial were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ccpem.ac.uk/docs.php">https://www.ccpem.ac.uk/docs.php</ext-link> and adapted to allow simultaneous positioning of eight molecular symmetry-related SARM1 copies (MOLREP keyword NCS 800).</p><p>The search protocol involved Spherically Averaged Phased Translation Function (SAPTF; MOLREP keyword PRF Y). The recent version of MOLREP (11.7.02; 29.05.2019) uses modification of the original SAPTF protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vagin and Isupov, 2001</xref>), adapted for work with EM density maps (Alexey Vagin, private communication). It now performs the Phased RF (rotation function) search step in a bounding box of the search model and not in the whole (pseudo) unit cell. Instead of Phased Translation Function step, MOLREP performs Phased RF search at several points in the vicinity of SAPTF peak and, in addition, applies Packing Function to potential solutions.</p><p>The SAM Model was positioned into the GraFix-ed density map with a score (Map CC times Packing Function) of 0.753. The positioned SAM model was used as a fixed model in MOLREP when searching for the TIR domain. The TIR Model 1 was positioned with a score of 0.582. The MR search with the TIR Model 2 gave essentially the same solution with a lower overall score of 0.559, but higher contrast. With both SAM<sup>1–2</sup> and TIR domains' positions fixed, the MR search for an ideal 10-residue α-helical model allowed location of 64 fragments (eight helices per SARM1 monomer) with scores in the range of 0.78–0.81. These helical fragments were used for building of the ARM domain in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The quality of the high resolution GraFix-ed density map was sufficient for assignment of side chains for all ARM domain residues. The TIR domain BB loop region (a.a 595–607) was built to fit a relatively poor density map in a conformation different to those observed in X-ray structures. The model was refined using REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murshudov et al., 2011</xref>). Side chains of some Lys residues had blobs of undescribed density attached to them. These were modeled as glutaraldehyde ligands. Geometrical restraints for the di-glutaraldehyde molecule and its links to side chains of Lys residues were prepared using JLIGAND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lebedev et al., 2012</xref>). The dictionary file was manually edited to allow links to more than a single lysine residue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>NAD-supplemented map</title><p>Originally, the refined full-length GraFix-ed model was positioned by MR into the NAD-supplemented density map, but differences in the relative positions of the hSARM1 domains were apparent. Therefore, MR search was conducted for separate hSARM1 domains. The SAM model was positioned with a score of 0.653 into this map. With the fixed SAM model the TIR Model 1 was found with a score of 0.594. With fixed SAM and TIR Models, the ARM domain from the GraFix model was found with a score of 0.623. The BB-loop of the TIR domain was built into well-defined density map in a conformation not observed in any of the X-ray structures and different to that in the GraFix-ed model. A low sigma cutoff map allowed modeling of the loop connecting the SAM and TIR domains. Inspection of the maps indicated NAD+ binding accompanied by structural rearrangement of the ARM1-ARM2 linker region (a.a. 312–324).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Accession numbers</title><p>Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 6ZFX, 7ANW, 6ZG0, 6ZG1, and in the EMDB with accession numbers 11187, 11834, 11190, 11191 for the GraFix-ed, NAD+ supplemented, not treated, and SAM<sup>1–2</sup> models and maps, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff of beamline CM01 of ESRF and members of the Opatowsky lab for technical assistance.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>SARM1 is an enzyme that depletes NAD+ to trigger axon loss in response to injury. A recent publication reported the structure of full-length SARM1 to reveal an octameric ring assembly. The current study also reports structures of full-length SARM1 (inactive mutant) by cryo-EM, and makes the additional finding that SARM1 is substrate-inhibited. Structures determined after crosslinking in the presence of glycerol or the presence of NAD+ appear to be an inhibited conformation. Biochemical studies show that glycerol and NAD+ (and ATP) are inhibitors, and NAD+ binds an allosteric site to prevent the catalytic domains adopting their active dimeric association. In contrast, a structure determined in the absence of NAD+ or crosslinking allows enough conformational freedom for catalytic domains to dimerize. Overall, this is an important advance in structural-mechanistic understanding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please discuss the recent Bratkowski et al. publication in Cell Reports from 2020 explicitly, which reports similar structure determination but arrives at a very different mechanistic conclusion.</p><p>2) A major point of the paper is on the NAD-mediated allosteric inhibition of SARM1. To strengthen this point, it may be helpful to expand the discussion and include more figure panels that illustrate how NAD binds SARM1, and how this binding stabilizes the autoinhibited conformation. Given the limitations of data, the best way to illustrate and discuss will be a judgement call for the authors. We note that the density for NAD as shown in Figure 5 is a bit weak, with a part of the NAD molecule sticking outside of the density. Is it possible to fit NAD in the opposite orientation? In addition, would it be helpful to show comparison the ARM/TIR interface with or without NAD in more detail, which may shed more light on how the NAD-induced conformation of ARM holds tighter to TIR.</p><p>3) As pointed out the manuscript, the results from mutations at the NAD binding site are somewhat unexpected. L152A, which has a strong effect, appears not directly contacting NAD. R322 and R157 also seem a little far from NAD. Plus, these residues are not conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> SARM1. In contrast, W103 is conserved and appears to be making a key interaction with NAD, but its mutation has no effect. Related to this point, the recent Cell Reports manuscript shows essentially the same autoinhibited assembly of SARM1, in the absence of Grafix crosslinking or NAD, which seems to argue that the SARM1 is able to adopt the autoinhibited conformation on its own. These discrepancies raise the possibility that in cells a different metabolite binds to this site in SARM1, with similar but distinct atomic interactions. Or is it possible that the NAD-mediate regulation is species specific?</p><p>4) The secondary TIR docking site is disengaged in the NAD-bound structure. Can the authors discuss whether this reflects the actual difference between the two states of the protein, or is it possible that the secondary docking site is imposed by the crosslinking reagent?</p><p>5) The resolution based on the FSC between the density map and model for the NAD-bound structure is 5.6 Å, much worse than the resolution of the map based on the gold-standard FSC (2.7). This large difference between the two FSC curves is concerning, suggesting that there are some issues in the model that cause it to not fit the density well. This issue needs to be addressed, and the PDB-vs-map FSC curves should be shown as supplemental figures. The manuscript does touch on this point, mentioning &quot;domain-based heterogeneity&quot;, but fell short of providing a clear explanation. One possibility might be that NAD only occupied some, but not all, of the subunits in the octamer, which resulted in different conformations of the peripheral TIR and ARM domains within the same octamer. Imposing C8 symmetry under this situation would deteriorate the density for all the subunits. Have the authors tried the symmetry expansion and then focused refinement approach as implemented in Relion (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2016.04.012)? One might then perform classification of the subunit, which may allow subunits with different conformations to be separated.</p><p>6) The HEK-based viability assay has been used in previous studies to assess SARM1 activity and the effect of various mutations and domain deletions. Hence, the authors adopted it for this work. Although the experimental setup is internally controlled (accounting for fluorescent background signals and emission from mock-transfected cells), there is no control over or validation of mutant protein expression levels (assessed using e.g. blot densitometry), which may skew the cell viability data if expression levels would diverge from wild-type levels, by impacting on NAD depletion rates. Overall, the effects of various SARM1 mutants would be more elegantly assessed using a robust neuronal assay, where SARM1 variants would be expressed in a more native-like environment and axonal death would be monitored. Although desirable, this is not necessary for the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62021.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please discuss the recent Bratkowski et al. publication in Cell Reports from 2020 explicitly, which reports similar structure determination but arrives at a very different mechanistic conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Bratkowski et al. is now discussed in the context of structural comparison at the end of the “2.8-6.5 Å resolution structure….” section, and for the activation model by increased NMN vs. decreased NAD+ at the “Conclusions…” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major point of the paper is on the NAD-mediated allosteric inhibition of SARM1.

However, it is not clear how and if these limited changes induce the compact inhibited two-ring conformation. It is important to keep in mind that the GraFixed structure (as well as the one published in Cell Reports by Bratkowski et al.) do not represent active SARM1, where the outer ring is disassembled. Rather, these structures represent a small sub-population of particles that retain the two-ring inhibited conformation even in the absence of NAD+. Possibly, the structure of the ARM domain in the disassembled conformation (which is currently not available) is such that prevents the assembly of the outer ring, and that NAD+ binding to it induces a dramatic structural change that allows the outer ring assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We note that the density for NAD as shown in Figure 5 is a bit weak, with a part of the NAD molecule sticking outside of the density.</p></disp-quote><p>2.2) Most of the NAD+ density is as strong as the surrounding polypeptide elements. There is a very weak density for the adenosine, but the rest of the molecule is very clear, including the positions of the phosphate oxygens, and the amide protrusion on the nicotine ring.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible to fit NAD in the opposite orientation?</p></disp-quote><p>2.3) When positioned opposite to the current orientation, the adenosine sticks out of the (nicotinamide) density. In numerical terms, the map/model CC per residue (by phenix calculation) for the NAD+ drops from 0.88 to 0.85. More importantly – the adenosine clashes with surrounding sidechains, which have a very clear density themselves. Therefore, the opposite orientation of the NAD+ is unlikely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, would it be helpful to show comparison the ARM/TIR interface with or without NAD in more detail, which may shed more light on how the NAD-induced conformation of ARM holds tighter to TIR.</p></disp-quote><p>2.4) As explained above (2.1), how NAD+ binding stabilizes the compact two-ring conformation is still not clear, probably because of the absence of ARM domain structure in the disassembled conformation. It is clear that the NAD+ binding site is inhibitory – because mutations at this site activate SARM1 in cultured cells.</p><p>There are differences between the GraFix-ed and NAD+ supplemented structures at the TIR domain’s BB loop interaction with the secondary ARM site. Alas, the BB loop (which is one of the most important elements in SARM1) is one of the least clear regions in both density maps, and therefore an in-depth analysis of the changes in the BB loop may be speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As pointed out the manuscript, the results from mutations at the NAD binding site are somewhat unexpected. L152A, which has a strong effect, appears not directly contacting NAD.</p></disp-quote><p>3.1) The backbone amine of L152 forms a hydrogen bond with one of the NAD+ ribose oxygens (see the new 2D interaction map Figure 5—figure supplement 2). More importantly, the L152 sidechain is positioned in a way that may affect the conformation of the 𝛂5-6 turn, and therefore the alanine mutation should inflict a conformational effect in this region. The fact that the L152A strongly activates SARM1 best reflects, in our opinion, the critical role of the ARM<sup>1</sup>-ARM<sup>2</sup> “crescent horns” region in regulating SARM1 inhibition and activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R322 and R157 also seem a little far from NAD.</p></disp-quote><p>3.2) R157 forms a salt bridge with a NAD+ phosphate (see the new 2D interaction map Figure 5—figure supplement 2). R322 is involved in hydrophobic interactions with NAD+ atoms, and more importantly the R322 sidechain stabilizes the ARM<sup>1</sup>-ARM<sup>2</sup> loop, and therefore the glutamate mutation should destabilize this region, explaining the activating effect of this mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Plus, these residues are not conserved in C. elegans SARM1.</p></disp-quote><p>3.3) It is possible that not all the mechanisms that control SARM1 activation and inhibition are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and it acquired additional regulations during evolution. It should be pointed that Wallerian degeneration is not conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as axonal degeneration is induced only by two nerve cuts, where there is a mild protective effect (~20%) of TIR-1/SARM1 loss (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.165852">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.165852</ext-link>). This is in a sharp contrast to the observations in flies and mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast, W103 is conserved and appears to be making a key interaction with NAD, but its mutation has no effect.</p></disp-quote><p>3.4) The ineffectiveness of the W103A mutation troubled us too, and we were able to generate and test another mutation: W103D that indeed, as expected, induced strong activation of SARM1. We think that while the substitution to alanine deprived a hydrophobic contact point, which could be compensated by the other interactions, the interference made by the aspartate substitution could not be tolerated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this point, the recent Cell Reports manuscript shows essentially the same autoinhibited assembly of SARM1, in the absence of Grafix crosslinking or NAD, which seems to argue that the SARM1 is able to adopt the autoinhibited conformation on its own.</p></disp-quote><p>3.5) Only small percentage of purified SARM1 particles adopt the autoinhibited conformation on their own. &gt;80% of SARM1 particles, in the absence of NAD+ in high concentration, are found in the active conformation, where only the inner ring is visible. It can be seen in our Figure 4 B,C, and also in Bratkowski et al. Figure S1B. To overcome this problem, and to determine a cryo-EM structure, Bratowski et al. selected only the minor fraction of the two-ring particles (5.6% of the initial picked particles – see Figure S1F in Cell Reports).</p><p>The key difference between the two studies, is that while we have acknowledged that purified SARM1 is mostly active, and therefore focused our studies on finding the inhibitory factor that is lost in purification (NAD+), Bratowski et al. considered the purified SARM1 as inhibited and showed that NMN is an activating factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These discrepancies raise the possibility that in cells a different metabolite binds to this site in SARM1, with similar but distinct atomic interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>3.6) We, of course, cannot rule out the binding of other cellular elements – small molecules or proteins to the ARM allosteric inhibitory site. For example, being a structural component of NAD+, it is likely that NMN also binds to the ARM<sup>1</sup> side of this site (see the new addition to the conclusion part in the paper). However, NAD+ is one of the most abundant metabolites in the cell, while NMN concentrations are much lower. So, when we consider together the NAD+ high cellular concentrations, the dramatic effect it has on SARM1 structure, and the clear substrate inhibition curve and values that correspond to the physiological NAD+ concentrations, we are inclined to think that NAD+ is indeed the key metabolite that regulates SARM1 inhibition and activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Or is it possible that the NAD-mediate regulation is species specific?</p></disp-quote><p>3.7) While SARM1 seems to have an NADase activity in all animals, it is quite clear that there are some differences between species in SARM1 regulation. One such difference between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other animals is detailed above in answer 3.3. Another difference is the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial localization peptide in mammals – but not in non-mammalian creatures (based on our analysis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The secondary TIR docking site is disengaged in the NAD-bound structure. Can the authors discuss whether this reflects the actual difference between the two states of the protein, or is it possible that the secondary docking site is imposed by the crosslinking reagent?</p></disp-quote><p>As we have discussed above in 2.4, there are differences at the TIR domain’s BB loop interaction with the secondary ARM site. Alas, the BB loop (which is one of the most important elements in SARM1) is one of the least clear regions in the structure, and therefore an in-depth analysis of the changes in the BB loop may be speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The resolution based on the FSC between the density map and model for the NAD-bound structure is 5.6 Å, much worse than the resolution of the map based on the gold-standard FSC (2.7). This large difference between the two FSC curves is concerning, suggesting that there are some issues in the model that cause it to not fit the density well. This issue needs to be addressed, and the PDB-vs-map FSC curves should be shown as supplemental figures. The manuscript does touch on this point, mentioning &quot;domain-based heterogeneity&quot;, but fell short of providing a clear explanation. One possibility might be that NAD only occupied some, but not all, of the subunits in the octamer, which resulted in different conformations of the peripheral TIR and ARM domains within the same octamer. Imposing C8 symmetry under this situation would deteriorate the density for all the subunits. Have the authors tried the symmetry expansion and then focused refinement approach as implemented in Relion (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2016.04.012)? One might then perform classification of the subunit, which may allow subunits with different conformations to be separated.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for that – some of the numbers in the submitted table were old, and the model has much better correlation figures. As we have explained above (2.2) most of the NAD+ density is actually as strong as the surrounding polypeptide elements, and we see no indication that the NAD+ binding is not homogenous.</p><p>When we do not impose C8 symmetry during the NAD-supplemented structure processing, we do not see differences in NAD+ occupancy between protomers. Also, masking of protomers and symmetry expansion followed by 3D classification yields maps with low resolution that falls short of revealing different species in terms of NAD+.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The HEK-based viability assay has been used in previous studies to assess SARM1 activity and the effect of various mutations and domain deletions. Hence, the authors adopted it for this work.</p></disp-quote><p>6.1) We are the first to introduce a suspension culture of HEK293F for SARM1 viability assay. We found the suspension culture assay to be simple and most reproducible, and therefore the best way to monitor SARM1 NADase activity in cultured cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the experimental setup is internally controlled (accounting for fluorescent background signals and emission from mock-transfected cells), there is no control over or validation of mutant protein expression levels (assessed using e.g. blot densitometry), which may skew the cell viability data if expression levels would diverge from wild-type levels, by impacting on NAD depletion rates.</p></disp-quote><p>6.2) The basic problem is that constitutively active SARM1 truncations and mutants rapidly kill the cells, and we observe cell death as soon as 8 hours post transfection in some of the mutants. So, clearly WB will not be feasible as the protein levels are dropping due to cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the effects of various SARM1 mutants would be more elegantly assessed using a robust neuronal assay, where SARM1 variants would be expressed in a more native-like environment and axonal death would be monitored. Although desirable, this is not necessary for the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the Covid-19 lockdown we are unable to run experiments with neurons.
