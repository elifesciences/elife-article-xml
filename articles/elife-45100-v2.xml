central vision. Polymorphisms in genes involved in lipid metabolism, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (<italic>ABCA1</italic>), have been associated with AMD risk. However, the significance of retinal lipid handling for AMD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we study the contribution of lipid efflux in the RPE by generating a mouse model lacking ABCA1 and its partner ABCG1 specifically in this layer. Mutant mice show lipid accumulation in the RPE, reduced RPE and retinal function, retinal inflammation and RPE/photoreceptor degeneration. Data from human cell lines indicate that the <italic>ABCA1</italic> AMD risk-conferring allele decreases <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression, identifying the potential molecular cause that underlies the genetic risk for AMD. Our results highlight the essential homeostatic role for lipid efflux in the RPE and suggest a pathogenic contribution of reduced ABCA1 function to AMD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ABCA1</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>retinal pigment epithelium</kwd><kwd>lipid efflux</kwd><kwd>age-related macular degeneration</kwd><kwd>ABCG1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008494</institution-id><institution>Vontobel-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storti</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004337</institution-id><institution>Roche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPF 378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storti</surname><given-names>Federica</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_173008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todorova</surname><given-names>Vyara</given-names></name><name><surname>Samardzija</surname><given-names>Marijana</given-names></name><name><surname>Barben</surname><given-names>Maya</given-names></name><name><surname>Grimm</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lipid efflux by the retinal pigment epithelium is crucial for proper retinal integrity and function, and its impairment may contribute to diseases like age-related macular degeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly population of Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joachim et al., 2015</xref>) and its socio-economic impact is predicted to dramatically increase in the next decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). AMD is a progressive disease of the macula, the central cone-rich region of the retina, and can develop into the ‘dry’ or ‘wet’ form in the advanced stage. Dry AMD is characterized by atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor degeneration, while wet AMD exhibits pathological neo-vascularization of the retina originating from the choroid. Both conditions eventually result in loss of RPE and photoreceptors with deleterious consequences on high acuity and color vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The etiology of AMD is complex and multifactorial but several lines of evidence associate the disease with local disturbances of lipid metabolism in the ageing human eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pauleikhoff et al., 1990</xref>). Lipids physiologically accumulate in extracellular deposits known as drusen and sub-retinal drusenoid deposits (SDDs) on the basal and apical side of the RPE, respectively. Drusen contain polar lipids, such as un-esterified (free) cholesterol (UC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), as well as neutral lipids, such as cholesteryl esters (CEs), and several lipid-binding proteins (apolipoproteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Curcio et al., 2011</xref>). The more recently identified SDDs, instead, seem to contain UC only, together with apolipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudolf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spaide et al., 2018</xref>). Drusen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarks, 1980</xref>) and SDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zweifel et al., 2010</xref>) are considered hallmarks of AMD but their actual origin and contribution to the pathology remain unknown. Recently, primary RPE cells isolated from AMD patients, but not from control subjects, were shown to accumulate intracellular lipids <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golestaneh et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting altered lipid metabolism in diseased cells.</p><p>Genome-wide association studies have linked AMD to several genes involved in generation and remodeling of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), namely ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (<italic>ABCA1</italic>), apolipoprotein E (<italic>APOE</italic>), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (<italic>CETP</italic>) and hepatic lipase C (<italic>LIPC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fritsche et al., 2016</xref>). A recent review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Leeuwen et al., 2018</xref>) summarizes contradictory results from different studies concerning the association between systemic lipid levels and the risk of developing AMD and links long-term elevated plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol to increased AMD risk. However, it remains unknown whether genes involved in lipid metabolism exert a local and/or a systemic pathogenic effect on the retina.</p><p>A gene of interest in this context is <italic>ABCA1</italic>, encoding a transmembrane lipid transporter which generates HDLs together with its partner ABCG1. Either transporter uses ATP to flip lipids, mainly UC and phospholipids (PLs), but also sphingomyelins (SMs) and oxysterols, from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to extracellular lipophilic acceptors such as apolipoproteins or nascent HDLs. ABCA1 initiates the formation of HDL by direct interaction with naked apolipoproteins, while ABCG1 requires a lipidated particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavelier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quazi and Molday, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Since UC is one of the best established substrates of the two transporters, the ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway is also known as ‘active cholesterol efflux’. The fundamental role of this pathway for cellular lipid homeostasis is highlighted by macrophage foam cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tabas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Favari et al., 2015</xref>) and by the progressive and age-dependent lung phenotype, including lipid accumulation in alveolar macrophages and pneumocytes, lung dysfunction and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chai et al., 2017</xref>), in mice lacking ABCA1, ABCG1 or both. Inhibition of cholesterol efflux leads to cell dysfunction also in pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kruit et al., 2012</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karasinska et al., 2013</xref>) and liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arguello et al., 2015</xref>). Liver X receptors (LXR) α and β are the upstream regulators of the pathway: these two transcription factors are activated upon binding of oxysterols that accumulate in conditions of increased UC and upregulate expression of both <italic>ABCA1</italic> and <italic>ABCG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schultz et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitous expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 has been reported in the mouse, monkey and human retina, including the RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tserentsoodol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ananth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storti et al., 2017</xref>). The function of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in the RPE was previously investigated <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishida et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lyssenko et al., 2018</xref>) and shown to mediate transport of UC to ApoA-I, ApoE, HDLs and human serum on both sides of the RPE. This was true for plasma lipoprotein- as well as outer segment (OS)-derived cholesterol. However, the relevance of active cholesterol efflux for the RPE <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unknown. This, together with the fact that the RPE needs an efficient metabolism to handle large amounts of lipids coming from daily OS phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strauss, 2005</xref>), prompted us to generate an RPE-specific <italic>Abca1;Abcg1</italic> double knockout (KO) mouse. We characterize the retinal phenotype of this mouse model and provide evidence suggesting a correlation between AMD-associated <italic>ABCA1</italic> genotypes and expression levels of this gene in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of RPE-specific <italic>Abca1;Abcg1</italic> double KO mice (RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic>)</title><p>Expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 throughout the retinal layers, including the RPE, was confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) in wild type mouse retinal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ananth et al., 2014</xref>).

To confirm presence of CRE protein in the RPE, we performed IF staining on retinal sections. Although some un-specific staining was observed in the inner retina, CRE-positive nuclei were detected only in the RPE layer of RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> but not of control (Ctr, <italic>Cre</italic>-negative) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we checked for successful CRE-mediated excision of floxed fragments by amplifying <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> specific sequences from genomic DNA extracted from retina and eyecups (including RPE) of RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> and Ctr mice.

Staining with OilRedO (ORO) in retinal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and LipidTOX in RPE flat mounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) revealed strong lipid accumulation in CRE-positive RPE cells of RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice. CRE-negative RPE cells and other retinal layers were ORO-negative and served as internal controls demonstrating the specificity of lipid accumulation in RPE cells lacking <italic>Abca1</italic> and/or <italic>Abcg1</italic>. Both ORO and LipidTOX stain neutral lipids, which constitute the hydrophobic core of LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olofsson et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, actin staining of RPE flat mounts showed morphological irregularities of CRE-positive cells in RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice when compared to the regular, mainly hexagonal shape of Ctr cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These morphological irregularities progressively worsened and were more pronounced at 4–6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In particular, double staining for the tight junction protein zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) and the Wnt signaling mediator β-catenin (β-cat) in mutant cells revealed re-localization of β-cat from the plasma membrane to the cytosol, a feature of disorganized RPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2018</xref>).

At 6 months, we observed areas of dysmorphic RPE with accumulation of intracellular material and areas of RPE atrophy with infiltration of inflammatory cells (see below) in mutant but not control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Photoreceptor loss correlated with RPE atrophy (see below). Variability of the phenotype within the same retina was probably due to patchy <italic>Cre</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Reduced expression levels of <italic>Cre</italic> and the RPE marker monocarboxylic acid transporter 3 (<italic>Mct3</italic>) further indicated atrophic RPE at 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Loss of RPE cells in aged RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice was most likely a consequence of the lack of ABCA1 and/or ABCG1 activity in RPE rather than of CRE expression per se, since <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA levels declined in eyecups of old RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) but not old <italic>BEST1Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Although inactivation of the two genes was patchy due to variable <italic>Cre</italic> expression, genetic ablation of <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> resulted in strong lipid accumulation in RPE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This is in agreement with the known function of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in mediating lipid efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavelier et al., 2006</xref>). Lipid accumulation was accompanied by morphological alterations and, at older ages, loss of RPE cells. Increased size and irregular shape of RPE cells in mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggested that the healthy cells expanded in order to fill gaps in the epithelium that were generated by the drop out of CRE-positive cells and keep an intact barrier between neural retina and choroid, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagai and Kalnins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, discontinuities in the RPE were observed in 6-months-old RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice, together with degeneration of photoreceptors in the affected areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). We hypothesize that these were areas where numerous RPE cells were affected by CRE-mediated <italic>Abca1;Abcg1</italic> deletion, resulting in cell death and, therefore, in gaps too large to be filled by expanding neighboring cells. <italic>Abca1</italic> was the main responsible gene for maintaining lipid homeostasis and survival of RPE cells at 2 months of age, since lack of <italic>Abca1</italic>, but not <italic>Abcg1</italic>, was sufficient to cause strong lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This is in marked contrast to macrophages where both <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> needed to be inactivated to observe a phenotype in non-stressed retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2018a</xref>). <italic>Abcg1</italic> may thus be capable to compensate for the loss of <italic>Abca1</italic> in macrophages but may only have a limited ability to do so in the RPE. The reason for this is still unclear but a potential difference in transport substrate specificity between the two cell types can be postulated. Thus, additional experiments are required to conclusively dissect the individual contribution of the two genes to lipid accumulation and impairment of RPE function. Importantly, photoreceptor- and macrophage-specific <italic>Abca1</italic> and/or <italic>Abcg1</italic> KO mice showed a weaker retinal phenotype compared to RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sene et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ban et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ban et al., 2018b</xref>), suggesting that the lipid efflux pathway regulated by <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> is of particular importance for the RPE. Furthermore, RPE cells may not be able to easily compensate for the absence of <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> by activating alternative mechanisms. RNAseq data for example revealed only very minor alterations in the RPE- and retina-specific transcriptomes of 2-months-old RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice (data not shown). This suggests that absence of ABCA1 and ABCG1 in the RPE did not cause strong secondary gene expression changes that could balance the impaired lipid efflux pathway in RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice. Taken together, our data demonstrate that proper lipid handling by the RPE through active cholesterol efflux is essential for maintenance of an intact and functional retina <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, local impairment of the ABCA1-mediated lipid transport activity in the RPE may provide the molecular basis for the genetic link of <italic>ABCA1</italic> to AMD and partially explain the contradictory association between systemic lipid levels and the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Leeuwen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, prominent intracellular accumulation of LDs was observed in RPE lacking ABCA1/ABCG1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Biochemical analysis of these LDs showed specific accumulation of CEs and, to a lesser extent, REs, while UC as well as PLs, SLs and GLs remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It is conceivable that the RPE continued to phagocytize lipid-rich OS also in the absence of functional ABCA1/ABCG1 to support photoreceptors. This hypothesis is supported by increased presence of fatty acids typical of OS membranes, such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6), in the RPE of mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The specific accumulation of esterified cholesterol, which is very important for retinal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fliesler and Bretillon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pikuleva and Curcio, 2014</xref>), fits well with the lipid composition of human drusen and SDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haimovici et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spaide et al., 2018</xref>) and with the high cholesterol content in rod OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fliesler and Schroepfer, 1982</xref>). The unchanged intracellular levels of UC in eyecups of 2-months-old mutant animals suggest that RPE cells esterified UC and fatty acids from OS disks to generate neutral CEs and REs that can be stored into LDs in an attempt to maintain intracellular UC levels below a toxic threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tabas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lakkaraju et al., 2007</xref>). Eventually, however, lipid concentration may become too high in the absence of a functional efflux pathway and lead to cell death. In contrast to the RPE, deletion of <italic>Abca1</italic> alone or in combination with <italic>Abcg1</italic> in hepatocytes, the main contributors to systemic lipid levels, not only affected plasma concentrations of UC and CEs, but also those of PLs, TGs and SLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Timmins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iqbal et al., 2018</xref>). This difference compared to the RPE suggests once more a cell-type dependent substrate specificity for the lipid efflux pathway or a remodeling of HDLs in the bloodstream, a process that does not occur within cells. Indeed, intracellular lipidomic changes in macrophages and endothelial cells that lacked <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> were more similar to the changes identified in RPE cells of RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice, including an accumulation of cholesterol, both in its un-esterified and esterified forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Westerterp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Westerterp et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to CEs, the abundance of REs was increased in our model, suggesting that lack of <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> not only reduced lipid efflux but also affected intracellular handling of REs as intermediates of the visual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kiser and Palczewski, 2016</xref>). An increase in REs and fatty acids may change the kinetics of the enzymes involved in the initial phases of the visual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saari, 2012</xref>). Moreover, altered RPE apical morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) could affect the physical interaction between RPE cells and photoreceptor OS, resulting in impaired internalization of incoming all-<italic>trans</italic> retinol intermediates. Once this step is achieved, however, the visual cycle seemed less affected as shown by similar amounts of regenerated RHO at later intervals after bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, AMD patients show delayed rod-mediated dark adaptation, suggesting visual cycle disturbance, already at early stages of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Owsley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owsley et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A ‘cholesterol-recycling’ mechanism involving transport of OS-derived cholesterol from the RPE back to the photoreceptors was proposed for the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tserentsoodol et al., 2006</xref>). It is rather surprising that retinal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), localization of rod and cone markers (not shown), and lipid composition of the neural retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) were not or not strongly affected in young RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice. Thus, photoreceptors seem capable to cope with an impaired lipid supply from RPE. Rods and cones could get enough cholesterol from the healthy CRE-negative RPE cells or they could re-direct towards a different lipid source like the intra-retinal circulation. Since retinal cells are able to synthesize cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fliesler and Bretillon, 2010</xref>), functional cholesterol efflux from the RPE may not be absolutely required for photoreceptor survival. We therefore propose that photoreceptor loss in RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice is a secondary effect to dysfunctional RPE.</p><p>In summary, our model recapitulates some important features of dry AMD. i) Impaired lipid efflux in the RPE primarily affects RPE function and survival resulting in secondary photoreceptor degeneration and decreased retinal function in our mice. In both its dry and wet forms, AMD affects RPE cells while many photoreceptors in the macula may be lost secondarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rattner and Nathans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). ii) The phenotype of RPE<sup>Δ</sup><italic><sup>Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice is age-related and slowly progressing, similar to AMD. iii) The photoreceptor/RPE layer of mutant mice at 4–6 months of age is infiltrated with inflammatory cells, an important hallmark of AMD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kauppinen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the characterization of the mouse model, we present novel preliminary data on the effect of AMD risk-associated SNPs in <italic>ABCA1</italic> on its expression level. No variants in <italic>ABCG1</italic> have so far been associated with the disease, suggesting a predominant role of <italic>ABCA1</italic> in the RPE/retina, an interpretation that fits to the early phenotype of single KO mice in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Our data from human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) suggest that the AMD increased risk allele correlates with lower <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression, at least upon LXR stimulation. The limited effect of the SNPs on <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression may not be surprising given their intronic location and the relatively small effect size of the SNPs on the disease (odds ratio 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fritsche et al., 2016</xref>)). Variants in non-coding regions of the genome, including in the <italic>ABCA1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhyne et al., 2009</xref>), may directly change gene expression by affecting splicing, chromatin accessibility or binding of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper, 2010</xref>). On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility of an indirect effect due to regions inherited <italic>in cis</italic> with the SNPs or a difference between cell lines in their responsiveness to LXR stimulation. Clearly however, the potential effect of the SNPs on <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression should be confirmed in a larger study, ideally using RPE cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandl, 2019</xref>). Independently of the genotype, it has been reported that expression and function of <italic>ABCA1</italic> is reduced in aged mouse and human monocytes, including in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sene et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, own preliminary data suggested a tendency of reduced expression of <italic>ABCA1</italic> in eyecups of old human donors (data not shown). It was also shown that cholesterol efflux was less efficient in old compared to young mouse RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswas et al., 2017</xref>), further suggesting an age-dependent physiological decline in <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression and function. In the presence of the risk-conferring <italic>ABCA1</italic> allele, expression of the gene may decrease below a critical threshold needed to prevent disease development. If so, this age-dependent decline could be targeted by the pharmacological activation of <italic>ABCA1</italic> gene expression, for example through treatment with an LXR agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koldamova et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Besides the intronic variants being associated with AMD, biallelic mutations in the coding region of <italic>ABCA1</italic> are known to cause the very rare Tangier disease, a systemic condition characterized by virtual absence of plasma HDLs, cholesterol accumulation in several tissues and, in some instances, peripheral neuropathy and increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schaefer et al., 2016</xref>). However and in contrast to our mouse data, Tangier patients are not known to have any ophthalmological phenotype, including AMD, except mild corneal opacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winder et al., 1996</xref>). RPE of Tangier patients might be healthier compared to AMD-affected RPE, making the impact of dysfunctional ABCA1 weaker in Tangier disease. This might be due to additional impaired mechanisms present in aged/AMD RPE cells, such as oxidative stress, accumulation of bis-retinoids, genetic factors and others.</p><p>In conclusion, this study supports an essential role of the ABCA1/ABCG1 lipid efflux pathway for mouse RPE survival <italic>in vivo</italic> and suggests that an impaired lipid metabolism via ABCA1 may contribute to the pathology of AMD, most likely in combination with additional mechanisms. If the link between <italic>ABCA1</italic> and AMD is confirmed, activation of ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux will be an attractive target for AMD therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Abca1</italic></td><td/><td>NCBI gene <break/>ID: 11303</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Abcg1</italic></td><td/><td>NCBI gene <break/>ID: 11307</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57BL/6J (wt)</td><td>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td>RRID: <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>; <break/>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory: 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>BEST1Cre</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iacovelli et al., 2011</xref></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:017557">IMSR_JAX:017557</ext-link></td><td>Name at the Jackson <break/>Laboratory: C57BL/6-Tg <break/>(BEST1-cre)1Jdun/J</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Abca1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;</italic> <break/><italic>Abcg1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson <break/>Laboratory</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:021067">IMSR_JAX:021067</ext-link></td><td>Name at the Jackson <break/>Laboratory: B6.Cg-Abca1 <break/>tm1Jp Abcg1tm1Tall/J</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ABCA1 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Novus Biologicals</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10000630">AB_10000630</ext-link>; <break/>Novus Biologicals: <break/>NB400-105</td><td>(1:250 for IF, 1:200 for WB)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ABCG1 <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_867471">AB_867471</ext-link>; <break/>Abcam: ab52617</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-EZR <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_783303">AB_783303</ext-link>; <break/>Santa Cruz: sc-58758</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-CRE <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Merck</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10806983">AB_10806983</ext-link>; <break/>Merck: 69050–3</td><td>(1:300)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-IBA1 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Wako Fujifilm</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_839504">AB_839504</ext-link>; <break/>Wako Fujifilm: 019–19741</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ZO1 <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2533456">AB_2533456</ext-link>; <break/>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific: 40–2200</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-βcatenin <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_397554">AB_397554</ext-link>; <break/>BD Biosciences: 610153</td><td>(1:300)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-POU4F1 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Merck</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_94166">AB_94166</ext-link>; <break/>Merck: MAB1585</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant <break/>DNA reagent</td><td>pTR-BEST1-Cre-P2A-GFP <break/>(AAV vector plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Constructed from AAV <break/>plasmid materials at the <break/>University of Florida, <break/>laboratory of S.

Tubes were inverted 20 times, plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2’500 g for 10 min at RT and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). Neural retinas were isolated through a slit in the cornea and snap-frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>; corresponding eyecups (containing RPE) were isolated and dissected from contaminating cornea, optic nerve or adipose tissue left overs. For analysis of UC, CEs and REs, tissues from both eyes of the same animal were pooled; whereas for analysis of PLs, SLs and GLs, tissues from single eyes were analyzed. For analysis of UC, CEs and REs, eyecup samples were enriched for RPE cells by incubating the tissues in 100 μl of PBS for 20 min at RT followed by flicking of the tubes 50 times to release pigmented cells into the PBS, similar to a procedure previously used for protein isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wei et al., 2016</xref>).

Lipids were separated using a C30 Accucore LC column (150 mm * 2.1 mm * 2.6 µm) and a transcend TLX eluting pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific). UC, CEs and REs were separated with the following mobile phases: A) acetonitrile:water (2:8 v/v) with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, B) isopropanol:acetonitrile (9:1 v/v) with 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid and C) methanol at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.

For UC, CEs and REs, samples were analyzed in positive mode using a heated electrospray ionization (HESI) interface. The following parameters were used: spray voltage 3.5 kV, vaporizer temperature of 300°C, sheath gas pressure 20 AU, aux gas 8 AU and capillary temperature of 320°C. The detector was set to an MS2 method using a data-dependent acquisition with top10 approach with stepped collision energy between 25 and 30. A 140’000 resolution was used for the full spectrum and a 17’500 for MS2. A dynamic exclusion filter was applied which excluded fragmentation of the same ions for 20 s. For PLs, SLs and GLs, a data-dependent acquisition with positive and negative polarity switching was used. A full scan was used from 220 to 3’000 m/z at a resolution of 70’000 and AGC Target 3e6 while data-dependent scans (top10) were acquired using normalized collision energies (NCE) of 25, 30 and a resolution of 17’500 and AGC target of 1e5.</p><p>Identification criteria for UC, CEs and REs were 1) resolution with an accuracy of 5 ppm from the predicted mass at a resolving power of 140’000 at 200 m/z, 2) matching retention time on synthetic available standards and 3) the specific fragmentation patterns ([M-H2O]+ and 369.3 for cholesterol esters and 269.2 for retinyl esters). Identification criteria for PLs, SLs and GLs were 1) resolution with an accuracy of 5 ppm from the predicted mass at a resolving power of 70’000 at 200 m/z, 2) isotopic pattern fitting to expected isotopic distribution, 3) comparison of the expected retention time to an in-house database and 4) fragmentation pattern matching to an in-house experimentally validated lipid fragmentation database. Quantification was done using single point calibration or by comparing the area under the peak of each species to the area under the peak of the internal standard. Quality controls using a mixture of all samples were used in four concentration (1x, 0.5x, 0.25x and 0.125x). Triplicates on the quality controls were measured, and the CV% for each of the lipids reported was below 20%. Mass spectrometric data analysis was performed in Treacefinder software 4.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for peak picking, annotation and matching to the in-house fragmentation database.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fundus imaging/OCT and ERG</title><p>Pupils were dilated using Cyclogyl 1% (Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Fribourg, Switzerland) and Neosynephrine 5% (Ursapharm Schweiz GmbH, Roggwil, Switzerland) 20 min prior to anesthesia.

Three experts reviewed your manuscript, and their assessments, together with my own, form the basis of this letter.

Our strong recommendation is to remove these data from the manuscript. A second recommendation is to immunostain WT vs KO mouse RPE for the transporters to assess the KO at the protein level. In the manuscript, the analysis of Cre expression is nice but it is one step removed from the transporter. Also, the PCR analysis of the recombined fragment does not assess the fraction of cells in which recombination did not occur. A third recommendation – and this one is less critical than the first two – is to conduct RNAseq on the WT vs KO RPE to see if there are secondary gene expression changes in response to transporter KO. Such changes, if they exist, could by informative.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>This study demonstrates the importance of the ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux pathway in maintaining RPE and photoreceptor cell health. Specifically, they show unequivocally that lack of ABCA1 in RPE cells resulted in lipid droplet accumulation within the RPE which, over time, led to loss of the RPE cells. The authors generated and characterized an RPE-specific Abca1;Abcg1 double knockout mice on a <italic>BEST1Cre</italic> background, they used 2 month old mice to show evidence of Cre mRNA expression in the eyecup and very little in the retina, IF positive staining for Cre only in the RPE nuclei, and showed CRE-mediated excision fragments of Abca1 and Abcg1 in the eyecups with some variability, likely due to the variable Cre expression in the RPE of these mice. Also, at 2 months of age, on a normal diet, morphologically there were already changes: a dotted pattern on fundus images, changes seen in the apical border of the RPE and lipid droplets in the RPE, lipidTOX and OilRedO staining coinciding with Cre expression in the RPE. A decrease in the rates of rhodopsin regeneration after bleaching demonstrated that this was slower initially in the double knockout mice suggesting impairment of visual cycle even in these 2 month old mice.</p><p>Age-dependent changes were also seen by studying the mice at 2, 4 and 6 months. They detected deteriorating phenotypic changes by careful measurements of RPE shape, size, and Mct3 expression, light microscopy and EM showed increasing damage to the RPE and neural retina and increasing visual deficits by ERG measurements of 2, 4, and 6 month old mice.</p><p>They used the correct controls to ensure changes seen in the mice were not developmental, they injected an AAV virus expressing CRE and GFP into adult Abca1flox/flox:Abcg1flox/flox mice and they saw, in regions that were GFP-positive, the same changes in accumulation of lipids and RPE damage they saw with the double knockout mice. To ensure the phenotype of the double KO was not due to CRE toxicity the <italic>BEST1CRE</italic> mouse was used as a control. They also generated RPE-specific Abca1 KO and RPE-specific Abcg1 KO mice and studying these at 2 months of age determined that the Abca1 appeared to be the dominant gene responsible for lipid efflux in the RPE cells, resulting in lipid accumulation in the cells, this may imply a somewhat different regulation of lipid homeostasis in RPE cells compared to macrophages that require both Abca1 and Abcg1.</p><p>Overall a careful study which does not overstate the findings but nicely points to the ABCA1-mediated efflux of lipids as being essential for maintaining RPE health.</p><p>It is unclear which of the analyses shown in Figure 5 were from &quot;RPE-enriched samples&quot;, i.e. from an eyecup without the neural retina, to which PBS was added and then the tubes were flicked to release RPE cells and which analysis used the entire eyecup without the neural retina. Were all the analyses done on single eyes or were the tissue lysates pooled?</p><p>In Figure 9A using 4 month old mice and flat mounts, sub-RPE IBA-1 positive cells infiltrating the RPE from the choroidal side are shown in flatmounts, can you give an indication of how many cells were seen and if you saw this in all the KO mice at this age. Then IBA-1 cells in 6 month mice showed, in retinal sections, sub-retinal immune cells were seen- were these seen in parts of the retina that still had an intact RPE layer or, as was seen in EM of sections of mice at this age had the RPE completely atrophied and disappeared. In the text, it appears there is a comparison made between the localization of immune cells at 4 months and 6 months, but because the figures show flat mounts for one time point and cross sections for the other the comparison is a little difficult to interpret.</p><p>In Supplementary figure S5 using eyecup tissue from 25 human donor eyes, the authors attempted to show that there was a decrease in ABCA1 mRNA expression levels with age. Only 4 of these samples were from donors younger than 53 and without these 4 samples there did not appear to be any decline in ABCA1 expression from 57 to 96 years of age. This was the least convincing part of this project and slightly detracted from the rest of the work.</p><p>Introduction: Change 'choroids' to choroid</p><p>Discussion section: Replace 'phagocyte' with 'phagocytize'</p><p>Discussion section: Replace 'synthetize' with 'synthesize'</p><p>Discussion section: Change 'In presence' to 'In the presence'</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Storti et al., includes the characterization of a conditional knockout mouse that lacks ABCA1 and its effector protein ABCG1 in the RPE cells. RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mice presented an early onset ocular phenotype including lipid deposition in the RPE, local inflammatory reactivity, and progressive loss of both RPE and photoreceptor cells. Lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCL) from individuals with known AMD-risk variant of ABCA1 showed reduced ABCA1 expression when stimulated with a liver x receptor (LXR) agonist, further suggesting the role of ABCA1 in lipid metabolism. The manuscript is well-written for most of the parts. The study is more descriptive rather than providing new mechanistic insights on AMD. Given the similarities to AMD in the phenotypic features, the RPEDAbca1;Abcg1 mouse may be useful to test various therapeutic approaches targeting intracellular lipid/cholesterol metabolism. However, a major flaw of the study is the lack of direct investigations of ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels in the RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mouse by immunoblotting and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p><p>The ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels were evaluated by IHC only in the wild-type sections (Figure 1A). For the RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mouse, the read out for gene knockdown was evidenced primarily by Cre mRNA expression (Figure 1B and Figure 3F; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3) and at the protein level by IHC using an antibody against Cre rather than ABCA1 and ABCG1. Expression of Abca1 and Abcg1 mRNA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2) was reduced in the mutated mouse but no protein data is shown.</p><p>Cre-driven morphological changes and increased lipid deposition in the RPE cells RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mouse were clearly evidenced in Figure 2 and Figure 5. The group also choose an AAV-based approach to transduce the RPE cells of Abca1 and Abcg1 Floxed/Floxed mouse to further draw a correlate between the GFP-Cre-expression and lipid deposition (Figure 4). Here again, immunostaining for ABCA1 and ABCG1 was not performed.</p><p>In the paper, it is implied that lack of ABCA1/ABCG1 significantly impairs the recycling of lipids of phagocytosed OS. However, phagocytosis does not appear to have been tested in these conditional mice. Is the uptake/internalization of the phagocytosed OS normal in these mutated RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mice?</p><p>A decline in the expression of ABCA1 mRNA level was observed in the aged eyes (Supplementary figure S5). This finding would be more impactful if the tested samples would have been genotyped for the known AMD-associated ABCA1 risk-variant. What if the older donor eyes carry the risk-variant? The authors attempted to address the risk-genotype effect by showing a reduced level of the ABCA1 mRNA in the LCLs from individuals with ABCA1 risk-variant compared to control cells upon stimulation with an LXR agonist (Figure 11). In this experiment, reduction in expression of the ABCA1 mRNA (Figure 11A) in the risk-genotype cells did not correlate with the protein levels (Figure 11C). Also, these LCLs are quite different than RPE cells morphologically and functionally. The human data appear to be inconclusive and require additional experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>The authors targeted deletion of ABCA1 and its partner ABCG1 in mouse RPE, which resulted in retinal degeneration and inflammation, substantial loss of function of RPE and photoreceptors/neural retina, and accumulation of lipids in RPE (due to loss of efflux capacity). Assessment of human-derived cell lines from aged control and AMD patients confirmed increased AMD risk associated with decreased ABCA1 gene expression. The results highlight the importance of a functional ABC efflux machinery in the RPE for maintaining normal lipid homeostasis as well as retinal/RPE structure and function. Further, the results appear to have relevance to the pathobiological mechanism underlying AMD-- with the obvious caveat that the mouse has no macula and the life span is severely compressed relative to humans.</p><p>Overall, this is an elegant, well-conceived and technically well-executed study. The data (which were expansive in scope!) are rigorous and statistically sound, the manuscript is clearly written, and the quality of the data presentation is extremely good. A veritable tour de force!</p><p>This reviewer has no substantive concerns.</p><p>1) Anytime one meddles with a cell's genetic material, such as the targeted deletion performed in this study, there tends to be a &quot;ripple effect&quot;-- with expression of other genes being affected. The ABC family of transporters is complex, and integrates into a network of inter-connected gene families that regulate multiple aspects of cellular metabolism and homeostasis. It would be of interest to consider what other genes, besides ABCA1 and ABCG1, were affected (up/down expression of transcripts) by this targeted deletion-- both in RPE as well as in the neighboring neural retina. While this would be a rather time-consuming and expensive undertaking (so this reviewer is NOT requiring this for revision), the authors should at least consider the possibility of network effects in their discussion of the results.</p><p>2) While the comparison is often made to the cardiovascular system when discussing AMD and lipid homeostasis, it occurs to this reviewer that there's another parallel with the pulmonary system in the context of inflammation, disease, ABC transporters, and lipid homeostasis. A recent review highlights this: see Chai, Ammit and Gelissen, 2017.</p><p>Perhaps the authors would want to take this into consideration in their Discussion section as well?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45100.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major item in our assessment is that we think that the post-mortem human data in Supplementary figure S5 are not compelling.

Also, the PCR analysis of the recombined fragment does not assess the fraction of cells in which recombination did not occur.</p></disp-quote><p>This is of course a very valid (and expected) comment. We invested a significant amount of time and effort and used several approaches to show downregulation of ABCA1/ABCG1 at the protein level. For Western blotting, we used two different buffers to isolate proteins from RPE-enriched cell isolates and whole eyecup preparations. All attempts failed to conclusively show reduced ABCA1 or ABCG1 protein levels. The only explanation we have is that anti-ABCA1 and anti-ABCG1 antibodies recognize epitopes outside the excised regions (epitope for ABCA1 lies within exons 23-29 (before the excised exons 45-46); epitope for ABCG1 is within exon 5 (after the excised exon 3)) and that (non functional) proteins are translated that are detected by the antibodies despite the excision of the respective floxed sequences. Such proteins should be smaller in size but since the proteins are very large (ABCA1: 254 kDa; ABCG1: predicted 75.5 kDa, runs around 110 kDa on Western blots), the size difference may not be easily detectable, especially since both antibodies proofed to perform poorly in Western blotting. In addition, <italic>Cre</italic> expression is patchy with many cells expressing full-length proteins, making it difficult to detect a difference by Western blotting. The presence of the flox/- genotype in a subset of cells (possibly in a chimeric fashion) in both Ctr and RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice can also influence the amount of protein, as it clearly influences the mRNA levels of <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Abcg1</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), and make the detection of a rather small difference even more difficult.</p><p>To circumvent some of these problems, we used immunofluorescence on retina sections and RPE flat mounts. In our hands, however, it was difficult to get meaningful intracellular staining of ABCA1/ABCG1 that discriminated between control and RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice, despite several attempts with different protocols. On flat mounts, no obvious differences were detectable, likely because of the production of truncated proteins recognized by the antibodies (see above).</p><p>Unfortunately, all of our many attempts showed only a tendency of reduced protein levels at most. We are very confident, however, that our Cre-LoxP system resulted in non-functional ABCA1/ABCG1 proteins at least in some RPE cells. With the presentation of the successful excision at the genomic DNA level (Figure 1), the specific <italic>Cre</italic> expression in the RPE (Figure 1), the lack of a phenotype in the <italic>BEST1Cre</italic> mouse (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and the reduced mRNA levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) together with the strong RPE-specific phenotype of the RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice that fits well with reduced ABCA1/ABCG1 function, we believe that it is highly likely that function of ABCA1/ABCG1 was affected in our RPE-specific knockout mice. Moreover, the <italic>Abca1<sup>flox/flox</sup>;Abcg1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice were previously used to successfully generate KO models in different tissues with a clear functional phenotype (Westerterp et al., 2012; Westerterp et al., 2016; Ban et al., 2018; Ban et al., 2018).</p><p>Of course, we are happy to provide all data of our attempts to demonstrate reduced ABCA1/ABCG1 protein levels upon request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A third recommendation – and this one is less critical than the first two – is to conduct RNAseq on the WT vs KO RPE to see if there are secondary gene expression changes in response to transporter KO.

We asked this question ourselves and conducted an RNAseq experiment at 2 months of age to detect potential changes in the gene expression pattern of RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice.

We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. We look forward to receiving your revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>This study demonstrates the importance of the ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux pathway in maintaining RPE and photoreceptor cell health. Specifically, they show unequivocally that lack of ABCA1 in RPE cells resulted in lipid droplet accumulation within the RPE which, over time, led to loss of the RPE cells. The authors generated and characterized an RPE-specific Abca1;Abcg1 double knockout mice on a BEST1Cre background, they used 2 month old mice to show evidence of Cre mRNA expression in the eyecup and very little in the retina, IF positive staining for Cre only in the RPE nuclei, and showed CRE-mediated excision fragments of Abca1 and Abcg1 in the eyecups with some variability, likely due to the variable Cre expression in the RPE of these mice. Also, at 2 months of age, on a normal diet, morphologically there were already changes: a dotted pattern on fundus images, changes seen in the apical border of the RPE and lipid droplets in the RPE, lipidTOX and OilRedO staining coinciding with Cre expression in the RPE. A decrease in the rates of rhodopsin regeneration after bleaching demonstrated that this was slower initially in the double knockout mice suggesting impairment of visual cycle even in these 2 month old mice.</p><p>Age-dependent changes were also seen by studying the mice at 2, 4 and 6 months. They detected deteriorating phenotypic changes by careful measurements of RPE shape, size, and Mct3 expression, light microscopy and EM showed increasing damage to the RPE and neural retina and increasing visual deficits by ERG measurements of 2, 4, and 6 month old mice.</p><p>They used the correct controls to ensure changes seen in the mice were not developmental, they injected an AAV virus expressing CRE and GFP into adult Abca1flox/flox:Abcg1flox/flox mice and they saw, in regions that were GFP-positive, the same changes in accumulation of lipids and RPE damage they saw with the double knockout mice. To ensure the phenotype of the double KO was not due to CRE toxicity the BEST1CRE mouse was used as a control. They also generated RPE-specific Abca1 KO and RPE-specific Abcg1 KO mice and studying these at 2 months of age determined that the Abca1 appeared to be the dominant gene responsible for lipid efflux in the RPE cells, resulting in lipid accumulation in the cells, this may imply a somewhat different regulation of lipid homeostasis in RPE cells compared to macrophages that require both Abca1 and Abcg1.</p><p>Overall a careful study which does not overstate the findings but nicely points to the ABCA1-mediated efflux of lipids as being essential for maintaining RPE health.</p><p>It is unclear which of the analyses shown in Figure 5 were from &quot;RPE-enriched samples&quot;, i.e. from an eyecup without the neural retina, to which PBS was added and then the tubes were flicked to release RPE cells and which analysis used the entire eyecup without the neural retina. Were all the analyses done on single eyes or were the tissue lysates pooled?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing description. The analyses for UC, CEs and REs were done separately from the rest of the lipid classes. We changed the labeling of the figure to reflect which analyses have been done on ‘RPE-enriched eyecup’ and which were done on ‘whole eyecup’ samples. This labeling is now also explained in the Materials and methods section and in the legend to Figure 5. Also, pooled tissues from both eyes of the same animal were used for UC, CEs and REs, while single eyes were analyzed for PLs, SL, and GLs. This is now explained in the Materials and methods section and in the legend to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 9A using 4 month old mice and flat mounts, sub-RPE IBA-1 positive cells infiltrating the RPE from the choroidal side are shown in flatmounts, can you give an indication of how many cells were seen and if you saw this in all the KO mice at this age.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very good point. After careful inspection of the images, we re-considered our initial interpretation of the results: since we cannot exclude the possibility that IBA-1-positive cells infiltrated the RPE from the apical side and migrated through the layer to the basal side, we now discuss the observed localization of the cells rather than speculating on the direction of their infiltration. All the flat mounts analyzed from RPE<sup>∆<italic>Abca1;Abcg1</italic></sup> mice at 4 months of age showed the presence of inflammatory cells in varying amounts: we now provide a rough estimate of the amount of IBA-1-positive cells per flat mount in the text. As we did not perform a staining for apical versus basal RPE markers and the mutant RPE is occasionally already damaged at this time point, it is often not possible to assign a clear localization (apical, middle or basal) to the IBA-1-positive cells in the RPE layer. The corresponding Results section was changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then IBA-1 cells in 6 month mice showed, in retinal sections, sub-retinal immune cells were seen- were these seen in parts of the retina that still had an intact RPE layer or, as was seen in EM of sections of mice at this age had the RPE completely atrophied and disappeared. In the text, it appears there is a comparison made between the localization of immune cells at 4 months and 6 months, but because the figures show flat mounts for one time point and cross sections for the other the comparison is a little difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to compare the two time points because quantification of these cells is difficult due to variability in their shape and origin (blood-born macrophages versus activated retinal microglia). The main point from the IBA-1 immunofluorescence images is that we detect IBA-1 positive cells already at 4 months and also later at 6 months of age. We changed the text (subsection “Inflammatory response in RPE<sup>Δ<italic>Abca1;Abcg1</italic></sup> mice”) to make this point clearer and to state that IBA-1 positive cells were not only detected in the most affected retinal regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Supplementary figure S5 using eyecup tissue from 25 human donor eyes, the authors attempted to show that there was a decrease in ABCA1 mRNA expression levels with age. Only 4 of these samples were from donors younger than 53 and without these 4 samples there did not appear to be any decline in ABCA1 expression from 57 to 96 years of age. This was the least convincing part of this project and slightly detracted from the rest of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree that this data set is not very strong because only few young donors were available for testing. This misbalanced age distribution was the reason why we placed this data as a supplementary figure. To avoid presentation of potentially misleading data, we removed (old) Supplementary figure S5 and (old) Supplementary table S4 from the manuscript.

RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mice presented an early onset ocular phenotype including lipid deposition in the RPE, local inflammatory reactivity, and progressive loss of both RPE and photoreceptor cells. Lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCL) from individuals with known AMD-risk variant of ABCA1 showed reduced ABCA1 expression when stimulated with a liver x receptor (LXR) agonist, further suggesting the role of ABCA1 in lipid metabolism. The manuscript is well-written for most of the parts. The study is more descriptive rather than providing new mechanistic insights on AMD. Given the similarities to AMD in the phenotypic features, the RPEDAbca1;Abcg1 mouse may be useful to test various therapeutic approaches targeting intracellular lipid/cholesterol metabolism. However, a major flaw of the study is the lack of direct investigations of ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels in the RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mouse by immunoblotting and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC).</p><p>The ABCA1 and ABCG1 protein levels were evaluated by IHC only in the wild-type sections (Figure 1A). For the RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mouse, the read out for gene knockdown was evidenced primarily by Cre mRNA expression (Figure 1B and Figure 3F; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3) and at the protein level by IHC using an antibody against Cre rather than ABCA1 and ABCG1. Expression of Abca1 and Abcg1 mRNA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2) was reduced in the mutated mouse but no protein data is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We made many attempts (including Western blotting using different methodologies and protocols, immunofluorescence on sections and immunofluorescence on flat mounts) to show the effect of the CRE-mediated deletions on the protein levels. However, none of these attempts was convincing and we decided not to show the data.

The group also choose an AAV-based approach to transduce the RPE cells of Abca1 and Abcg1 Floxed/Floxed mouse to further draw a correlate between the GFP-Cre-expression and lipid deposition (Figure 4). Here again, immunostaining for ABCA1 and ABCG1 was not performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the point above. The same difficulties to detect levels of ABCA1 and ABCG1 on the protein level apply here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the paper, it is implied that lack of ABCA1/ABCG1 significantly impairs the recycling of lipids of phagocytosed OS. However, phagocytosis does not appear to have been tested in these conditional mice. Is the uptake/internalization of the phagocytosed OS normal in these mutated RPEΔAbca1;Abcg1 mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point that we also considered but did not test directly <italic>in vivo</italic>. Based on the morphology of POS, the lack of obvious debris accumulation in the sub-retinal space (e.g. Figure 2), the accumulation of fatty acids typical for photoreceptor OS such as DHA in the RPE (Figure 5, see Discussion section) and the staining pattern obtained with an antibody against rhodopsin (not shown) in RPE<italic><sup>∆Abca1;Abcg1</sup></italic> mice, we have no evidence that uptake/internalization of shed OS was impaired in our mice.</p><p>Nevertheless, we generated three ARPE19 cell lines that stably expressed different anti-<italic>ABCA1</italic> shRNAs to investigate this in some more detail. Expression of <italic>ABCA1</italic> in these cell lines was at about 25% of control cells. The knockdown cells were fed with bodipy-cholesterol labeled OS from pig eyes and phagosomes were quantified at different time points after feeding. With this approach we detected a tendency towards reduced phagosome numbers at some but not all time points. Since number and size of cells at confluency strongly varied between these stable knockdown cell lines and control ARPE19 cells, data were not conclusive. No differences in phagosome numbers were detected when the same experiment was done with ARPE19 cells treated with anti-<italic>ABCA1</italic> siRNAs (transient knockdown).</p><p>Since phagocytosis was not at the heart of our research focus, we decided to abandon this line of experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A decline in the expression of ABCA1 mRNA level was observed in the aged eyes (Supplementary figure S5). This finding would be more impactful if the tested samples would have been genotyped for the known AMD-associated ABCA1 risk-variant. What if the older donor eyes carry the risk-variant? The authors attempted to address the risk-genotype effect by showing a reduced level of the ABCA1 mRNA in the LCLs from individuals with ABCA1 risk-variant compared to control cells upon stimulation with an LXR agonist (Figure 11). In this experiment, reduction in expression of the ABCA1 mRNA (Figure 11A) in the risk-genotype cells did not correlate with the protein levels (Figure 11C). Also, these LCLs are quite different than RPE cells morphologically and functionally. The human data appear to be inconclusive and require additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect of the risk-allele needs further investigation and that this data set is not very strong because only few young donors were available for testing. This misbalanced age distribution was the reason why we placed this data as a supplementary figure. To avoid presentation of potentially misleading data, we removed (old) Supplementary figure S5 and (old) Supplementary table S4 from the manuscript. However, we still mention in the Discussion section as ‘data not shown’ that preliminary experiments showed a tendency of reduced <italic>ABCA1</italic> expression in human RPE with age.</p><p>With regard to the data generated using LCLs from patients, we agree with the reviewer that these preliminary data (as we specifically labeled them in the manuscript) need to be confirmed. In particular, we will test iPSC-derived RPE cells from the patients to investigate cells that may resemble native RPE cells more closely. These cells will be used to test expression levels of ABCA1, and to analyze the potential influence of the risk allele on general metabolism and function. However, these experiments require more time and – to our feeling – are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>The authors targeted deletion of ABCA1 and its partner ABCG1 in mouse RPE, which resulted in retinal degeneration and inflammation, substantial loss of function of RPE and photoreceptors/neural retina, and accumulation of lipids in RPE (due to loss of efflux capacity). Assessment of human-derived cell lines from aged control and AMD patients confirmed increased AMD risk associated with decreased ABCA1 gene expression. The results highlight the importance of a functional ABC efflux machinery in the RPE for maintaining normal lipid homeostasis as well as retinal/RPE structure and function. Further, the results appear to have relevance to the pathobiological mechanism underlying AMD-- with the obvious caveat that the mouse has no macula and the life span is severely compressed relative to humans.</p><p>Overall, this is an elegant, well-conceived and technically well-executed study. The data (which were expansive in scope!) are rigorous and statistically sound, the manuscript is clearly written, and the quality of the data presentation is extremely good. A veritable tour de force!</p><p>This reviewer has no substantive concerns.</p><p>1) Anytime one meddles with a cell's genetic material, such as the targeted deletion performed in this study, there tends to be a &quot;ripple effect&quot;-- with expression of other genes being affected. The ABC family of transporters is complex, and integrates into a network of inter-connected gene families that regulate multiple aspects of cellular metabolism and homeostasis. It would be of interest to consider what other genes, besides ABCA1 and ABCG1, were affected (up/down expression of transcripts) by this targeted deletion-- both in RPE as well as in the neighboring neural retina. While this would be a rather time-consuming and expensive undertaking (so this reviewer is NOT requiring this for revision), the authors should at least consider the possibility of network effects in their Discussion of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we completely agree with this recommendation.
