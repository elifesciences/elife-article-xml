In youth, MuSCs return to a reversible state of cell-cycle arrest termed ‘quiescence’ after injury resolution. Conversely, some MuSCs in aged muscle remain semi-activated, causing a premature response to injuries that results in incomplete repair and eventual stem cell depletion. Regulating this balance between MuSC quiescence and activation may hold the key to restoring tissue homeostasis with age, but is incompletely understood. To fill this gap, we developed a simple and tractable in vitro method, to rapidly inactivate MuSCs freshly isolated from young murine skeletal muscle, and return them to a quiescent-like state for at least 1-week, which we name mini-IDLE (<bold>I</bold>nactivation and <bold>D</bold>ormancy <bold>LE</bold>veraged in vitro). This was achieved by introducing MuSCs into a 3D bioartificial niche comprised of a thin sheet of mouse myotubes, which we demonstrate provides the minimal cues necessary to induce quiescence. With different starting numbers of MuSCs, the assay revealed cellular heterogeneity and population-level adaptations that converged on a common niche repopulation density; behaviours previously observed only in vivo. Quiescence-associated hallmarks included a Pax7<sup>+</sup>CalcR<sup>+</sup>DDX6<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup>c-FOS<sup>-</sup> signature, quiescent-like morphologies, and polarized niche markers. Leveraging high-content bioimaging pipelines, we demonstrate a relationship between morphology and cell fate signatures for possible real-time morphology-based screening. When using MuSCs from aged muscle, they displayed aberrant proliferative activities and delayed inactivation kinetics, among other quiescence-associated defects that we show are partially rescued by wortmannin treatment. Thus, the assay offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically investigate long-standing queries in areas such as regulation of pool size and functional heterogeneity within the MuSC population, and to uncover quiescence regulators in youth and age.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When our muscles are injured, stem cells in the tissue are activated to start the repair process. However, when there is no damage, these cells tend to stay in a protective, dormant state known as quiescence. If quiescence is not maintained, the stem cells cannot properly repair when the muscle is damaged. This happens in old age, when a proportion of the cells remain semi-activated, and become depleted. However, researchers still do not fully understand how quiescence is regulated. This is partly because in order to study quiescence, live animals must be used, because muscle stem cells immediately come out of quiescence when they are removed from muscle tissue.</p><p>To overcome this experimental limitation, Jacques et al. developed a new method to study muscle stem cells by transferring them from mice into three-dimensional engineered muscle tissue grown in the lab. This tissue is made by infiltrating the pores of teabag paper with muscle progenitor cells, which then fuse with one another to make a thin muscle that contains three layers of contractile muscle cells. Introducing muscle stem cells from young healthy animals into this engineered muscle tissue allowed them to return to a quiescent-like state and to remain in that state for at least a week. Cells from older animals could also be returned to dormancy if they were chemically treated after placing them in the engineered muscle tissue.</p><p>The approach works in a miniaturized fashion, with each engineered tissue requiring less than one per cent of the muscle stem cells collected from each mouse. This allows 100 times as many experiments compared to the current methods using live animals.</p><p>This system could help researchers to study the genetic and chemical influences on muscle stem cell quiescence. Further understanding in this area could lead to treatments that restore healing abilities in older muscle tissue.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle stem cell</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>inactivation</kwd><kwd>in vitro assay</kwd><kwd>niche</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CGS-D Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004489</institution-id><institution>Mitacs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Globalink Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Michael Smith Foreign Study Supplement</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacques</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010785</institution-id><institution>Canada First Research Excellence Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medicine by Design (MbDC2-2019-02)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Penney M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Research Chair in Endogenous Repair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilbert</surname><given-names>Penney M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A user-friendly, and modular, 3D skeletal muscle culture assay enables iterative studies of murine muscle stem cell pool size regulation, functional heterogeneity, return to quiescence, and age-associated functional defects within a 96-well footprint.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are an adult stem cell population identifiable by the selective expression of the paired-box transcription factor Pax7 in skeletal muscle tissue, and are essential to muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Günther et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">von Maltzahn et al., 2013</xref>).

Anatomically, they reside between a myofiber and the surrounding basal lamina, a highly specialized microenvironment or ‘niche’, that conveys unto them the popularized term ‘satellite cell’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mauro, 1961</xref>). Though quiescent, they are not dormant but are in fact idling; constantly communicating with their niche and waiting to respond to stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Velthoven and Rando, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crist et al., 2012</xref>). Examples include significant physical activity causing mechanically induced damage, acute trauma, or exposure to myotoxic compounds that induce myofiber degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baghdadi and Tajbakhsh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murach et al., 2021</xref>). In these situations, MuSCs rapidly shift to an activated state wherein they enter cell cycle, and proliferate to produce progeny that differentiate to repair or create new myofibers, or they undertake self-renewing divisions where a subpopulation eventually returns to quiescence and repopulates the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rudnicki et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Quiescence is required for the long-term stability of the stem cell pool, and proper activation kinetics are necessary to ensure the integrity of the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ancel et al., 2021</xref>). MuSCs are regarded as existing individually along a quiescence activation spectrum where shifts occur during different stages of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ancel et al., 2021</xref>). The depth of quiescence is shown to be positively correlated with stem cell potency, or ‘stemness’. Indeed, instances where depth of quiescence is lost, such as in aging, leads to less efficient and incomplete regeneration, and a progressive decline in MuSC number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). However, how the process of MuSC inactivation (reversibly rendering non-active or inert) and the quiescent state are regulated, in youth and in age, remains largely unexplored, in part due to a reliance on in vivo studies, which imparts through-put limitations.</p><p>A requirement of quiescence studies in vitro (a setting that offers higher-content and precise experimental control as compared to in vivo studies), is that MuSC activation must be overridden to reinstate a quiescent state. This is because tissue dissection, enzymatic digestion, and cell sorting impart an injury-associated stress response to MuSCs, and cause isolation-induced activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machado et al., 2021</xref>). Several studies describe in vitro approaches to delay activation for days (at most) by manipulating the culture substrate or media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charville et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arjona et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monge et al., 2017</xref>). Though temporary, these strategies offer potential options to be able to first isolate and expand MuSC number ex vivo and then preserve or improve MuSC potency by holding them in a quiescent state prior to transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charville et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arjona et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monge et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, combining a chemically defined ‘quiescence media’ with artificial muscle fibers was reported to maintain MuSCs in culture with limited proliferative activity or changes to cell volume, and sustained CD34 expression for a 3.5-day period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quarta et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, three-dimensional (3D) skeletal muscle macrotissue platforms were shown to support Pax7<sup>+</sup> reserve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baroffio et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>) within human myoblast populations to take on a reversible quiescent-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tiburcy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Juhas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleming et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rajabian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trevisan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>). To date, a strategy to inactivate freshly isolated adult MuSCs in culture for &gt;3.5 days and to induce multiple molecular and morphological hallmarks of quiescence has yet to be reported. These experimental roadblocks, in turn, have focused all evaluations of MuSCs isolated from aged tissue on proliferation since studies of functional defects associated with quiescence have been precluded ex vivo.</p><p>To address these gaps and offer unparalleled access to the elusive quiescent MuSC, our group employed tissue engineering principles to create a scalable in vitro biomimetic niche capable of provoking inactivation in freshly isolated MuSCs. Previously, we invented MEndR, a method to study skeletal muscle endogenous repair ‘in a dish’ in a 24-well format by introducing MuSCs into thin sheets of engineered muscle tissue that we then injured using myotoxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davoudi et al., 2022</xref>). In our uninjured control tissues, we observed a non-negligible proportion of the engrafted cells remained mononucleated at the assay endpoint, in spite of the differentiation-inducing culture media used. We hypothesized that the muscle tissues were providing a pro-quiescence niche. To evaluate this in depth, herein we produced miniaturized (96-well format) muscle tissues, derived from primary mouse myoblasts, into which we introduced freshly sorted adult mouse MuSCs. We report that within these biomimetic niches, termed mini-IDLE (<bold>I</bold>nactivation and <bold>D</bold>ormancy <bold>LE</bold>veraged in vitro), the MuSCs rapidly inactivated for at least 7 days; a period 2× longer than previously possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quarta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charville et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arjona et al., 2022</xref>). Analysis of MuSC activities reflected functional heterogeneity and population-level adaptations to achieve a steady-state equilibrium in pool size. Modulating various components of the niche revealed the unique setting of 3D extracellular matrix (ECM) with engineered myotubes to be vital to inactivation and sufficient for inducing in vivo-like hallmarks of quiescence never before reported in vitro, including cadherin-mediated niche interactions, elongated nuclei, and elaborated cytoplasmic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>). Integrating the culture assay with a high-content imaging system and CellProfiler-based image analysis pipelines allowed us to relate cell fate signatures to morphometric features and produced criteria to assess the quiescence of MuSCs based solely on morphology. Finally, aged MuSCs introduced into mini-IDLE displayed phenotypic and functional defects associated with their failure to properly inactivate, that were partially rescued by wortmannin, a treatment shown by others to push activated young MuSCs into a deeper quiescence. Thus, we present a new MuSC quiescence assay that recapitulates in vivo-like hallmarks of young and aged MuSCs within homeostatic muscle ‘in a dish’ for the first time, which enabled the identification of a putative strategy to correct aged MuSC dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineered myotube templates derived from primary mouse myoblasts maintain integrity for 2 weeks in culture</title><p>We first set out to engineer a skeletal muscle microenvironment suited to investigate the ability of a 3D myotube niche to induce a quiescent-like phenotype upon freshly isolated (i.e. activated) MuSCs cultured in vitro.

Herein, we adapted and extended the method to create thin sheets of murine myotubes that fit within a 96-well plate footprint. Briefly, we incorporated primary mouse myoblasts within a mixture of media, fibrinogen, and Geltrex (i.e. reconstituted basement membrane proteins). The resultant slurry was pipetted into pieces of thin, porous cellulose teabag paper, pre-adsorbed with thrombin, and situated within a 96-well plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this way, fibrin hydrogel gelation is delayed until the cell/fibrinogen slurry diffuses within the thrombin-containing cellulose scaffold. Following a 2-day equilibration period in growth media (GM), the tissues were transitioned to a low-mitogen differentiation media (DM) to support multinucleate myotube formation within the cellulose-reinforced fibrin hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A three-dimensional (3D) murine skeletal muscle myotube template with a 96-well footprint.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the strategy used to generate myotube templates with an associated timeline for downstream culture (made with BioRender).

Peak myotube content (≈65% by sarcomeric α-actinin (SAA) tissue coverage) and a nuclear fusion index of 90% was achieved by 5 days in DM with as few as 25,000 cells per tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since myotube degradation could serve as an activation cue for the engrafted MuSCs, we evaluated the integrity of the tissues over time in culture. Starting on day 18, a visual inspection of tissues revealed loss of myotubes around the periphery of the tissues and quantification of SAA coverage showed a corresponding drop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). A colorimetric metabolic activity assay (i.e. MTS) revealed that mitochondrial activity was significantly reduced on day 18 when compared to day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), another indication that the integrity of the tissues becomes compromised at later timepoints. Based on these analyses, we established conditions to engineer a mouse myotube template and concluded that day 5 to day 14 of myotube template culture would serve as the assay window.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>3D myotube templates show improved maturity and integrity compared to 2D culture</title><p>Our prior studies comparing human myotubes cultivated in 2D and 3D settings revealed disadvantages of 2D culture that included myotube detachment from the substrate, which enriched for less mature myotubes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar Bakooshli et al., 2019</xref>). We compared murine myotubes at days 5, 8, and 12 of differentiation in 2D and 3D culture, and drew similar conclusions. Specifically, by day 12 we observed detachment zones in 2D cultures which translated to a significant drop in SAA coverage compared to our 3D myotube templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>). Upon closer inspection, we also observed a higher incidence of multinucleated, SAA<sup>+</sup> sphere-shaped structures, indicative of retracted myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>). To address myotube maturity, we evaluated SAA<sup>+</sup> striations using a MATLAB z-disc analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morris et al., 2020</xref>). According to the Z-line fraction (i.e. the fraction of SAA skeleton classified as Z-lines by actin guided segmentation), the proportion of striations per field of view is increased in 3D at the day 5 timepoint, with 2D cultures eventually catching up by day 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and E</xref>). While we noted no differences in mean continuous Z-line length, we found an increase in mean sarcomere length in 3D culture, which is closer to the length-tension plateau reported in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moo et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, by contrast to 2D culture, 3D myotube templates show little to no myotube detachment over 12 days of differentiation and a quicker obtention of striations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MuSC populations persist in myotube templates</title><p>The engineered mouse myotube template incorporates key cellular, biochemical, and biophysical aspects of the MuSC niche: myofibers and ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mauro, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilbert and Blau, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuchs and Blau, 2020</xref>). Thus, we next sought to determine whether adult mouse MuSCs could persist, in terms of pool size and Pax7 expression, when introduced to these biomimetic cultures. Firstly, we adapted a magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) protocol as a convenient and fast alternative to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for enriching the Pax7<sup>+</sup> mononucleated cell population from digested skeletal muscle. By conducting two rounds of microbead-based lineage depletion followed by integrin α-7 enrichment, we achieved an average purity of 93% Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which meets FACS purity values reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maesner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>).

Freshly sorted MuSCs were seeded onto day 5 myotube templates, and the tissue co-cultures processed for analysis at 1, 3, and 7 days post-engraftment (DPE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Over the 1-week culture period, the Pax7<sup>+</sup> mononuclear donor (YFP<sup>+</sup>) cells were seen distributed throughout the myotube template and adopting an elongated morphology that aligned with the local myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). We investigated the effect of introducing different numbers of MuSCs onto individual myotube templates, by quantifying the population of Pax7<sup>+</sup> mononuclear donor cells over time. Seeding 500 MuSCs resulted in a relatively stable pool size over time. Interestingly, when a higher (1500 or 2500) or lower number of MuSCs were introduced to myotube templates, over time the number of Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cells converged to match the pool size attained in the 500 MuSC condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the engrafted MuSC population persists and establishes a steady-state cell density within the engineered niche.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Engrafted muscle stem cells (MuSCs) persist in myotube template cultures and achieve a steady-state population density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the engraftment of freshly isolated MuSCs and the timeline for downstream analysis (made with BioRender).

We began by evaluating MuSCs within the engraftment condition that lent to a stable population density over time (i.e. 500 MuSCs per tissue). Calcitonin receptor (CalcR) expression is a hallmark of quiescent MuSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baghdadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Robinson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gnocchi et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, at the protein level, CalcR is expressed by quiescent MuSCs, but is then absent from all MuSCs within 48 hr of an in vivo myotoxin injury or within 48 hr of prospective isolation followed by in vitro culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamaguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baghdadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gnocchi et al., 2009</xref>). In the context of our 3D culture assay, the majority of MuSCs expressed CalcR at 1 DPE, with a sharp decline in the proportion of CalcR<sup>+</sup> donor cells observed at 3 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, ~15% of donor MuSCs were CalcR<sup>+</sup> at both 3 and 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the lack of evidence for CalcR<sup>+</sup> MuSCs in prolonged in vitro cultures, we posited that this subpopulation might be reflective of MuSCs that had resisted activation in favour of maintaining a more quiescent-like state, which we sought to interrogate further.</p><p>After a single day of culture, we found that ≈75% of the donor MuSCs (YFP<sup>+</sup>caveolin-1<sup>+</sup> cells) engrafted within the myotube templates expressed the transcription factor c-FOS, among the earliest transcriptional events reported to date in the MuSC activation sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Velthoven et al., 2017</xref>).

To better resolve the proliferative trajectory of the engrafting MuSCs, we conducted a Ki67 co-labelling study whereby 5-ethanyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) was refreshed in the culture media daily over the 1-week culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Of the Ki67<sup>-</sup> mononuclear donor cells present at 7 DPE, the vast majority were EdU<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Approximately 30% were EdU<sup>+</sup>, indicating cell-cycle entry at some point during the 1-week culture period, and a cessation by 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This correlates well with the proportion of Ki67<sup>+</sup> MuSCs we observed at 3 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This data, together with a scarcity of EdU<sup>+</sup> myonuclei observed in the cultures (data not shown), suggests that the main fate of the EdU labelled MuSCs is eventual cell-cycle exit, and not myotube fusion.</p><p>Lastly, we sought to understand whether the inactivated donor cells at 7 DPE were capable of re-entering the cell cycle. We first established a barium chloride exposure protocol that induced effective clearing of the myotubes with a non-significant change to MuSC population density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then analysed the mononuclear YFP<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> population 2 days post-injury and observed a statistically significant increase in the proportion of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells as compared to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, myotube template cultures allow for inactivation and cell-cycle exit of engrafted MuSCs, which can be reversed with the injury-associated stimuli caused by barium chloride exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Engrafted MuSCs adapt their pool size to a myotube template threshold</title><p>Regardless of the initial size of the MuSC pool, a common mononuclear YFP<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell density was attained by 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To uncover cellular mechanisms underlying the acquisition of a MuSC steady-state population density, we investigated how the donor MuSC pool responded under a set of distinct starting conditions. We began by extending the EdU/Ki67 co-labelling study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>) to include an evaluation of conditions where more (1500, 2500) or less (200) MuSCs were seeded onto the myotube templates. Compared with the 500 MuSC seeding condition, we found a significant increase in the proportion of mononuclear YFP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>-</sup> cells that were EdU<sup>+</sup> at 7 DPE in cultures seeded with 200 MuSCs, suggesting the MuSC pool expanded to attain a steady-state density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and C</xref>). By contrast, in conditions where &gt;500 MuSCs were seeded, a significant decrease in the proportion of mononuclear YFP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>-</sup> cells that were EdU<sup>+</sup> at 7 DPE was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In these conditions, a decrease in the MuSC pool size by 7 DPE could be achieved through cell death or by fusion into myotubes. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, upon visual inspection we saw a qualitatively greater number of donor-derived myotubes in the cultures seeded with &gt;500 MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which was confirmed by quantifying the percentage area of myotube templates covered by YFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>). In sum, we conclude that MuSCs meet a steady-state population density via increased proliferation when beginning below the 500 cell threshold, and with increased cell fusion when beginning above it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A 3D myotube culture is required for a persistent MuSC population in vitro</title><p>The rapid inactivation and subsequent maintenance of Pax7<sup>+</sup> MuSCs engrafted within the 3D myotube templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) represents a divergent phenotype when compared to conventional 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilbert et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we next sought to elucidate culture design criteria that served to support MuSC inactivation and pool maintenance over time. We first explored the response of MuSCs seeded onto tissues on day 0 of myotube template differentiation, a timepoint corresponding to the earliest myocyte fusion events, and therefore when myotubes were absent from the tissues. Compared to MuSCs seeded on myotube templates on day 5 of differentiation, day 0 seeding resulted in a progressive loss of YFP<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> mononuclear cells, and most of those that remained were Ki67<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). The striking contrast in YFP<sup>+</sup> myotube content observed at 7 DPE upon comparing these two conditions suggests that the MuSCs engrafted on day 0 had undergone differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next determined whether a 3D cellulose-reinforced hydrogel alone was sufficient to support MuSC inactivation and maintenance, since the myocytes present on day 0 of differentiation may have exerted a dominant effect overriding contributions of the 3D culture environment. However, this notion was abandoned upon finding that the outcome of this culture scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) very closely matched what we observed when the MuSCs were cultured in 2D Geltrex-coated culture wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>); a loss of the YFP<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> mononuclear population over time. Our results instead seemed to suggest that the myotube template played a central role in inactivating and maintaining a persistent population of MuSCs in culture. Indeed, upon adding MuSCs to a day 5 monolayer of myotubes in 2D culture, a Pax7<sup>+</sup> population was maintained over the 1-week culture period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). But in striking contrast to the 3D myotube template culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), only a minority of the Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cells were Ki67<sup>-</sup> at 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). From this iterative analysis, we conclude that myotubes are necessary for Pax7<sup>+</sup> MuSC persistence, and that the combination of myotubes and a 3D culture environment drives the MuSC inactivation process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Permissive culture conditions for a persistent muscle stem cell (MuSC) population in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Key for figure icons.

To quantify MuSC morphogenic progression in culture, we next overcame a significant data analysis bottleneck by establishing and validating a CellProfiler-based image analysis pipeline in order to segment and evaluate donor MuSCs in our phenotypic datasets (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>). The cytoplasmic elongation of mononucleated Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cell bodies was captured by applying a ratio of max/min Feret diameter to segmented images of tissues immunostained for YFP, Pax7, and DAPI. The roundness of nuclei within mononucleated YFP<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> cells was evaluated using the measurement of eccentricity, whereby a value of 0 corresponds to a perfect circle, and a value of 1 to a straight line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). With this pipeline, we determined that the Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cell population progressively shifted from low max/min Feret diameter ratios and eccentricities (lower left quadrant) to high max/min Feret diameter ratios and eccentricities (upper right quadrant) over time in 3D myotube culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). By conducting a side-by-side comparison of these features when MuSCs were cultured in 2D culture, vs. amongst a 2D myotube monolayer or within the 3D myotube template, we concluded that quiescence-associated morphologies were most prominent in the context of the 3D engineered niche (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Subsequently, we correlated MuSC morphology against another feature of quiescent MuSCs, the accumulation of DDX6<sup>+</sup> cytoplasmic mRNP granules, which were previously shown to sequester activation-specific transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crist et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, DDX6<sup>+</sup> puncta progressively accumulate within MuSCs cultured in the 3D in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), and we report a significant linear trend increase between the morphology of the cells and the number of DDX6<sup>+</sup> puncta at 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, the rice-like nuclear morphology and elaborated cytoplasmic projections of the Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cells at 7 DPE resembled quiescent features of MuSCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>) and associate with a known molecular feature of quiescent cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Morphological evolution of engrafted muscle stem cells (MuSCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal images of MuSCs (DAPI: cyan, YFP: yellow, Pax7: white) with distinct morphological features at 1, 3, and 7 days post-engraftment (DPE).

We introduced immunolabelling for MyoD, which, together with Pax7 staining, delivered molecular signatures for activated (Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup>) and inactivated (Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup>) donor cell populations. As expected, the ratio of Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> to Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> donor cells over time followed a trend similar to Ki67 status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), with a transient increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> cells at 3 DPE and a predominance of Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> cells at 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). By evaluating the mean max/min Feret diameter ratio and mean eccentricity values of the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> cell populations, we found that nuclear eccentricity differs between the populations by 3 DPE, while population divergence according to max/min Feret diameter ratio (˃2-fold) emerged a bit later, at 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Specifically, nuclear morphology of the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> population showed a progressive, statistically significant transition to a rice-like shape, while Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> nuclei remained more rounded. Elongation of the cell body and elaborate projections were features that exclusively characterized the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> cell population, and emerged between 3 and 7 DPE. Indeed, donor cells with a max/min Feret diameter ≥5.8 uniformly displayed the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> signature of inactivated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Quiescence-associated MuSC morphologies were recently shown to be induced and maintained by tipping the Rho family GTPase balance to favour cytoskeletal remodelling events caused by Rac signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, we asked whether inhibiting Rho signalling could expedite the process of MuSC inactivation and the emergence of quiescence-associated features. We added the Y-27632 ROCK inhibitor to the culture media for 1 week after MuSC engraftment. The treatment did not result in a significant shift in Pax7<sup>+</sup> cell population-level kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>), and while c-FOS labelling showed a trending decrease in c-FOS<sup>+</sup> cells at 3 DPE, it was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>). However, MyoD labelling revealed a Y-27632-induced block on the acquisition of a transiently activated subpopulation of MuSCs as had been observed in the control conditions at 3 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>). This was coupled to clear changes to MuSC morphology emerging at the 3 DPE timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Specifically, our evaluations of the max/min Feret diameter ratios of MuSCs indicated that Y-27632 treatment caused a shift towards the elongated morphology of quiescent-like cells at 3 DPE that was not attained in the control condition until 7 DPE. Thus, the Y-27632 treatment appeared to hasten the process of inactivation and, also, the acquisition of a quiescent-like morphology. Next, we quantified max/min Feret diameter ratio, nuclear eccentricity, mean number of cytoplasmic branches per cell, and mean skeleton length per cell and related these metrics to the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> and Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> signature of each donor cell at 1, 3, and 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). From this, we observed that the Y-27632 treatment elicited a significant influence over the morphology of the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> population, which in some cases (e.g. nuclear eccentricity, branching), matched, but did not supersede, the quiescent-like morphology of the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> engrafted cells. By contrast, the progression of the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup> population towards a quiescent-like morphology appeared to be uninfluenced by the Y-27632 treatment when compared against the control. Thus, Y-27632 treatment increased the proportion of inactivated (c-Fos<sup>-</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>-</sup>) MuSCs at 3DPE, which progressed to a quiescent-like morphology in a Y-27632 agnostic manner. In parallel, Y-27632 treatment coaxed the Pax7<sup>+</sup>MyoD<sup>+</sup> population to acquire quiescence-associated morphologies.</p><p>Taken together, morphological analysis of the engrafted MuSCs suggests that changes in nuclear morphology precede cell body extension and establishment of quiescent-like projections during the inactivation process, that morphometric features alone may predict MuSC inactivation status, and offers further support that cytoskeletal remodelling through Rho family GTPase signalling dictates the MuSC transition between activation and quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Engrafted MuSCs establish a polarized niche</title><p>We next evaluated additional hallmarks of quiescent MuSCs including the spatial organization of cadherins, integrins, and ECM proteins relative to their niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). In vivo, MuSCs are identified anatomically by their positioning sandwiched between a myofiber and the surrounding basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mauro, 1961</xref>). This polarized niche lends to the intracellular segregation or deposition of proteins within MuSCs to the apical side facing the myofiber (e.g. M-cadherin) or to the basal side facing the basal lamina (e.g. integrin α-7, laminin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goel et al., 2017</xref>). By evaluating immunolabelled tissues at 7 DPE, we found that most mononucleated donor cells had an elongated morphology and were closely associated with multinucleated myotubes. For more than two-thirds of donor cells, M-cadherin expression restricted to the apical interface was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It was recently discovered that quiescent MuSCs localize the N-cadherin adhesion molecule to the tips of elaborated cytoplasmic projections (coined ‘quiescent projections’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>), a feature we also observed within our culture assay at 7 DPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Examples such as these were found in ≈45% of mononuclear donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and in each case the Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cell morphology was characterized by a long oval-shaped nucleus and very long, elaborated cytoplasmic projections. Furthermore, we identified examples of polarized distribution of M-cadherin and integrin α-7 or laminin α-2 in Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cells, albeit with lower frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This evidence demonstrates that the engrafted MuSCs can recapitulate anatomical hallmarks of MuSCs residing within adult homeostatic skeletal muscle, and suggests that acquisition of these features is dependent on interactions with MuSCs and their immediate myofiber niche.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Engrafted muscle stem cells (MuSCs) display quiescence and niche-related hallmarks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal image of a mononuclear donor cell (DAPI: cyan, YFP: yellow) with neighbouring myotubes (Phalloidin: magenta) and N-cadherin (white) localized to the tip of the donor cell projection (white arrowhead).

A hallmark of MuSCs residing within aged muscle is precocious activation, owing to an improper maintenance and/or return to a quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haroon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Prat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimmel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimmel et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, a proportion of aged MuSCs remain in a state of chronic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2022</xref>).

We next leveraged mini-IDLE to evaluate possible defects in aged MuSC quiescence that might be apparent when they are decoupled from an aged niche environment. Upon seeding 500 MuSCs isolated from aged muscle onto a young 3D myotube template, we quantified an ≈2-fold increase in Pax7<sup>+</sup> mononucleated donor cell density by 3 DPE relative to tissues engrafted by young MuSCs and analysed at the same timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistently, a greater proportion of aged as compared to young MuSCs were Ki67<sup>+</sup> at 3 DPE, and aged MuSC morphology at this timepoint diverged significantly from that observed of young MuSCs in 3D myotube cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By 7 DPE, aged MuSC engrafted cultures showed a small, but significant, decrease in population density compared to young MuSC engrafted tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This, coupled with the trending increase in donor cell GFP<sup>+</sup> signal covering tissues at this timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggested that the aged MuSCs were unable to maintain pool size and that the production of Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cells observed at 3 DPE culminated in differentiation to myotubes. Nonetheless, the mononucleated aged Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cell population that persisted throughout the culture period showed a decline in the proportion of c-FOS<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and Ki67<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) cells with time, albeit with delayed inactivation kinetics when compared to young MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>).

Recent work showed that FoxO transcription factors are responsible for conferring a ‘genuine’ quiescent state to MuSCs, whereby genetic ablation resulted in a shift towards a ‘primed’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Prat et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, FoxO activity was computationally predicted to be regulated by the Igf-Akt pathway, where phosphorylated-Akt causes the phosphorylation of FoxO transcription factors and their translocation to the cytoplasm. Pharmacological inhibition of the AKT pathway using the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, resulted in increased stemness in primed young MuSCs. Whether this treatment strategy is capable of rescuing aged MuSCs is currently unknown, providing an opportunity to leverage our culture model to explore this hypothesis. First, we confirmed that compared to young MuSCs, aged MuSCs presented increased proliferation and reduced FoxO3a nuclear fluorescent intensity in 2D culture. In this context, wortmannin treatment (10 µM) blunted cell proliferation and increased FoxO3a nuclear localization in both young and aged MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Indeed, FoxO3a nuclear fluorescent intensity was comparable between young and aged MuSCs following wortmannin treatment in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We then introduced wortmannin to 3D myotube cultures engrafted with young or aged MuSCs. With this treatment, the aged MuSCs maintained a stable Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor population over time, that was indistinguishable from the untreated young MuSCs cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Indeed, the proportions of Ki67<sup>+</sup> and c-FOS<sup>+</sup> in the aged Pax7<sup>+</sup> population showed comparable kinetics to the young untreated donor MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). As well, the treatment encouraged a greater proportion of young MuSCs to inactivate, and with more rapid kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We also found a trending decrease in donor cell GFP<sup>+</sup> signal covering tissues at 7 DPE in wortmannin-treated conditions, suggesting reduced differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, morphological characterization of wortmannin-treated aged MuSCs at 7 DPE showed no change in average max/min Feret diameter ratio, whereas we found a rescue of nuclear eccentricity that matched young MuSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G</xref>).

MuSCs acquired in vivo-like hallmarks of quiescence in the mini-IDLE assay, that, to our knowledge, have never before been recapitulated in vitro. Through temporal single-cell analyses, we uncovered evidence of population-level adaptations to the muscle tissue niche and functionally heterogenous MuSC subpopulations mirroring in vivo heterogeneous activities. We also demonstrate the value proposition of the assay by introducing MuSCs from aged mice and revealing multiple functional deficits tied to an aberrant quiescent state, which we show are partially rescued by wortmannin treatment, a quiescence-reinforcing strategy previously tested on ‘primed’ MuSCs from young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Prat et al., 2020</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first aging assay ‘in a dish’ to capture advanced features of aged adult stem cell dysfunction. These breakthroughs, together with the modularity of the assay components, miniaturized format, and validated semi-automated workflows to capture and process phenotypic data, offer an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of MuSC quiescence and regulation in iterated designer niches.</p><p>In spite of a stress-induced response to tissue digestion and cell sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machado et al., 2021</xref>), our data demonstrate that the primary response of most MuSCs introduced to the biomimetic niche is immediate inactivation. A small proportion enter cell cycle prior to inactivation and an even smaller subset directly differentiate and fuse with myotubes in the template. The MuSC population is increasingly regarded as encompassing a continuum of quiescence to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ancel et al., 2021</xref>), and we believe our assay captures this continuum-influenced functional heterogeneity. More specifically, we expect those MuSCs closer to activation were inclined to differentiate and fuse, while those closer to a deeply quiescent state were resistant to activation cues. Additionally, Pax7<sup>+</sup> donor cells at 7 DPE expressing CalcR and/or polarized niche markers represent a little over one-tenth of the population, hinting that a subset of more naive MuSCs are those recapitulating the more ‘advanced’ hallmarks of quiescence we observed at 7 DPE. This is particularly intriguing taken with studies by others attributing a bona fide stem cell status to a similar proportion of MuSCs within the total population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rocheteau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Prat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sousa-Victor et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, taken together with our observation that a subpopulation of engrafted donor MuSCs never enter cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we proport that the biomimetic niche maintains a ‘genuine-like’ quiescent MuSC population alongside a more ‘primed-like’ MuSC population, therein offering a tractable culture system with which to identify biochemical and biophysical regulators of these unique states.</p><p>Engrafted MuSCs showed population-level control over their response to the niche, which opens up enticing possibilities for studies of MuSC pool size regulation, and to uncover rules dictating niche repopulation. Consistently, increased differentiation was recently recognized as a quality control mechanism to control MuSC pool size in vivo, biology that is matched in our in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). Rules of niche occupancy extoll limits on the number of transplanted MuSCs that can engraft into a recipient muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arpke et al., 2021</xref>), a barrier that may be broken upon expanding knowledge of MuSC pool size regulators. The data presented also underscores the importance of myotubes encased in a 3D matrix in allowing a persistent Pax7<sup>+</sup> pool, and for determining the niche occupancy plateau point, despite a differentiation-inducing culture milieu and the absence of any other cell types. This is perhaps not surprising as many studies tout a role for myofibers in preserving or inducing quiescence, and in controlling MuSC pool size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eliazer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sampath et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Southard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zofkie et al., 2021</xref>). A feedback mechanism between myofibers and MuSCs that is linked to nuclear content is suspected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zofkie et al., 2021</xref>); the likes of which could be interrogated in our system.</p><p>MuSCs in situ display long cytoplasmic projections that were initially described from electron microscopy analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schmalbruch, 1978</xref>), and more recently evaluated using tissue clearing and intravital imaging methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). The elaborate MuSC morphologies arising in our cultures offer a new opportunity to explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the acquisition of quiescent-like morphologies, but also the relevance of this phenotypic feature on MuSC behaviour and fate. Indeed, long elaborated cytoplasmic projections have been associated with a deeper quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>), and have been ruled out as a migratory apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>), favouring instead a role in ‘niche sensing’, though that remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>). Quite surprisingly, we found that acquisition of quiescent-like morphologies and anatomical hallmarks was dependent on interactions between MuSCs and their immediate niche, occurring in the absence of other resident muscle cell types. The modular culture assay described herein enables iterative study design and independent molecular perturbations to the niche (myotubes) and the MuSCs to break open knowledge in this area. Indeed, leveraging high-content imaging and CellProfiler workflows for relating morphometric features to fate signatures, we offer proof-of-concept support for the use of morphological features as a non-invasive readout of MuSC quiescence status in our model, thereby facilitating future phenotypic screening efforts.</p><p>To date, characterization of functional deficits of aged MuSC populations in vitro have focused on proliferation and colony formation as readouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haroon et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Prat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mouly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schultz and Lipton, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shefer et al., 2006</xref>), and studies of other recognized deficiencies have been restricted to in vivo studies. In recent years, aged MuSC regenerative deficits have been linked to the notion that with age there is a progressive decrease in truly quiescent cells in favour of a greater number of cells in a pre-activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kimmel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kimmel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with functional consequences expected of a pre-activated state, we noted aberrant expansion activity at early culture timepoints from a subset of the aged MuSCs seeded within our assay, and a trend towards increased differentiation at later timepoints, that were not observed in young MuSC cultures. Our studies also uncovered delayed inactivation kinetics and also in the acquisition of quiescent-like features. This suggests that a subset of aged MuSCs were unable to properly sense and respond to the pro-quiescent environment. Furthermore, the aged MuSC population was unable to maintain a steady-state pool size, which may imply that MuSC pool regulation is at least partly cell intrinsic and is dependent on both the activation state of MuSCs under steady-state conditions and exposure to activation-inducing cues. Interestingly, the myoblasts used to fabricate all of the muscle tissues for this study were derived from young mice, meaning that the aged MuSCs were exposed to a young niche. We cannot rule out the possibility that the young biomimetic muscle niche partially rescued aged MuSC function, as has been reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazure et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, we anticipate that aged MuSCs introduced to muscle tissues fabricated from myoblasts derived from aged donors and/or exposed to an aging systemic environment will induce further functional decline.</p><p>Finally, we found that inhibiting Akt signalling restored aged MuSC inactivation kinetics and population control. Our study extends prior work in showing that a strategy demonstrated to confer a genuine quiescent state onto young, activated MuSCs has a similar effect on aged MuSCs. We show that a decline in nuclear FoxOa3 levels is detected in MuSCs at an earlier age than previously thought, and that the nuclear FoxOa3 expression is corrected to youth-like levels by the wortmannin treatment. Wortmannin treatment had only subtle influence on young MuSCs, which may reflect an absence of stimulatory niche-derived ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Prat et al., 2020</xref>). However, we note that the DM culture media contains insulin, and the young and aged MuSCs were each cultured within young muscle tissues.</p><p>To conclude, herein we report that mini-IDLE is a culture assay capable of recapitulating aspects of quiescent mouse MuSC biology, in youth and in age, that were previously not possible to study in vitro. By contrast to all other 3D culture systems where the cellular and ECM components are mixed together and introduced at the start of the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tiburcy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fleming et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rajabian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trevisan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afshar Bakooshli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2020</xref>), our method is modular. Amongst the merits of this distinction is the ability to introduce and evenly distribute new cellular components to the assay at any time-point. It is also feasible to genetically modify the MuSC and myoblast components in different ways, and maintain these distinctions, when MuSCs are introduced to the muscle tissue after myotubes have formed. These advantages, together with the simplicity of the approach, assay compatibility with existing semi-automated high-content image acquisition and analysis tools, and high value features of MuSC biology captured by the system, offer a unique opportunity to expand MuSC fundamental knowledge and identify molecular targets to protect MuSC function as animals age.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal use protocols and ethics</title><p>All animal use protocols were reviewed and approved by the local Animal Care Committee (ACC) within the Division of Comparative Medicine (DCM) at the University of Toronto.

Briefly, ≈1 g of muscle tissues was dissected from the hindlimb muscles of a humanely euthanized mouse and placed into a GentleMACS dissociation tube (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-096-334). Seven mL of DMEM (Gibco, #11995-073) with 630 U/mL Type 1A collagenase from <italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic> (Sigma, #C9891) was added to the tube, and the sample was physically dissociated using a GentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-096-334) using the ‘skeletal muscle’ setting.

Prior inserting the 96-well plate into the Operetta, the PBS was removed from the wells of the plate to prevent tissues from shifting during imaging, and they were carefully positioned in the middle of the wells using tweezers. For stitched pictures, images were collected using the 10× air objective (Two Peak autofocus, NA 1.0 and Binning of 1). For MuSC analysis, images were collected using the 20× and 40× water immersion objectives (Two Peak autofocus, NA 1.0 and 1.1, and Binning of 1). All images were exported off the Harmony software in their raw form. Subsequent stitching, max projections, etc. was performed using the ImageJ-BIOP Operetta Import Plugin available on c4science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">ijs-Perkin Elmer Operetta CLS, Stitching And Export, 2022</xref>). For imaging of MuSC niche markers, the Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope and Olympus FluoView V4.2b imaging software was used along with a 40× silicone immersion objective (NA 1.25; Olympus, #UPLSAPO40XS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Z-line analysis</title><p>Myotubes were first stained for DAPI, SAA, and actin (phalloidin) and imaged at 40× (water immersion, Two Peak autofocus, NA 1.1, and Binning of 1) using the Perkin-Elmer Opera Phenix Plus High-Content Screening System. Images were then converted to max intensity projection images using the ImageJ-BIOP Operetta Import Plugin, the channels split and saved as individual TIFF files. The SAA and actin channels were then analysed using zlineDetection on MATLAB (R2022b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morris et al., 2020</xref>).

The SAA signal was put in red, the threshold set to 0–45, and the tissue outline selected using the oval tool. For fusion index, cell counting, cell morphology, YFP/GFP coverage and mean nuclear intensity, the CellProfiler software was utilized. CellProfiler version 4.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>) was downloaded from source website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cellprofiler.org">https://www.cellprofiler.org</ext-link>) and installed on a PC (Intel Core i9-11900 @ 2.5 GHz, 64.0 GB RAM, and 64-bit Windows 11 operating system). Analysis pipelines were created for each of the above-mentioned metrics. <italic>Fusion index</italic>: 9 × 20× max projected images were taken per tissue. The channels were split, the fiber and nuclei signal individually identified and overlayed to calculate the percentage of nuclei in fibers. <italic>Cell counting and morphology</italic>: 25 × 20× max projected images were taken per tissue. The channels were split, mononucleated DAPI<sup>+</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup>Pax7<sup>+</sup> (or caveolin-1<sup>+</sup>) objects extracted using the IdentifyPrimaryObjects module and counted. For object segmentation, the global minimum cross-entropy thresholding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li and Lee, 1993</xref>) was selected. Pixel intensity and object shape were used as metrics to distinguish and segment clumped objects. Morphology measurements of the identified cellular objects were recorded using the MeasureObjectSizeShape module. For the proportion of c-FOS<sup>+</sup>, Ki67<sup>+</sup>, MyoD<sup>+</sup>, and/or CalcR<sup>+</sup> cells, this fourth channel was overlayed over the identified objects and divided. <italic>YFP/GFP coverage</italic>: 25 × 20× max projected images were taken per tissue. The channels were split, the YFP/GFP signal identified, and coverage calculated using the MeasureAreaOccupied function. <italic>Mean nuclear intensity</italic>: 104 × 40× max projected images were taken per well. The channels were split, the nuclei, cell, and cytoplasm identified as primary, secondary, and tertiary objects, and the intensity of the FoxO3a signal within the nuclei calculated using the MeasureObjectIntensity function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>MTS assay</title><p>To quantify the metabolic activity of myotube templates, the MTS assay was used (abcam, #ab197010). First, 200 µL of fresh DM was added to each tissue. Then, 20 µL of the MTS tetrazolium compound was added to each well and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. The media was vigorously mixed with a pipette every 30 min to ensure maximal diffusion of the formazan dye product. The entire culture media from each tissue was then pipetted into a clear 96-well plate (Sarstedt, #83.3924) and the OD at 490 nm quantified with a spectrophotometer (Tecan, Infinite M200 Pro). The assay was performed on different tissues on different days of culture, each with their own ‘media + MTS’ negative control, which was subtracted as background from all OD values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EdU assay experiments</title><p>EdU experiments were performed using the Invitrogen Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 555 Imaging Kit (#C10638). EdU was added to the culture media on day 5 after MuSC engraftment and refreshed every 24 hr until 7 DPE. After tissue fixation and blocking, EdU labelling was done according to the product protocol apart from a 20 min incubation instead of 30 min. Subsequent immunolabelling was done as described above. The CellProfiler pipeline was then implemented to identify mononucleated DAPI<sup>+</sup>YFP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>-</sup> objects and then overlayed with the EdU channel to quantify the proportion of EdU positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Barium chloride tissue injury</title><p>On day 12 of differentiation (7 DPE), the culture media was removed, and tissues were incubated with either PSS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) or a 2.4 % wt/vol BaCl<sub>2</sub> solution diluted in PSS for a period of 4 hr (protocol adapted from previously published literature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morton et al., 2019</xref>).

The cell density was selected to match that observed in 3D myotube templates, which is ≈1273 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rescue of aged muscle stem cell quiescence defects by AKT inhibition revealed with a 3D biomimetic culture assay&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Colin Crist (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We include the following broad feedback in addition to the specific revisions requested below:</p><p>1) This is a timely contribution that demonstrates the utility of a myotube sheet biomimetic niche, in a 96 well format, to recapture some biological aspects of MuSC quiescence ex vivo. The format should provide a novel biological context within which features of MuSC quiescence can be studied.</p><p>2) The presented data does not fully capture the innovative 3D bioengineered myotube substrate, nor does it capture the advance that has been made, beyond more traditional 2D culture techniques. (The work is innovative, but the innovation is not captured by the presented data).</p><p>3) The title of the manuscript does not reflect the balance of the article. Although the authors have presented some statistically significant data showing Akt inhibition (Wortmannin) rescues aged MuSC defects in their assay, I would expect more lines of evidence, including rescue experiments in vivo, to support the authors conclusion that their assay revealed Akt inhibition as a targetable pathway to rescue aged MuSC quiescence.</p><p>4) The authors have innovated a novel in vitro assay that should be useful to assess more broadly critical MuSC stem cell properties, which would have great appeal, but the authors have somewhat restricted their analyses and interpretations to study quiescence. Experimentally, the authors could address more broadly stem cell properties including donor cell contribution to self-renewal/quiescence (as they have done) and differentiation (YFP/MYOD; YFP/myogenin; YFP/MHC). Ideally, if the 3D culture conditions maintain an adult stem cell population, mononuclear YFP cells should be reisolated and engrafted in vitro a second time, followed by their reassessment of their stem cell properties.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The data presented in Figure 1 does not capture the innovation in the work. The novel aspects of the Figure that I can appreciate are the method presented in Figure 1A (but please indicate seeding density) and the timecourse of stable myotubes present after 18 days of culture in a 96-well format, which to my knowledge cannot be achieved in 2D culture. I am unable to appreciate by the presented data the nature of the 3D myotube sheets, compared to conventional culture methods.</p><p>Suggestions: (1) present higher magnification, higher resolution images to capture greater maturity, organization and/or structural features of 3D myotube sheets. (2) Present data with direct comparison to 2D myotube cultures. Some comparison has been achieved in Figure 4, but this is a different analysis of the seeding.</p><p>2. In Figure 2, the authors provide evidence that varying numbers of donor, YFP(+), MuSCs contribute an ex vivo MuSC compartment, and quantify the numbers of YFP(+) PAX7(+) MuSCs at various timepoints after 'engraftment' (Figure 2B-D). It is not clear what happens to YFP(+) donor cells that no longer express PAX7. Do they contribute to new or existing myotubes as suggested by the illustration (Figure 2A)?</p><p>3. Figure 4 of the paper, which compares different conditions that enable persistent MuSC population in vitro, is amongst the most important Figures in the paper. In this figure, the reader can appreciate the innovation of the 3D myotube system (Figure 3C), compared to other conditions, for example 2D myotubes (Figure 3F) and ECM/cellulose only (Figure 3E). To have greater impact, I suggest a deeper analysis as has been done in other Figures, for example, quantification of PAX7, nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic projections, lack of MYOD and Ki67 immunolabeling. Please also include representative images.</p><p>4. Data presented in Figure 6 showing MuSC niche interactions is very interesting, and I appreciate the authors are pushing technology boundaries, but the description of the interactions as 'an uncommon occurrence' is problematic and it does not indicate which of the data is uncommon (N-cadherin tips or integrin/cadherin immunolabeling, or both?) I suggest quantifying the frequency of each of the observations reported in Figure 6 at minimum.</p><p>5. Figure 7A, F, G. Specifically with respect to wortmannin treatment, the authors have presented some data that is statistically significant and some data that is not statistically significant. More importantly, the biological significance of the reported data does not always support the authors conclusions.</p><p>6. If the authors want to conclude that their innovative in vitro 3D niche system led to the identification of wortmannin to rescue aged MuSC quiescence defects, greater supporting evidence is required, including critical in vivo administration of wortmannin to aging mice and a deeper analysis of rescued MuSC properties/regenerative capacity. Such an experimental revision is not necessarily required and may be beyond the scope of the work, but at minimum the authors need to reassess their conclusions and title of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81738.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We now make these goals clear in the text.</p><p>As it is established in the field that myotubes cannot be maintained in 2D culture for prolonged periods due to eventual substrate detachment, we had focused our analysis on the outcomes of the MuSCs in each condition rather than the myotubes themselves in Figure 4. However, we agree that an additional layer of insight is offered by highlighting differences between myotubes formed in our 3D model, when compared to 2D myotubes. We thus added new Figure 1—figure supplement 2 comparing myotubes cultivated in 2D as compared to 3D, showing both stitched and high-resolution images, which addresses differences in maturity by analyzing the striations through sarcomeric α-actinin staining. We’ve also updated the Results accordingly (lines 162-179).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2, the authors provide evidence that varying numbers of donor, YFP(+), MuSCs contribute an ex vivo MuSC compartment, and quantify the numbers of YFP(+) PAX7(+) MuSCs at various timepoints after 'engraftment' (Figure 2B-D). It is not clear what happens to YFP(+) donor cells that no longer express PAX7. Do they contribute to new or existing myotubes as suggested by the illustration (Figure 2A)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, which we believe we addressed in the initial submission through our experiments in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3, and as discussed in lines 250-254 and 254-266. We can see that the engrafted YFP+ Pax7+ MuSCs remain a stable population size over the 7 days (Figure 2D). At 3 DPE we note transient increase in Pax7+Ki67+ (Figure 3C), Pax7+MyoD+ (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A, Figure 5—figure supplement 4D), and Pax7- cells (Figure below, left (n=9 across N=3 biological replicates)). By 7 DPE these population proportions have reduced, and we see an accumulation YFP+ myotubes (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B), however we see no EdU+ myonuclei. From these pieces of evidence, we then concluded that some cells were directly fusing (with one another to form de novo myotubes, or with existing myotubes) while others continue to proliferate while maintaining Pax7 expression. There is yet another population of mono-nucleated Pax7- cells remaining at 7 DPE that do not appear to be MyoD+ and we speculate they are stuck in a state of terminal differentiation.</p><p>To recap, we’ve put together an illustration of our current model for explaining engrafted donor cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, right). Starting off with activated MuSCs that are engrafted, the majority immediately inactivate. Other, perhaps those too far down the activation process, directly differentiate and fuse to existing myotubes. A portion also proliferates, but again primarily exit cell-cycle and inactivate downstream, we theorize, to replace the cells lost to fusion.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81738-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4 of the paper, which compares different conditions that enable persistent MuSC population in vitro, is amongst the most important Figures in the paper. In this figure, the reader can appreciate the innovation of the 3D myotube system (Figure 3C), compared to other conditions, for example 2D myotubes (Figure 3F) and ECM/cellulose only (Figure 3E). To have greater impact, I suggest a deeper analysis as has been done in other Figures, for example, quantification of PAX7, nuclear morphology, cytoplasmic projections, lack of MYOD and Ki67 immunolabeling. Please also include representative images.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the importance of this Figure and thank them for this suggestion. Along with the population kinetics and Ki67 labelling and analysis over time that was included in the first submission, we’ve now added representative images showing the different abundance of Pax7+ and Ki67+ donor cells (Figure 4G and lines 289-290). As well, of the three conditions with a non-negligible amount of Pax7+ donor cells remaining at 7 DPE (2D, 3D myotubes, and 2D myotubes), we’ve now analyzed the morphology by reporting the max\min feret diameter ratio and nuclear eccentricity of those cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and lines 296-298 and 309-312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Data presented in Figure 6 showing MuSC niche interactions is very interesting, and I appreciate the authors are pushing technology boundaries, but the description of the interactions as 'an uncommon occurrence' is problematic and it does not indicate which of the data is uncommon (N-cadherin tips or integrin/cadherin immunolabeling, or both?) I suggest quantifying the frequency of each of the observations reported in Figure 6 at minimum.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer on this point. For the revised submission, we now quantify and report the incidence of each phenotypic observation made in Figure 6C-D (N-cad+ projections, polarized Iα7/M-cad expression) within the mononuclear donor cell population at 7 DPE. The changes are also reflected in the Results (lines 383-384 and 386-388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 7A, F, G.

We have also changed the title of our manuscript to focus more so on our model, and less on the outcomes of Figure 7.</p><p>With regards to Figure 7E-G, recent work by our collaborators (Kann et al. 2022 <italic>Cell Stem Cell,</italic> An injury-responsive Rac-to-Rho GTPase switch drives activation of muscle stem cells through rapid cytoskeletal remodeling) showed that the morphology of the MuSC reflects its activation state. We’ve also shown several lines of evidence in the context of our model that align with their findings (Figure 5D-F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 3, Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Hence, with our image analysis in our Young vs Aged studies, we sought to understand whether the aged MuSCs were attaining the same “quiescent-like morphology” we observed with young MuSCs. The aged MuSCs did not, and resembled a more activated morphology (rounded). Treatment with Wortmannin did not have a pronounced effect on this front, aside from a subtle change in nuclear eccentricity (0.75 to 0.81) which was visibly different (see 0.06 eccentricity difference example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Since changes to nuclear morphology can modulate gene expression, we felt it necessary to report in the main figure. Our findings may also help inform future studies by others as well, which justifies in our mind the inclusion of negative data. We have modified the text to tone down conclusions drawn from this study.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81738-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
