realize critical gating functions in cortical circuits, but it has been difficult to ascertain the content of gated information for well-characterized interneurons in primate cortex. Here, we address this question by characterizing putative interneurons in primate prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex while monkeys engaged in attention demanding reversal learning. We find that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have a relative suppressive effect on the local circuit indicating they are inhibitory interneurons. One of these interneuron subclasses showed prominent firing rate modulations and (35–45 Hz) gamma synchronous spiking during periods of uncertainty in both, lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In LPFC, this interneuron subclass activated when the uncertainty of attention cues was resolved during flexible learning, whereas in ACC it fired and gamma-synchronized when outcomes were uncertain and prediction errors were high during learning. Computational modeling of this interneuron-specific gamma band activity in simple circuit motifs suggests it could reflect a soft winner-take-all gating of information having high degree of uncertainty. Together, these findings elucidate an electrophysiologically characterized interneuron subclass in the primate, that forms gamma synchronous networks in two different areas when resolving uncertainty during adaptive goal-directed behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reversal learning</kwd><kwd>cognitive flexibility</kwd><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>feature-based attention</kwd><kwd>nonhuman primates</kwd><kwd>cell types</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH123687</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Womelsdorf</surname><given-names>Thilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 102482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Womelsdorf</surname><given-names>Thilo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A fast spiking interneuron sub-type in medial and lateral prefrontal cortex fires and gamma-synchronizes prominently during adaptive learning of reward values when outcomes are uncertain and choice options have similar values.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inhibitory interneurons in prefrontal cortex are frequently reported to be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases with debilitating consequences for cognitive functioning. Groups of fast spiking interneurons with basket cell or chandelier morphologies have consistently been found to be abnormal in individuals with schizophrenia and linked to dysfunctional working memory and reduced control of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dienel and Lewis, 2019</xref>). Altered functioning of a non-fast spiking interneuron class is linked to reduced GABAergic tone in individuals with severe major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Levinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fee et al., 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that the circuit functions of different subtypes of interneurons in prefrontal cortices are important to regulate specific aspects of cognitive and affective functioning.</p><p>But it has remained a challenge to identify how individual interneuron subtypes support specific cognitive or affective functions in the nonhuman primate. For rodent prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, cells with distinguishable functions express differentially cholecystokinin (CCK), parvalbumin (PV), or somatostatin (SOM), amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roux and Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cardin, 2018</xref>). Prefrontal CCK expressing basket cells have been shown to impose inhibition that is required during the choice epoch, but not during the delay epoch of a working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, retention of visual information during working memory delays has been shown to require activation specifically of PV+ expressing fast spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). In the same prefrontal circuits, the PV+ neurons have also been associated with attentional orienting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), shifting of attentional sets and response strategies during reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canetta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cho et al., 2020</xref>), and with spatial reward choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagler et al., 2016</xref>), among other functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>). Distinct from PV+, the group of somatostatin expressing neurons (SOM+) have been shown to be necessary during the initial encoding phase of a working memory task but not during the delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>), and in anterior cingulate cortex they activate specifically during the approach of reward sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Urban-Ciecko and Barth, 2016</xref>). Taken together, these findings illustrate that rodent prefrontal cortex interneurons expressing PV, SOM, or CCK fulfill separable, unique roles at different processing stages during goal-directed task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lagler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The rich insights into cell-specific circuit functions in rodent prefrontal cortices stand in stark contrast to the limited empirical data from primate prefrontal cortex. While there are recent advances using optogenetic tools for use in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gong et al., 2020</xref>), most existing knowledge about cell-specific circuit functions are indirectly inferred from studies that distinguish only one group of putative interneurons that show narrow action potential spike width. Compared to broad spiking neurons the group of narrow spiking, putative interneurons in lateral prefrontal cortex have been found to more likely encode categorical information during working memory delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Diester and Nieder, 2008</xref>), show stronger stimulus onset responses during cognitive control tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>), stronger attentional modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Thiele et al., 2016</xref>), more location-specific encoding of task rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>), stronger reduction of firing selectivity for task irrelevant stimulus features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hussar and Pasternak, 2009</xref>), stronger encoding of errors and loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sajad et al., 2019</xref>), more likely encoding of outcome history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kawai et al., 2019</xref>), and stronger encoding of feature-specific reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oemisch et al., 2019</xref>), amongst other unique firing characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Constantinidis and Goldman-Rakic, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ardid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rich and Wallis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Voloh and Womelsdorf, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>These summarized findings suggest that there are subtypes of narrow spiking neurons that are particularly important to regulate prefrontal circuit functions. But it is unclear whether these narrow spiking neurons are inhibitory interneurons and to which interneuron subclass they belong. Comparisons of protein expression with action potential spike width have shown for prefrontal cortex that &gt; 95% of all PV+ and ~ 87% of all SOM + interneurons show narrow spike width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ghaderi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>), while narrow spikes are also known to occur in ~20% of VIP interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>) among other GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krimer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zaitsev et al., 2009</xref>), and (at least in primate motor cortex) in a subgroup of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, electrophysiological characterization has shown at least three different types of firing patterns in narrow spiking neurons of monkeys during attention demanding tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ardid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasilva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Trainito et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these insights raise the possibility that spike width and electrophysiology will allow identifying the interneuron subtypes that are particularly important for prefrontal cortex functions.</p><p>Here, we investigated this possibility by recording narrow spiking cells in nonhuman primate prefrontal and cingulate cortex during an attention demanding reversal learning task. We found that in both areas three narrow spiking neuron classes are well distinguished and show a suppressive influence on the local circuit activity compared to broad spiking neurons, supporting labeling them as inhibitory interneurons. Among these interneurons the same sub-type showed significant functional correlations in both ACC and LPFC, firing stronger to reward predictive cues when their predictability is still learned during the reversal (in LPFC), and firing stronger to outcomes when they are most unexpected during reversal (in ACC). Notably, in both, ACC and LPFC, these functions were evident in 35–45 Hz gamma rhythmic synchronization to the local field potential in the same interneuron subclass.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used a color-based reversal paradigm that required subjects to learn which of two colors were rewarded as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oemisch et al., 2019</xref>). The rewarded color reversed every ~30–40 trials. Two different colors were assigned to stimuli appearing randomly left and right to a central fixation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During the task the color information was presented independently from the up-/downward- direction of motion of the stimuli. The up-/downward direction instructed the saccade direction that animals had to show to a Go event in order to receive reward. Motion was thus the cue for an overt choice (with saccadic eye movements), while color was the cue for covert selective attention. Color was shown either before (as Feature-1) or after the motion onset (as Feature-2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Both animals took on average 7/7 (monkey H/K) trials to reach criterion performance, that is, they learned which color was rewarded within seven trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The asymptotic performance accuracy was 83/86% for monkey’s H/K (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task paradigm and cell classification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Trials required animals to covertly attend one of two peripheral stimuli until a dimming (Go-event) instructed to make a saccade in the direction of the motion of the attended stimulus.

Prior biophysical modeling has shown that the extracellular action potential waveform shape, including its duration, is directly related to transmembrane currents and the intracellularly measurable action potential shape and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>). Based on this knowledge we quantified the extracellularly recorded spike duration of the inferred hyperpolarization rates and their inferred time-of-repolarizations (<italic>see</italic> Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). These measures split narrow and broad spiking neurons into a bimodal distribution (calibrated Hartigan’s dip test for bimodality, p&lt;0.001), which was better fit with two than one gaussian (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, Bayesian information criterion for two and one gaussian fit: 4.0450, 4.8784, where a lower value indicates a better model). We found in LPFC 21% neurons had narrow spikes (n = 259 broad, n = 70 narrow cells) and in ACC 17% of neurons had narrow action potentials (n = 331 broad, n = 66 narrow cells).</p><p>To assess the excitatory or inhibitory identity of the broad and narrow spiking neuron classes (<italic>B-</italic> and <italic>N-type</italic> neurons), we estimated the power of multi-unit activity (MUA) in its vicinity (at different electrodes than the spiking neuron) around the time of spiking for each cell and tested how this spike-triggered MUA-power changed before versus after the cell fired a spike (see Materials and methods). This approach expects for an excitatory neuron to spike concomitant with neurons in the local population reflected in a symmetric rise and fall of MUA before and after its spike. In contrast, inhibitory neurons are expected to spike when MUA rises, but when the spike occurs, the spike should contribute to suppress the local MUA activity, which should be reflected in a faster drop in MUA activity after the spike occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oemisch et al., 2015</xref>). We found that B-<italic>type</italic> cells showed on average a symmetric pre- to post- spike triggered MUA activity modulation indicative of excitatory participation with local activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, spikes of <italic>N-type</italic> cells were followed by a faster drop of MUA activity indicating an inhibitory influence on MUA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The excitatory and inhibitory effects on local MUA activity were consistent across the population and significantly distinguished <italic>B-</italic> and <italic>N-type</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; MUA modulation index: [(post MUA<sub>spike</sub> - pre MUA<sub>spike</sub>)/pre MUA<sub>spike</sub>] for <italic>B-</italic> vs <italic>N-type</italic> cells, Wilcoxon test, p=0.001). This distinction was evident in ACC and in LPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; for the <italic>N-type</italic> the MUA modulation index was different from zero, Wilcoxon test, in ACC, p&lt;0.001, and in LPFC, p=0.03; for B-type cells the difference was not sign.).

In LPFC gamma synchronization was evident when expected stimulus values were uncertain (reflected in low p(choice)), and in ACC gamma synchronization emerged when reward outcomes were uncertain (reflected in high RPE). In contrast, there was no gamma-band synchrony when choice probabilities were certain and reward outcomes predictable. In these trials, N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons rather showed beta synchronization to the cue (in LPFC), or theta band synchronization to the reward onset (in ACC). These findings indicate that oscillatory activity signatures inform us about the possible circuit motifs underlying uncertainty-related related computations. These computations are formally described in the reinforcement learning framework allowing us to propose a linkage of specific computations to oscillatory activity signatures and their putative circuits as proposed in the <italic>Dynamic Circuits Motif</italic> framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Womelsdorf et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>To show the feasibility of this approach we devised two circuit models that reproduces the gamma band activity signatures in LPFC and ACC using populations of inhibitory cells modeled to correspond to N3 e-type cells (for modeling details, see Appendix 1). First, we modeled a putative LPFC circuit. Here, N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons showed gamma synchronization when p(choice) was low which happens in trials in which the values of the two available objects are similar and the choice among them is difficult (<italic>see</italic> <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> in Materials and methods). We predicted in this situation gamma synchronization of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> reflects resolving competition among inputs from similarly active, pyramidal cell populations encoding the expected values of the two objects. To test whether this scenario is plausible, we conceptualized and then simulated a circuit which modelled the activity of an N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neuron population that we presumed to be PV+ fast spiking basket cells (see Discussion) activated by two excitatory pyramidal cell populations (<italic>Es</italic>) whose activity scales with the value of the stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Such an <italic>E-I</italic> network can synchronize by way of mutual inhibition at beta or gamma frequencies depending on the total amount of drive the network receives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">White et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tiesinga and José, 2000</xref>). When both stimuli have similar values and the choice probability is relatively low, the drive to the network is high and it synchronizes in the gamma band. In contrast, when one of the objects has a value that is much larger than the other which results in high choice probabilities for that stimulus, it results in a net level of drive that makes the network synchronize in the beta band. We observed such a switch from gamma to beta frequencies in N3 <italic>e-type</italic> interneurons in LPFC when the choice probabilities changed from low to high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In order to show that such gamma-to-beta switch can indeed follow from such a E-I network as a function of the diversity of inputs we ran simulations in a firing rate E-I model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Keeley et al., 2017</xref>), described in detail in Appendix 1, which reproduces the gamma-beta switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The network model simulations suggest that the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> inhibition in LPFC after color-cue onset might accomplish two functions. It leads to a normalization that transforms the object value into a choice probability (a soft winner-take-all gating of values, see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> in Materials and methods) and its gamma synchrony indexes resolving strong competition when similar excitatory drive originates from different sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical link of the observed gamma band synchronization of the N3 e-type to circuit motifs and their putative functional correlate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The N3 e-type in LPFC synchronized at gamma when p(choice) was relatively low and at beta frequencies otherwise. The switch from gamma to beta synchronization can be parsimoniously reproduced in a circuit model with an interneuron (I) population receiving inputs from two excitatory (E) populations. When the input is diverse (similar p(choice)) a simulated circuit shows gamma activity (left) while when one excitatory population dominates it engages in beta synchronization (simulation details in Appendix 1).

Such a gamma/theta switch is different to the gamma/beta switch seen in LPFC (<italic>see</italic> above). A parsimonious circuit realizing such a switch uses two separate interneuron populations (<italic>Is</italic>) that inhibit a common group of pyramidal cells (<italic>Es</italic>): A fast interneuron (<italic>I1</italic>) presumed to be PV+, corresponding to the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> (<italic>see</italic> Discussion), and a slower interneuron population (<italic>I2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). When both are reciprocally connected with an excitatory population (<italic>E</italic>), an oscillatory regime emerges whose frequency varies depending on which interneuron population receives more excitatory drive (details in Appendix 1). When the <italic>I1</italic> population receives stronger drive, gamma frequency synchronization dominates the network, while a relatively stronger drive to the <italic>I2</italic> population causes neurons in the network to switch to slower, theta band synchronization. We documented this gamma/theta switching result in simulations of firing rate neurons in detail in the Appendix 1. The activity signatures of this E-I-I model resembles the empirical activity signatures. The theta synchronous activity that reflects the activity of <italic>I2</italic> neurons corresponds to low RPE trials, in which a reward <italic>R</italic> is received and the value V of the chosen stimulus was relatively high (a high <italic>V</italic> and a large <italic>R</italic>, the RPE is computed as<italic> = R-</italic>V) (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> in Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the gamma synchronous state that emerged with larger drive to the <italic>I1</italic> neurons in the model corresponds to high RPE trials, in which a reward <italic>R</italic> is received, but the value <italic>V</italic> of the chosen stimulus was relatively low. This circuit motif is plausible when one assumes that the <italic>I1</italic> neuron population is disinhibited when the chosen stimulus value is low. Such a disinhibition can be achieved by lowering the drive to <italic>I2</italic> cells (which may require high values to be activated), or by assuming a separate disinhibitory circuit (for details see Appendix 1). In summary, the E-I-I motif reproduces the switch of gamma to theta synchronization we observed in ACC N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons. At the functional level, the circuit suggests that the emergence of gamma activity in this network indexes the detection of a mismatch between the received reward (as one source of excitation) and the chosen stimulus value (as another source of excitation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>The described circuits provide proofs-of-concept that the synchronization patterns we observed in the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> interneurons in ACC and LPFC during periods of uncertain values and outcomes can originate from biologically realistic circuits. The results justify future studies generating and testing quantitative predictions that can be derived from these circuit motifs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that narrow spiking neurons in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex of macaques cause a fast drop of local multiunit activity indicative of inhibitory interneurons. These putative interneurons in LPFC showed increased firing rates to the color-cue onset, encoded the rewarded color and correlated their rates with the choice probabilities, while in ACC their firing correlated with reward prediction errors during the processing of the reward outcome. These functional signatures were specifically linked to a putative interneuron subtype (<italic>N3</italic>) that showed intermediate narrow action potential waveforms and more regular firing patterns than expected from a Poisson process (LVs of N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons: 0.84). Moreover, this putative interneuron (N3) <italic>e-type</italic> engaged in prominent event-triggered 35–45 Hz gamma band synchronization in each of the recorded brain areas. In LPFC, the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> synchronized at gamma to the cue when choice probabilities were low and uncertain, and in ACC the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> synchronized at gamma to the reward onset when the RPE was high and the reward outcome was unexpected. Thus, the same <italic>e-type</italic> showed functional firing correlations and gamma synchrony in LPFC and in ACC during periods of uncertainty about cues and outcomes, respectively. Taken together, these findings point to a special role of the same type of interneuron in LPFC and in ACC to realize their area specific functional contribution to the color-based reversal learning task. This interpretation highlights several aspects of interneuron specific circuit functions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Characterizing narrow spiking interneurons in vivo</title><p>The first implication of our findings is that narrow spiking neurons can be reliably subdivided in three subtypes based on their electrophysiological firing profiles. Distinguishing three narrow spiking neurons in vivo during complex task performance is a significant step forward to complement previous electrophysiological distinctions of three interneuron types in-vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zaitsev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>) or in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ardid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasilva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shin and Moore, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Banaie Boroujeni et al., 2020b</xref>), and complementing the finer-grained electrophysiological characterization of ‘<italic>e-types</italic>’ in-vitro that has been achieved with a rich battery of current injection patterns that are difficult to apply in the awake and behaving primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monyer and Markram, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Medalla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). This in vitro ‘<italic>e-typing’</italic> has distinguished eleven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Markram et al., 2015</xref>) or thirteen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>) distinct interneuron <italic>e-types</italic> in rodent somatosensory and mouse visual cortex, respectively. In the visual cortex, these classes entailed six fast spiking subclasses showing variably transient, sustained or pause-delay response patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the fast spiking interneuron classes in that study were characterized by a low coefficient of variation (CV), low bursting reflective of a low Local Variability (LV), and a feature-importance analysis showed that the narrow action potential width and firing rate of these neurons were most diagnostic for separating the fast spiking from other neuron classes (Figure 2i, S9, and S14 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). Our study used these diagnostic metrics (LV, CV, AP width and rate) directly for the clustering because we do not have the current injection responses available and distinguished three interneurons in the monkey compared to six fast spiking interneuron <italic>e-types</italic> in the mouse study. These results illustrate that our three interneuron <italic>e-types</italic> will encompass further subclasses that future studies should aim to distinguish in order to narrow the gap between the in vivo <italic>e-types</italic> that we and others report in the monkey, and the in-vitro <italic>e-types</italic> in the rodents that are more easily mapped onto specific molecular, morphological and genetic make-ups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). As a caveat, this mapping of cell types between species might also reveal cell classes and unique cell class characteristics in nonhuman primate cortices that are not similarly evident in rodents as recently demonstrated in a cross-species study of non-fast spiking gamma rhythmic neurons in early visual cortex that were exclusively evident in the primate and not in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Onorato et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>With regard to the specific interneuron <italic>e-types</italic> we believe that the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> that showed functional correlations in two areas encompasses mostly parvalbumin PV+ expressing neurons, because of their narrow spikes, regular inter-spike intervals and their propensity to synchronize at gamma, which resemble the regular firing and gamma synchrony described for PV+ cells in the rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tiesinga, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amilhon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, similar to the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> responses to the attention cue, rodent dorsomedial frontal PV+ neurons systematically activate to preparatory cues while somatostatin neurons respond significantly less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>). However, PV+ neurons are heterogeneous and entail Chandelier cells and variably sized basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Markram et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Markram et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gouwens et al., 2019</xref>). It might therefore be an important observation that the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> was distinguished from other narrow spiking neurons by having a lower firing rate and an intermediate-narrow action potential shape as opposed to the narrowest waveform and highest firing rates that N1 <italic>e-types</italic> showed. The proposed tentative suggestion that N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons will be mostly PV+ cells also entails for the primate brain that they would not be part of calretinin (CR+) or calbindin (CB+) expressing cells as their expression profiles do not apparently overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dombrowski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Medalla and Barbas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raghanti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is the circuit role of the N3 interneuron <italic>e-type</italic>?</title><p>Assuming that N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons are partly PV+ neurons, we speculate that this translates into gamma rhythmic inhibition of local circuit pyramidal cells close to their soma where they impose output gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tiesinga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Womelsdorf et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). In our task, such local inhibition was linked to how uncertain the expected values of stimuli were (reflected in low choice probabilities) or how unexpected reward outcomes were (reflected in high RPE’s). These conditions are periods that require a behavioral adaptation for which N3 <italic>e-type</italic> mediated inhibition could be instrumental. For example, in LPFC pyramidal cells that encoded the rewarded color in trials prior to the un-cued reversal become irrelevant when the reversal links reward to the alternative color and hence need to be suppressed during the reversal. This suppression of neurons encoding the previously relevant but now irrelevant color might be realized through activation of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neuron. Similarly, the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> activation in ACC reflects a rise in inhibition when an unexpected outcome (high RPE) is detected. This activation might therefore facilitate the updating of value expectations to reduce future prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oemisch et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The described, putative functions of N3 e-type activity provide direct suggestions on how they might contribute to transform inputs to outputs in a neural circuit. To understand this process, we devised and simulated circuit models of the activity signatures of inhibitory cells for the LPFC and the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, Appendix 1). For LPFC, we devised an E-E-I circuit where the interneuron (I) population synchronized at gamma when the excitatory drive of two E-cell populations was similar (Appendix 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). This situation mimics the situation when the values of two objects are similar, resulting in a low choice probability. According to this circuit, the function of I cells that putatively correspond to the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons in LPFC is twofold. They normalize the activity of the excitatory cells, and they are instrumental in gating the activity of one over the other excitatory cell population when there is competition among them. Such competition arises specifically when choice probabilities are low because the low p(choice) indicates that the expected values of the stimuli to choose from are similar which makes a choice difficult. We therefore speculate that the putative circuit function of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> cells in LPFC is the gating of competing excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).</p><p>For ACC, we devised an E-I-I circuit where the population of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> putatively corresponded to one population of fast spiking inhibitory neurons (<italic>I1</italic>) that synchronized to gamma when receiving stronger excitatory drive than another population of slower inhibitory neurons (<italic>I2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The enhanced excitation of the <italic>I1</italic> over the <italic>I2</italic> population was modeled to correspond to trials with high RPE, which occurred when a reward (<italic>R</italic>) was received but the expected value (<italic>V</italic>) of the chosen stimulus was relatively low (a large RPE defined as the difference of <italic>R-V</italic>). In this situation, a stronger excitatory drive and consequently a gamma synchronous activity, could follow from disinhibiting the <italic>I1</italic> population. Such a disinhibition could originate from reduced inhibition from the <italic>I2</italic> cells in trials with low stimulus value, or it could originate from disinhibition from other neurons. These scenarios deserve explicit testing in future studies (for further discussion, see Appendix 1). They gain plausibility from anatomical studies that report that a large proportion of connections to interneurons go to disinhibitory interneurons that express calretinin and are distinct from the fast-spiking PV+ neurons that more likely entail the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Medalla and Barbas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Medalla and Barbas, 2010</xref>). In summary, the proposed circuit model for the ACC suggests that the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons activate when there is a mismatch of reward and chosen value. Activation of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons may thus be a (bio-) marker that predictions need to be updated to improve future performance.</p><p>We acknowledge that the proposed circuit models represent merely a proof-of-concept that says that the neuronal activities can originate in reasonable and previously described E-I motifs. They are not full biophysical implementations of the actual reversal learning task and entail finer predictions that await quantitative testing in future studies. They motivate combined electrophysiological and optogenetic studies in the primate to clarify cell-type-specific circuit functions during higher cognitive operations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Interneuron-specific gamma synchronization: Comparison to previous studies</title><p>Two major findings of our study pertain to spike-LFP gamma band synchronization. First, we found that N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons showed an event-triggered synchrony increase in the same 35–45 Hz gamma frequency band in both LPFC and ACC when there was uncertainty about the correct choice (low p(choice) or about the outcomes (high RPE) [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8F</xref>]). Synchronization of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> switched from a gamma frequency to the beta frequency in LPFC when the choices became more certain, and to the theta frequency in ACC when outcomes became more certain. An intrinsic propensity for generating gamma rhythmic activity through, for example GABA<sub>a</sub>ergic time constant, is well described for PV+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Womelsdorf et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) and is a documented activity signature even at moderate excitatory feedforward drive that might be more typical for prefrontal cortices than earlier visual cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vinck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shin and Moore, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Onorato et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that narrow spiking interneurons are the main carriers of gamma rhythmic activity in nonhuman primate prefrontal cortex during cue and outcomes processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Whittington et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hasenstaub et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hasenstaub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shin and Moore, 2019</xref>). This conclusion resonates well with rodent studies that document how interneurons in infra-/peri-limbic and cingulate cortex engage in gamma synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cho et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The second major implication of the gamma synchronous N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons is that gamma band synchrony was associated with task epochs in which neural circuits realize a circuit function that can be considered to be ‘area specific’. In LPFC, the gamma increase was triggered by the color-cue onset of two peripherally presented stimuli that instructed covertly shifting attention. Our circuit model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) illustrates that cue related gamma was restricted to periods when object values were similar, and the animal still learned which object is most reward predictive. The control of learning what is relevant during cognitively demanding tasks is a key function of the LPFC, suggesting that gamma activity emerges when this key function is called upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szczepanski and Knight, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cho et al., 2020</xref>). A similar scenario holds for the ACC whose central function is often considered to monitor and evaluate task performance and detect when outcomes should trigger a change in behavioral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heilbronner and Hayden, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander and Brown, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>). In ACC, the gamma increase was triggered by an unexpected, rewarded outcome (high RPE). Thus, the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> specific gamma band signature occurred specifically in those trials with conflicting stimulus values requiring behavioral control to reduce the prediction errors through future performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Considering this ACC finding together with the LPFC finding suggests that gamma activity of N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons indexes a key function of these brain areas, supporting recent causal evidence from rodent optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cho et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with the proposed importance of interneurons for area-specific key functions prior studies have documented the functional importance of inhibition in these circuits. Blocking inhibition with GABA antagonists like bicuculline not only renders fast spiking interneurons nonselective during working memory tasks but abolishes the spatial tuning of regular spiking (excitatory) cells during working memory tasks in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sawaguchi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rao et al., 2000</xref>), disturbs accuracy in attention tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paine et al., 2011</xref>) and reduces set shifting flexibility by enhancing perseveration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Enomoto et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, abnormally enhancing GABAa levels via muscimol impairs working memory and set shifting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rich and Shapiro, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Urban et al., 2014</xref>) and can result in either maladaptive impulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Paine et al., 2015</xref>), and when applied in anterior cingulate cortex to perseveration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amiez et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, altered medial and lateral prefrontal cortex inhibition is closely linked to an inability to adjust attentional strategies given unexpected outcomes. This evidence supports our studies suggestion of the importance of inhibitory neuron involvement in resolving uncertainties during adaptive behaviors.</p><p>Taken together, our interneuron-specific findings in primate LPFC and ACC stress the importance of interneurons to influence circuit activity beyond a mere balancing of excitation. Multiple theoretical accounts have stressed that some types of interneurons ‘control information flow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>), by imposing important filters for synaptic inputs to an area and gain-control the output from that area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akam and Kullmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Womelsdorf et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Roux and Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cardin, 2018</xref>). Testing these important circuit functions of interneurons has so far been largely limited to studies using molecular tools. Our study addresses this limitation by characterizing putative interneurons, delineating their suppressive effects on the circuit and highlighting their functional activation during reversal learning. The observed interneuron-specific, gamma synchronous coding of choice probabilities and prediction errors lends strong support to study cell-type-specific circuit mechanisms of higher cognitive functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal care and experimental protocols were approved by the York University Council on Animal Care (ethics protocol 2015–15 R2) and were in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>Data was collected from two male rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) from the anterior cingulate cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex as described in full in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oemisch et al., 2019</xref>.

Stimuli were 2.0° radius wide block sine gratings with rounded-off edges, moving within a circular aperture at 0.8 °/s and a spatial frequency of 1.2 (cycles/°). Color-reward associations were reversed without cue after 30 trials or until a learning criterion was reached, which makes this task a color-based reversal learning task.</p><p>Each trial began with the appearance of a gray central fixation point, which the monkey had to fixate. After 0.5–0.9 s, two black/white gratings appeared to the left and right of the central fixation point. Following another 0.4 s the two stimulus gratings either changed color to green and red (monkey K: cyan and yellow), or they started moving in opposite directions up and down, followed after 0.5–0.9 s by the onset of the second stimulus feature that had not been presented so far, for example if after 0.4s the grating stimuli changed color then after another 0.5–0.9 s they started moving in opposite directions. After 0.4–1 s either the red and green stimulus dimmed simultaneously for 0.3 s or they dimmed separated by 0.55 s, whereby either the red or green stimulus could dim first. The dimming of the rewarded stimulus represented the GO cue to make a saccade to one of two response targets displayed above and below the central fixation point. The dimming of the no-rewarded stimulus thus represented a NO-GO cue triggering the withholding of a response and waiting until the rewarded stimulus dimmed. The monkeys had to keep central fixation until this dimming event occurred.</p><p>A saccadic response following the dimming was rewarded if it was made to the response target that corresponded to the (up- or down-ward) movement direction of the stimulus with the color that was associated with reward in the current block of trials, for example if the red stimulus was the currently rewarded target and was moving upward, a saccade had to be made to the upper response target at the time the red stimulus dimmed. A saccadic response was not rewarded if it was made to the response target that corresponded to the movement direction of the stimulus with the non-reward associated color. Hence, a correct response to a given stimulus must match the motion direction of that stimulus as well as the timing of the dimming of that stimulus. This design ensures the animal could not anticipate the time of dimming of the current target stimulus (which could occur before, after, or at the same time as the second stimulus), and thus needed to attend continuously until the ‘Go-signal’ (dimming) of that stimulus occurred. If dimming of the target stimulus occurred after dimming of the second/distractor stimulus, the animal had to ignore dimming of the second stimulus and wait for dimming of the target stimulus. A correct response was followed by 0.33 ml of water reward.</p><p>The color-reward association remained constant for 30 to a maximum of 100 trials. Performance of 90% rewarded trials (calculated as running average over the last 12 trials) automatically induced a block change. The block change was un-cued, requiring monkeys to use the trial’s reward outcome to learn when the color-reward association was reversed. Reward was delivered deterministically.</p><p>In contrast to color, other stimulus features (motion direction and stimulus location) were only randomly related to reward outcome – they were pseudo-randomly assigned on every trial. This task ensured that behavior was guided by attention to one of two colors, which was evident in monkeys choosing the stimulus with the same color following correct trials with 89.5% probability (88.7%/90.3% for monkey H/K), which was significantly different from chance (t-test, both p&lt;0.0001).</p><p>Monkeys performed the task at 83/86% (monkey’s H/K) accuracy (excluding fixation break errors).

This framework entails a state equation that describes the internal learning process as a hidden Markov or latent process and is updated with each trial. The learning state process estimates the probability of a correct (rewarded) choice in each trial and thus provides the learning curve of subjects. The algorithm estimates learning from the perspective of an ideal observer that takes into account all trial outcomes of subjects’ choices in a block of trials to estimate the probability that the single trial outcome is reward or no reward. This probability is then used to calculate the confidence range of observing a rewarded response. We identified a ‘Learning Trial’ as the earliest trial in a block at which the lower confidence bound of the probability for a correct response exceeded the p=0.5 chance level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reinforcement learning modeling to estimate choice probability and expected value of color</title><p>The color reversal task required monkeys to learn from trial outcomes when the color reward association reversed to the alternate color.

First, detected peaks had to be Rayleigh test significant (p&lt;0.05), to reject the homogeneity hypothesis of the phase distribution. Second, each peak had to have PPC value greater than 0.005. Third, each peak had to have peak prominence of at least 0.0025 from its neighboring minima to disregard locally noisy and possibly spurious PPC peaks. Fourth, detected peaks had to have PPC value greater than 25% of PPC range.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis on the class-specific PPC peak distribution</title><p>To determine whether clusters show significant proportion of PPC peaks in a specific frequency band, 1000 samples with the same size to each class was selected from the population of neurons.

The distribution of peak proportion for each class was then compared with identified 95% confidence interval of the population of samples.

To investigate class-specific event response, we used a permutation approach and randomly selected 1000 samples with a class size same as each class. We then constructed a distribution of mean samples under the null hypothesis that no class show event response different than sample population. Cell classes that showed significantly different response than the population were then identified in a duration that they show response more extreme than two standard deviation from the population of samples.

First, we divided trials into two groups of high and low RPE and p(choice) values (trials were assigned based on their median value for each experimental session). Then, for each neuron, RPE, and p(choice)condition we extracted spikes and their phase synchronization to the LFP in different frequencies (4–80 Hz, 1 Hz resolution) by applying Fourier transform on a hanning-tapered LFP signal (±2.5 frequency cycles around each spike). Then we computed the PPC for moving windows of ±350 ms every 50 ms around the outcome onset (for RPE) and around color onset (for p(choice)). We included only neurons with at least 50 spikes across trials, using on average 44 (SE 2) trials. To control for spike number, we repeated the procedure 500 times with a random subsample of 50 spikes of a neuron for each window before computing the PPC. For each neuron, behavioral condition, and window we calculated the average PPC over the random subsamples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis of time-resolved spike-LFP coherence for putative interneurons and broad spiking neurons</title><p>Statistics on the time-resolved coherence was computed in two steps. In the first step, we tested for each post-event time window the null hypothesis that <italic>N3-type</italic> neurons and broad spiking neurons showed similar spike-LFP synchronization strength after the event onset compared to the time windows prior to the event. To test this, we first normalized the time resolved coherence for each neuron to the baseline coherence (−850 ms to 0 ms) before reward or attention-cue onset (in ACC and PFC, respectively). We then randomly selected 1000 sample of neurons from the population with the same size as neurons in class N3 and broad cells under the null hypothesis that N3 class and broad spiking neurons do not show different synchronization pattern triggered by event onset compared with population. For each sample, we extracted the 95% CIs, and over the population of samples we extracted the most extreme 5% of the previously extracted CIs and set the final 95% multiple comparison corrected confidence intervals. We then found the average of normalized PPC values for N3 class and broad spiking neurons in a time period and frequency domain that were more extreme than the defined confidence intervals. The area of significance then was shown by black contours. In the second step, we asked whether N3 class neurons show different average synchrony strength over a time window of (0 ms 500 ms) aligned windows to the attention-cue onset (in PFC and for high and low Choice Probability conditions) and to the reward onset (in ACC and for high and low Reward Prediction Error conditions). We randomly selected 1000 sampgles, with the same size as N3 class, from broad spiking neurons and computed their average pre-onset normalized synchrony in the defined post-onset period. We then constructed the most 5% extreme values of 95% confidence intervals defined over 1000 samples and across frequencies under the null hypothesis that N3 class cells do not show different synchrony strength from broad spiking cells in the post-onset time period and across different frequencies. We set the confidence interval levels and selected frequency bands more extreme than the CIs as significantly different (multiple comparison adjusted alpha level = 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Analysis of spike-LFP synchronization controlled for event evoked LFP</title><p>This analysis controls that the synchronization results are not confounded by event evoked LFP signals. First, we extracted the LFP aligned to the color cue and the reward onset on each individual trial and averaged it in a −0.5 to 1 s window around the onset of the color cue and reward onset, respectively. We then removed the average event evoked LFP from individual trials. We then repeated the above-described synchronization and statistical analysis on the event evoked LFP subtracted trials. Subtraction of event-evoked LFPs did not change the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis of functional spike-LFP gamma synchronization for neuron types</title><p>We analyzed how distribution of PPC values for each e-type is different from the other e-type in high and low RPE/p(choice) conditions. For each area, we extracted average PPC value for each neuron and conditions in frequency range 35–45 Hz. We used Kruskal Wallis test to see whether neuron types show different synchronization patterns. Lastly, we performed multiple comparison (Tukey-Kramer corrected) to see whether any of the classes is different from the others. These analyses were done separately for each area and each behavioral condition. No significant differences were observed between more certain conditions (high p(choice) and low RPE). Consistent with time resolved results, only N3 class showed stronger gamma synchrony in low p(choice) condition in LPFC, and high RPE condition in ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Analysis of narrow vs. broad and cell class-specific firing correlations with reversal learning</title><p>To investigate whether firing rate of cells correlate with the learning state, we performed correlation analysis between firing rate of single neurons and model parameters: probability of chosen stimulus (choice probability, p<sub>(choice)</sub>), and positive Reward Prediction Error (RPE<sub>pos</sub>). For the correlation analysis, we excluded neurons that had less than 30 trials of neural activity. For each neuron, the event onset response was normalized to the mean of all trials’ pre-onset firing (in a period of −0.5 s to the event onset) and was divided by the standard deviation of all in that period. We then computed for each neuron the Spearman correlation coefficient between p<sub>(choice)</sub> values and then normalized firing rate in a moving window ±200 ms with sliding increments of 25 ms relative to the Color-Cue onset. We used the same procedure for the reward-onset mean of normalized firing rate and RPE<sub>pos</sub> values. To test whether narrow and broad spiking neurons correlate their firing rate differently to model values, we randomly shuffled cell labels and constructed a distribution of 1000 differences of the mean correlations of randomly assigned neurons to the broad and narrow groups under the null hypothesis that there is no difference in correlations depending on the spike waveform group. We then computed the most extreme 5% of the sample difference of means through their time course and identified the 95% confidence interval to test our null hypothesis. We also tested whether cells of different cell classes showed different correlations of firing rate and p(choice) or RPE<sub>pos</sub>. using the Kruskal-Wallis test considering cell class as the grouping variable. To test which class shows correlations different than the population mean, we randomly shuffled cell class labels 1000 times and computed the mean difference between each randomly labeled cell class and the population. We then constructed a distribution of mean difference samples under the null hypothesis that no class shows a mean correlation different from the population mean. We then computed the top 5% of samples and identified 95% confidence interval. Classes that showed a mean difference of correlation to the population more extreme than the identified CI were marked as significant. All mentioned procedures were performed separately for neurons in area ACC and PFC and for both, p<sub>(choice)</sub> or RPE<sub>pos</sub> values. In addition to the correlations of firing rate and p(choice), and firing rate and RPE<sub>pos</sub>, we also calculated the time resolved correlation of neurons firing rate with number of trials since reversal. We found that B-type and N-type neurons in LPFC and in ACC did not change their firing differently as a function of the raw trial count since reversal. The lack of correlation with trial number was true for the color cue period and the reward period of the task (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Training classifiers for predicting cell classes from their correlations with learning variables</title><p>We used a machine learning approach to test how accurately cells can be labeled to a cell class based on their functional properties. For training classifiers, we used correlation of cells firing rate and RPE/p(choice) separately for areas LPFC and ACC. We test whether functional correlation of cells activity in a class allows to reliably classify them into the true class label (from the k-means clustering) or in alternate classes. We used multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) with one to one comparison of identified cell-classes with 10 folds of cross validation. A vector of correlation values (each element representing one neuron) was used along with a vector of cluster labels (from our clustering results) to train the SVM. The classifier used a Gaussian radial basis function kernel with a scaling factor of 1. For each classifier, only classes were considered that contained ≥5 cells and each unique cluster was present in all folds. As classes N1 and N2 did not meet the criteria, we excluded them from the classifier and instead randomly distributed them to other classes (weighted by the size of classes) as an internal noise factor. For each learning measure (RPE and p(choice)) and for each area (LPFC and ACC), we subsampled each cluster with a size equal to the half of the minimum size of clusters ensuring an equal cell number from clusters in each subsample. We constructed the confusion matrix as the ratio of outcome matrix to the total count across all 1000 subsamples test and performed a binomial test (FDR-corrected p&lt;0.05) to find cells of the confusion matrix that are significantly greater than the chance level (chance level here was defined by one divide by the number of classes). Prediction of classifiers on correlation of LPFC rate and RPE, and ACC rate and p(choice) were closed to the chance level (not shown). However, in ACC N3 class was predictable with an accuracy of 0.34 from its correlation with RPE, and in LPFC, N3 class was predictable with an accuracy of 0.31 from its correlation with p(choice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Analysis of the information coding cells for the rule identity and target location</title><p>To determine what proportion of neurons relative to the Color-Cue onsets as well as Reward/Error outcome onsets systematically carry information about the rule identity (Red vs. Green), or target location (Left vs. Right), we considered neurons we had at least 20 trials for each condition. We used a moving window of ±200 ms with sliding increments of 25 ms relative to the Cue-onset or Error/Reward outcome onsets. For each window, we performed the nonparametric rank sum test between the two of conditions under the null hypothesis that neurons do not fire preferentially different to a specific color or location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For Narrow and Broad spiking neurons, we computed the proportion of neurons that showed statistically significant firing rate (p&lt;0.05) to each condition. We then randomly shuffled the proportion amounts of significantly different firing neurons over the time course and computed 95% CI under the null hypothesis that each group of neurons do not show proportionally different number of neurons compared to the pre-onset population of proportion values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Analysis of cell class firing statistics measures</title><p>For each of firing statistic measures (firing rate, local variation, and coefficient of variance), we performed nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with cell class as grouping variable to test for a main effect of cell class on each firing statistics.

For each waveform-grouped neuron, we randomly shuffled their labels and computed the difference of PPC peak proportions between neurons that their firing rate were significantly correlated with learning state and those that were not significantly correlated. We constructed a distribution of 1000 randomly selected samples of difference of proportions of PPC peaks under the null hypothesis that for each waveform grouped neurons there is no significant difference in the proportion PPC peaks for neurons that their firing rate were significantly correlated with learning values and those that were not significantly correlated. We then identified the most extreme 5% of the peak proportion difference and computed 95% CI over the population of samples.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Mariann Oemisch and Ali Hassani for help with the study.

Each motif can create its own oscillation, but when one circuit is dominant it takes over the other circuit and imposes its frequency. We assume that interneuron population I1 corresponds to PV neurons because they have a faster dynamics. We simulate the case of rewarded trials, which means that the RPE is low when the expected value is high, whereas when the RPE is high the expected value is low. We further assume that the value-associated drive to I1 is part of a disinhibitory circuit, that is, it is an inhibitory input to I1 that reflects the expected value. In other words, when RPE varies from low to high values, the drive to I1 varies from low to high.</p></sec><sec id="s10-2"><title>3.2 Model equations for the E-I-I circuit model</title><p>The network is simulated using the same modeling framework as in 2.2 (<italic>above</italic>), but now there are two I populations, I1, I2, and only one E population, hence the vectors are changed in an obvious way: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>; and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1,1</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>;<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.5,5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>45</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2.5,5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>4,3</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>.

Discussion of circuit motifs, relation to other models and experiment</title><p>The E-E-I motif provides a proof of principle for the link between diversity of input and oscillation frequency (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We increased the drive to E1 and reduced it to E2 in such a way that the sum remained constant and studied the oscillation frequency of the I population. The situation with high drive to E1 and low drive to E2 (and vice versa) corresponds to a situation with diverse inputs which happens in a reversal block after learning of values is completed (in the ‘steady state’) and one object has high value and the other object a low value. In this regime oscillations are prominent in the beta frequency range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). But when the drive of the E1 and E2 populations is similar, indexing the situation of low p(choice), i.e. when it is near 0.5, the I population increased its oscillation frequency to the gamma range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, in the model, competition between two similarly-valued objects that results in a low choice probability is indexed by gamma oscillations of the inhibitory cell population, while otherwise beta synchrony predominates. This result matches the core oscillatory signature we observed in the LPFC around the color cue onset. It suggests that the transient gamma increase of the N3 <italic>e-type</italic> might reflect the gating of diverse inputs as has been suggested by larger-scale modeling of similar circuit motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buia and Tiesinga, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sherfey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sherfey et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The second circuit that implemented a E-I-I model provides a proof of principle for the link between the increased activation of a ‘fast’ interneuron population (I1) and a switch from theta to gamma oscillations. Here, theta synchronous activity driven by the I2 neurons corresponds to low RPE trials (after learning of values is completed), in which a reward R is received and the value V of the chosen stimulus was relatively high (a high V and a large R, the RPE is computed as R - V) (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> in Materials and methods of main text) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the gamma synchronous state that emerges with larger drive to the I1 neurons in the model correspond to high RPE trials, in which a reward R is received, but the value of the chosen stimulus was relatively low (low V). This circuit motif is plausible when one assumes that the I1 neuron population is disinhibited when the chosen stimulus value is low. Such a disinhibition can be achieved by lowering the drive to I2 cells, or by assuming a separate disinhibitory circuit involving other inhibitory cells. In the model simulation we only explored the former assumption. In summary, the E-I-I motif reproduces the switch of gamma to theta synchronization we observed during learning in ACC N3 <italic>e-type</italic> neurons. At the functional level, the circuit suggests that the emergence of gamma activity in this network indexes the detection of a discrepancy between the received reward (as one source of input) and the chosen stimulus value (as another source of input).</p><p>The oscillation frequency observed in these two models was not directly related to biophysical time scales, such as, synaptic or membrane time scales or rate constants for the opening and closing of ionic channels, as would be the case in models based on Hodgkin-Huxley type channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tiesinga et al., 2001</xref>), rather it was achieved by the product of the two effective time scales (firing rate and synaptic) in the model. Therefore, these models serve as a proof of principle, indicating how populations may be wired up to produce oscillations with different frequencies, but they can not make conclusive predictions regarding the dynamics of the underlying interneurons, that is, whether they are PV or SOM, or what type of spike patterns they produce. For this type of insight proper network models composed of biophysical models need to be constructed. Nevertheless, we think it is reasonable to identify faster interneuron populations with PV+ interneurons given prior modeling studies (see next paragraph), and thereby putatively link them to the N3 <italic>e-type (see</italic> also Discussion of the main text).</p><p>Similar reservations hold for the mechanism by which oscillations are generated, such as for instance ING versus PING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Whittington et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tiesinga and Sejnowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tiesinga, 2012</xref>). Model 1 is functionally a soft winner-take-all model, but the oscillations could emerge by way of an ING motif, potentially heterogeneously activated, when individual interneurons receive a different mix of inputs from E1 and E2. Previous simulations by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wang and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">White et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tiesinga and José, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tiesinga and Sejnowski, 2004</xref>) show that this would be feasible. Model 2 is comprised of two competing E-I motifs, which our recent simulations indicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Domhof and Tiesinga, 2021</xref>) could implement switches when one motif is more strongly activated than the other. Our simulations do not exclude the possibility that the I1 population synchronizes by the ING mechanism, but it would in our opinion represent a less parsimonious explanation.</p><p>The involvement of ING and PING mechanisms for beta and gamma oscillations are well-established. For theta oscillations other mechanisms have also been proposed, for instance by way of intrinsic membrane resonance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hutcheon and Yarom, 2000</xref>) in the pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tiesinga et al., 2001</xref>) activated by neuromodulatory tone or in a specific type of interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rotstein et al., 2005</xref>), which do need to be reciprocally connected to a fast interneuron for the theta oscillations to emerge. In other models slower synaptic time scales were instrumental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">White et al., 2000</xref>). As resonance mechanisms were not explicitly modeled, our model simulations do not directly speak to whether the empirical findings rely on resonance properties. We can therefore not conclusively exclude them until a more comprehensive modeling study is conducted that not only takes into account synaptic time scales but also the intrinsic dynamics of all the involved neuron classes together with their task-dependent firing rate dynamics. A comprehensive review of cortical rhythms and their mechanisms can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wang, 2010</xref>.</p></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69111.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Haegens</surname><given-names>Saskia</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper will be of interest to system neuroscientists studying reinforcement learning, as well as neuroscientists in the field of brain rhythms. The work sheds new light on the specialization of individual cell types in the cortex of animals engaged in a challenging task. The authors combine many different techniques (single-cell recordings, clustering of cell types, behavioral modeling, spike-field coherence) in order to understand the differential contributions of subclasses of cell types to cortical computations during a reversal-learning task. The questions asked by the authors in this paper are interesting and their treatment is thorough, with many controls. As a result, this work is a valuable addition to the field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Interneuron Specific Gamma Synchrony Indexes Cue Uncertainty and Prediction Errors in Prefrontal and Cingulate Cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. While we found the work overall potentially interesting, and the reviewers each found merit in particular elements, several major concerns were raised regarding key components (including the computational model and the focus on the N3 subtype). You will find these detailed in the reviews attached below.</p><p>In its current state, the paper tries many things at once (neuron subtype clustering, reward processing, computational modeling), which by itself is laudable, but as it stands it is coming short at tying these aspects together.</p><p>We are not inviting a revision because the amount of work we consider required is too extensive. However, given there was considerable interest in elements of the work, we want to point out you are free to decide to rework the current manuscript into a new version and submit this new manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>. Note that if you choose to submit a new manuscript it would go through the regular process again (i.e., consideration by editors) and if selected to be sent out for review could potentially go back to the same reviewers and/or new ones.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Boroujeni et al. recorded extracellular spikes from single neurons in brain areas LPFC and ACC in two awake behaving macaques that were performing a reward reversal learning task. They classified the recorded neurons into various subtypes, and investigated how neuronal activity in these different subtypes related to the variables of the behavioural task.</p><p>The paper's clear and primary strength is the classification of extracellularly recorded neurons into broad- and narrow-spiking neurons, and even further into subtypes of these two classes. While a split based purely on spike waveform shape into broad- and narrow-spiking is relatively common, the cluster-based classification into subtypes based on various additional parameters like spike variability is novel and potentially illuminating. The authors furthermore convincingly demonstrate that the recorded narrow-spiking neurons (often labelled &quot;putative inhibitory interneurons&quot;) are indeed likely inhibitory in nature, by showing that the net effect of a spike in these cells on the surrounding population spike rate is negative. The analysis choices in this part of the paper were clear, well-motivated, and well-presented.</p><p>However, the bulk of the paper is taken up by the relationship between neuronal spiking and variables from the behavioural task, specifically choice probability (p(choice)) and reward prediction error (RPE). Here, the conclusions appear not backed up by the data, for several reasons.</p><p>First of all, the authors only present results for correlations with RPE in the reward window, and results for correlations with p(choice) in the stimulus windows. One of the main conclusions of the paper is that LPFC neurons code for p(choice) whereas ACC neurons code for RPE. However, correlations with RPE in the stimulus windows and p(choice) in the reward window are never shown. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that, purely given the task structure, RPE and p(choice) are almost perfectly negatively correlated (r = -0.928, Figure S4). It is therefore very possible that the crucial split is not between p(choice) and RPE as the determinant of neural activity, but simply the time window in which these are analyzed.</p><p>Second, the authors present a &quot;circuit architecture&quot; that might account for the observed results. In the Results, this model is presented as though it were a computationally implemented biophysical neural circuit model that makes predictions that are in line with the observed data. I cannot find details of the implementation of such a model in the Methods, which makes the status of the predictions here unclear. It is not explained why two equally-valued objects would lead to gamma synchronization, whereas two objects of unequal value lead to beta synchronization (the key conclusion derived from the model). This appears to depend on total input strength, but it is hard to see why 0.5 + 0.5 (equal value, numbers provided by authors) would result in higher input than 0.8 + 0.2 (unequal value, again numbers from this paper, Figure 9). These choices, and others, appear arbitrary. In general, the description of the model in Results reads more like an interpretation/Discussion section than an outline of model-derived Results.</p><p>Third, the presented empirical evidence for narrow-spiking cells (or, more specifically, the N3-subtype) engaging preferentially in gamma-band synchronization, whereas broad-spiking cells engage preferentially in beta-band synchronization, is modest. Interneuron engagement in gamma rhythms is expected from the literature, of course, but in the present dataset this is less clear-cut. In particular, the spectral peaks in Figure 6C are quite similar between broad- and narrow-spiking, and labelling the former &quot;beta&quot; but the latter &quot;gamma&quot; requires a more thorough analysis than is now presented.</p><p>Fourth, there are some issues with reporting, where occasionally results are only reported for the narrow-spiking cells and not for the broad-spiking cells, or it is unclear whether a stated result holds for all or just a subset of cells, etc.</p><p>Finally, all results are shown aggregated over two animals, while it is important to know how the key results hold in the two animals separately.</p><p>I mention some additional recommendations here.</p><p>At the very least, correlation analyses for both p(choice) and RPE should be shown for all time windows, to allow a proper assessment. If the authors indeed wish to maintain the hard claim of a dissociation ACC&lt;&gt;RPE and LPFC&lt;&gt;p(choice) this should explicitly be tested by e.g. directly comparing the correlations with the two behavioural variables.</p><p>The model should be specified in much more detail. Specifically, the assumptions built into it should be clearly defined, and the quantitative predictions derived from it should be presented.</p><p>I understand that the data are not yet publicly released, as others from the same lab are still working on the same data (which is common in the field). However, I would urge the authors to make the source code for all reported analyses publicly available already, to greatly improve transparency and replicability. (&quot;Upon reasonable request&quot; is not sufficient for this goal.)</p><p>In general, the narrative could be streamlined a bit, as it currently stands the manuscript is hard to read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper studies the role of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in reversal learning. The authors suggest that LPFC plays a role in computing the probability that the animal will make a certain choice (termed choice probability), whereas ACC signals the reward prediction error. Interestingly, narrow spiking cells (putatively inhibitory neurons also known as fast spiking units) had a higher correlation with these task-relevant parameters, compared to broad spiking cells (putatively excitatory neurons also known as regular spiking units).</p><p>Next, the authors define electrophysiological cell types (termed e-types), based on spike waveform and firing patterns. The narrow spiking cells are subdivided into 3 subclasses, termed N1, N2 and N3. Notably, the same subclass of narrow spiking cells, N3, had a correlation with choice probability in LPFC and a correlation with reward prediction error in ACC. Neither of the other narrow spiking subtypes had a significant correlation with either parameter in either area.</p><p>In the final part of the paper, the authors examine the phase-locking behavior of these N3 cells to the local field potential (LFP). They find that in LPFC, N3 cells phase lock to gamma (35 – 45 Hz) during the initial learning stage shortly after rule reversal, but as learning progresses and performance reaches a new plateau, their phase locking switches to the beta-band (15 – 30 Hz). Perhaps most remarkably, the N3 cells in ACC showed a similar reversal learning stage dependent phase locking behavior; to elaborate, they phase-locked to gamma only when the reward prediction error was high (i.e., shortly after rule reversal).</p><p>These results are generally well supported by rigorous statistics and sophisticated analyses. However, there are several weaknesses. First, while the claim that LPFC encoded choice probability is well supported, the claim that ACC encodes reward prediction error is not as well substantiated. As seen in Figure 3, percent neurons showing significantly correlation between their firing rate and reward prediction error is not very different between LPFC and ACC, and quite similar between broad spiking and narrow spiking units within ACC.</p><p>Second, the authors build a reinforcement learning model to calculate &quot;Choice Probability&quot;, which quantifies the probability that the animal will select the rewarded stimulus. According to this definition, choice probability should dip upon reversal, and rise to a new plateau after several trials. However, this metric is fairly unintuitive, not to mention in conflict with existing nomenclature (e.g., Nienborg, Cohen and Cumming 2012). It would be helpful to have an accompanying plot of how the firing rate and phase locking behavior of each neuronal type changes as a function of trials after reversal.</p><p>Third, the extent to which choice probability encoding neurons and reward prediction error encoding neurons in each area falls into a specific e-type is not shown.</p><p>Undoubtedly, it is noteworthy and remarkable that N3 is the only e-type that shows a positive correlation with choice probability in lateral prefrontal cortex and a positive correlation with reward prediction error in ACC (Figure 5). But do all choice probability encoding neurons in LPFC and reward prediction error encoding neurons in ACC fall into the N3 e-type?</p><p>Further, the task-dependent phase locking behavior of e-types other than N3 are not shown. Given that N3 is the only NS e-type that shows a relationship with task-relevant parameters, I would expect the task learning dependent phase-locking behavior to also be unique to N3, but this result is not presented in this paper.</p><p>Finally, the conceptual model in Figure 9 captures the results presented in this paper and gives rise to testable predictions. It seems that some predictions of this model should be testable with the presented data. For example, the prediction that in LPFC, broad spiking cells fall into two functional categories, whereas N3 cells are more functionally homogeneous, would be an interesting prediction to test. Further, the prediction that in ACC, broad spiking cells encode reward whereas N3 cells encode reward prediction error is easily testable and would strengthen the conclusions of this paper.</p><p>The main finding of this paper, that a specific electrophysiological subclass of narrow spiking cells serve important roles in a reversal learning by preferentially phase-locking to gamma band LFP, would be of broader significance and impact if this finding could be generalized to other brain regions, behavioral tasks and model species. That said, there are already several papers in the literature that define e-types. Specifically, Markram et al. (2015) define 11 e-types; Gouwens et al. 2019 define 6 e-types that constitute narrow spiking cells (referred to as fast spiking cells in Gouwens et al). For sake of future efforts to study e-types and their functional roles, it would be important to reconcile these disparate definitions of e-types.</p><p>Moreover, there are at least two other papers showing that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have different relationship with gamma (Shin and Moore 2019; Onorato et al., 2020). It would be very interesting and important to know whether the 3 narrow spiking e-types discussed in this paper match up with the subclasses in the two aforementioned papers.</p><p>In sum, this paper is a valuable addition to the reinforcement learning literature as well as neuronal cell types and neural oscillations literature. Some additional analyses could strengthen the conclusions of this paper. It is unclear how the e-types defined in this paper will tie into other neuronal categorizations in recent literature. This link to prior work will be important for broader significance.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>I. Comments on Figures</p><p>1. Figure 2 and Figure S6 shows the PSTH aligned to Feature 1 and Feature 2 based on the cue order (Motion first vs Color first). It would be highly relevant to also show the PSTH aligned to Feature 1, Feature 2 and Reward based on behavioral outcome (correct vs incorrect, and there are at least 3 different types of error outcomes; please see my comment III-2 in Comments on Methods below for elaboration).</p><p>In particular, PSTH aligned to reward conditioned on behavioral outcome is crucial for interpreting Figure 3.</p><p>2. Figures 2 and 3: The correlation between firing rate and Choice Probability / RPE is interesting, but not very intuitive. It would be helpful to have a plot of Choice Probability and Reward Prediction Error as a function of trials since reversal, as well as the firing rate for each cell type and brain area as a function of trials since reversal. This way we can see whether LPFC NS firing rate after color cue onset tracks Choice Probability, and whether ACC NS firing rate after reward tracks RPE.</p><p>3. Figure 4B firing rate unit is missing both the figure and in the main text.</p><p>Figure 4C rastergram firing rate seems massively different from the average firing rate in 4B? e.g., for Figure 4C rastergram for N1, there seems to be ~5 spikes per 100ms, which would be ~50Hz, but the average firing rate for N1 is 4Hz?</p><p>Also, please discuss why the narrow spiking firing rate is so low (assuming the firing rate unit was Hz, mean firing rate is &lt;2Hz for N2 and N3). Narrow spiking firing rates have typically been reported to be ~10Hz in vivo.</p><p>4. Figure 5: It is remarkable that N3 is the only e-type that shows a positive correlation with choice probability in LPFC and a positive correlation with reward prediction error in ACC. To what extent do choice probability encoding neurons and reward prediction error encoding neurons in each area fall into a specific e-type? I would like to know whether a neuron's e-type is predictable from task-dependent functional properties of the neuron.</p><p>5. Figure 6C: suggest plotting N3 in the same plot as Broad Spiking and Narrow Spiking units such that the magnitude can be compared more easily.</p><p>In addition, please clarify what the y-axis of Figure6c means (Peak densities of spike-LFP synchronization (PPC)). Is this simply the average PPC spectra? Or normalized for each unit in some way? I would recommend plotting the former, such that it is possible to compare which e-types have the best locking properties to which frequency band.</p><p>6. Figure 7 and 8: It's very interesting that initially after reversal, N3 locks to gamma but later, as performance reaches a new plateau, N3 locks to beta. If you plot trial since reversal on the x-axis, and plot the peak of PPC spectra (averaged across N3 cells) on the y-axis, do you see a gradual change in peak frequency or is it more of a step function change after each reversal? Relatedly, if you plot the histogram of PPC spectra peak frequency across N3 cells, is it a bimodal distribution (one peak in beta and another peak in gamma) or is it unimodal?</p><p>7. It would be interesting to know the behavior-dependent phase locking of other e-types as well. I suggest adding Figure 7 and 8 C and F for all e-types as a supplemental figure.</p><p>8. Were LPFC and ACC recorded simultaneously? If so, it would be very interesting to see if inter-area coherence mimics the changes in PPC. For example, does the gamma band coherence go up in the first few trials after reversal, followed by an increase in beta band coherence as behavioral performance plateaus?</p><p>9. Figure 9 outlays a really nice hypothesis that gives rise to testable predictions. Some of these predictions are testable within the data presented in this paper. I think it would significantly strengthen this paper if some of these predictions could be tested:</p><p>Figure 9 hypothesizes that in LPFC, Broad Spiking neurons should encode Value predictions; e.g., red-selective neurons that, after learning, fire more when red is being rewarded compared to when green is being rewarded. These Value-predictive neurons should fire similarly during learning, and is perhaps even predictive of the animal's choice on a trial-by-trial basis (e.g., on trials that red-selective neurons fired more during learning, the animal saccades according to the red stimulus). In contrast, N3 neurons should show no such Value-predictive behavior. Is there evidence of such prediction in the data?</p><p>Relatedly, Figure 9 hypothesizes that in ACC, Broad Spiking neurons encode reward, whereas N3 encode RPE. According to this prediction, N3 activity should be higher for &quot;surprise correct&quot; trials shortly after reversal, and go down as performance plateaus, whereas Broad Spiking neurons should be excited by reward the same amount regardless of whether it is shortly after reversal or after behavioral performance has reached plateau. Is this seen in data? I think this would be made clear if the PSTH aligned to reward were plotted, as suggested in Comment 1.</p><p>II. Comments on Main Text</p><p>1. &quot;We next asked whether the narrow spiking, putative interneurons that encode p(choice) in LPFC and RPE in ACC are from the same electrophysiological cell type, or e-type (Markram et al., 2015).&quot;</p><p>There are ~11 e-types described in Markram et al., 2015. Further, Gouwens…Koch 2019 NN describes ~6 sub-e-types of Fast Spiking cells. I recommend the authors to speculate on how previously reported e-types match up with the e-types described in this paper.</p><p>2. &quot;Prior studies have suggested that interneurons have unique relationships to oscillatory activity (Cardin et al., 2009; Vinck et al., 2013; Voloh and Womelsdorf, 2018; Womelsdorf et al., 2014a),&quot;</p><p>I suggest adding Chen…Zhang 2017 Neuron to this list of references.</p><p>3. Discussion section: There are at least two other papers showing that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have different relationship with gamma (Shin and Moore 2019 Neuron; Onorato…Vinck 2020 Neuron). It would be an interesting addition to the Discussion section to speculate on whether the 3 narrow spiking e-types discussed in this paper match up with the subclasses in the two aforementioned papers.</p><p>III. Comments on Methods</p><p>1. In general, the Method section is not consistent about referring to relevant figures for the analyses being described. It would really help the reader if the analyses that went into each figure were clarified: e.g., &quot;Statistical Analysis of time resolved spike-LFP coherence for putative interneurons and broad spiking neurons (Figure 7, 8)&quot;</p><p>2. Task design: &quot;Color-reward associations were reversed without cue after 30 trials or until a learning criterion was reached, which makes this task a color-based reversal learning task. &quot;</p><p>It seems that a strategy that a monkey might employ would be to count the number of trials after reversal to anticipate when the next reversal would happen, which would rely on a different mental strategy than reversal learning tasks where the reversal points are not predictable. Is there any behavioral evidence that would discount the possibility that the monkeys are counting?</p><p>&quot;Hence, a correct response to a given stimulus must match the motion direction of that stimulus as well as the timing of the dimming of that stimulus.&quot;</p><p>In this task, there appears to be one way to be correct, but several distinct ways of being incorrect. First, the monkey could be incorrect in both the timing and the saccade direction. Second, the monkey could be correct with the timing but incorrect with the direction. Third, the monkey could be correct with the direction but incorrect with the timing. The third outcome could be further subdivided into premature response versus late response. The reason why a monkey might make each mistake is different. Only the first scenario supports the possibility that the monkey thought the other color was being rewarded, e.g., shortly after reversal. It would be interesting to know the proportion of each error type as a function of trials since reversal. Furthermore, I would expect the negative reward prediction error to be most prominent in the first type of error. Hence, it would make sense to me if only the first type of error was considered when calculating choice probability and reward prediction error.</p><p>3. &quot;Here, we use this model to estimate the trial-by-trial fluctuations of the expected value (EV) for the rewarded color and the choice probability (CP) of the animal's stimulus selection. EV and CP increase with learning similar to the increase in the probability of the animal to make rewarded choices, causing all three variables to correlate (Figure 4E, F).&quot;</p><p>Figure 4 does not have E-F panels.</p><p>4. Behavioral analysis: I could not find a formal definition of Choice Probability and Reward Prediction Error anywhere. I assume Equation 4 defines Choice Probability, while Rt-Vt defines RPE? I suggest making these definitions clear in the Methods, as well as the main text and the figure legend.</p><p>Choice Probability is abbreviated in at least three different ways throughout the manuscript (e.g., p(choice), CP, CHP). Please be consistent.</p><p>Note on terminology: Choice Probability commonly refers to the relationship between the activity of individual sensory neurons and the animal's behavioral choice (see Nienborg, Cohen and Cumming 2012 ARN). The duplicate terminology may be confusing for some readers. I suggest using a different term (e.g., Probability of Choice).</p><p>5. &quot;We then quantified the log-likelihood of the independent test dataset given the training datasets optimal parameter values.&quot;</p><p>Where is this result plotted? What is the model performance in predicting test dataset?</p><p>6. Waveform analysis: It would help to add a diagram of T2P, T4R and HR in Figure 4.</p><p>Relatedly, trough comes before the peak in extracellular spike waveforms (as apparent in Figure 4C) – T2P should be (t<sub>peak</sub>-t<sub>trough</sub>) in order to be a positive value?</p><p>7. &quot;LV is a measure of regularity/burstiness of spike train and is proportional to the square of the difference divided by sum of two consecutive interspike intervals (Shinomoto et al., 2009).&quot;</p><p>This sentence should go in the main text. The reason being; the way LV is described in the main text makes it sound like LV and CV measure the same things: &quot;regular or variable interspike intervals (local variability 'LV'), or more or less variable firing relative to their mean interspike interval (coefficient of variation 'CV').&quot;</p><p>8. Given how central the clustering analysis in Figure 4A is to the rest of the paper, the exact parameters that went into this analysis (HR, T4R, LV, CV, FR) should be made clear in the main text.</p><p>In addition, this clustering analysis is key to the reproducibility of e-types in other datasets. The authors have stated that &quot;All data and code is available upon reasonable request.&quot; However, in my opinion, at least the code for the e-type clustering analysis should be made publicly available.</p><p>9. &quot;Correlation of local variation with burst index&quot;</p><p>Burst index is defined here, but not plotted in any figures. I suggest adding a plot depicting the relationship between local variation and burst index would be informative.</p><p>10. &quot;First, we divided trials into two groups of high and low RPE and CHP values (trials were assigned based on their median value for each neuron).&quot;</p><p>I understood RPE and Choice Probability to be values unique to each trial, rather than to each neuron? If so, the median value should be specific to each behavior session, not to each neuron? Please clarify.</p><p>11. &quot;We included only neurons with at least 50 spikes per time window.&quot;</p><p>Does this sentence mean 50 spikes per time window per trial? For a 700ms time window, this would mean that the neuron would have to be firing at ~70Hz in order to be included in this analysis! If this sentence means 50 spike per time window across trials, please clarify. In this case, please also clarify the range of trial number that went into this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this work, Boroujeni et al. investigated the role of different cellular subtypes in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LFPC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the rhesus macaque as the animals performed an attention demanding reversal-learning task. The authors use an attention-augmented reinforcement learning model to track the trial-by-trial values of key decision-making variables which were then correlated against the neural activity. The cellular population was separated into broad and narrow spiking neurons using features computed from the extracellularly recorded waveforms. The authors find that the activity of the narrow spiking cells in the LFPC is correlated with the choice probability, whereas the activity of narrow spiking cells in the ACC is correlated with reward prediction errors. Interestingly, the authors find that further splitting the population of broad and narrow spiking cells into subtypes revealed that both the choice probability in LPFC and the reward prediction error in the ACC were encoded by a specific subtype of putative interneuron. The authors show that the spike-field phase synchronization of this putative interneuron subgroup is also modulated by choice probability in the LFPC and reward prediction error in the ACC, mirroring the result from their single-unit correlation analysis. The authors use these results to propose a biologically plausible circuit model of how learning in such a task might be implemented through interneuron specific synchronization.</p><p>While many of the results in the paper seem robust, some of the conclusions drawn by the authors rest on analyses and methods that require further validation and controls.</p><p>1. The clustering of the cell population into 5 broad-spiking and 3 narrow-spiking subtypes is perhaps one of the most critical results that requires further validation since a lot the conclusions in the paper rely on the outcome of this analysis. The validation that the authors include in the paper (Figure S5C, S5D) address concerns regarding the clustering quality, but it's still unclear how meaningful this separation into these 8 clusters actually is. The clustering is also performed on the pooled data across both animals, but the authors should have also shown what the clustering looks like when performed independently on the population from each animal, and if there is a meaningful correspondence between the sets of clusters recovered in the two populations.</p><p>2. Most of the follow-up analysis focuses on the comparison between one specific interneuron subtype (N3) and all broad -spiking cells. I imagine that the reason for this is two-fold: (1) the N3 subtype is the only one that showed a significant modulatory effect on the multi-unit activity (Figure 4D), and (2) it seems to be special in the sense that the activity of the N3 cells is significantly correlated with choice probability in LPFC in addition to reward prediction error in ACC. While the reasons for showing key results only for the N3-type can be appreciated, the authors should have included additional control analysis to demonstrate that their results are indeed specific to the N3 subtype. For example, in Figure 7 and 8, the authors show a comparison of the spike-LFP phase synchronization between N3 and broad spiking cells, but no further characterization of subtypes within the broad spike cells or the other narrow spiking types (i.e. N1, N2).</p><p>3. The authors show that the spike-field phase synchronization of the N3 subgroup is also modulated by choice probability in the LFPC (Figure 7) and reward prediction error in the ACC (Figure 8), mirroring the result from their single-unit correlation analysis (Figures 2 and 3). Unlike their firing rate analysis however, they do not show anatomical specialization in these analyses, even though the model they propose in Figure 9 clearly shows that they hypothesize this to be the case. It would be very interesting to show the analysis performed in Figure 7 for the ACC N3 population, and likewise, the analysis performed in Figure 8 for the LPFC N3 population.</p><p>4. Behavior</p><p>a. In Figure 1C, I imagine that the proportion of rewarded choices at reversal (t=0, not shown) is equal to one minus the asymptotic performance? So around 0.1?</p><p>b. If the stimulus-reward pairings are fully deterministic, why does the monkey require so many trials (on average 7 I believe it was) to reach asymptotic performance again?</p><p>c. Related to the previous question, is there any change in this acquisition time over the course of a session (as they experience more and more reversals)?</p><p>d. Can you show some example fits of the reinforcement learning model? For example, the choice probability and expected value as a function of the trial number around a reversal.</p><p>5. Single Units</p><p>a. The authors correlate the neural activity with model-derived variables, like the probability of choice, and prediction error. The distributions of these variables, however (as indicated in Figure S4b, and S4C) are very skewed, and it seems like most of the variability comes from the few trials (around 10) that it takes to reach asymptotic performance after a reversal. It would be interesting to know what this correlation represents. Are the cells truly tracking small changes in the P(choice) and PE or does this reflect more of a discrete switch? Maybe the authors could show some scatters, firing rate vs. P(choice), of some example cells. How well can p(choice) and PE be decoded from the neural population?</p><p>6. Electrophysiology/Clustering</p><p>It seems that a lot of the results in the paper rely on clustering analysis. The authors have been cautious in their approach (i.e., validating the results), but given that a lot depends on the reliability of these results, I think it would be wise to add a few more control analyses. I am not sure how feasible these are, but worth considering nonetheless:</p><p>a. Another way of validating the clustering is to do it across animals. From what I understood, the clustering (for e-type) is done using data from both animals. How well would a clustering model fit within animals, predict the clustering across animals?</p><p>7. Spike field coherence</p><p>a. Can the authors comment on the effect of ERPs?</p><p>b. Simply controlling for the number of spikes between conditions is not necessarily sufficient. If you have a cell that responds to one condition but does not respond to another condition, the spikes for condition 1 are going to be much more clustered in time than for condition 2. Therefore the underlying LFP is not sampled in the same way between the two conditions.</p><p>c. Is it possible to show that the spike-field coherence results are also anatomically specific?

The authors suggest that LPFC plays a role in computing the probability that the animal will make a certain choice (termed choice probability), whereas ACC signals the reward prediction error. Interestingly, narrow spiking cells (putatively inhibitory neurons also known as fast spiking units) had a higher correlation with these task-relevant parameters, compared to broad spiking cells (putatively excitatory neurons also known as regular spiking units).</p><p>Next, the authors define electrophysiological cell types (termed e-types), based on spike waveform and firing patterns. The narrow spiking cells are subdivided into 3 subclasses, termed N1, N2 and N3. Notably, the same subclass of narrow spiking cells, N3, had a correlation with choice probability in LPFC and a correlation with reward prediction error in ACC. Neither of the other narrow spiking subtypes had a significant correlation with either parameter in either area.</p><p>In the final part of the paper, the authors examine the phase-locking behavior of these N3 cells to the local field potential (LFP). They find that in LPFC, N3 cells phase lock to gamma (35 – 45 Hz) during the initial learning stage shortly after rule reversal, but as learning progresses and performance reaches a new plateau, their phase locking switches to the beta-band (15 – 30 Hz). Perhaps most remarkably, the N3 cells in ACC showed a similar reversal learning stage dependent phase locking behavior; to elaborate, they phase-locked to gamma only when the reward prediction error was high (i.e., shortly after rule reversal).</p><p>The main finding of this paper, that a specific electrophysiological subclass of narrow spiking cells serve important roles in a reversal learning by preferentially phase-locking to gamma band LFP, would be of broader significance and impact if this finding could be generalized to other brain regions, behavioral tasks and model species. This paper cites several precedents in the literature that define e-types. Specifically, Markram et al. (2015) define 11 e-types; Gouwens et al. 2019 define 6 e-types that constitute narrow spiking cells (referred to as fast spiking cells in Gouwens et al). For sake of future efforts to study e-types and their functional roles, it would be important to reconcile these disparate definitions of e-types.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned in the Discussion section of this paper, there are several other papers showing that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have different relationship with gamma (Shin and Moore 2019; Onorato et al., 2020). It would be very interesting and important to know whether the 3 narrow spiking e-types discussed in this paper match up with the subclasses in the aforementioned papers.</p><p>In sum, this paper is a valuable addition to the reinforcement learning literature as well as neuronal cell types and neural oscillations literature. However, it is unclear how the e-types defined in this paper will tie into other neuronal categorizations in recent literature. This link to prior work will be important for broader significance.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>This paper has made significant improvements from the previous version. Most importantly, the implementation details of the circuit simulation are clarified. The vast majority of my prior concerns have been addressed. I have only a few suggestions remaining.</p><p>1. Given that reward prediction error analysis is critical to the thesis of this paper, I am still of the opinion that it would be important to include the PSTH aligned to the reward, for narrow spiking and broad spiking neurons (as in Figure 2) as well as for important e-types (as in Figure S3).</p><p>2. The added classifier analysis or predicting cell classes from their correlations with learning variables is very interesting. However, I am not clear on exactly what was used to train the SVM. The way I currently understand this analysis is that in LPFC, correlation between firing rate and p(choice) was calculated for each neuron – and this one-dimensional vector, the size of which is (Number of neurons)X1, was used to train the SVM. Is this the case? Please clarify.</p><p>3. Figure S5 E and F: it is hard to see a trend in these plots. I suggest either making the dots transparent; or plotting the data as a 2D-histogram. This way it would be possible to discern where the data is the densest.</p><p>4. In Methods, the numbering in the equations are not unique (there's two Equation 2 and two Equation 3). Please correct.</p><p>5. The following sentences in Supplementary Online Information needs to be corrected as indicated:</p><p>&quot;These circuit motifs are provided to provide a proof-of-concept that the observations can follows from biologically plausible motifs. These circuits motifs also provide predictions which can be tested in future studies.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, Boroujeni et al. investigated the role of different cellular subtypes in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LFPC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the rhesus macaque as the animals performed an attention-demanding reversal-learning task. The authors use an attention-augmented reinforcement learning model to track the trial-by-trial values of key decision-making variables which were then correlated against the neural activity. The cellular population was separated into broad and narrow spiking neurons using features computed from the extracellularly recorded waveforms. The authors find that the activity of the narrow spiking cells in the LFPC is correlated with the choice probability, whereas the activity of narrow spiking cells in the ACC is correlated with reward prediction errors. Interestingly, the authors find that further splitting the population of broad and narrow spiking cells into subtypes revealed that both the choice probability in LPFC and the reward prediction error in the ACC were encoded by a specific subtype of putative interneuron. The authors show that the spike-field phase synchronization of this putative interneuron subgroup is also modulated by choice probability in the LFPC and reward prediction error in the ACC, mirroring the result from their single-unit correlation analysis. The authors use these results to propose a biologically plausible circuit model of how learning in such a task might be implemented through interneuron-specific synchronization.</p><p>The analysis is thorough and the authors present a nice narrative of the results, even though in some cases my interpretation of the data is a little more mixed than what is written in the paper. For example, the authors are eager to point out that their results are &quot;interneuron specific&quot; and yet the data that they show suggests otherwise. Take the spike-LFP synchronization results shown in Figure S15, where it seems that the modulation of pairwise phase consistency with p(choice) could also be present for the B1 cluster of cells in addition to the N3 group (no stats shown). The same could be true for the B2 type in the ACC, which seems to show differential effects for high and low RPE.</p><p>Are these real effects or are these anomalies that are biased by a few outliers? In either case, please clarify.</p><p>Thank you for including the new supplementary figures; I can really appreciate the additional amount of work that must have gone into preparing the new controls for the second submission of the paper. The addition of the example model fittings (Figure S5) and the correlation of the firing rate from the two example cells with the RPE and p(choice) (Figure S10) are very nice. I would recommend to the authors to move the two examples in Figure S10 to one of the main figures. In the first submission, the focus of the paper was predominantly on the N3 subtype and its specialized functional properties in ACC and LPFC. The new figures however (specifically Figure S15) show that the story is a little more mixed than originally presented. B1 for example in LPFC shows differential effects for high and low P(choice) and B2 in ACC shows differential effects for high and low RPE. In any case, the new figures provide a much more complete story and I feel made the paper stronger.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69111.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Boroujeni et al. recorded extracellular spikes from single neurons in brain areas LPFC and ACC in two awake behaving macaques that were performing a reward reversal learning task. They classified the recorded neurons into various subtypes, and investigated how neuronal activity in these different subtypes related to the variables of the behavioural task.</p><p>The paper's clear and primary strength is the classification of extracellularly recorded neurons into broad- and narrow-spiking neurons, and even further into subtypes of these two classes. While a split based purely on spike waveform shape into broad- and narrow-spiking is relatively common, the cluster-based classification into subtypes based on various additional parameters like spike variability is novel and potentially illuminating. The authors furthermore convincingly demonstrate that the recorded narrow-spiking neurons (often labelled &quot;putative inhibitory interneurons&quot;) are indeed likely inhibitory in nature, by showing that the net effect of a spike in these cells on the surrounding population spike rate is negative. The analysis choices in this part of the paper were clear, well-motivated, and well-presented.</p><p>However, the bulk of the paper is taken up by the relationship between neuronal spiking and variables from the behavioural task, specifically choice probability (p(choice)) and reward prediction error (RPE). Here, the conclusions appear not backed up by the data, for several reasons.</p><p>First of all, the authors only present results for correlations with RPE in the reward window, and results for correlations with p(choice) in the stimulus windows. One of the main conclusions of the paper is that LPFC neurons code for p(choice) whereas ACC neurons code for RPE. However, correlations with RPE in the stimulus windows and p(choice) in the reward window are never shown. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that, purely given the task structure, RPE and p(choice) are almost perfectly negatively correlated (r = -0.928, Figure S4). It is therefore very possible that the crucial split is not between p(choice) and RPE as the determinant of neural activity, but simply the time window in which these are analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe there is a misunderstanding regarding some aspects of our data that we aim to address in three ways.</p><p>Firstly, conceptually the fact that RPE and p(choice) are anti-correlated (at r = -0.96, revised Figure S 5) does not change the interpretation of our findings during the cue and reward period. We report highly specific effects at the moment in the trial when p(Choice) and RPE are computed: A reward prediction error is by definition occurring after reward is processed and compared with an expected value, and not when a cue is processed. When a cue is processed the expected value of the cued information is reactivated and translated into a choice probability. We therefore show for LPFC and ACC and for broad and narrow spiking neuron types that after a cue p(choice) is correlated in narrow spiking neurons in PFC but not in ACC or for broad spiking neurons. Similarly, the reward prediction error (RPE) is computed when the outcome is received and during that time the RPE correlates with ACC narrow spiking neurons but not with broad spiking neurons and not in LPFC.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern whether the cue triggered correlation of p(choice) is not a correlation with RPE (and vice versa), we adjusted the interpretation in the text. In the revised text we more clearly emphasize that the time of low choice probabilities and high prediction errors demarcate a time of enhanced uncertainty about the relevant stimulus color. According to this perspective the firing and gamma synchrony correlations of narrow spiking neurons in PFC and ACC are reflecting not p(choice) and RPE per se, but a period with uncertainty about cues and outcomes. In the revised abstract we write:</p><p>“One of these interneuron subclasses showed prominent firing rate modulations and (35-45 Hz) gamma synchronous spiking during periods of uncertainty in both, lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). […] Computational modeling this interneuron-specific gamma band activity in simple circuit motifs suggests it could reflect a soft winner-take-all gating of information having high degrees of uncertainty.” (abstract)</p><p>We hope that these changes address conceptually the reviewer’s concern.</p><p>Secondly, we also want to point out a methodological aspect. Applying partial correlations of firing rate and p(choice) and RPE with variables that are so highly correlated leads to ambiguous results. We therefore refrain from attempting to perform partial correlations. What seems to matter is the clear interpretation about which latent decision variable (after cue onset) and learning variable (after reward onset) should emerge at what time point during the trial (cue period versus reward period).</p><p>Thirdly, experimentally dissociating choice probability and reward prediction errors might be interesting. In our experiment the correlation of p(choice) and RPE cannot be dissociated cleanly (as in most reinforcement learning tasks). This has, however, also not been the focus of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors present a &quot;circuit architecture&quot; that might account for the observed results. In the Results, this model is presented as though it were a computationally implemented biophysical neural circuit model that makes predictions that are in line with the observed data. I cannot find details of the implementation of such a model in the Methods, which makes the status of the predictions here unclear. It is not explained why two equally-valued objects would lead to gamma synchronization, whereas two objects of unequal value lead to beta synchronization (the key conclusion derived from the model). This appears to depend on total input strength, but it is hard to see why 0.5 + 0.5 (equal value, numbers provided by authors) would result in higher input than 0.8 + 0.2 (unequal value, again numbers from this paper, Figure 9). These choices, and others, appear arbitrary. In general, the description of the model in Results reads more like an interpretation/Discussion section than an outline of model-derived Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion about the computational circuit explanation. We adjusted this in the revised manuscript and provide a detailed description of the circuit and their implementation in firing rate models in a new Supplementary Online Information, new Suppl. Figures S17 and S18 showing the simulation results and in a simplified Figure 9.</p><p>The Suppl. Online Information now provides the implementation details and a discussion on what other architectures could underlie the empirically observed cell – type specific gamma synchronization effects. It has these four separate sections:</p><p>1. Overview of circuit modeling</p><p>2. E-E-I circuit motif realizing the switch from gamma to beta frequency synchronization</p><p>3. E-I-I circuit motif realizing the switch from gamma to theta frequency synchronization</p><p>4. Discussion of circuit motifs, relation to other models and experiment</p><p>We also clarify in the Results section of the main text that the circuit motifs are conceptualized in order to understand the possible circuit function of the observed gamma synchronization of the N3 interneuron class. We kindly refer to the Results section entitled “Circuits model of interneuron-specific switches of gamma to beta or theta synchronization”. In that section we state that</p><p>“… oscillatory activity signatures might inform us about the possible circuit motifs underlying uncertainty-related related computations. These computations are formally described in the reinforcement learning framework allowing us to propose a linkage of specific computations to oscillatory activity signatures and their putative circuits as proposed in the Dynamic Circuits Motif framework (Womelsdorf et al., 2014).”.</p><p>We then go on to explicitly refer to the Supplementary Online Information that contains detailed descriptions of the model details and the simulation results:</p><p>“To show the feasibility of this approach we devised two circuit models that reproduces the gamma band activity signatures in LPFC and ACC using populations of inhibitory cells modeled to correspond to N3 e-type cells (for modeling details, see Suppl. Online Information)”</p><p>The revised text also explicitly states that</p><p>“… [t]he described circuits provide proofs-of-concept that the synchronization patterns we observed in the N3 e-type interneurons in ACC and LPFC during periods of uncertain values and outcomes can originate from biologically realistic circuits.”</p><p>We believe the addition of the circuit models enhances the impact of the paper by explicitly pointing to possible circuit function of the observed interneuron specific gamma activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the presented empirical evidence for narrow-spiking cells (or, more specifically, the N3-subtype) engaging preferentially in gamma-band synchronization, whereas broad-spiking cells engage preferentially in beta-band synchronization, is modest. Interneuron engagement in gamma rhythms is expected from the literature, of course, but in the present dataset this is less clear-cut. In particular, the spectral peaks in Figure 6C are quite similar between broad- and narrow-spiking, and labelling the former &quot;beta&quot; but the latter &quot;gamma&quot; requires a more thorough analysis than is now presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Our highly specific gamma synchronization effects of the N3 e-type neurons are not described in Figure 6 to which the reviewer refers to. We adjusted the revised text to make this more clear, added new analyses results and describe the statistics more explicitly to convey our specific findings:</p><p>1. We explicitly report that both, narrow and broad spiking neurons show beta spike-LFP peaks (Figure 6, Suppl. Figure S4). This analysis was task-epoch independent. Please also note that we describe these results in the section entitled “Narrow spiking neurons synchronize to theta, beta and gamma band network rhythms.”, including links to relevant literature. This shows we do not claim a simple beta – gamma dissociation.</p><p>2. Among the individual cell classes, the spike-LFP synchrony showed significant ~40 Hz gamma peaks in ACC for classes N2 and N3. The other cell classes in ACC and all of the cell classes in LPFC did not show 40Hz gamma in a task-epoch independent way. These results (for all cell classes in each area) are provided explicitly in Suppl. Figure S12.</p><p>We consider the results from 1) and 2) not essential for our manuscript’s main message. They are provided to more comprehensively provide information about the cell classes, as the clustering procedure did not take into account synchrony. As another reviewer pointed out, the more information we provide about the cell classes the easier it will be in the future to identify possible subclasses and compare results from different studies.</p><p>3. We provide statistical evidence that gamma spike-LFP synchronization emerges transiently after a cue only for the N3 class in LPFC during low choice probability trials, and only for the N3 class in ACC during trials with low reward prediction error. The statistics for this cell class specific transient gamma increase is provided in Figure 7C (for LPFC) and in Figure 8F (for ACC). The specificity of these findings is now documented in the new Suppl. Figures S13 and S14 (please also see below).</p><p>4. In response to the reviewer we now provide for each of the cell sub-classes in a new Suppl. Figure S15 the time-frequency spike-LFP synchronization cue-aligned for low and high p(Choice) and reward-aligned for high and low RPE trials for PFC and ACC, respectively. These figures are noisy, because of the typically low number of spikes, but they do show that class N3 has some 3545 Hz synchrony in each brain area that other cell types do not show. We revised the text to describe these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, there are some issues with reporting, where occasionally results are only reported for the narrow-spiking cells and not for the broad-spiking cells, or it is unclear whether a stated result holds for all or just a subset of cells, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We added missing information and carefully checked that the revised text reports all main results also for the broad spiking cells. The newly added results did not change the conclusions from the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, all results are shown aggregated over two animals, while it is important to know how the key results hold in the two animals separately.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment we added the results from the key analyses for each monkey separately as supplementary results. In summary, both animals show similar result patterns in their response to color onset and reward onset, their firing rate correlation, and for both animals we verified the cell clustering separately:</p><p>“New Supplementary Figure S6 shows the main firing rate results for each of the two monkeys separately. For both monkeys narrow spiking neurons have stronger event-related firing and correlation with choice probabilities and reward prediction errors. This supports our main findings.”</p><p>We added new result panels in Supplementary Figure S8E and F that show monkey specific validation of cell clusters using two established methods. Both methods provided results showing that the cell classes were reliable in each monkey. This was true also for the main interneuron class N3 that carries the main results of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I mention some additional recommendations here.</p><p>At the very least, correlation analyses for both p(choice) and RPE should be shown for all time windows, to allow a proper assessment. If the authors indeed wish to maintain the hard claim of a dissociation ACC&lt;&gt;RPE and LPFC&lt;&gt;p(choice) this should explicitly be tested by e.g. directly comparing the correlations with the two behavioural variables.</p></disp-quote><p>Please also see our reply to the comment starting “However, the bulk of the paper…” above. We added the results of the suggested correlation analyses. We indeed do see only an ACC&lt;&gt;RPE and not an LPFC&lt;&gt;RPE effect, and we do find only a LPFC&lt;&gt;p(choice) and not an ACC&lt;&gt;p(choice) effect.</p><p>RPE and p(choice) are highly negatively correlated at r =-0.928 (shown in Suppl. Figure S5B), so that a third variable (firing rate) that correlates positively with one variable will negatively correlate with the other variable. However, choice probability is most meaningfully tested after the color cue onset (the color values are needed to compute p(Choice) and RPE is most meaningfully correlated after reward onset (when the value of the chosen stimulus is compared to the experienced reward).</p><p>We adjusted the text to make this more explicit and refer directly in the main text to the definitions of p(choice) (formalized in Equation 4, Methods) and of RPE (formally described in Equation 2, Methods).</p><p>In response to another comment, we also added results of the synchronization analysis for both ACC and LPFC for low and high p(choice) and low and high RPE (shown in new Suppl. Figure S13 and S14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model should be specified in much more detail. Specifically, the assumptions built into it should be clearly defined, and the quantitative predictions derived from it should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. A substantially revised Results sections summarizes the circuit motifs. The circuit hypotheses shown in Figure 9 is simplified and streamlined. We added the details about the circuit motifs that reproduce the gamma synchronization effects in LPFC and in ACC and describe the assumptions explicitly. We now also show stimulation results in a new Suppl. Online Information and Suppl. Figures S17 and S18.</p><p>The circuit models are not provided to generate quantitative predictions. We specify this now explicitly in the revised Results and write e.g.:</p><p>“To show the feasibility of this approach we devised two circuit models that reproduces the gamma band activity signatures in LPFC and ACC using populations of inhibitory cells modeled to correspond to N3 e-type cells (for modeling details, see Suppl.

The authors suggest that LPFC plays a role in computing the probability that the animal will make a certain choice (termed choice probability), whereas ACC signals the reward prediction error. Interestingly, narrow spiking cells (putatively inhibitory neurons also known as fast spiking units) had a higher correlation with these task-relevant parameters, compared to broad spiking cells (putatively excitatory neurons also known as regular spiking units).</p><p>Next, the authors define electrophysiological cell types (termed e-types), based on spike waveform and firing patterns.

They find that in LPFC, N3 cells phase lock to gamma (35 – 45 Hz) during the initial learning stage shortly after rule reversal, but as learning progresses and performance reaches a new plateau, their phase locking switches to the beta-band (15 – 30 Hz). Perhaps most remarkably, the N3 cells in ACC showed a similar reversal learning stage dependent phase locking behavior; to elaborate, they phase-locked to gamma only when the reward prediction error was high (i.e., shortly after rule reversal).</p><p>These results are generally well supported by rigorous statistics and sophisticated analyses. However, there are several weaknesses.</p><p>First, while the claim that LPFC encoded choice probability is well supported, the claim that ACC encodes reward prediction error is not as well substantiated. As seen in Figure 3, percent neurons showing significantly correlation between their firing rate and reward prediction error is not very different between LPFC and ACC, and quite similar between broad spiking and narrow spiking units within ACC.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to convey that RPE is not encoded in LPFC, or only encoded in ACC.</p><p>We adjusted the text to clarify this and write about Figure 3 that “…23% of LPFC and 35% of ACC…” neurons show sign. rate&lt;&gt;RPE correlations, reporting that the proportions are significantly different from zero. This corresponds well to our previous work that comprehensively surveyed how different types of RPEs are encoded in LPFC and in ACC with LPFC showing RPE encoding slightly less likely and slightly later than ACC when considering both, single isolated neurons as in this study, and multiunit activities (Oemisch et al., 2019).</p><p>What we found is that the positive correlation of RPE and firing rate had a stronger effect size in narrow spiking ACC neurons (Figure 3D) and is driven by a significant correlation of the N3 subclass (Figure 5D).</p><p>No other narrow or broad spiking neuron class has an average significant positive correlation strength.</p><p>We adjusted the text at various place to convey this more clearly in the revised manuscript. E.g., we write</p><p>“…time-resolved analysis of the strength of the average correlations revealed a significant positive firing x RPE correlation in the 0.2-0.6 s after reward onset for ACC N-type neurons, which was absent in LPFC (ACC, n=43 N-type neurons, randomization test p&lt;0.05; LPFC: n=31 N-type neurons, no time bin with sign.; Figure 3C,D).”</p><p>We confirmed that this result was evident in each of the monkeys when tested separately (and added this result to the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors build a reinforcement learning model to calculate &quot;Choice Probability&quot;, which quantifies the probability that the animal will select the rewarded stimulus. According to this definition, choice probability should dip upon reversal, and rise to a new plateau after several trials. However, this metric is fairly unintuitive, not to mention in conflict with existing nomenclature (e.g., Nienborg, Cohen and Cumming 2012). It would be helpful to have an accompanying plot of how the firing rate and phase locking behavior of each neuronal type changes as a function of trials after reversal.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not explicitly describe the p(choice) in the original manuscript and apologize for this oversight. In the revised text we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and added the progression of choice probabilities since trials after reversal in an extended Supplementary Figure S5. Choice probabilities positively correlate at r=0.27 with the trial number since reversal (as expected).</p><p>We also adjusted the text to more explicitly convey how the reinforcement learning literature uses a softmax (or Boltzman) equation to translate stimulus values into choice probabilities. We adjusted the methods section explicitly and write:</p><p>“Equation 4 defines the choice probability, or p(choice), that is used for the neuronal analysis of this manuscript (Sutton and Barto, 2018). P(choice) increases with trials since reversal (Supplementary Figure S5A,E), indicating a reduction in the uncertainty of the choice the more information is gathered about the value of the stimuli.”</p><p>We refrain from adding a rate or phase locking analysis as a function of trials since reversal because this would require trial by trial estimates of phase synchronization in short time windows around cue or reward onset. The isolated neurons fire few spikes in these epochs (Figure 4B), rendering the estimate of phase consistency noisy. We believe the trial-by-trial analysis will be more relevant when analyzing larger datasets that do not separate neurons into sub-classes with few and low firing neurons (given the small proportion of interneurons in the population).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the extent to which choice probability encoding neurons and reward prediction error encoding neurons in each area falls into a specific e-type is not shown.</p><p>Undoubtedly, it is noteworthy and remarkable that N3 is the only e-type that shows a positive correlation with choice probability in lateral prefrontal cortex and a positive correlation with reward prediction error in ACC (Figure 5). But do all choice probability encoding neurons in LPFC and reward prediction error encoding neurons in ACC fall into the N3 e-type?</p></disp-quote><p>The key finding is that the N3 e-type shows the strongest correlations with p(choice) (in LFPC) and RPE (in ACC). It does not entail that neurons in other e-type classes would not significantly encode p(choice) and RPE. In each class a small fraction of neurons individually shows significant correlations.</p><p>We clarify this in the text and added a new classification analysis to address the reviewers question.</p><p>First, we adjusted the text at various places to more explicitly refer to the “proportion of significance” and to the “strength / effect size” of the correlation when describing the results. E.g., we write</p><p>“… on average 23% of LPFC and 35% of ACC neurons showed significant firing rate correlations with RPE … ”, while “… analysis of the strength of the average correlations revealed …”</p><p>Second, to quantitatively convey the statistical nature of the main findings we added an analysis that predicted the cell class label of an individual cell based on its correlation of firing rate and p(choice) in LPFC and RPE in ACC. The confusion matrix results shown in the newly added Supplementary Figure S11 reveals that p(Choice) allowed to significantly predict a neurons’ class for various e-types and not only for the N3 e-type (for which the correlations were strongest as shown in other analyses). We added to the main text that in</p><p>“… LPFC, a linear classifier trained on multiclass p(choice) values was able to label N3 e-type from their p(choice) value with and accuracy of 31% (Suppl. Figure S11A).” and in</p><p>“…ACC a linear classifier trained on multiclass RPE values was able to label N3 e-type from their RPE value with and accuracy of 34% (Suppl. Figure S11B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the task-dependent phase locking behavior of e-types other than N3 are not shown. Given that N3 is the only NS e-type that shows a relationship with task-relevant parameters, I would expect the task learning dependent phase-locking behavior to also be unique to N3, but this result is not presented in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the phase locking for all cell types around cue onset for low and high p(choice) in LPFC and around reward onset for low and high RPE in ACC as new Suppl. Figure 15. The plots show that the N3 e-type is the only narrow spiking e-type with a gamma response after cue (in LPFC) / after reward (in ACC) in the period of enhanced reward uncertainty (low p(choice) and high RPE).</p><p>Additionally, as requested, we now provide for each cell type the gamma spike-LFP phase locking for low and high p(choice) in LPFC, and low and high RPE in ACC in the new Suppl. Figure’s S13E-H and S14EH.</p><p>Notably, gamma synchrony is evident most clearly for the N3 e-type in LPFC during low p(choice) (Suppl. Figure S13E) and the N3 e-type in ACC during high RPE trials (Suppl. Figure S14H).</p><p>These results support our original conclusions. The revised text is adjusted to refer to these new results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the conceptual model in Figure 9 captures the results presented in this paper and gives rise to testable predictions. It seems that some predictions of this model should be testable with the presented data. For example, the prediction that in LPFC, broad spiking cells fall into two functional categories, whereas N3 cells are more functionally homogeneous, would be an interesting prediction to test. Further, the prediction that in ACC, broad spiking cells encode reward whereas N3 cells encode reward prediction error is easily testable and would strengthen the conclusions of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to editorial and other comments we simplified the scope of the circuit modeling. We devised these models to account for the observe gamma synchronization of the N3 interneuron class and inform us about possible circuit functions of this gamma synchronization. Testing predictions of the model’s broad spiking neurons was not the intention and would exceed the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we make this explicit by writing, for example, in the Results section:</p><p>“The described circuits provide proofs-of-concept that the synchronization patterns we observed in the N3 e-type interneurons in ACC and LPFC during periods of uncertain values and outcomes can originate from biologically realistic circuits. The results justify future studies testing detailed predictions that can be derived from these circuit motifs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main finding of this paper, that a specific electrophysiological subclass of narrow spiking cells serve important roles in a reversal learning by preferentially phase-locking to gamma band LFP, would be of broader significance and impact if this finding could be generalized to other brain regions, behavioral tasks and model species. That said, there are already several papers in the literature that define e-types. Specifically, Markram et al. (2015) define 11 e-types; Gouwens et al. 2019 define 6 e-types that constitute narrow spiking cells (referred to as fast spiking cells in Gouwens et al). For sake of future efforts to study e-types and their functional roles, it would be important to reconcile these disparate definitions of e-types.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. But we particularly want to highlight that our findings in two brain areas in the monkey is already an important, newly achieved milestone. There is no other paper to our knowledge that characterizes specific interneuron functions in the nonhuman primate in ACC and LPFC and succeeds to find a functional similarity for the same electrophysiological cell type.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s suggestions, we added a more explicit discussion that is aimed at linking the different e-typing approaches from in-vitro and from in-vivo studies. We write in the revised Discussion section:</p><p>“The first implication of our findings is that narrow spiking neurons can be reliably subdivided in three subtypes based on their electrophysiological firing profiles. […] These results illustrate that our three interneuron e-types will encompass further subclasses that future studies should aim to distinguish in order to narrow the gap between the in-vivo e-types that we and others report in the monkey, and the in-vitro e-types in the rodents that are more easily mapped onto specific molecular, morphological and genetic make-ups (Markram et al., 2015; Gouwens et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, there are at least two other papers showing that subclasses of narrow spiking neurons have different relationship with gamma (Shin and Moore 2019; Onorato et al., 2020). It would be very interesting and important to know whether the 3 narrow spiking e-types discussed in this paper match up with the subclasses in the two aforementioned papers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these are very important references and added them at different places in the revised Discussion section.</p><p>Please see the quote in the previous reply. Additionally, when discussing the importance to link in the future e-types to morphological and molecular types in mice we refer to the Onorato study (of which the last author of this study is a co-author) and write:</p><p>“…As a caveat, this mapping of cell types between species might also reveal cell classes and unique cell class characteristics in nonhuman primate cortices that are not similarly evident in rodents as recently demonstrated in a cross-species study of non-fast spiking gamma rhythmic neurons in early visual cortex that were exclusively evident in the primate and not in mice (Onorato et al., 2020).”</p><p>When discussing when gamma synchrony has been observed in specific cell classes, e.g. we now write in the revised text:</p><p>“Such an intrinsic propensity for generating gamma rhythmic activity through, e.g. GABA<sub>a</sub>ergic time constant, is well described for PV+ interneurons (Wang and Buzsaki, 1996; Bartos et al., 2007; Womelsdorf et al., 2014b; Chen et al., 2017) and for some cells even for states with relatively low excitatory feedforward drive that might be more typical for prefrontal cortices than earlier visual cortices (Cardin et al., 2009; Vinck et al., 2013; Shin and Moore, 2019; Onorato et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, this paper is a valuable addition to the reinforcement learning literature as well as neuronal cell types and neural oscillations literature. Some additional analyses could strengthen the conclusions of this paper. It is unclear how the e-types defined in this paper will tie into other neuronal categorizations in recent literature. This link to prior work will be important for broader significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the positive comment. We fully agree with the importance to link to other classification schemes and hope the revised discussion and the added details in the supplementary materials will support this goal.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I. Comments on Figures</p><p>1. Figure 2 and Figure S6 shows the PSTH aligned to Feature 1 and Feature 2 based on the cue order (Motion first vs Color first). It would be highly relevant to also show the PSTH aligned to Feature 1, Feature 2 and Reward based on behavioral outcome (correct vs incorrect, and there are at least 3 different types of error outcomes; please see my comment III-2 in Comments on Methods below for elaboration). In particular, PSTH aligned to reward conditioned on behavioral outcome is crucial for interpreting Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your point of view. But this manuscript is about encoding of positive reward prediction errors and choice probabilities during learning with multiple sub-conditions and result panels (with 17 supplementary figures). The proposed (hit vs miss) error type analysis would be a different manuscript and beyond the scope of this paper, or it would add complexity that the revisions aim to reduce.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figures 2 and 3: The correlation between firing rate and Choice Probability / RPE is interesting, but not very intuitive. It would be helpful to have a plot of Choice Probability and Reward Prediction Error as a function of trials since reversal, as well as the firing rate for each cell type and brain area as a function of trials since reversal. This way we can see whether LPFC NS firing rate after color cue onset tracks Choice Probability, and whether ACC NS firing rate after reward tracks RPE.</p></disp-quote><p>We added example learning blocks showing the progression of choice probabilities and RPE (and the value of the chosen stimuli) over trials in an extended Suppl. Figure S5A. We show the overall change of choice probabilities and RPE since the first trial after reversal in Suppl. Figure S5E,F and report the correlations of these variables with the trial-since-reversal (which is r=0.13 for p(choice) and r= 0.23 for RPE and trial-since-reversal). We showed more examples in an earlier publication (Oemisch et al., 2019).</p><p>To provide ore insights into the firing rate changes with p(choice) and RPE we provide an example for LPFC and ACC in new Suppl. Figure S10 and write e.g.:</p><p>“The on-average positive correlation of firing rate and p(choice) was also evident in an example N3 e-type cell (Suppl. Figure S10A-C).”</p><p>Please note that the average correlation of the N3 cell classes firing rate with p(choice) is significant but weak: r=0.08 in LPFC (and with RPE in ACC it is r=0.09) so that trial x rate plots will be noisy. The key result is that the narrow spiking neurons do show on average an on-response to the cue and reward onset and that only one of these classes (N3) shows significant correlations (and gamma synchronization).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4B firing rate unit is missing both the figure and in the main text.</p><p>Figure 4C rastergram firing rate seems massively different from the average firing rate in 4B? e.g., for Figure 4C rastergram for N1, there seems to be ~5 spikes per 100ms, which would be ~50Hz, but the average firing rate for N1 is 4Hz?</p><p>Also, please discuss why the narrow spiking firing rate is so low (assuming the firing rate unit was Hz, mean firing rate is &lt;2Hz for N2 and N3). Narrow spiking firing rates have typically been reported to be ~10Hz in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing us to this. The firing rate axes is log(spikes/sec.), so the firing rates for N1, N2, and N3 are on average 20, 3.8, and 4.3 spikes/sec – similar to previous studies / datasets in monkey prefrontal cortex (e.g., Ardid et al., 2015).</p><p>We corrected this in Figure 4B and the main text. Figure 4C are example raster’s selected to convey primarily how regular/irregular the firing was (as captured in LV and CV). They might differ in mean rate to the average class specific firing rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5: It is remarkable that N3 is the only e-type that shows a positive correlation with choice probability in LPFC and a positive correlation with reward prediction error in ACC. To what extent do choice probability encoding neurons and reward prediction error encoding neurons in each area fall into a specific e-type? I would like to know whether a neuron's e-type is predictable from task-dependent functional properties of the neuron.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting question. To address this, we trained a classifier on the correlation values of e-types for p(choice) and RPE, and then predicted the class labels of neurons in a one to all classification process with the trained classifier. Two N-type classes (N1 and N2) were not large enough to survive the sampling we implemented in the analysis. From the other 6 e-types in ACC, the N3 e-type and two other broad spiking classes were predictable significantly higher than the chance level. However, only N3 e-type was not significantly confused with classifiers trained on other e-types.</p><p>We added the results in Supplementary Figure S11 and adjusted the methods and results text. We summarize the results by writing in the revised text:</p><p>“In LPFC, a linear classifier trained on multiclass p(choice) values was able to label N3 e-type neurons from their p(choice) value with and accuracy of 31% (Suppl. Figure S11A).” and “In ACC a linear classifier trained on multiclass RPE values was able to label N3 e-type neurons from their RPE value with and accuracy of 34% (Suppl. Figure S11B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 6C: suggest plotting N3 in the same plot as Broad Spiking and Narrow Spiking units such that the magnitude can be compared more easily.</p><p>In addition, please clarify what the y-axis of Figure 6c means (Peak densities of spike-LFP synchronization (PPC)). Is this simply the average PPC spectra? Or normalized for each unit in some way? I would recommend plotting the former, such that it is possible to compare which e-types have the best locking properties to which frequency band.</p></disp-quote><p>The magnitudes are directly comparable and the axis limits identical: Figure 6C shows the proportion of neurons in that population with a reliable (significant) PPC peak at that frequency. We clarified this in the revised figure axis and legend. The method section describes the computation explicitly.</p><p>Similarly, revised Supplementary Figure S12 shows the detailed information about the likelihood for significant PPC peaks for each cell class in each brain area (with the same [ylim] to ease comparison).</p><p>The values are directly comparable between plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 7 and 8: It's very interesting that initially after reversal, N3 locks to gamma but later, as performance reaches a new plateau, N3 locks to beta. If you plot trial since reversal on the x-axis, and plot the peak of PPC spectra (averaged across N3 cells) on the y-axis, do you see a gradual change in peak frequency or is it more of a step function change after each reversal? Relatedly, if you plot the histogram of PPC spectra peak frequency across N3 cells, is it a bimodal distribution (one peak in beta and another peak in gamma) or is it unimodal?</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting approach. We have tried it per your recommendation. However most of classes did not pass the minimum spike number criterion per time window per trial. The result is too noisy to be meaningful. We are actively working on a new experiment that increases the number of learning blocks per recorded cell to more than 30 and expect this new design will allow more fine-grained trial-by-trial predictions of learning (and to see for how many neurons this is a one shot or a gradual learning change).</p><p>For the revised circuit models (Figure 9 and Suppl. Figures S17 and S18) we do describe mechanisms for a gradual gamma-to-beta switch mechanism (for LPFC) and gamma-to-theta witch mechanism (for ACC). We also added an explicit discussion of possible alternative switch mechanisms in the Suppl. Online Information. In the models we propose and simulated the switch depends on the heterogeneity of the inputs to the network cells (we kept the overall excitatory drive constant in both tested models). This provides a starting point to test in the future more precise predictions about how rapid the switch occurs. Our manuscripts can provide the rationale for these more specific tests in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. It would be interesting to know the behavior-dependent phase locking of other e-types as well. I suggest adding Figure 7 and 8 C and F for all e-types as a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We added as new Suppl. Figure S15 the suggested information with time frequency plots for low and high p(choice) in LPFC and low and high RPE in ACC for B1-5 and N1-N3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Were LPFC and ACC recorded simultaneously? If so, it would be very interesting to see if inter-area coherence mimics the changes in PPC. For example, does the gamma band coherence go up in the first few trials after reversal, followed by an increase in beta band coherence as behavioral performance plateaus?</p></disp-quote><p>That is a really interesting point but unfortunately the number of data points recorded simultaneously is not sufficient for this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

These Value-predictive neurons should fire similarly during learning, and is perhaps even predictive of the animal's choice on a trial-by-trial basis (e.g., on trials that red-selective neurons fired more during learning, the animal saccades according to the red stimulus). In contrast, N3 neurons should show no such Value-predictive behavior.

According to this prediction, N3 activity should be higher for &quot;surprise correct&quot; trials shortly after reversal, and go down as performance plateaus, whereas Broad Spiking neurons should be excited by reward the same amount regardless of whether it is shortly after reversal or after behavioral performance has reached plateau. Is this seen in data? I think this would be made clear if the PSTH aligned to reward were plotted, as suggested in Comment 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to the previous comment regarding the revised and more detailed circuit models.

In general, the Method section is not consistent about referring to relevant figures for the analyses being described. It would really help the reader if the analyses that went into each figure were clarified: e.g., &quot;Statistical Analysis of time resolved spike-LFP coherence for putative interneurons and broad spiking neurons (Figure 7, 8)&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We added explicitly the specific Figure numbers / Suppl. Figure numbers to the individual methods sections in the revised submission. We also changed the order of some methods sections to more fairly reflect the order in which they are applied in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Task design: &quot;Color-reward associations were reversed without cue after 30 trials or until a learning criterion was reached, which makes this task a color-based reversal learning task. &quot;</p><p>It seems that a strategy that a monkey might employ would be to count the number of trials after reversal to anticipate when the next reversal would happen, which would rely on a different mental strategy than reversal learning tasks where the reversal points are not predictable. Is there any behavioral evidence that would discount the possibility that the monkeys are counting?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, in previous studies we compared quantitatively which of many different reinforcement learning (RL) models, Bayesian models and hybrid Bayes-RL best accounts for the behavior of the animals (Oemisch et al., 2019). The optimal Bayesian model would come closest to very fast changes of behavior after or at the time of reversal but it did not fit the monkeys’ behavior well. Monkeys are slower than predicted by optimal models and are slower than predicted from anticipating the trial of reversal (as suggested by the reviewer).</p><p>For estimating the RPE and (choice) we used the best-fitting (cross validated) RL model. We refer explicitly to this in the revised methods:</p><p>“This color-based reversal learning is well accounted for by an attention augmented Rescorla Wagner reinforcement learning model (‘attention-augmented RL’) that we previously tested against multiple competing models (Balcarras et al., 2016; Hassani et al., 2017; Oemisch et al., 2019). Here, we use this model …”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Hence, a correct response to a given stimulus must match the motion direction of that stimulus as well as the timing of the dimming of that stimulus.&quot;</p><p>In this task, there appears to be one way to be correct, but several distinct ways of being incorrect. First, the monkey could be incorrect in both the timing and the saccade direction. Second, the monkey could be correct with the timing but incorrect with the direction. Third, the monkey could be correct with the direction but incorrect with the timing. The third outcome could be further subdivided into premature response versus late response. The reason why a monkey might make each mistake is different. Only the first scenario supports the possibility that the monkey thought the other color was being rewarded, e.g., shortly after reversal. It would be interesting to know the proportion of each error type as a function of trials since reversal. Furthermore, I would expect the negative reward prediction error to be most prominent in the first type of error. Hence, it would make sense to me if only the first type of error was considered when calculating choice probability and reward prediction error.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct about the error types. We added error distribution information to the revised text (in the methods where other behavioral results were described already in order to not disrupt the flow of the result section). We write:</p><p>“Monkeys performed the task at 83 / 86 % (monkey’s H / K) accuracy (excluding fixation break errors). Of the 17/14 % of errors were composed on average to 50 / 50% of erroneous responding to the dimming of the distractor when it dimmed before the target and 34 / 37 % of erroneous responding at the time when target and distractor dimmed simultaneously but the monkey chose the distractor direction, and 16 / 13 % of error were responses when the target dimmed before any distractor dimming and the choice was erroneously made in the direction of the distractor.”</p><p>For computing the choice probabilities, we use all trials where the monkey made a choice rather than a fixation break or a no-response. In the model, the choice probability is not computed only based on color values, but on location and motion values too (location and motion direction of the stimuli are sources of uncertainty when making a choice). When monkeys make an unrewarded choice at the wrong time, to the wrong direction, or to the wrong stimulus, then this behavior still is a choice initiated by the animal. The choice probability estimate is not supposed to only include choices of one color versus another color. Rather, the choice probability estimate was used because it quantifies how certain the animal was when making the choice. (Analysis of the encoding of color-value estimates is not part of this manuscript but is a separate project).</p><p>Regarding RPE’s, this paper reports cell specific correlations with positive RPEs on correct trials (it is mentioned in the methods section). The errors that lead to negative RPEs are too rare in this design to allow a strong analysis in classes with low number of cells and low firing single neuron. A probabilistic reward schedule might be useful in the future to get more error trials. A separate analysis of negative versus positive prediction errors and how they distribute and carry different feature information is provided on a larger dataset in our previous work in Oemisch et al., 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. &quot;Here, we use this model to estimate the trial-by-trial fluctuations of the expected value (EV) for the rewarded color and the choice probability (CP) of the animal's stimulus selection.

Please be consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, pardon. We corrected this and now use “p(choice)” consistently throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note on terminology: Choice Probability commonly refers to the relationship between the activity of individual sensory neurons and the animal's behavioral choice (see Nienborg, Cohen and Cumming 2012 ARN).

By using the term p(choice) more directly in the text and defining more explicitly how p(choice) was calculated in Equation 4 we hope this reduces ambiguity with other ways of calculating or using it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. &quot;We then quantified the log-likelihood of the independent test dataset given the training datasets optimal parameter values.&quot;</p><p>Where is this result plotted?

The authors use an attention-augmented reinforcement learning model to track the trial-by-trial values of key decision-making variables which were then correlated against the neural activity. The cellular population was separated into broad and narrow spiking neurons using features computed from the extracellularly recorded waveforms. The authors find that the activity of the narrow spiking cells in the LFPC is correlated with the choice probability, whereas the activity of narrow spiking cells in the ACC is correlated with reward prediction errors. Interestingly, the authors find that further splitting the population of broad and narrow spiking cells into subtypes revealed that both the choice probability in LPFC and the reward prediction error in the ACC were encoded by a specific subtype of putative interneuron. The authors show that the spike-field phase synchronization of this putative interneuron subgroup is also modulated by choice probability in the LFPC and reward prediction error in the ACC, mirroring the result from their single-unit correlation analysis. The authors use these results to propose a biologically plausible circuit model of how learning in such a task might be implemented through interneuron specific synchronization.</p><p>While many of the results in the paper seem robust, some of the conclusions drawn by the authors rest on analyses and methods that require further validation and controls.</p><p>1. The clustering of the cell population into 5 broad-spiking and 3 narrow-spiking subtypes is perhaps one of the most critical results that requires further validation since a lot the conclusions in the paper rely on the outcome of this analysis. The validation that the authors include in the paper (Figure S5C, S5D) address concerns regarding the clustering quality, but it's still unclear how meaningful this separation into these 8 clusters actually is. The clustering is also performed on the pooled data across both animals, but the authors should have also shown what the clustering looks like when performed independently on the population from each animal, and if there is a meaningful correspondence between the sets of clusters recovered in the two populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We address the specific suggestions for further validation/recovering reliability and monkey separation of the clustering with added analysis and result figures. The additional validation of the cluster number and the cluster boundaries showed they are highly reliable also in each of the monkeys. We added new Suppl. Figure S7 and new Suppl. Figure S8 and adjusted the results text by writing:</p><p>“Cluster boundaries were highly reliable (Suppl. Figure S7). Moreover, assignment of a cell to its class was statistically consistent and also reliably evident for cells from each monkey independently (Suppl.

Most of the follow-up analysis focuses on the comparison between one specific interneuron subtype (N3) and all broad -spiking cells. I imagine that the reason for this is two-fold: (1) the N3 subtype is the only one that showed a significant modulatory effect on the multi-unit activity (Figure 4D), and (2) it seems to be special in the sense that the activity of the N3 cells is significantly correlated with choice probability in LPFC in addition to reward prediction error in ACC. While the reasons for showing key results only for the N3-type can be appreciated, the authors should have included additional control analysis to demonstrate that their results are indeed specific to the N3 subtype. For example, in Figure 7 and 8, the authors show a comparison of the spike-LFP phase synchronization between N3 and broad spiking cells, but no further characterization of subtypes within the broad spike cells or the other narrow spiking types (i.e. N1, N2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. That was an oversight on our part. We added multiple additional control analyses and results for other cell classes too. These added analyses support the special role of N3 cells in LPFC and in ACC. Perhaps most relevant are the spike-LFP results in the newly added Supplementary Figure’s S13, S14 and S15.</p><p>Suppl. Figure S15A shows the time frequency results for each cell class in LPFC around cue onset in the low and high p(choice) trials and reveals that the gamma increase to the feature cue onset is specific to the N3 class. Suppl. Figure S15B shows the time frequency results for each cell class in ACC around reward onset in the low and high RPE trials and reveals that the gamma increase to the reward onset is specific to the N3 class in the high RPE trials. These time frequency plots are noisy because many neurons fire only few spikes in the time windows of interest and there are only few cells in each class.</p><p>To more clearly illustrate the effect on gamma band spike-LFP synchronization and simplify the statistical analysis we extracted the average gamma band effect for all cell classes and sub-conditions, and summarize them directly in Figure ’s S13 and S14:</p><p>The specific gamma effect for cell classes in LPFC are shown in Figure S13: It shows that for low and high p(Choice) and low and high RPE, the N3 class sticks out by showing selectively higher gamma synchrony in the low p(Choice) condition (Suppl.

[…] E-type classes did not differ in their spike-LFP gamma in low RPE trials, or during the color cue period in high or low p(choice) trials (Suppl. Figure S14E-H, see Suppl.

The authors show that the spike-field phase synchronization of the N3 subgroup is also modulated by choice probability in the LFPC (Figure 7) and reward prediction error in the ACC (Figure 8), mirroring the result from their single-unit correlation analysis (Figures 2 and 3). Unlike their firing rate analysis however, they do not show anatomical specialization in these analyses, even though the model they propose in Figure 9 clearly shows that they hypothesize this to be the case.

If the stimulus-reward pairings are fully deterministic, why does the monkey require so many trials (on average 7 I believe it was) to reach asymptotic performance again?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the animals learn sub-optimally slow in this task, because it is a difficult, attention demanding task. Their choice is made according to the motion direction of the stimulus with the rewarded color. When they do not get reward with their choice then this can be not only because of the wrong color of the stimulus, but also because of the wrong motion direction or even the wrong location they attended. This makes the task highly demanding and dependent on a good representation of the currently rewarded color. This task is very different to spatial reversal tasks or simple object-based reversal tasks where animals are allowed to look at the specific stimuli (In our task, animals do not make a saccade to the peripheral stimuli but to up- and down- ward presented response targets).</p><p>Please note that we tried fitting the behavior with optimal Bayesian models in previous work and confirmed that they failed to account for behavior, because they would learn too fast (Oemisch et al., 2019). Rather, we found that a reinforcement learning model with a selective decay (forgetting) of nonchosen (or: non-attended) stimulus values was outperforming other models consistently. We use this so-called attention-augmented reinforcement learning model to account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

Figure S5E,F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Single Units</p><p>a. The authors correlate the neural activity with model-derived variables, like the probability of choice, and prediction error. The distributions of these variables, however (as indicated in Figure S4b, and S4C) are very skewed, and it seems like most of the variability comes from the few trials (around 10) that it takes to reach asymptotic performance after a reversal. It would be interesting to know what this correlation represents. Are the cells truly tracking small changes in the P(choice) and PE or does this reflect more of a discrete switch? Maybe the authors could show some scatters, firing rate vs. P(choice), of some example cells. How well can p(choice) and PE be decoded from the neural population?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot conclusively answer how gradual or discrete the correlation occurs in the current dataset given the few and low firing neurons and the rather few learning blocks during which they were recorded. The average correlation of the N3 cell classes firing rate with p(choice) were significant but weak: r=0.08 in LPFC and with RPE in ACC it was r=0.09.</p><p>To address the reviewer, we now visualize in a new Suppl Figure 10 two example cells of the N3 – e-type, showing the positive correlation of rate and RPE in ACC, and the positive correlation of rate and p(choice) in LPFC. We pooled all trials and sorted them based on RPE/P(choice) Value. We then plot the raster of trials sorted according to the RPE and p(choice) and the pre-onset normalized heatmap.

The authors find that the activity of the narrow spiking cells in the LFPC is correlated with the choice probability, whereas the activity of narrow spiking cells in the ACC is correlated with reward prediction errors. Interestingly, the authors find that further splitting the population of broad and narrow spiking cells into subtypes revealed that both the choice probability in LPFC and the reward prediction error in the ACC were encoded by a specific subtype of putative interneuron. The authors show that the spike-field phase synchronization of this putative interneuron subgroup is also modulated by choice probability in the LFPC and reward prediction error in the ACC, mirroring the result from their single-unit correlation analysis.

Take the spike-LFP synchronization results shown in Figure S15, where it seems that the modulation of pairwise phase consistency with p(choice) could also be present for the B1 cluster of cells in addition to the N3 group (no stats shown).

I would recommend to the authors to move the two examples in Figure S10 to one of the main figures. In the first submission, the focus of the paper was predominantly on the N3 subtype and its specialized functional properties in ACC and LPFC. The new figures however (specifically Figure S15) show that the story is a little more mixed than originally presented.

We opted to leave the example raster in the supplementary figure because it is difficult to discern a correlation finding in example a raster plot and the average results appear more convincing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
