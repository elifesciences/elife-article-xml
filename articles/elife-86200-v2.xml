Gene expression analyses in LPS-activated wild-type and p38γ/δKIKO macrophages revealed that p38γ/p38δ-regulated numerous genes implicated in innate immune response. Additionally, phospho-proteomic analyses and in vitro kinase assays showed that the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2D (MEF2D) was phosphorylated at Ser444 via p38γ/p38δ.

The stimulation of pattern-recognition receptors, by pathogens or molecules from damaged cells, triggers the activation of p38MAPK and other signalling pathways that are critical to promote an innate immune response and production of inflammatory molecules (cytokines and other mediators) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaestel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>). It is well established that among the four p38MAPK isoforms (p38α (<italic>Mapk14</italic>), p38β (<italic>Mapk11</italic>), p38γ (<italic>Mapk12</italic>), and p38δ (<italic>Mapk13</italic>)), p38α is an inflammation modulator and has been considered as a therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases and related pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuenda and Sanz-Ezquerro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaestel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2020</xref>). However, clinical trials using potent p38α inhibitors have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen, 2009</xref>).</p><p>p38γ and p38δ (p38γ/p38δ) are closely related kinases and have largely redundant functions, which makes it difficult to study the specific functions of these kinases using single knock-out mice. Recent studies have analysed mice lacking both p38γ and p38δ (p38γ/δKO) kinases to demonstrate the importance of these kinases in the innate immune response and inflammation. p38γ/p38δ promote inflammation in several disease models, including sepsis, candidiasis, colitis, dermatitis, liver steatosis, arthritis, and cancer associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuenda and Sanz-Ezquerro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina-Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>). Biochemical studies have indicated an important role for p38γ/p38δ MAPKs in myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cuenda and Sanz-Ezquerro, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina-Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risco et al., 2012</xref>). The production of cytokines and chemokines triggered by C-type lectin receptor (Dectin-1) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation is reduced in macrophages lacking p38γ/p38δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina-Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>). Also, compound p38γ/p38δ deficiency substantially reduces <italic>Map3k8</italic> mRNA translation and TPL2 protein levels in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina-Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escós et al., 2022</xref>). TPL2 is the key MAP3-kinase upstream of the MKK1–extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in myeloid cells in innate immune responses. p38γ/δKO macrophages show impaired TLR activation of ERK1/2 and reduced production of key TPL2-regulated cytokines such as TNFα (Tumour necrosis factor α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina-Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risco et al., 2012</xref>), raising the possibility that the observed effects in p38γ/δKO mice could be due in part to the reduced steady-state levels of TPL2. However, p38γ/p38δ deficiency does not completely recapitulate the effects observed in TPL2-deficient (TPL2KO) mice suggesting specific p38γ/p38δ functions. For example, in a candidiasis mouse model, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection and cytokine production is reduced in p38γ/δKO mice, but increased in TPL2KO mice relative to wild-type (WT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsina-Beauchamp et al., 2018</xref>). Also, in a chemically induced colitis-associated colon cancer model, deletion of p38γ/p38δ decreases tumour development, whereas in TPL2KO mice tumour development is increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koliaraki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">del Reino et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the specific TPL2-independent functions of p38γ/p38δ in the innate immune responses, we generate a <italic>Mapk12</italic><sup>D171A/D171A</sup>/<italic>Mapk13</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (p38γ/δKIKO) mouse that expressed a catalytically inactive p38γ isoform and lacks p38δ. Here, we report that, in contrast to p38γ/δKO mice, p38γ/δKIKO mice show normal TPL2 protein levels, and therefore are a good tool to elucidate TPL2-independent roles of p38γ and p38δ in vivo. We studied p38γ/δKIKO mice inflammation and infection in two different mouse models of sepsis, and compared with WT mice. Also, we analysed the gene expression and protein phosphorylation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated p38γ/δKIKO macrophages, and found that these were different compared to WT macrophages. We demonstrate that p38γ/p38δ phosphorylate the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor-2D (MEF2D) at Ser444 (Ser437 in mouse), and that this phosphorylation modulates MEF2D’s transcriptional activity. MEF2D belongs to MEF2 family, is highly regulated by extracellular stimuli, and has been implicated in transcriptional control of cytokines in innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Based on this result and other findings in this study, we demonstrate the importance of p38γ and p38δ for innate immune responses and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of p38γ and p38δ activity would be beneficial in inflammatory diseases and infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of <italic>Mapk12</italic><sup>D171A/D171A</sup>, <italic>Mapk13</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (p38γ/δKIKO) mice</title><p>Since p38γ expression in p38γ/δKO cells restores TPL2 levels independently of its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escós et al., 2022</xref>), we decided to generate a p38γ/δKIKO mouse line by crossing <italic>Mapk12</italic><sup>D171A/D171A</sup> and <italic>Mapk13</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. p38γ/δKIKO mice, which have catalytically inactive p38γ and lack p38δ, will not have either p38γ or p38δ kinase activity, as p38γ/δKO mice. Genotype was confirmed by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). p38γ/δKIKO mice were viable and fertile and had no obvious health problems. Western blot analysis using p38γ and p38δ antibodies confirmed that p38γ/δKIKO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) did not express p38δ and expressed p38γ, although to lower levels to that of WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The expression levels of p38α, c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK1/2) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) were similar in p38γ/δKIKO and in WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In response to osmotic stress induced by sorbitol all signalling pathways were activated in p38γ/δKIKO and WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Osmotic shock caused p38γ phosphorylation in both WT and p38γ/δKIKO MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>); however, phosphorylation of the protein hDlg at Ser158, a physiological p38γ substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sabio et al., 2005</xref>), was only observed in WT, but not in p38γ/δKIKO MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), confirming that the p38γ expressed in p38γ/δKIKO cells is catalytically inactive.</p><p>We next examined Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) stimulation by LPS in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Differentiation of bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells to macrophages was not affected in p38γ/δKIKO mice, as indicated by the expression of macrophage-specific membrane protein marker F4/80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that WT and p38γ/δKIKO BMDM exhibited similar levels of TPL2, whereas TPL2 expression was severely reduced in p38γ/δKO cells as found previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A20 Binding Inhibitor of NF-κB2 (ABIN2), a TPL2-associated protein, was expressed in WT and p38γ/δKIKO macrophages, but was not in p38γ/δKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As TPL2 mediates TLR activation of ERK1/2 signalling in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gantke et al., 2011</xref>), we next analysed the activation of ERK1/2, as well as JNK1/2, p38α and the canonical NF-κB pathway, whose activation is triggered by TLR4 stimulation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gaestel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee and Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Takeuchi and Akira, 2010</xref>). ERK1/2 activation in p38γ/δKIKO BMDM was similar to that in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We also confirmed that the activation of ERK1/2 was impaired in p38γ/δKO macrophages compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Phosphorylation of NF-κB1 p105 (p105) and activation loop phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38α were similar in all three LPS-stimulated WT, p38γ/δKIKO, and p38γ/δKO BMDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These results indicate that TPL2 protein levels, and therefore activation of the ERK1/2 pathway by TLR4, were regulated by p38γ independently of its kinase activity. Accordingly, we have recently demonstrated that p38γ, and also p38δ, kinase-independent activity regulates the amount of TPL2 protein at two posttranscriptional levels: (1) increasing TPL2 protein stability by binding to the complex TPL2/ABIN2/Nuclear Factor-κB1p105 (NF-κB1p105), and (2) modulating <italic>Map3k8</italic> mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Escós et al., 2022</xref>).

We observed that the relative luciferase activity was significantly higher when cells, regardless of the genotype, were transfected with MEF2D. In both conditions, we found a marked increase in luciferase activity in p38γ/δKO and p38γ/δKIKO cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). MEF2D expression levels were similar under each experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the transcriptional activity of MEF2D was significantly much higher in p38γ/δKO than in p38γ/δKIKO cells suggesting that, in addition to phosphorylation, the interaction of p38γ with MEF2D or with other protein might be affecting MEF2D transcriptional activity; this question could be addressed in future works. Next, we analysed the effect of the p38MAPK inhibitor BIRB796 on MEF2D transcriptional activity. Since this compound inhibits all four (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) p38MAPK isoforms, we also used in parallel the compound SB203580 that blocks p38α and p38β only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kuma et al., 2005</xref>), so we could determine which effect was caused by p38α/p38β or by p38γ/p38δ inhibition. Incubation with BIRB796, but not with SB203580 significantly increased luciferase activity in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that p38γ and p38δ activity regulates MEF2D-mediated transcription. In p38γ/δKO cells, luciferase activity was significantly and equally increased by SB20358 and BIRB796, suggesting that p38α can control MEF2D activity in the absence of p38γ/p38δ. The expression levels of transfected MEF2D were similar under each experimental condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>MEF2D transcriptional activity is modulated by phosphorylation, and phosphorylation at different MEF2D sites has different effects in its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ke et al., 2015</xref>). For example, MEF2D transcriptional activity is increased after phosphorylation at Thr259, Ser275, Ser294, and Ser314 by the kinase Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2014</xref>), or at Ser179 by ERK5 in Hela cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2000</xref>). However, phosphorylation of MEF2D at Ser251 by DYRK1, in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2021</xref>)<italic>,</italic> or of Ser444 by Cdk5, has been implicated in the repression of MEF2D transcriptional activity in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tang et al., 2005</xref>). Particularly, it has been shown that Ser444 phosphorylation by Cdk5 is required for the sumoylation of Lys439, which regulates MEF2D transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grégoire et al., 2006</xref>). MEF2D-Ser444 was phosphorylated in vitro by p38δ, and phosphorylation at this residue was decreased in p38γ/δKO and p38γ/δKIKO cells compared to WT cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). Consistently, the expression of <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Cd14</italic>, <italic>Hdac7</italic>, <italic>Nos2</italic>, and <italic>Il1b</italic> mRNA, which are MEF2D-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han and Prywes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Park et al., 2002</xref>), is increased by the lack of p38γ/p38δ activity. We then mutated Ser444 to Ala to generate MEF2D-Ser444Ala (MEF2D<sup>S444A</sup>) mutant and study its effect on MEF2D transcriptional activity in WT cells. Transfection of MEF2D<sup>S444A</sup> mutant caused a significant increase in luciferase activity compared to MEF2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), similarly to that observed in p38γ/δKIKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The expression levels of transfected MEF2D and MEF2D-S444A were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Mice and cells expressing inactive kinases are powerful tools: (1) in the study of the role of kinase binding interactions that are independent of the kinase catalytic activity, (2) to also avoid unspecific side effects caused by the treatment with small molecule inhibitors, and (3) to overcome the problems of protein compensation, due to kinase functional redundancy, inherent in assessing kinase function using knock-out mice or cells.</p><p>p38MAPK are a clear example of highly related family members with functional redundancies, which may account for the difficulty on finding altered phenotypes in the p38γ- or p38δ-null mice. This highlights the need for using mice expressing inactive kinases in combination with knock-out mice in the study of the role of these kinases. Here we demonstrate with the use of p38γ/δKIKO mice, that p38γ/p38δ are implicated in the immune response modulating the expression of inflammatory genes and the phosphorylation of regulatory proteins such as the transcription factor MEF2D. Phosphorylation analysis revealed that p38δ phosphorylated recombinant MEF2D more efficiently than p38γ, suggesting that MEF2D is a better substrate for p38δ than for p38γ, at least in vitro. These data support that despite the functional redundancies of p38δ and p38γ, there are also specific substrates, and therefore biological roles, for each kinase. For example, we have recently shown that p38δ is a better kinase phosphorylating the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK) 1 than p38γ, in vitro. Also, p38δ mediates the phosphorylation and activation of MSK1, in LPS-stimulated macrophages, as well as the phosphorylation of the MSK1 substrates, the transcription factors CREB and ATF1, and the expression of MSK1-dependent genes such as <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Il1ra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diaz-Mora et al., 2023</xref>). All these evidence suggest that p38δ specifically regulates the production of some inflammatory proteins via MSK1 and also MEF2D, whereas p38γ may have different functions through the phosphorylation of other substrates.</p><p>Research using p38γ/δKIKO mice, or alternatively a mouse expressing both inactive p38γ and p38δ, will be of great help to investigate which inflammatory diseases are dependent on p38γ/p38δ catalytic activity. This aspect is very important for the development of p38γ/p38δ inhibitors to treat inflammatory diseases and also cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation and genotyping of <italic>MAPK12</italic><sup>D171A/D171A</sup>/<italic>MAPK13</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (p38γ/δKIKO) mice</title><p>p38γ/δKIKO mouse were produced by crossing <italic>MAPK12</italic><sup>D171A/D171A</sup> and <italic>MAPK13</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and genotype was confirmed by PCR as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sabio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sabio et al., 2010</xref>).

Phosphopeptide enrichment procedure concatenated two in-house packed microcolumns, Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) and Oligo R3 polymeric reversed-phase that provided selective purification and sample desalting prior to liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)/MS analysis, and was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Navajas et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Protein identification by tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS Exploris 240)</title><p>The peptide samples were analysed on a nano liquid chromatography system (Ultimate 3000 nano HPLC system, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples (5 μl) were injected on a C18 PepMap trap column (5 µm, 100 µm I.D. × 2 cm, Thermo Scientific) at 10 µl/min, in 0.1% FA in water, and the trap column was switched on-line to a C18 PepMap Easy-spray analytical column (2 µm, 100 Å, 75 µm I.D. × 50 cm, Thermo Scientific). Equilibration was done in mobile phase A (0.1% FA in water), and peptide elution was achieved in a 30-min gradient from 4 to 50% B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN) at 250 nl/min. Data acquisition was performed using a data-dependent top 15 method, in full scan positive mode (range of 350–1200 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>). Survey scans were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200, with Normalized Automatic Gain Control (AGC) target of 300% and a maximum injection time (IT) of 45 ms. The top 15 most intense ions from each MS1 scan were selected and fragmented by HCD of 28. Resolution for HCD spectra was set to 15,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 200, with AGC target of 75% and maximum ion injection time of 80 ms. Precursor ions with single, unassigned, or six and higher charge states from fragmentation selection were excluded.</p><p>MS and MS/MS raw data were translated to mascot general file (mgf) format using Proteome Discoverer (PD) version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and searched using an in-house Mascot Server v. 2.7 (Matrix Science, London, UK) against a human database (reference proteome from Uniprot Knowledgebase). Search parameters considered fixed carbamidomethyl modification of cysteine, and the following variable modifications: methionine oxidation, phosphorylation of serine/threonine/tyrosine, deamidation of asparagine/glutamine, and acetylation of the protein N-terminus. Peptide mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, in MS and MS/MS mode, respectively, and three missed cleavages were allowed. The Mascot confidence interval for protein identification was set to ≥95% (p &lt; 0.05) and only peptides with a significant individual ion score of at least 30 were considered. If there were two or more residues susceptible to phosphorylation in such a way that an alternative fragment ion assignment was possible, Mascot provided information on the probability percentage that the considered residue is phosphorylated (site analysis), so that percentages above 80% usually correspond to a highly reliable assignment of the phosphorylation site. In addition, manual validation of the identified phosphopeptides was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>LPS/D-Gal-induced endotoxic shock</title><p>A combination of <italic>E. coli</italic> 0111:B LPS (50 μg/kg body weight) (Sigma-Aldrich) and D-Gal (1 g/kg body weight) (Sigma-Aldrich) was simultaneously injected intraperitoneally in 12-week-old WT, p38γ/δKO, and p38γ/δKIKO mice of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risco et al., 2012</xref>).

Gene expression analyses revealed that p38γ/p38δ regulated the expression of numerous genes implicated in the innate immune response. However, the lack of consistent results, not only between the two different mouse models of sepsis but also between the in vivo and in vitro models of LPS stimulation, decreases the impact of the results. For example, the level of the CCL2 transcript is significantly lower in the kidney of p38γ/δKIKO mice compared with that of the WT after fungal infection (Figure 2D). In contrast, p38γ/δKIKO macrophages stimulated with LPS produced significantly more CCL2 than WT macrophages (Figure S3D). The IL6 mRNA level is significantly lower in the kidney of p38γ/δKIKO mice after fungal infection compared with that of the WT (Figure 2D), whereas no differences are observed in the LPS-induced septic shock model (Figure 2F). Although one p38γ/p38δ do not appear to be required for mediating the increase in IL6 mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Figure 3F), the production of IL6 is significantly lower in LPS-stimulated p38γ/δKIKO macrophages (Figure S3D). Moreover, there is no strong correlation between the changes in RNA levels associated with p38γ/δKIKO and the amount of cytokines/chemokines produced. Although one can argue that fungal infection, LPS-induced septic shock, and in vitro activation of macrophages by LPS, are not directly comparable, the authors should systematically analyse the same panel of inflammatory mediators (e.g. CCL2, CCL5, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, iNOS) in these models to identify specific inflammatory mediators downstream p38γ/δ.</p><p>2. Evidence that p38γ/δ regulate the transcriptional activity of MEF2D is performed in fibroblasts (Figure 5B-E). This result must be confirmed in macrophages. In particular, the authors should show that (i) MEF2D is indeed a substrate of p38δ in macrophages and (ii) p38γ/δ-mediated phosphorylation of MEF2D at Ser444 negatively regulate expression of iNOS and IL-1β transcripts in macrophage.</p><p>3. The biological significance of p38γ/p38δ in macrophages in the context of septic shock has not been addressed. Therefore, an additional experiment should be performed to confirm that p38γ/δKIKO monocytes/macrophages isolated from the kidney, bone marrow, and/or blood after septic shock, exhibit impaired production of inflammatory mediators (e.g. CCL2, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, iNOS) – a hypothesis supported by the in vitro data. These experiments would provide further evidence that decreased fungal burden (Figure 2A) and increased survival after LPS-induced septic shock (Figure 2E-I) is a consequence of an abnormal innate immune response caused by the functional loss of p38γ/p38δ signaling in macrophages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below there are several points that should be addressed to clarify the information presented and make the story more convincing.</p><p>1. On page 10, and several other places of the text and figure legends, when referring to changes in expression of at least 1.5 fold it is written: -1.5&lt; logFC &lt;1.5. If I understand it correctly, this means logFC &lt;-1.5 for downregulated genes and logFC &gt;1.5 for upregulated genes. Then shouldn´t the correct formulation be -1.5&gt; logFC &gt;1.5?</p><p>2. Please explain in the text or figure legends the difference between the data presented in Figure 3C and in FigS3A.</p><p>3. The enrichment analysis of Figure 3E was done using the differentially expressed genes in LPS-activated p38g/dKIKO macrophages, according to the legend, but it is not clear if this refers to p38g/dKIKO treated with LPS vs untreated, or excluding genes that are common with LPS-treated WT, i.e. 95 or 53 genes in Figure 3C, LPS 30 min Down? Please clarify.</p><p>4. Figure 4D – write phosphopeptides instead of peptides in the figure.</p><p>5. Figure 4E, the legend mentions that kinase assays using MBP were also performed but are not presented in the figure. It would be interesting to show the MBP assays together with the GST-MEF2D assays to confirm that similar kinase activity levels were used in the four samples. Based on the Coomassie, it looks like there is less protein for p38g than for the other three.</p><p>6. It is surprising that p38g only poorly phosphorylates MEF2D, given the overlapping functions reported for p38g and p38d in macrophages. It would be useful to briefly discuss the implications of this observation.</p><p>7. Figure 5B, *** is indicated in the legend but not in the figure.</p><p>8. Figure 5D, to interpret this result correctly it would be important to show that the expression levels of MEF2D WT and S444A proteins are similar.</p><p>9. Figure 5E, it is not clear how these quantifications were performed. Is there any difference in the expression levels of those genes between fibroblasts expressing MEF2D WT and S444A without LPS treatment? Are Flag-MEF2D WT and S444A expressed at similar levels?</p><p>10. Figure S4A, the blots show a clear reduction in the levels of both P-p38a and P-ERK1/2 in LPS-treated WT vs p38g/dKIKO macrophages, which could be around 50%. These changes might or might not contribute to the phospho-proteome differences reported in figure 4 between the two samples, but it would be informative to present a histogram with the quantification of the two experiments performed.</p><p>11. There are some discrepancies between the information in Figure S5B and in Table 1. According to S5B: S121 is similarly phosphorylated in control and p38a, S180, and S231 are not phosphorylated in control. S98 seems also poorly phosphorylated in control. Data for S192 is not included in S5B.</p><p>To clarify the message, I suggest using the following three signs instead of x in Table 1: – no or poor phosphorylation detected, + phosphorylation detected, and ++ stronger phosphorylation detected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86200.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 5B-D.

Figure 5D, to interpret this result correctly it would be important to show that the expression levels of MEF2D WT and S444A proteins are similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the point made by the reviewers is important and we have now included those results in new Figure 5D. The expression levels of MEF2D WT and S444A proteins are similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 5E, it is not clear how these quantifications were performed. Is there any difference in the expression levels of those genes between fibroblasts expressing MEF2D WT and S444A without LPS treatment? Are Flag-MEF2D WT and S444A expressed at similar levels?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5E, results were normalized to β-actin RNA expression and fold induction calculated relative to that in cells expressing Flag-MEF2D WT at time 0 of LPS. We have now included data at time 0 LPS in new Figure 5E. We found that, at time 0, gene expression was increased in fibroblasts expressing MEF2D S444A.</p><p>As shown in Figure 5D Flag-MEF2D WT and S444A were expressed at similar levels in MEFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure S4A, the blots show a clear reduction in the levels of both P-p38a and P-ERK1/2 in LPS-treated WT vs p38g/dKIKO macrophages, which could be around 50%. These changes might or might not contribute to the phospho-proteome differences reported in figure 4 between the two samples, but it would be informative to present a histogram with the quantification of the two experiments performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the P-p38a and P-ERK1/2 bands in the two experiments, as the reviewer asked. These data are now shown in new Figure S4A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. There are some discrepancies between the information in Figure S5B and in Table 1. According to S5B: S121 is similarly phosphorylated in control and p38a, S180, and S231 are not phosphorylated in control. S98 seems also poorly phosphorylated in control. Data for S192 is not included in S5B.</p><p>To clarify the message, I suggest using the following three signs instead of x in Table 1: – no or poor phosphorylation detected, + phosphorylation detected, and ++ stronger phosphorylation detected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the changes that the reviewer suggested in Table 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
