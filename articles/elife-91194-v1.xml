In <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, the endocytic machinery is under special selective pressure because rapid membrane recycling is essential for immune evasion. This unicellular parasite effectively removes host antibodies from its cell surface through hydrodynamic drag and fast endocytic internalization. The entire process of membrane recycling occurs exclusively through the flagellar pocket, an extracellular organelle situated at the posterior pole of the spindle-shaped cell. The high-speed dynamics of membrane flux in trypanosomes do not seem compatible with the conventional concept of distinct compartments for early endosomes (EE), late endosomes (LE), and recycling endosomes (RE). To investigate the underlying structural basis for the remarkably fast membrane traffic in trypanosomes, we employed advanced techniques in light and electron microscopy to examine the three-dimensional architecture of the endosomal system. Our findings reveal that the endosomal system in trypanosomes exhibits a remarkably intricate structure. Instead of being compartmentalized, it constitutes a continuous membrane system, with specific functions of the endosome segregated into membrane subdomains enriched with classical markers for EE, LE, and RE. These membrane subdomains can partly overlap or are interspersed with areas that are negative for endosomal markers. This continuous endosome allows fast membrane flux by facilitated diffusion that is not slowed by multiple fission and fusion events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane recycling</kwd><kwd>African trypanosomes</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>rab proteins</kwd><kwd>Tokuyasu</kwd><kwd>tomography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-473-416.13/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>426173797 (INST 93/1003-1 FUGG) 218894163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stigloher</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>88881.199683/2018-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borges</surname><given-names>Alyssa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019180</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>835102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sauer</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPP1726</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The endosomal apparatus of African trypanosomes consists a continuous membrane system with functional subdomains rather than distinct compartments for early, late, and recycling endosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endocytosis research has traditionally focussed on a limited number of organisms, primarily opisthokonts (including yeast and humans). Recently, using the extensive genetic and cell biological resources now available for studying numerous other organisms, studies on protists such as <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, or trypanosomes have revealed remarkable deviations from the hitherto existing understanding of the processes of endo- and exocytosis described in textbooks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benchimol and de Souza, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Link et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGovern et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vines and King, 2019</xref>). Looking at the distinct evolutionary solutions for endosomal recycling across different branches of the eukaryotes, these protists, and especially the parasites among them, are of particular interest.</p><p>Throughout their life cycle, parasites often encounter a series of inherently hostile environments. The arms race between the parasite and its host has resulted in coevolutionary processes characterized by intense reciprocal selective pressures. Although parasite and host use similar basic cell biological pathways, parasites have often optimized these, either to achieve maximum efficiency or to establish additional functions. In this regard, the endocytosis and membrane recycling mechanisms observed in African trypanosomes serve as a remarkable illustration of the exceptional functional adaptations exhibited by parasites in response to their specific host environments.</p><p><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> is a representative of the group Discoba, which diverged before the appearance of opisthokonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strassert et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>T. brucei</italic> is an exclusively extracellular parasite, that resists the harsh conditions within the bloodstream, interstitial fluids, and lymph and thus thrives in the body fluids of its vertebrate host. Additionally, the cells have adapted to entirely distinct, yet equally challenging environments within the transmitting insect vector, <italic>Glossina</italic> (tsetse fly). Within the midgut of the fly, the trypanosomes proliferate to very high densities and, following a several week long journey, attach to the insect salivary glands before being injected back into the host skin during the bloodmeal of the tsetse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rose et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The extracellular lifestyle of <italic>T. brucei</italic> renders the parasite vulnerable to constant attacks by the host’s immune system. In response, these parasites have evolved a protective surface coat covering the entire plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cross, 1975</xref>). This coat comprises a single type of variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) and forms the basis of antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mugnier et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>T. brucei</italic> possesses hundreds of VSG genes that encode structurally similar yet antigenically distinct proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor and Rudenko, 2006</xref>). However, only one VSG gene is expressed at a time, originating from a polycistronic expression site located at the telomere of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaves et al., 1999</xref>). The stochastic switching to the expression of a new VSG guarantees that the parasites remain ahead of the host immune response.</p><p>Antigenic variation is not the sole defense strategy employed against the host’s immune reaction. During immune attack, parasites actively remove anti-VSG antibodies from their cell surface. This process of antibody clearance is driven by hydrodynamic drag forces resulting from the continuous directional movement of trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engstler et al., 2007</xref>). The VSG–antibody complexes on the cell surface are dragged against the swimming direction of the parasite and accumulate at the posterior pole of the cell. This region harbours an invagination in the plasma membrane known as the flagellar pocket (FP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gull, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Overath et al., 1997</xref>). The FP, which marks the origin of the single attached flagellum, is the exclusive site for endo- and exocytosis in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gull, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Overath et al., 1997</xref>). Consequently, the accumulation of VSG–antibody complexes occurs precisely in the area of bulk membrane uptake. For the process of antibody clearance to function efficiently, several conditions must be met. The VSG coat must be densely packed to prevent immune recognition of non-variant surface proteins, VSG must be highly mobile to allow the drag forces to take effect, and endocytosis must be sufficiently rapid to internalize the VSG–antibody complexes effectively. Furthermore, endosomal sorting and membrane recycling must keep pace with the bulk membrane uptake to maintain membrane balance. In fact, the VSG coat is as densely packed as physically possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartel et al., 2016</xref>) and VSG molecules possess a flexible C-terminal domain attached via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borges et al., 2021</xref>). This lipid anchoring enables the highly dynamic behaviour of the VSG coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartossek et al., 2017</xref>), further facilitated by <italic>N</italic>-glycans that insulate VSG molecules, thereby minimizing protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartel et al., 2016</xref>). VSG molecules exhibit diffusion on the plasma membrane with coefficients that enable fast randomization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hartel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwebs et al., 2022</xref>). This rapid VSG diffusion is precisely balanced with membrane recycling kinetics, with one surface equivalent being internalized and recycled within 12 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>). This exceptionally fast endocytosis is crucial for antibody clearance.</p><p>To summarize, <italic>T. brucei</italic> has evolved a series of interconnected cell biological adaptations in order to evade the immune system, ranging from a highly polarized cell structure and constant directional motion to the generation of a variable, densely packed yet highly mobile cell surface coat, as well as an unusually rapid endocytosis machinery. The strong selective pressure acting on trypanosomes has led to the integration and coordination of seemingly unrelated features, such as cell motility, surface protein dynamics, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, protein sorting, and membrane recycling. This illustrates the extraordinary cell biology of parasitic protozoa, which offers functional linkages beyond that of yeast or mammalian cells.</p><p>In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, the process of endocytosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Link et al., 2021</xref>) begins with the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) at the FP membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morgan et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequently, both membrane-bound VSG and fluid-phase cargo pass through early endosomes (EE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>). From this compartment, both either move directly to the recycling endosomes (RE) and return to the cell surface or first pass from the EE to the late endosomes (LE) before returning to the surface via the RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>). Alternatively, fluid-phase cargo can be directed from LEs to the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>). In comparison, less is known about the biosynthetic pathway to the lysosome. Endogenous proteins like TbCatL, a soluble thiol protease, and p67, a membrane glycoprotein, are segregated from secretory cargo in the Golgi apparatus. They are then transported out of the Golgi, probably in a clathrin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tazeh et al., 2009</xref>). An alternative route to the lysosome was discovered by disrupting transport signals in endogenous proteins, for example by blocking of GPI anchor addition to VSGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Triggs and Bangs, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Similar to other eukaryotic organisms, the trafficking process through various endosomal compartments is regulated by a core set of three small Rab-GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackers et al., 2005</xref>). TbRab5 and TbRab11 are responsible for controlling trafficking through the EE and RE, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Field et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pal et al., 2003</xref>). TbRab7 plays a role in regulating late endocytic trafficking to the lysosome, but does not appear to be involved in the biosynthetic trafficking of either native lysosomal proteins or default reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silverman et al., 2011</xref>). TbRab5A-positive endosomal structures have been described by immuno-electron microscopy as circular or elongated cisternae, while TbRab7-positive structures exhibit an irregular shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Overath and Engstler, 2004</xref>). Additionally, TbRab11-positive structures are characterized as either elongated cisternae or disk-shaped exocytic carriers (EXCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>). Apart from EXCs, the exocyst is currently the only proposed mediator of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A thorough examination of the kinetics of endosomal recycling has validated the rapid passage through various endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>). However, these analyses have not addressed how the kinetics can be reconciled with the occurrence of multiple fission and fusion events that are thought to accompany endosomal transport through these compartments.</p><p>Here, we have employed a comprehensive set of techniques to scrutinize the ultrastructure of specific endosomal subdomains in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. In addition to utilizing electron tomography, super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, and colocalization analysis, we have introduced Tokuyasu sectioning for 3D immuno-electron microscopy. These tools allowed us to elucidate the structural basis for the remarkable speed of endosomal recycling in trypanosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The endosomal apparatus of <italic>T. brucei</italic> is a large intricate structure</title><p>In order to generate an overview of the endosomal ultrastructure in bloodstream form (BSF) trypanosomes, we performed electron tomography after fluid-phase cargo uptake assays with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and ferritin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Analysis of the reconstructed electron tomograms of various BSF cells revealed a morphologically intricate system of endosomes comprised of interconnected and fenestrated membrane networks. The main endosome, spanning the posterior region of the cell from the vicinity of the FP to the Golgi apparatus, exhibited elongated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>) and circular membrane sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>), encompassing a volume with a diameter of approximately 2 µm and a length of 4 µm. The localization of endosomes was strictly confined to the posterior cytoplasm. Their precise positioning, however, appeared to be flexible, indicating a lack of direct and rigid connection with the microtubule cytoskeleton. This observation is not surprising, as there are no reports of cytoplasmic microtubules in trypanosomes. All microtubules appear to be either subpellicular or within the flagellum. However, it is very likely that a scaffold is necessary to maintain the intricate membrane structure of the endosomal system, especially given the constant deformation of the cell body by the beating of the attached flagellum. The electron tomograms further suggest that the large size of the endosomes may render them unable to pass through the space between the nucleus and pellicular microtubules. Another notable finding was the proximity of endosomes to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), suggesting a potential involvement of the endosomal system in post-Golgi transport.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tomographic reconstructions of the endosomal apparatus of <italic>T.</italic> <italic>brucei</italic> after cargo uptake reveal a large and mostly continuous membrane system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Elongated and highly fenestrated endosomal sheets and palisades.

Interestingly, these tomograms did not exhibit the fenestration pattern identified in traditional electron tomography. We suspect that this is due to methodological reasons. The Tokuyasu procedure uses only aldehydes to fix all structures. Consequently, effective fixation of lipids occurs only through their association with membrane proteins.

Apart from exhibiting antigenic variation across hundreds of coat variants, the VSG proteins are attached to the cell surface through GPI moieties, enabling their remarkable mobility. Exploiting this feature, the parasites evade early immune responses by clearing antibodies. This evasion process hinges upon the highly polarized nature of the trypanosome cell body, with exclusive endocytic uptake occurring at the posterior end, coupled with an exceptionally rapid membrane recycling rate. The prevailing model of the endosomal system, consisting of distinct compartments for EE, LE, and RE, seems incompatible with the observed rapid turnover rates in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Nevertheless, the parasite expresses the canonical Rab GTPases which serve as markers for these endosomal compartments, such as Rab5 (EE), Rab7 (LE), and Rab11 (RE). To resolve this apparent contradiction, we performed a structure–function analysis of the trypanosome endosome apparatus.</p><p>3D electron tomography reconstructions, utilizing cargo uptake assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> ), revealed a complex network of endosomal structures in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. These compartments were characterized by interconnected fenestrated sheets, circular cisternae, and tubular structures, that formed a single intricate endosome. Our results shine a new light on transmission electron microscopic (TEM) studies of the trypanosome endomembrane system (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Link et al., 2021</xref>). Based on 2D information the giant endosomal sheets had been interpreted as extended tubular structures, fenestrations as vesicles and the connective areas as irregularly shaped structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Overath and Engstler, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, tubular endosomes constitute a major part of the endosomal system. Tubules possess a higher surface area-to-volume ratio compared to vacuolar regions. As a result, they have been proposed to geometrically sort membrane-associated proteins over soluble cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mayor et al., 1993</xref>). It is assumed that the carrier tubules, following detachment, transport their cargo either to the plasma membrane or to the RE.</p><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> lacks elongated tubulo-vesicular structures. Furthermore, our tomographic analysis did not reveal the conventional tubular carriers (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chi et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, in these parasites, geometric sorting most likely occurs at the rims of flat, fenestrated sheets. A specific class of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCV II) pinches off from these strongly curved membrane areas. They transport bulky fluid-phase cargo and membrane protein complexes (such as VSG<sup>IgG</sup>) to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grünfelder et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The sorting mechanism into CCV II vesicles could be a purely physical process. Both the fenestrated sheets and circular cisternae exhibit the same inner width of about 35 nm. The VSG coat occupies 2 × 15 nm of this width, significantly limiting the available volume for fluid-phase cargo. As the VSG concentration in the membrane increases, the bulky cargo is pushed towards the edges of the sheets, resulting in further membrane deformation that facilitates the recruitment of clathrin. The VSG is excluded from the CCV II and thus not transported to the lysosome. How this works mechanistically is unknown, however, it is tempting to speculate that the geometric sorting of larger cargo into the CCV II, sterically excludes VSG.</p><p>The electron tomographic analysis of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> endosome yielded compelling evidence of an extensive and interconnected membrane system. While this conclusion is supported by a substantial number of tomograms, the technique is not well suited for quantitative analyses.</p><p>Therefore, we conducted super-resolution microscopy and cargo uptake assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To analyse the full 3D volume of the cell, ExM was conducted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The visualized endosomal network looked like the elongated and circular structures found in the reconstruction of the electron tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While the elongated structures could easily correspond to the fenestrated sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the circular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle row, image III, arrow) nicely recapitulates the morphology of a circular cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, dividing cells (possessing two kinetoplasts and two FPs) always showed a fluorescence signal corresponding to the endosomal system juxtaposed only to the ‘old’ FP, indicating that the duplication of the endosomal network might occur de novo during the cell cycle. This is currently speculation and requires more in-depth analysis. The 3D presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) confirmed the continuity of the endosomal membranes, which had been seen already in the electron tomography.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>d</italic>STORM or SIM, ExM offers a selective perspective on the trypanosome endosomal system. To date, ExM has been effectively employed to visualize cell structures associated with the cytoskeleton or other stabilizing supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alonso, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amodeo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorilak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalichava and Ochsenreiter, 2021</xref>). However, we could not find any published ExM images of endosomes. Our initial efforts to identify endosomal markers using ExM were also unsuccessful. Only when we added the inert fluid-phase cargo dextran did the endosomes become clearly visible. This was likely due to the stabilizing effect of the cargo.</p><p>Having established that the endosomes in trypanosomes likely form a continuous cellular structure, our next inquiry was whether this would be evident in the simultaneous presence of the canonical marker proteins TbRab5A, TbRab7, and TbRab11. To define the ROI in 3D immunofluorescence microscopy, we utilized the previously established fluorescent marker EP1::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engstler and Boshart, 2004</xref>), which stains the entire endosomal system. MIPs of multichannel images indicated that the TbRabs were closely juxtaposed but in distinct endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, upper row). This finding aligns with the results of a previously published quantitative colocalization analysis of TbRab5A and TbRab7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engstler et al., 2004</xref>). However, the presentation as 3D objects already implied an overlap between the different marker proteins. The present study now reveals that endosomal sheets can easily span over several micrometres, which fundamentally alters the interpretation of the light microscopy colocalization data. Thus, the seemingly separate structures could well be subdomains of the same membrane structure.</p><p>We therefore performed quantitative colocalization analyses with all marker combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The degree of colocalization was assessed by determining the percentage of overlap for the volume of one TbRab marker colocalized with another. Notably, TbRab5A and TbRab7 exhibited a significantly higher percentage of overlap (about 53%) compared to the other marker combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). An overlap of Rab5 and Rab7 has also been found in mammalian cells where it has been attributed to a temporary phenomenon during the maturation of EE to LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Podinovskaia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Beek et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, TbRab7 exhibited a higher degree of colocalization with TbRab11 (45%) than TbRab5A showed with TbRab11 (35%). This observation could indicate a functional polarization within the FP. TbRab11 is known to decorate disk-shaped structures called EXCs, which transport the recycled VSG coat back to the cell surface. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2017</xref> report that in the FP endocytic and exocytic sites are in close proximity but do not overlap. We further suggest that the fusion of EXCs with the FP membrane and clathrin-mediated endocytosis take place on different sites of the pocket. This disparity explains the lower colocalization between TbRab11 and TbRab5A. It is worth noting that the mechanism by which Golgi-derived membrane and cargo are transported to the FP in trypanosomes remains unclear. In our view, the most plausible scenario involves feeding into the rapid endocytic recycling pathway, which is further supported by the absence of tubular carriers as observed in mammals.</p><p>Quantitative colocalization analysis by 3D IF provides statistically valid results, however, has the obvious limitation that it lacks ultrastructural information. Therefore, we analysed the localization of the different TbRab proteins on cryo-electron micrographs. This finally proved that different TbRab markers can be found on the same membrane structures and argues against the existence of distinct early, late, and recycling endosomal compartments in <italic>T. brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). An alternative explanation for the two marker proteins residing on the same membrane would be the endosome maturation model, which has been proposed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stoorvogel et al., 1991</xref>). In short, EE undergo maturation and transform into late endosomes through a series of changes. This maturation process involves the acquisition of new membrane proteins and enzymes that among others facilitate a decrease in the pH value. Ultimately, the late endosomes fuse with lysosomes, leading to cargo degradation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Podinovskaia and Spang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>EM cryosections provide high-resolution 2D information. To gain volume information, we resorted to an extremely demanding technique that combines ultrastructural 3D information with immunodetection. 3D Tokuyasu has not been applied to trypanosomes and the utilization of 3D immunogold has not been used on endosomes in any system. The Tokuyasu tomograms clearly showed the connection of circular cisternae and sheet-like structures in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The decoration with different endosomal marker proteins demonstrated the existence of functional subdomains within a giant endosomal membrane system convincingly, and finally offered an explanation to the fundamental question of how trypanosomes can combine endosomal functionality with very fast membrane recycling.</p><p>Our work has certainly raised more questions than it has answered. One puzzling aspect is the presence of extended sheet-like endosomal structures that display sparse or no labelling of TbRab proteins. This is particularly intriguing when considering the substantial membrane area covered by these sheets. It is tempting to speculate that the absence of canonical markers correlates with a lack of endosomal function. We postulate that these sheets represent ‘endosomal highways’ that support fast flow of cargo by facilitated diffusion. This may allow for the efficient transport of VSG and fluid-phase cargo between distinct functional endosomal subdomains, which can be in close proximity or at a distance of microns apart. Consequently, the slow vesicular trafficking process in trypanosomes could be limited to CCVs, originating either from the FP or the rims of fenestrated sheets and cisternae, as well as to Rab11-positive EXCs.</p><p>Interestingly, we did not find any structural evidence of vesicular retrograde transport to the Golgi. Instead, the endosomal ‘highways’ extended throughout the posterior volume of the trypanosomes approaching the trans-Golgi interface. It is highly plausible that this region represents the convergence point where endocytic and biosynthetic membrane trafficking pathways merge. A comparable merging of endocytic and biosynthetic functions has been described for the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in plants. Different marker proteins for EE and RE were shown to be associated and/ or partially colocalized with the TGN suggesting its function in both secretory and endocytic pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minamino and Ueda, 2019</xref>). As we could not find structural evidence for the existence of a TGN we tentatively propose that trypanosomes may have shifted the central orchestrating function of the TGN as a sorting hub at the crossroads of biosynthetic and recycling pathways to the endosome. Although this is a speculative scenario, it is experimentally testable.</p><p>In summary, we confirmed the endosomal identity of the analysed membranes with the aid of cargo uptake assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), transgenic cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) as well as immuno labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) combined with various light and electron microscopy methods. In the process, we ensured that all examined membranes belonged to the endosomal system and we did not, for example, mischaracterize ER membranes as endosomal membranes. All our results suggest that the endosomal apparatus consists of a continuous membrane system with TbRab5A-, TbRab7-, or TbRab11-positive subdomains that can be dynamically formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, the overall architecture of the trypanosome endosomes represents an adaptation that has facilitated the extreme speed of plasma membrane recycling observed in these organisms.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the endosomal system in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>brucei</italic>.</title><p>The endosome is marked by the presence of small GTPases of the Rab family: Rab5A (yellow dots), Rab7 (cyan dots), and Rab11 (red dots).

All elutions were then separately dialysed overnight against a 20-mM phosphate buffer (2.7 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 17.3 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) at 4°C. The purification success was validated by 15% SDS–PAGE and proteins were sent to different companies for antibody generation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Antibody generation</title><p>Recombinant full-size proteins were used to immunize different animals (Pineda, Berlin, Germany; Davids Biotechnology, Regensburg, Germany; Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The resulting antisera were affinity purified against the immobilized recombinant protein. The resulting antisera from two rats (anti-TbRab5A) showed no need for affinity purification. All antibodies were validated for selectivity through immunoblots of the corresponding RNAi cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>HaloTag ligand labelling</title><p>HaloTag-Ligand-Amine (Promega, #P6741) was reconstituted in N,N-dimethylformamid (DMF; Sigma-Aldrich, #70547) to a concentration of 10 g/l. 250 μg HaloTag-Ligand Amine was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647-NHS (Thermo Fisher, #A20006) by adding 150 μg of NHS-dye from a 10 g/l stock solution in DMF. The total reaction volume was adjusted to 120 μl with DMF, then DIPEA Base (Sigma-Aldrich, #387649) was added at 1:100. The reaction was incubated under gentle agitation and protected from light at room temperature for 3 hr. The reaction mixture was purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Jasco) using a biphenyl column (Kinetex, #00F-4622-E0) with a solvent gradient of 0–60% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, #34851) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA; Sigma-Aldrich, #T6508) in water run over 30 min. Collected product fractions were dried in a speed-vac (Thermo Fisher, #SPD111V) and dissolved in DMSO.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91194-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All raw data are uploaded to BioImage Archive and accessible via <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1080">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD1080</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Engstler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Continuous endosomes form functional subdomains and orchestrate rapid membrane trafficking in trypanosomes</data-title><source>BioImage Archive</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.6019/S-BIAD1080</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Cell Microscopy Core of UMC Utrecht for their workshop 'Cryosectioning and immuno-electron microscopy' and the opportunity to learn the Tokuyasu technique.

This rapid turnover of its surface enables the trypanosome to 'clean' its surface removing antibodies and other immune effectors that are subsequently degraded. The high rate of endocytosis is likely reflected in the organisation of the endosomal system in these parasites. Here, Link et al., sought to address this question using a range of light and three-dimensional electron microscopy approaches to define the endosomal organisation in this parasite.</p><p>Before this study, the vast majority of our information about the make-up of the trypanosome endosomal system was from thin section electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies, which did not provide the necessary resolution and 3D information to address this issue. Therefore, it was not known how the different structures observed by EM were related. Link et al., have taken advantage of the advances in technology and used an impressive combination of approaches at the LM and EM level to study the endosomal system in these parasites. This innovative combination has now shown the interconnected-ness of this network and demonstrated that there are no 'classical' compartments within the endosomal system, with instead different regions of the network enriched in different protein markers (Rab5a, Rab7, Rab11). Overall, the authors have achieved their aims, with results supporting their conclusions.</p><p>This is a well written manuscript in which the authors use an impressive range of approaches to address the organisation of the endosomal system. The authors have clearly demonstrated that trypanosomes have a large interconnected endosomal network, without defined compartments and instead shows enrichment for specific Rabs within this network. I appreciate their inclusion of how they used a range of different light microscopy approaches even though for instance the dSTORM approach did not turn out to be as effective as hoped.</p><p>The methodological impact of this work has the potential to be large, as the authors have introduced a range of advanced EM techniques for the study of trypanosomes. Moreover, the study of fundamental biological processes such as endosomal trafficking in divergent eukaryotes is important to define the limits within which this process operates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91194.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study combines a range of advanced ultrastructural imaging approaches to define the unusual endosomal system of African trypanosomes. Compelling images show that instead of a distinct set of compartments, the endosome of these protists comprises a continuous system of membranes with functionally distinct subdomains as defined by canonical markers of early, late and recycling endosomes. The findings suggest that the endocytic system of bloodstream stages has evolved to facilitate the extraordinarily high rates of membrane turnover needed to remove immune complexes and survive in the blood, which is of interest to anyone studying infectious diseases.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Bloodstream stages of the parasitic protist, <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, exhibit very high rates of constitutive endocytosis, which is needed to recycle the surface coat of Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSGs) and remove surface immune complexes. While many studies have shown that the endo-lysosomal systems of T. brucei BF stages contain canonical domains, as defined by classical Rab markers, it has remained unclear whether these protists have evolved additional adaptations/mechanisms for sustaining these very high rates of membrane transport and protein sorting. The authors have addressed this question by reconstructing the 3D ultrastructure and functional domains of the <italic>T. brucei</italic> BF endosome membrane system using advanced electron tomography and super-resolution microscopy approaches. Their studies reveal that, unusually, the BF endosome network comprises a continuous system of cisternae and tubules that contain overlapping functional subdomains. It is proposed that a continuous membrane system allows higher rates of protein cargo segregation, sorting and recycling than can otherwise occur when transport between compartments is mediated by membrane vesicles or other fusion events.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is a technical tour-de-force using a combination of electron tomography, super-resolution/expansion microscopy, immune-EM of cryo-sections to define the 3D structures and connectivity of different endocytic compartments. The images are very clear and generally support the central conclusion that functionally distinct endocytic domains occur within a dynamic and continuous endosome network in BF stages.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors suggest that this dynamic endocytic network may also fulfil many of the functions of the Golgi TGN and that the latter may be absent in these stages. Although plausible, this comment needs further experimental support. For example, have the authors attempted to localize canonical makers of the TGN (e.g. GRIP proteins) in <italic>T. brucei</italic> BF and/or shown that exocytic carriers bud directly from the endosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the criticism and have shortened the discussion accordingly and clearly marked it as speculation. However, we do not want to completely abandon our hypothesis.</p><p>The paragraph now reads:</p><p>Lines 740 – 751:</p><p>“Interestingly, we did not find any structural evidence of vesicular retrograde transport to the Golgi. Instead, the endosomal ‘highways’ extended throughout the posterior volume of the trypanosomes approaching the trans-Golgi interface. It is highly plausible that this region represents the convergence point where endocytic and biosynthetic membrane trafficking pathways merge. A comparable merging of endocytic and biosynthetic functions has been described for the TGN in plants. Different marker proteins for early and recycling endosomes were shown to be associated and/ or partially colocalized with the TGN suggesting its function in both secretory and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Minamino and Ueda, 2019). As we could not find structural evidence for the existence of a TGN we tentatively propose that trypanosomes may have shifted the central orchestrating function of the TGN as a sorting hub at the crossroads of biosynthetic and recycling pathways to the endosome. Although this is a speculative scenario, it is experimentally testable.”</p><p>Furthermore, we removed the lines 51 - 52, which included the suggestion of the TGN as a master regulator, from the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors suggest that the African trypanosome endomembrane system has unusual organisation, in that the entire system is a single reticulated structure. It is not clear if this is thought to extend to the lysosome or MVB. There is also a suggestion that this unusual morphology serves as a trans-(post)Golgi network rather than the more canonical arrangement.</p><p>The work is based around very high-quality light and electron microscopy, as well as utilising several marker proteins, Rab5A, 11 and 7. These are deemed as markers for early endosomes, recycling endosomes and late or pre-lysosomes. The images are mostly of high quality but some inconsistencies in the interpretation, appearance of structures and some rather sweeping assumptions make this less easy to accept. Two perhaps major issues are claims to label the entire endosomal apparatus with a single marker protein, which is hard to accept as certainly this reviewer does not really even know where the limits to the endosomal network reside and where these interface with other structures. There are several additional compartments that have been defined by Rob proteins as well, and which are not even mentioned. Overall I am unconvinced that the authors have demonstrated the main things they claim.</p><p>The endomembrane system in bloodstream form T. brucei is clearly delimited. Compared to mammalian cells it is tidy and confined to the posterior part of the spindleshaped cell. The endoplasmic reticulum is linked to one side of the longitudinal cell axis, marked by the attached flagellum, while the mitochondrion locates to the opposite side. Glycosomes are easily identifiable as spheres, as are acidocalcisomes, which are smaller than glycosomes and – in electron micrographs – are characterized by high electron density. All these organelles extend beyond the nucleus, which is not the case for the endosomal compartment, the lysosome and the Golgi. The vesicles found in the posterior half of the trypanosome cell are quantitatively identifiable as COP1, CCVI or CCVII vesicles, or exocytic carriers. The lysosome has a higher degree of morphological plasticity, but this is not topic of the present work. Thus, the endomembrane system in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is comparatively well structured and delimited, which is why we have chosen trypanosomes as cell biological model.</p></disp-quote><p>We have published EP1::GFP as marker for the endosome system and flagellar pocket back in 2004. We have defined the fluid phase volume of the trypanosome endosome in papers published between 2002 and 2007. This work was not intended to represent the entirety of RAB proteins. We were only interested in 3 canonical markers for endosome subtypes. We do not claim anything that is not experimentally tested, we have clearly labelled our hypotheses as such, and we do not make sweeping assumptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The approaches taken are state-of-the-art but not novel, and because of the difficulty in fully addressing the central tenet, I am not sure how much of an impact this will have beyond the trypanosome field. For certain this is limited to workers in the direct area and is not a generalisable finding.</p></disp-quote><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no published research that has employed 3D Tokuyasu or expansion microscopy (ExM) to label endosomes. The key takeaway from our study, which is the concept that &quot;endosomes are continuous in trypanosomes&quot; certainly is novel. We are not aware of any other report that has demonstrated this aspect.</p><p>The doubts formulated by the reviewer regarding the impact of our work beyond the field of trypanosomes are not timely. Indeed, our results, and those of others, show that the conclusions drawn from work with just a few model organisms is not generalisable. We are finally on the verge of a new cell biology that considers the plethora of evolutionary solutions beyond ophistokonts. We believe that this message should be widely acknowledged and considered. And we are certainly not the only ones who are convinced that the term &quot;general relevance&quot; is unscientific and should no longer be used in biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>As clearly highlighted by the authors, a key plank in the ability of trypanosomes to evade the mammalian host’s immune system is its high rate of endocytosis. This rapid turnover of its surface enables the trypanosome to ‘clean’ its surface removing antibodies and other immune effectors that are subsequently degraded. The high rate of endocytosis is likely reflected in the organisati’n and layout of the endosomal system in these parasites. Here, Link et al., sought to address this question using a range of light and three-dimensional electron microscopy approaches to define the endosomal organisation in this parasite.</p><p>Before this study, the vast majority of our information about the make-up of the trypanosome endosomal system was from thin-section electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies, which did not provide the necessary resolution and 3D information to address this issue. Therefore, it was not known how the different structures observed by EM were related. Link et al., have taken advantage of the advances in technology and used an impressive combination of approaches at the LM and EM level to study the endosomal system in these parasites. This innovative combination has now shown the interconnected-ness of this network and demonstrated that there are no ‘classical’ compartments within the endosomal system, with instead different regions of the network enriched in different protein markers (Rab5a, Rab7, Rab11).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a generally well-written and clear manuscript, with the data well-presented supporting the majority of the conclusions of the authors. The authors use an impressive range of approaches to address the organisation of the endosomal system and the development of these methods for use in trypanosomes will be of use to the wider parasitology community.</p><p>I appreciate their inclusion of how they used a range of different light microscopy approaches even though for instance the dSTORM approach did not turn out to be as effective as hoped. The authors have clearly demonstrated that trypanosomes have a large interconnected endosomal network, without defined compartments and instead show enrichment for specific Rabs within this network.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My concerns are:</p><p>i) There is no evidence for functional compartmentalisation. The classical markers of different endosomal compartments do not fully overlap but there is no evidence to show a region enriched in one or other of these proteins has that specific function. The authors should temper their conclusions about this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in stating that Rab-presence does not necessarily mean Rabfunction. However, this assumption is as old as the Rab literature. That is why we have focused on the 3 most prominent endosomal marker proteins. We report that for endosome function you do not necessarily need separate membrane compartments. This is backed by our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The quality of the electron microscopy work is very high but there is a general lack of numbers. For example, how many tomograms were examined? How often were fenestrated sheets seen? Can the authors provide more information about how frequent these observations were?</p></disp-quote><p>The fenestrated sheets can be seen in the majority of the 37 tomograms recorded of the posterior volume of the parasites. Furthermore, we have randomly generated several hundred tiled ( = very large) electron micrographs of bloodstream form trypanosomes for unbiased analyses of endomembranes. In these 2D-datasets the “footprint” of the fenestrated flat and circular cisternae is frequently detectable in the posterior cell area.</p><p>We now have included the corresponding numbers in all EM figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The EM work always focussed on cells which had been processed before fixing. Now, I understand this was important to enable tracers to be used. However, given the dynamic nature of the system these processing steps and feeding experiments may have affected the endosomal organisation. Given their knowledge of the system now, the authors should fix some cells directly in culture to observe whether the organisation of the endosome aligns with their conclusions here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid criticism; however, it is the cell culture that provides an artificial environment. As for a possible effect of cell harvesting by centrifugation on the integrity and functionality of the endosome system, we consider this very unlikely for one simple reason. The mechanical forces acting in and on the parasites as they circulate in the extremely crowded and confined environment of the mammalian bloodstream are obviously much higher than the centrifugal forces involved in cell preparation. This becomes particularly clear when one considers that the mass of the particle to be centrifuged determines the actual force exerted by the g-forces. Nevertheless, the proposed experiment is a good control, although much more complex than proposed, since tomography is a challenging technique. We have performed the suggested experiment and acquired tomograms of unprocessed cells. The corresponding data is now included as supplementary movie 2, 3 and 4. We refer to it in lines 202 – 206: To investigate potential impacts of processing steps (cargo uptake, centrifugation, washing) on endosomal organization, we directly fixed cells in the cell culture flask, embedded them in Epon, and conducted tomography. The resulting tomograms revealed endosomal organization consistent with that observed in cells fixed after processing (see Supplementary movie 2, 3, and 4).</p><p>We furthermore thank the reviewer for the experiment suggestion in the acknowledgments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) The discussion needs to be revamped. At the moment it is just another run through of the results and does not take an overview of the results presenting an integrated view. Moreover, it contains reference to data that was not presented in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The reviewers concurred about the high calibre of the work and the importance of the findings.</p><p>They raised some issues and made some suggestions to improve the paper without additional experiments - key issues include</p><p>(1) Better referencing of the trypanosome endocytosis/ lysosomal trafficking literature.</p></disp-quote><p>The literature, especially the experimental and quantitative work, is very limited. We now provide a more complete set of references. However, we would like to mention that we had cited a recent review that critically references the trypanosome literature with emphasis on the extensive work done with mammalian cells and yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Moving the dSTORM data that detracts from otherwise strong data in a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Removal of the conclusion that the continuous endosome fulfils the functions of TGN, without further evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, this was not a conclusion in our paper, but rather a speculation, which we have now more clearly marked as such. Lines 740 to 751 now read:</p><p>“Interestingly, we did not find any structural evidence of vesicular retrograde transport to the Golgi. Instead, the endosomal ‘highways’ extended throughout the posterior volume of the trypanosomes approaching the trans-Golgi interface.

Do they become labelled with fluid phase markers with longer incubations (e.g late endosome/ lysosomal)?</p></disp-quote><p>The function of MVBs in trypanosomes is still far from being clear. They are filled with fluid phase cargo, especially ferritin, but are devoid of VSG. Hence it is likely that MVBs are part of the lysosomal compartment. In fact, this part of the endomembrane system is highly dynamic. MVBs can be physically connected to the lysosome or can form elongated structures. The surprising dynamics of the trypanosome lysosome will be published elsewhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2. The compartments labelled with EP1::Halo are very poorly defined due to the low levels of expression of the reporter protein and/or sensitivity of detection of the Halo tag. Based on these images, it would be hard to conclude whether the endosome network is continuous or not. In this respect, it is unclear why the authors didn't use EP1-GFP for these analyses? Given the other data that provides more compelling evidence for a single continuous compartment, I would suggest removing Fig 2A.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used EP1::GFP to label the entire endosome system (Engstler and Boshart, 2004). Unfortunately, GFP is not suited for dSTORM imaging. By creating the EP1::Halo cell line, we were able to utilize the most prominent dSTORM fluorescent dye, Alexa 647. This was not primarily done to generate super resolution images, but rather to measure the dynamics of the GPI-anchored, luminal protein EP with single molecule precision. The results from this study will be published separately. But we agree with the reviewer and have relocated the dSTORM data to the supplementary material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observation that Rab5a/7 can be detected in the lumen of lysosome is interesting. Mechanistically, this presumably occurs by invagination of the limiting membrane of the lysosome. Is there any evidence that similar invagination of cytoplasmic markers occurs throughout or in subdomains of the endocytic network (possibly indicative of a 'late endosome' domain)?</p></disp-quote><p>So far, we have not observed this. The structure of the lysosome and the membrane influx from the endosome are currently being investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors note that continuity of functionally distinct membrane compartments in the secretory/endocytic pathways has been reported in other protists (e.g T. cruzi). A particular example that could be noted is the endo-lysosomal system of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> discoideum which mediates the continuous degradation and eventual expulsion of undigested material.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to include this in the discussion but ultimately decided against it because the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> system cannot be easily compared to the trypanosome endosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Abstract</p><p>Not sure that 'common' is the correct term here. Frequent, near-universal..... it would be true that endocytosis is common across most eukaryotes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence to “common process observed in most eukaryotes” (line 33).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Immune evasion - the parasite does not escape the immune system, but does successfully avoid its impact, at least at the population level.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the word “escape” with “evasion” (line 35).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The third sentence needs to follow on correctly from the second. Also, more than Igs are internalised and potentially part of immune evasion, such as C3, Factor H, ApoL1 etcetera.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there may be a misunderstanding here. The process of endocytic uptake and lysosomal degradation has so far only been demonstrated in the context of VSGbound antibodies, which is why we only refer to this. Of course, the immune system comprises a wide range of proteins and effector molecules, all of which could be involved in immune evasion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not follow the logic that the high flux through the endocytic system in trypanosomes precludes distinct compartmentalisation - one could imagine a system where a lot of steps become optimised for example. This idea needs expanding on if it is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Membrane transport by vesicle transfer between several separate membrane compartments would be slower than the measured rate of membrane flux.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again I am not sure 'efficient' on line 40. It is fast, but how do you measure efficiency? Speed and efficiency are not the same thing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the word “efficient” with “fast” (line 42).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The basis for suggesting endosomes as a TGN is unclear. Given that there are AP complexes, retromer, exocyst and other factors that are part of the TGN or at least post-G differentiation of pathways in canonical systems, this seems a step too far. There really is no evidence in the rest of the MS that seems to support this.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree and have clarified the discussion accordingly. We have not completely removed the discussion on the TGN but have labelled it more clearly as speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am aware I am being pedantic here, but overall the abstract seems to provide an impression of greater novelty than may be the case and makes several very bold claims that I cannot see as fully valid.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any claim in the summary that we have not substantiated with experiments, or any hypothesis that we have not explained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the concept of fused or multifunctional endosomes (or even other endomembrane compartments) is old, and has been demonstrated in metazoan cells and yeast. The concept of rigid (in terms of composition) compartments really has been rejected by most folks with maturation, recycling and domain structures already well-established models and concepts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the (transient) presence of multiple Rab proteins decorating endosomes has been demonstrated in various cell types. This finding formed the basis for the endosomal maturation model in mammals and yeast, which has replaced the previous rigid compartment model.</p><p>However, we do not appreciate attempts to question the originality of our study by claiming that similar observations have been made in metazoans or yeast. This is simply wrong. There are no reports of a functionally structured, continuous, single and large endosome in any other system. The only membrane system that might be similar was described in the American parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, however, without the use of endosome markers or any functional analysis. We refer to this study in the discussion.</p><p>In summary, the maturation model falls short in explaining the intricacies of the membrane system we have uncovered in trypanosomes. Therefore, one plausible interpretation of our data is that the overall architecture of the trypanosome endosomes represents an adaptation that enables the remarkable speed of plasma membrane recycling observed in these parasites. In our view, both our findings and their interpretation are novel and worth reporting. Again, modern cell biology should recognize that evolution has developed many solutions for similar processes in cells, about whose diversity we have learned almost nothing because of our reductionist view. A remarkable example of this are the Picozoa, tiny bipartite eukaryotes that pack the entire nutritional apparatus into one pouch and the main organelles with the locomotor system into the other. Another one is the “extreme” cell biology of many protozoan parasites such as Giardia, Toxpoplasma or Trypanosoma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Higher plants have been well characterised, especially at the level of Rab/Arf proteins and adaptins.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention plant endosomes in our brief discussion of the trypanosome TGN. Lines 744 – 747:</p><p>“A comparable merging of endocytic and biosynthetic functions was already described for the TGN in plants. Different marker proteins for early and recycling endosomes were shown to be associated and/ or partially colocalized with the TGN suggesting its function in both secretory and endocytic pathways (reviewed in Minamino and Ueda, 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The level of self-citing in the introduction is irritating and unscholarly. I have no qualms with crediting the authors with their own excellent contributions, but work from Dacks, Bangs, Field and others seems to be selectively ignored, with an awkward use of the authors' own publications. Diversity between organisms for example has been a mainstay of the Dacks lab output, Rab proteins and others from Field and work on exocytosis and late endosomal systems from Bangs. These efforts and contributions surely deserve some recognition?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an original article and not a review. For a comprehensive overview the reviewer might read our recent overview article on exo- and endocytic pathways in trypanosomes, in which we have extensively cited the work of Mark Field, Jay Bangs and Joel Dacks. In the present manuscript, we have cited all papers that touch on our results or are otherwise important for a thorough understanding of our hypotheses. We do not believe that this approach is unscientific, but rather improves the readability of the manuscript. Nevertheless, we have now cited additional work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the uninitiated, the posterior/anterior axis of the trypanosome cell as well as any other specific features should be defined.</p></disp-quote><p>In lines 102 - 110 we wrote:</p><p>“This process of antibody clearance is driven by hydrodynamic drag forces resulting from the continuous directional movement of trypanosomes (Engstler et al., 2007). The VSG-antibody complexes on the cell surface are dragged against the swimming direction of the parasite and accumulate at the posterior pole of the cell. This region harbours an invagination in the plasma membrane known as the flagellar pocket (FP) (Gull, 2003; Overath et al., 1997). The FP, which marks the origin of the single attached flagellum, is the exclusive site for endo- and exocytosis in trypanosomes (Gull, 2003; Overath et al., 1997). Consequently, the accumulation of VSG-antibody complexes occurs precisely in the area of bulk membrane uptake.”</p><p>We think this sufficiently introduces the cell body axes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't understand the comment concerning microtubule association. In mammalian cells, such association is well established, but compartments still do not display precise positioning. This likely then has nothing to do with the microtubule association differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this in the text (lines 192 – 199). There is no report of cytoplasmic microtubules in trypanosomes. All microtubules appear to be either subpellicular or within the flagellum. To maintain the structure and position of the endosomal apparatus, they should be associated either with subpellicular microtubules, as is the case with the endoplasmic reticulum, or with the more enigmatic actomyosin system of the parasites.We have been working on the latter possibility and intend to publish a follow-up paper to the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The inability to move past the nucleus is a poor explanation. These compartments are dynamic. Even the nucleus does interesting things in trypanosomes and squeezes past structures during development in the tsetse fly.</p></disp-quote><p>The distance between the nucleus and the microtubule cytoskeleton remains relatively constant even in parasites that squeeze through microfluidic channels. This is not unexpected as the nucleus can be highly deformed. A structure the size of the endosome will not be able to physically pass behind the nucleus without losing its integrity. In fact, the recycling apparatus is never found in the anterior part of the trypanosome, most probably because the flagellar pocket is located at the posterior cell pole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L253 What is the evidence that EP1 labels the entire FP and endosomes? This may be extensive, but this claim requires rather more evidence. This is again suggested at l263. Again, please forgive me for being pedantic, but this is an overstatement unless supported by evidence that would be incredibly difficult to obtain. This is even sort of acknowledged on l271 in the context of non-uniform labelling. This comes again in l336.</p></disp-quote><p>The evidence that EP1 labels the entire FP and endosomes is presented here: Engstler and Boshart, 2004; 10.1101/gad.323404.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps I should refrain from comments on the dangers of expansion microscopy, or asking what has actually been gained here. Oddly, the conclusion on l290 is a fair statement that I am happy with.</p></disp-quote><p>An in-depth discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages of expansion microscopy is beyond the manuscript's intended scope. Our approach involved utilizing various imaging techniques to confirm the validity of our findings. We appreciate that our concluding sentence is pleasing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F2 - The data in panel A seem quite poor to me. I also do not really understand why the DAPI stain in the first and second columns fails to coincide or why the kinetoplast is so diffuse in the second row. The labelling for EP1 presents as very small puncta, and hence is not evidence for a continuum. What is the arrow in A IV top? The data in panel B are certainly more in line with prior art, albeit that there is considerable heterogeneity in the labelling and of the FP for example. Again, I cannot really see this as evidence for continuity. There are gaps.... Albeit I accept that labelling of such structures is unlikely to ever be homogenous.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dSTORM data represents the least robust aspect of the findings we have presented, and we concur with relocating it to the supplementary material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F3 - Rather apparent, and specifically for Rab7, that there is differential representation - for example, Cell 4 presents a single Rab7 structure while the remaining examples demonstrate more extensive labelling. Again, I am content that these are highly dynamic strictures but this needs to be addressed at some level and commented upon. If the claim is for continuity, the dynamics observed here suggest the usual; some level of obvious overlap of organellar markers, but the representation in F3 is clever but not sure what I am looking at. Moreover, the title of the figure is nothing new. What is also a bit odd is that the extent of the Rab7 signal, and to some extent the other two Rabs used, is rather variable, which makes this unclear to me as to what is being detected. Given that the Rab proteins may be defining microdomains or regions, I would also expect a region of unique straining as well as the common areas. This needs to at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences in the representation result from the dynamics of the labelled structures. Therefore, we have selected different cells to provide examples of what the labelling can look like. We now mention this in the results section.</p><p>The overlap of the different Rab signals was perhaps to be expected, but we now have demonstrated it experimentally. Importantly, we performed a rigorous quantification by calculating the volume overlaps and the Pearson correlation coefficients.</p><p>In previous studies the data were presented as maximal intensity projections, which inherently lack the complete 3D information.</p><p>We found that Rab proteins define microdomains and that there are regions of unique staining as well as common areas, as shown in Figure 3. The volumes do not completely overlap. This is now more clearly stated in lines 315 – 319:</p><p>“These objects showed areas of unique staining as well as partially overlapping regions. The pairwise colocalization of different endosomal markers is shown in Figure 3 A, XI - XIII and 3 B. The different cells in Figure 3 B were selected to represent the dynamic nature of the labelled structures. Consequently, the selected cells provide a variety of examples of how the labelling can appear.”</p><p>This had already been stated in lines 331 – 336:</p><p>“In summary, the quantitative colocalization analyses revealed that on the one hand, the endosomal system features a high degree of connectivity, with considerable overlap of endosomal marker regions, and on the other hand, TbRab5A, TbRab7, and TbRab11 also demarcate separated regions in that system. These results can be interpreted as evidence of a continuous endosomal membrane system harbouring functional subdomains, with a limited amount of potentially separated early, late or recycling endosomes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F4-6 - Fabulous images. But a couple of issues here; first, as the authors point out, there is distance between the gold and the antigen. So, this of course also works in the z-plane as well as the x/y-planes and some of the gold may well be associated with membraneous figures that are out of the plane, which would indicate an absence of colinearity on one specific membrane. Secondly, in several instances, we have Rab7 essentially mixed with Rab11 or Rab5 positive membrane. While data are data and should be accepted, this is difficult to reconcile when, at least to some level, Rab7 is a marker for a late-endosomal structure and where the presence of degradative activity could reside. As division of function is, I assume, the major reason for intracellular compartmentalisation, such a level of admixture is hard to rationalise. A continuum is one thing but the data here seem to be suggesting something else, i.e. almost complete admixture.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the positive feedback regarding the image quality. It is true that the &quot;linkage error,&quot; representing the distance between the gold and the antigen, also functions to some extent in the z-axis. However, it's important to note that the zdimension of the section in these Figures is 55 nm. Nevertheless, it's interesting to observe that membranes, which may not be visible within the section itself but likely the corresponding Rab antigen, is discernible in Figure 4C (indicated by arrows).</p><p>We have clarified this in lines 397 – 400:</p><p>“Consequently, gold particles located further away may represent cytoplasmic TbRab proteins or, as the “linkage error” can also occur in the z-plane, correspond to membranes that are not visible within the 55 nm thickness of the cryosection (Figure 4, panel C, arrows). “</p><p>The coexistence of different Rabs is most likely concentrated in regions where transitions between different functions are likely. Our focus was primarily on imaging membranes labelled with two markers. We wanted to show that the prevailing model of separate compartments in the trypanosome literature is not correct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F7 - Not sure what this adds beyond what was published by Grunfelder.</p></disp-quote><p>First, this figure is an important control that links our results to published work (Grünfelder et al. (2003)). Second, we include double staining of cargo with Rab5, Rab7, and Rab11, whereas Grünfelder focused only on Rab11. Therefore, our data is original and of such high quality that it warrants a main figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F8 - and l583. This is odd as the claim is 'proof' which in science is a hard thing to claim (and this is definitely not at a six sigma level of certainty, as used by the physics community). However, I am seeing structures in the tomograms which are not contiguous - there are gaps here between the individual features (Green in the figure).</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the term &quot;proof&quot;. It is important to note that the structures in individual tomograms cannot all be completely continuous because the sections are limited to a thickness of 250 nm. Therefore, it is likely that they have more connectivity above and below the imaged section. Nevertheless, we believe that the quality of the tomograms is satisfactory, considering that 3D Tokuyasu is a very demanding technique and the production of serial Tokuyasu tomograms is not feasible in practice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion - Too long and the self-citing of four papers from the corresponding author to the exclusion of much prior work is again noted, with concerns about this as described above. Moreover, at least four additional Rab proteins are known associated with the trypanosome endosomal system, 4, 5B, 21 and 28. These have been completely ignored.</p></disp-quote><p>We have outlined our position on referencing in original articles above. We also explained why we focused on the key marker proteins associated with early (Rab5), late (Rab7) and recycling endosomes (Rab11). We did not ignore the other Rabs, we just did not include them in the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall this is disappointing. I had expected a more robust analysis, with a clearer discussion and placement in context. I am not fully convinced that what we have here is as extreme as claimed, or that we have a substantial advance. There is nothing here that is mechanistic or the identification of a new set of gene products, process or function.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that this is constructive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This MS suggests that the endosomal system of African trypanosomes is a continuum of membrane structures rather than representing a set of distinct compartments. A combination of light and electron microscopy methods are used in support. The basic contention is very challenging to prove, and I'm not convinced that this has been. Furthermore, I am also unclear as to the significance of such an organisation; this seems not really addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge and respect varying viewpoints, but we hold a differing perspective in this matter. We are convinced that the data decisively supports our interpretation.

For example, the dividing cell in 1D has palisades associating with the new pocket - is this commonly seen? Does this reflect something happening in dividing cells. This point about endosomal division was picked up in the discussion but there was little about in the main results.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is undoubtedly inherent to the method itself, and we have made efforts to mitigate it by generating a series of tomograms recorded randomly. We have refrained from delving deeper into the intricacies of the cell cycle in this manuscript, as we believe that it warrants a separate paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors prosecute, the co-localisation analysis highlights the variable nature of the endosome and the overlap of different markers. When looking at the LM analysis, I was struck by the variability in the size and number of labelled structures in the different cells. For example, in 3A Rab7 is 2 blobs but in 3B Cell 1 it is 4/5 blobs. Is this just a reflection of the increase in the endosome during the cell cycle?</p></disp-quote><p>The variability in representation is a direct consequence of the dynamic nature of the labelled structures. For this reason, we deliberately selected different cells to represent examples of how the labelling can look like. We have decided not to mention the dynamics of the endosome during the cell cycle. This will be the subject of a further report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, Rab 11 looks to be the marker covering the greatest volume of the endosomal system - is this true? I think there's more analysis of this data that could be done to try and get more information about the relative volumes etc of the different markers that haven't been drawn out. The focus here is on the co-localisation.</p></disp-quote><p>Precisely because we recognize the importance of this point, we intend to turn our attention to the cell cycle in a separate publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate that it is an awful lot of work to perform the immuno-EM and the data is of good quality but in the text, there could be a greater effort to tie this to the LM data. For example, from the Rab11 staining in LM you would expect this marker to be the most extensive across the networks - is this reflected in the EM?</p><p>For the immuno-EM there were no numbers, the authors had measured the position of the gold but what was the proportion of gold that was in/near membranes for each marker? This would help the reader understand both the number of particles seen and the enrichment of the different regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our original intent was to perform a thorough quantification (using stereology) of the immuno-EM data. However, we later realized that the necessary random imaging approach is not suitable for Tokuyasu sections of trypanosomes. In short, the cells are too far apart, and the cell sections are only occasionally cut so that the endosomal membranes are sufficiently visible. Nevertheless, we continue to strive to generate more quantitative data using conventional immuno-EM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The innovative combination of Tokuyasu tomograms with immuno-EM was great. I noted though that there was a lack of fenestration in these models. Does this reflect the angle of the model or the processing of these samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the referee, as we have asked ourselves the same question. However, we do not attribute the apparent lack of fenestration to the viewing angle, since we did not find fenestration in any of the Tokuyasu tomograms. Our suspicion is more directed towards a methodological problem. In the Tokuyasu workflow, all structures are mainly fixed with aldehydes. As a result, lipids are only effectively fixed through their association with membrane proteins. We suggest that the fenestration may not be visible because the corresponding lipids may have been lost due to incomplete fixation.</p><p>We now clearly state this in the lines 563 – 568.</p><p>“Interestingly, these tomograms did not exhibit the fenestration pattern identified in conventional electron tomography. We suspect that this is due to methodological reasons. The Tokuyasu procedure uses only aldehydes to fix all structures. Consequently, effective fixation of lipids occurs only through their association with membrane proteins. Thus, the lack of visible fenestration is likely due to possible loss of lipids during incomplete fixation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion needs to be reworked. Throughout it contains references to results not in the main results section such as supplementary movie 2 (line 735). The explicit references to the data and figures felt odd and more suited to the results rather than the discussion. Currently, each result is discussed individually in turn and more effort needs to be made to integrate the results from this analysis here but also with previous work and the data from other organisms, which at the moment sits in a standalone section at the end of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the discussion and removed the previous supplementary movies 2 and 3.

Does that mean there was no endosome by the new pocket and if so where is this data in the manuscript? This point relates back to my question about how cells were chosen for analysis - how many dividing cells were examined by tomography?</p></disp-quote><p>The fate of endosomes during the cell cycle is not the subject of this paper. In this manuscript we only show only one dividing cell using tomography.

The pocket I presume is included within the endosomal system for this analysis but there was no specific mention of it in the results and no marker of each position to help define any specialisation. From the results, I thought the focus was on endosomal co-localisation of the different markers. If the authors are thinking about specialisation of the pocket this paper from Mark Field shows there is evidence for the exocyst to be distributed over the entire surface of the pocket, which is relevant to the discussion here.

However, we are convinced that membrane exchange cannot physically work without functional polarization of the pocket. We know that Rab11, for example, is not evenly distributed on the pocket. By the way, in Boehm et al. (2017) the exocyst is not shown to cover the entire pocket (as shown in Supplementary Video 1).</p><p>We now refer to Boehm et al.

This disparity explains the lower colocalization betweenTbRab11 and TbRab5A.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 735 - link to data not previously mentioned I think.
