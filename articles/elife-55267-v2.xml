(vHPC) to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulate cognition, emotion, and memory. These functions are also tightly controlled by inhibitory networks in the PFC, whose disruption is thought to contribute to mental health disorders. However, relatively little is known about how the vHPC engages different populations of interneurons in the PFC. Here we use slice physiology and optogenetics to study vHPC-evoked feed-forward inhibition in the mouse PFC. We first show that cholecystokinin (CCK+), parvalbumin (PV+), and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons are prominent in layer 5 (L5) of infralimbic PFC. We then show that vHPC inputs primarily activate CCK+ and PV+ interneurons, with weaker connections onto SOM+ interneurons. CCK+ interneurons make stronger synapses onto pyramidal tract (PT) cells over nearby intratelencephalic (IT) cells. However, CCK+ inputs undergo depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) and CB1 receptor modulation only at IT cells. Moreover, vHPC-evoked feed-forward inhibition undergoes DSI only at IT cells, confirming a central role for CCK+ interneurons. Together, our findings show how vHPC directly engages multiple populations of inhibitory cells in deep layers of the infralimbic PFC, highlighting unexpected roles for both CCK+ interneurons and endocannabinoid modulation in hippocampal-prefrontal communication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>Endocannabinoid</kwd><kwd>modulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH085974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Adam G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endocannabinoids modulate ventral hippocampal inputs to the infralimbic prefrontal cortex by dampening feed-forward inhibition mediated by cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) interneurons onto layer 5 intratelencephalic (IT) cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls cognitive and emotional behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Euston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>) and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godsil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sigurdsson and Duvarci, 2015</xref>). PFC activity is driven and maintained by long-range glutamatergic inputs from a variety of other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>). Strong, unidirectional connections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) contribute to both working memory and threat conditioning in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones and Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>). Dysfunction of vHPC to PFC connectivity is also implicated in schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, chronic stress disorders, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godsil et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sigurdsson and Duvarci, 2015</xref>). To understand these roles, it is necessary to establish how vHPC inputs engage local excitatory and inhibitory networks within the PFC.</p><p>The vHPC primarily projects to the ventral medial PFC in rodents, with axons most prominent in layer 5 (L5) of infralimbic (IL) PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). These excitatory inputs contact multiple populations of pyramidal cells and are much stronger at intratelencephalic (IT) cells than nearby pyramidal tract (PT) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). vHPC inputs can drive the robust firing of IT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>), which may be important for maintaining activity during behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>). However, they also evoke prominent feed-forward inhibition at pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marek et al., 2018</xref>), and excitation and inhibition evolve with different dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). Here we focus on the mechanisms responsible for this inhibition by establishing which interneurons are engaged by vHPC inputs to the PFC.</p><p>As in other cortices, PFC activity is regulated by a variety of GABAergic interneurons, which have distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). Parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons mediate feed-forward inhibition via strong synapses at the soma of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atallah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>). By contrast, somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) interneurons mediate feed-back inhibition via facilitating synapses onto the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>). However, during trains of repetitive activity, SOM+ interneurons can also participate in feed-forward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, recent in vivo studies suggest both PV+ and SOM+ interneurons may contribute to vHPC-evoked inhibition in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marek et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While PV+ and SOM+ interneurons are prominent in the PFC, there is also an unusually high density of cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whissell et al., 2015</xref>). In the hippocampus, these inhibitory cells help regulate the motivation and emotional state of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>). They also highly express cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors on their axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katona et al., 1999</xref>), and can be strongly modulated by endocannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson and Nicoll, 2001</xref>). For example, brief depolarization of postsynaptic pyramidal cells releases endocannabinoids that bind to CB1 receptors on CCK+ axon terminals and inhibit presynaptic GABA release, a process known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson and Nicoll, 2001</xref>).</p><p>While CCK+ interneurons are prominent in the PFC and may play a role in different forms of inhibition, they remain relatively understudied. A major technical reason is the low-level expression of CCK in pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), which makes CCK+ interneurons challenging to specifically target. For example, expressing Cre-dependent reporters in CCK-Cre transgenics also label pyramidal cells in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). Fortunately, this challenge can be overcome with intersectional viruses using the Dlx enhancer, which restricts expression to interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>). This approach allows identification of CCK+ interneurons, enabling targeted recordings and optogenetic access to study their connectivity and modulation in the PFC.</p><p>Here we examine vHPC-evoked inhibition at L5 pyramidal cells in IL PFC using slice physiology, optogenetics, and intersectional viral tools. We find vHPC inputs activate PV+, SOM+, and CCK+ interneurons, with different dynamics during repetitive activity. Inputs to PV+ and CCK+ interneurons are strong but depressing, while those onto SOM+ interneurons are weak but facilitating. CCK+ interneurons contact L5 pyramidal cells, with stronger connections onto PT cells than neighboring IT cells. However, endocannabinoid modulation via DSI and direct activation of CB1 receptors only occurs at synapses onto IT cells. Endocannabinoid modulation of vHPC-evoked feed-forward inhibition also occurs only at IT cells, highlighting a central role for CCK+ interneurons. Together, our findings show how the vHPC engages interneurons to inhibit the PFC, while revealing a novel property of cell-type-specific endocannabinoid modulation in this circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>vHPC-evoked inhibition and interneurons in L5 of infralimbic PFC</title><p>We studied vHPC-evoked inhibition at pyramidal neurons using whole-cell recordings and optogenetics in acute slices of the mouse PFC. To allow for visualization and activation of inputs to the PFC, we injected the ChR2-expressing virus (AAV-ChR2-EYFP) into the ipsilateral vHPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Little and Carter, 2012</xref>).

To visualize these cells in the PFC, we crossed PV-Cre and SOM-Cre mice with reporter mice (Ai14) that express Cre-dependent tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). We observed labeling of PV+ and SOM+ interneurons in L5 of IL PFC, suggesting they could be contacted by vHPC afferents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the PFC also has a high density of cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK+) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whissell et al., 2015</xref>), which mediate inhibition in other cortices and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>), and could also participate in the PFC. To label these cells, we initially injected AAV-DIO-GFP into CCK-Cre mice but observed labeling of both interneurons and pyramidal neurons across multiple layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To restrict labeling to CCK+ interneurons, we instead used AAV-Dlx-Flex-GFP, expressing Cre-dependent GFP under control of the Dlx enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>). Injecting AAV-Dlx-Flex-GFP selectively labeled CCK+ interneurons in the IL PFC, including prominent labeling in L5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, we found little co-labeling of CCK+ cells with either PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; 11.3% overlap, n = 308 cells total, 17 slices, 6 animals) or SOM (6.6% overlap, n = 105 cells total, 8 slices, 3 animals).</p><p>To confirm the targeting of CCK+ interneurons, we next used whole-cell recordings followed by post-hoc reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

These results confirm that our viral strategy can identify CCK+ interneurons, which are present in deeper layers of IL, and also show that PV+, SOM+, and CCK+ interneurons are positioned to receive vHPC inputs and may mediate feed-forward inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>vHPC inputs primarily engage PV+ and CCK+ interneurons</title><p>Previous studies suggest that vHPC inputs engage PV+ and SOM+ interneurons in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marek et al., 2018</xref>). However, these connections have not been examined in L5 of IL, where vHPC connections are the strongest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>).

To study connectivity, we injected AAV-ChR2-YFP into the vHPC and recorded EPSCs from identified interneurons. To compare across animals and cell types, we recorded within the same slice from neighboring IT cells, which receive the bulk of vHPC inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). To isolate monosynaptic connections, we included TTX (1 Î¼M), 4-AP (10 Î¼M), and elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (4 mM), which blocks action potentials (APs) but restores presynaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Little and Carter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). We kept the light intensity and duration constant within pairs, allowing us to account for differences in viral expression across animals andÂ slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). We found that vHPC inputs evoked robust EPSCs at CCK+ interneurons, which were similar in amplitude to IT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; IT = 674 Â± 102 pA, CCK+ = 413 Â± 89 pA, CCK+/IT ratio = 0.56, p = 0.13; n = 9 pairs, 4 animals).

Together, these experiments indicate that equivalent CB1R modulation of CCK+ inputs to IT cells also occurs under more physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Endocannabinoid modulation depends on postsynaptic cell type</title><p>If the cell-type specificity of DSI depends on presynaptic factors, we would expect to observe equivalent differences for pharmacologically evoked endocannabinoid modulation by activating presynaptic CB1Rs. We further examined the mechanism of CB1R modulation using wash-in of the agonist WIN 55,212â1 (WIN, 1 ÂµM) followed by the inverse agonist AM-251(10 ÂµM), which act directly at presynaptic CB1Rs located on CCK+ axon terminals. In voltage-clamp recordings from L5 IT cells, we found that WIN reduced CCK+-evoked IPSCs, which was reversed by AM-251 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A &amp; C</xref>; baseline = 234 Â± 53 pA, WIN = 106 Â± 26 pA, AM-251 = 206 Â± 50 pA; baseline versus WIN, p = 0.008; WIN versus AM-251, p = 0.016; n = 8 cells, 5 animals).

Interestingly, during trains of CCK+ stimulation, wash-in of WIN also increased the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) at IT cells, suggesting presynaptic modulation of release probability by CB1Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; IPSC<sub>2</sub> / IPSC<sub>1</sub>: baseline = 0.48 Â± 0.03, WIN = 0.59 Â± 0.03, AM-251 = 0.54 Â± 0.02; baseline versus WIN, p = 0.03; WIN versus AM-251, p = 0.22; n = 7 cells, 4 animals).

Based on the presence of CB1R modulation and DSI at IT cells, we hypothesized that vHPC-evoked inhibition should also undergo target-specific DSI. In voltage-clamp recordings from IT cells, we found that repetitive activation of vHPC inputs evoked EPSCs and IPSCs at â50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A &amp; B</xref>). Depolarization of IT cells (5 s to +10 mV) reduced vHPC-evoked IPSCs but not EPSCs at â50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B &amp; E</xref>; before, after, recovery: IPSC<sub>1</sub> = 102 Â± 14 pA, 51 Â± 10 pA, 88 Â± 10 pA; EPSC<sub>1</sub> = 248 Â± 54 pA, 233 Â± 48 pA, 241 Â± 52 pA; DSI ratio = 0.47 Â± 0.05, p = 0.02; DSE ratio = 0.99 Â± 0.06, p = 0.30; n = 7 cells, 4 animals). These findings indicate that there is no DSE at the vHPC to PFC connection, whereas there is prominent DSI onto IT cells. Importantly, application of AM-251 minimized DSI, indicating that it is mediated by endocannabinoids activating CB1Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C &amp; E</xref>; IPSC<sub>1</sub>: before = 136 Â± 31 pA, after = 116 Â± 29 pA, recovery = 149 Â± 35 pA; DSI ratio = 0.84 Â± 0.03, p = 0.02; n = 7 cells, 3 animals; DSI in ACSF versus AM-251, p = 0.0006).

First, we found vHPC contacts and strongly activates CB1R-expressing CCK+ interneurons in L5 of IL PFC. Second, we showed that CCK+ interneurons contact nearby pyramidal cells, suggesting they participate in feed-forward inhibition. Third, we found that CCK+ connections undergo CB1R-mediated modulation and DSI, which is selective for IT and not PT cells. Fourth, endocannabinoids also modulate vHPC-evoked inhibition, which also undergoes DSI selectively at IT cells. Together, our results reveal a central role for CCK+ interneurons and endocannabinoid modulation in communication between vHPC and PFC.</p><p>The PFC possesses a rich variety of GABAergic interneurons, which are known to have unique roles in goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courtin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the PFC has fewer PV+ interneurons and more CCK+ interneurons compared to other cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whissell et al., 2015</xref>). Our results indicate that CCK+ interneurons are abundant in L5 of IL PFC, which we previously showed receives the strongest connections from vHPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). We found these cells are distinct from PV+ and SOM+ interneurons, with different morphological and physiological properties. We also found that they are enriched in presynaptic CB1Rs, as in other parts of cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Armstrong and Soltesz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vogel et al., 2016</xref>). The abundance of CCK+ interneurons in the ventral mPFC is consistent with their role in cognitive and emotional behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freund, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to characterize CCK+ interneurons in other layers and subregions of the PFC.</p><p>One of our key results is that vHPC inputs densely contact and strongly activate CCK+ interneurons in L5 of IL PFC. vHPC inputs are strong and depressing onto CCK+ interneurons, in contrast to the facilitating inputs onto IT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). Importantly, vHPC-evoked firing of CCK+ interneurons occurs without activation of IT cells, indicating polysynaptic recurrent activity is not required for activation of CCK+ interneurons, which are therefore likely to mediate feed-forward inhibition. With higher intensity of input stimulation, CCK+ interneurons may also be activated by local inputs, as observed in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>), and similar to SOM+ interneurons in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>). Indeed, in the hippocampus, CCK+ interneurons have been shown to participate in both feed-forward and feed-back networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Basu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Glickfeld and Scanziani, 2006</xref>). Our findings show that CCK+ interneurons have an important and underappreciated role in hippocampal evoked feed-forward inhibition, and it will be important to assess whether this generalizes to other inputs to the PFC.</p><p>While we focused on CCK+ interneurons, we also confirmed that vHPC inputs engage other interneurons in L5 of IL PFC. The activation of PV+ interneurons is strong, consistent with their role in feed-forward inhibition in PFC and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delevich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>). Previous results have indicated that vHPC engages PV+ interneurons in superficial layers of the medial PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marek et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, we find particularly strong connections in L5, where our previous study shows vHPC inputs are most dense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>). In the future, it will also be interesting to address the relative contribution of PV+ and CCK+ interneurons in feed-forward inhibition, which may be accomplished by novel genetic tools that allow for the labeling of CCK+ and PV+ interneurons in the same animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenno et al., 2014</xref>). SOM+ interneuron activation is weak, but increases with repetitive activity, similar to BLA inputs to superficial PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McGarry and Carter, 2016</xref>). The engagement of SOM+ interneurons is consistent with a role in oscillations linking the vHPC and PFC and involvement in working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the activation of SOM+ interneurons by long-range inputs also occurs in the granular sensory cortex, where it also builds during stimulus trains, suggesting this is a general property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our intersectional viral approach enabled cell-type specific identification and optogenetic activation of cortical CCK+ interneurons. We found that CCK+ interneurons make robust inhibitory connections onto neighboring pyramidal cells in L5 of IL PFC. Importantly, these connections are much stronger onto PT cells, similar to our previous findings for PV+, SOM+, and NDNF+ interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anastasiades et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>). Biased inhibition is thus a general property of inhibitory connections in the PFC, although strength also depends on intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>). In the hippocampus, CCK+ interneurons also make unique connections onto different pyramidal cell populations defined by sublayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Valero et al., 2015</xref>). While hippocampal CCK+ innervations vary along the somato-dendritic axis of pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), our sCRACM results suggest CCK+ interneurons target the soma of both IT and PT cells in L5 of IL PFC. This subcellular targeting could explain why we observed little asynchronous CCK+ release, which is stronger at dendritic synapses compared to somatic synapses at CCK+ connections in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another key finding was that endocannabinoid modulation of CCK+ connections depends on the postsynaptic target. Due to their distinct postsynaptic receptor expression profiles, IT and PT cells are known to respond differently to many neuromodulators, including dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anastasiades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dembrow and Johnston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shepherd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stephens et al., 2018</xref>). We observed robust endocannabinoid-mediated DSI at IT cells but not at nearby PT cells, despite the latter receiving stronger connections. Our result suggests the endocannabinoid system also shows marked cell-type specificity, with selective modulation on cortico-cortical networks. In the future, it will be important to assess the functional impact of this specificity on local processing in the PFC, including processing within and between hemispheres. It will also be important to establish if this specificity extends to other layers of the PFC, as IT cells are distributed from superficial L2 to deep L6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anastasiades et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In principle, selective DSI at CCK+ connections onto IT cells could reflect differences in the postsynaptic release or presynaptic detection of endocannabinoids. Our results are consistent with the latter explanation. First, our immunocytochemistry shows more CB1R puncta around IT cells, suggesting these receptors are selectively localized. This result was particularly surprising because we also found CCK+ interneurons make stronger connections onto PT cells. Second, direct activation of CB1Rs with WIN reduces CCK+-evoked IPSCs only at IT cells, with no effect at neighboring PT cells. This experiment bypasses the postsynaptic release of endocannabinoids, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism accounts for the specificity of DSI. The increase in PPR is also consistent with presynaptic modulation by CB1R, indicating reduced release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>). By contrast, a recent study of differential DSI at CCK+ connections onto projection neurons in the amygdala suggested a post-synaptic mechanism, due to selective expression of endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzyme DGLÎ± in pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vogel et al., 2016</xref>). These findings indicate that different mechanisms leading to the modulation specificity may occur in different brain regions, underscoring the complexity of endocannabinoid systems.</p><p>The absence of WIN modulation at CCK+ connections onto PT cells, despite the low level of CB1R presence around their cell bodies, was surprising. Previous studies indicate that the nanoscale organization of CB1Rs relative to voltage-gated calcium channels influences the effectiveness of presynaptic CB1Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudok et al., 2015</xref>). This explains the weaker endocannabinoid modulation of dendritic-targeting than somatic-targeting CCK+ inputs in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Although we showed CCK+ interneurons restrict their targeting to the soma of both IT and PT cells, different nanoscale CB1R organizations could still occur at boutons, making the CB1R at CCK+ inputs onto PT neurons non-functional. Alternatively, some PT-targeting CB1R+ boutons may come from other interneuron subtypes, as previous studies showed that a small percentage of non-CCK+ cells also express CB1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marsicano and Lutz, 1999</xref>).</p><p>A related question is whether CB1R+ and CB1R- connections arise from the same CCK+ interneurons. One possibility is that two different types of CCK+ interneurons exist: one that projects to IT cells and is sensitive to CB1R modulation and another that projects to PT cells and is insensitive to CB1R modulation. Indeed, several subtypes of CCK+ interneurons are found across the brain, which differ in their subcellular targeting of postsynaptic cells, the size of their soma, and the expression of molecular markers such as VIP and VGLUT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">del Pino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Omiya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pelkey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Somogyi et al., 2004</xref>). However, another possibility is that the same CCK+ interneuron projects to both projection neurons but the contacts at PT cells lack CB1R modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dudok et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Distinguishing between these possibilities is challenging, but may be accomplished in the future using triple recordings from CCK+ interneurons and pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reyes et al., 1998</xref>), facilitated by soma-restricted optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mardinly et al., 2018</xref>), which can be combined with our Dlx viral approach to specifically target CCK+ interneurons.</p><p>Ultimately, the ability of vHPC inputs to engage CCK+ interneurons, which in turn contact pyramidal cells, implicates a key role in feed-forward inhibition. Consistent with this idea, we observed prominent CB1R-mediated DSI of vHPC-evoked inhibition only at IT cells and not neighboring PT cells. Because there is no change in excitation, this modulation will selectively increase the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio at IT cells. In the intact brain, this could allow the vHPC to more effectively activate IT cells compared to neighboring PT cells. For example, when IT cells are highly active, increased endocannabinoid tone could promote local processing within the PFC. Disinhibition at IT cells could also allow for stronger responses to excitatory inputs, a potential mechanism for increased synchrony between hippocampus and PFC during working memory tasks and anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fujisawa and BuzsÃ¡ki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, altered E/I balance could potentially shift the output of the PFC toward other intratelencephalic targets throughout the brain, including other parts of the cortex, striatum, amygdala, and claustrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anastasiades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, our results have implications for the functional properties of hippocampal-prefrontal networks in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Euston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012</xref>). Previous studies have shown that endocannabinoid signaling can strongly influence both cognition and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mechoulam and Parker, 2013</xref>). Altering endocannabinoid levels also affects executive function, working memory, stress, anxiety, and threat learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marcus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marsicano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Volk and Lewis, 2016</xref>). Our results indicate endocannabinoids influence communication between vHPC to PFC by selectively modulating connections from CCK+ interneurons to IT cells. In the future, it will be particularly interesting to explicitly assess the role of this microcircuit and the impact of endocannabinoid modulation on PFC function and dysfunction, including threat learning and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

Labs). Homozygote male breeders (PV-Cre = JAX 008069, SOM-Cre = JAX 013044, CCK-Cre = JAX 012706) were paired with female wild-type or Ai14 breeders (JAX 007914) to yield heterozygote offspring for experiments. All experimental procedures were approved by the University Animal Welfare Committee of New York University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Viruses</title><p>AAV viruses used in this study were as follows: AAV1.EF1a.DIO.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH (UPenn AV-1â20298P), AAV1.hysn.hChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH (UPenn AV-26973P), AAV1.EF1a.DIO.eYFP.WPRE.hGH (Upenn AV-1â27056), AAVrg.CAG.GFP (Addgene 37825-AAVrg), AAVrg.CAG.tdTomato (Addgene 59462-AAVrg). Additional viral constructs were assembled for Cre-dependent expression of a reporter under the control of the Dlx5/6 enhancer: AAV-Dlx-Flex-GFP (Addgene #83900) and AAV-Dlx-Flex-ChR2-mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>). These constructs take advantage of the double-floxed inverted system, in which two consecutive and incompatible lox-sites are placed both in 5' and 3' of the reversed coding sequences of the viral reporter, restricting expression to Cre-expressing interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stereotaxic injections</title><p>Mice aged 4â6 weeks were deeply anesthetized with either isoflurane or a mixture of ketamine and xylazine, then head-fixed in a stereotaxic (Kopf Instruments). A small craniotomy was made over the injection site, using these coordinates relative to Bregma: PFC = Â±0.4, â2.3, +2.1 mm, PAG = â0.6, both â2.5 and â3, â4.0 mm, vHPC = â3.3, both â3.6 and â4.2, â3 mm (mediolateral, dorsoventral, and rostrocaudal axes). For retrograde labeling, pipettes were filled with red retrogradely transported fluorescent beads (Lumafluor), Cholera Toxin Subunit B (CTB) conjugated to Alexa 647 (Life Technologies), or viruses. Borosilicate pipettes with 5 to 10 Âµm diameter tips were back-filled with dye and/or virus, and a volume of 130â550 nl was pressure-injected using a Nanoject III (Drummond) every 30 s. The pipette was left in place for an additional 5 min, allowing time to diffuse away from the pipette tip, before being slowly retracted from the brain. For both retrograde and viral labeling, animals were housed for 2â3 weeks before slicing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology and fluorescence microscopy</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine, then perfused intracardially with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.01 M PBS. Brains were fixed in 4% PFA in 0.01 M PBS overnight at 4Â°C. Slices were prepared at a thickness of 70 Î¼m for imaging intrinsic fluorescence or 40 Âµm for antibody staining (Leica VT 1000S vibratome). For immunohistochemistry, slices were incubated with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton-X in 0.01 M PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature before primary antibodies were applied in blocking solution (mouse anti-parvalbumin antibody [Millipore, MAB1572] at 1:2000 overnight, rat anti-somatostatin [Millipore, MAB354] at 1:200 overnight, guinea pig anti-CB1R [Frontier Institute, Af530] at 1:500 for 36 hr) at 4Â°C. Slices were then incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution (goat anti-mouse 647 at 1:200, goat anti-rat 647 at 1:200, goat anti-guinea pig 647 at 1:500 [Invitrogen]) for 1.5 hr at room temperature before mounted under glass coverslips on gelatin-coated slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica SP8). Image processing involved adjusting brightness, contrast, and manual cell counting using ImageJ (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Slice preparation</title><p>Mice aged 6â8 weeks were anesthetized with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine, and perfused intracardially with an ice-cold external solution containing the following (in mM): 65 sucrose, 76 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (295â305 mOsm), and bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Coronal slices (300 Î¼m thick) were cut on a VS1200 vibratome (Leica) in ice-cold external solution, before being transferred to ACSF containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 21 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4 Na-ascorbate, and 2 Na-pyruvate (295â305 mOsm), bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were kept for 30 min at 35Â°C, before being allowed to recover for 30 min at room temperature before starting recordings. All recordings were conducted at 30â32Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Whole-cell recordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons or interneurons located in layer 5 (L5) of infralimbic (IL) PFC. Neurons were identified by infrared-differential interference contrast or fluorescence, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chalifoux and Carter, 2010</xref>). In the case of pyramidal cells, the projection target was established by the presence of retrobeads or Alexa-conjugated CTB, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Little and Carter, 2013</xref>). Pairs of adjacent cells were chosen for sequential recording, ensuring they received similar inputs (typically &lt; 50 Âµm between cells). Borosilicate pipettes (2â5 MÎ©) were filled with internal solutions. Three types of recording internal solutions were used. For current-clamp recordings (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 7 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg<sub>2</sub>-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, 290â295 mOsm, pH 7.3, with KOH. For voltage-clamp recordings (in mM): 135 Cs-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 4 Mg<sub>2</sub>-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, 0.5 EGTA, 10 TEA-chloride, and 2 QX314, 290â295 mOsm, pH 7.3, with CsOH. For DSI experiments (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 1.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1.1 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine, 2 MgATP, 0.4 NaGTP. In some experiments studying cellular morphology, 5% biocytin was also included in the recording internal solution. After allowing biocytin to diffuse through the recorded cell for at least 30 min, slices were fixed with 4% PFA before staining with streptavidin conjugated to Alexa 647 (Invitrogen).</p><p>Electrophysiology recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments), filtered at 4 kHz for current-clamp, and 2 kHz for voltage-clamp, and sampled at 10 kHz. The initial series resistance was &lt;20 MÎ©, and recordings were ended if series resistance rose above 25 MÎ©. In some experiments, 1 Î¼M TTX was added to block action potentials, and 100 Î¼M 4-AP and 4 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup> to restore presynaptic release. In many experiments, 10 Î¼M CPP was used to block NMDA receptors. In current-clamp experiments characterizing intrinsic properties, 10 Î¼M NBQX, 10 Î¼M CPP, and 10 ÂµM gabazine were used to block excitation and inhibition. In some experiments, 10 Âµm AM-251 was used to block CB1 receptors or 1 ÂµM WIN 55,212â2 was used to activate CB1 receptors. All chemicals were purchased from either Sigma or Tocris Bioscience.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in presynaptic neurons and activated with a brief light pulse from a blue LED (473 nm) (Thorlabs). For wide-field illumination, light was delivered via a 10 Ã 0.3 NA objective (Olympus) centered on the recorded cell. LED power was routinely calibrated at the back aperture of the objective. LED power and duration were adjusted to obtain reliable responses, with typical values of 0.4 to 10 mW and 2 ms, respectively. Subcellular targeting experiments were performed with a Polygon DMD device (Mightex) focused through a 10 Ã 0.3 NA objective (Olympus) with a 75 Î¼m pixel size. Pulses were delivered at 1 Hz using a pseudo-random 10 Ã 10 grid pattern, yielding an effective mapping area of 750 Î¼m Ã 750 Î¼m. Experiments used a 2 ms LED pulse yielding an effective power of 0.17 mW per pixel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Electrophysiology and imaging data were acquired using National Instruments boards and MATLAB (MathWorks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). Off-line analysis was performed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Intrinsic properties were determined as follows. Input resistance was calculated from the steady-state voltage during a â50 pA, 500 ms current step. Voltage sag ratio was calculated as (V<sub>sag</sub> â V<sub>ss</sub>) / (V<sub>sag</sub> â V<sub>baseline</sub>), where V<sub>sag</sub> is average over a 1 ms window around the minimum, V<sub>ss</sub> is average of last 50 ms, and V<sub>baseline</sub> is average of 50 ms preceding the current injection. The membrane time constant (tau) was measured using exponential fits to these hyperpolarizations. Adaptation was calculated as the ratio of the first and last inter-spike intervals, such that a value of 1 indicates no adaptation and values &lt; 1 indicate lengthening of the inter-spike interval. For experiments with a single optogenetic stimulation, the PSC amplitude was measured as the average value across 1 ms around the peak subtracted by the average 100 ms baseline value prior to the stimulation. For experiments with a train of optogenetic stimulation, each PSC amplitude was measured as the average value in a 1 ms window around the peak, minus the average 2 ms baseline value before each stimulation. Most summary data are reported in the text and figures as arithmetic mean Â± SEM. Ratios of responses at pairs of cells are reported as geometric mean in the text, and with Â± 95% confidence interval (CI) in the figures, unless otherwise noted. Comparisons between unpaired data were performed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Comparisons between data recorded in pairs were performed using non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Two-tailed p values &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Carter lab for helpful discussions and comments on the manuscript.

These connections are known to be important for working memory and other behaviors and so details of the underlying circuitry are likely to be important for our understanding of the contributions of these brain regions to complex behaviors in mammals. The data are of high quality and the results are compelling and present an important advance in our understanding of CCK driven inhibition in the PFC. In addition, the finding that cannabinoid-mediated DSI is specific to one set of inhibitory outputs adds a new level of refinement to how we think about this well studied form of synaptic plasticity/modulation, and hence the role of this prominent GPCR in cortical physiology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The stated author contributions do not meet the ICMJE recommendations for authorship. See: http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html and https://submit.elifesciences.org/html/elife_author_instructions.html#</p><p>2) Figure 5 and related text. The observation that DSI is prominent at IT connections but not PT connections is interesting and warrants further consideration. The authors suggest that a lower density of CB1R-positive boutons at inputs onto PT (5.7 puncta) versus IT (9.3 puncta) may explain this discrepancy. However this observation seems overly simplistic given the previous STORM study of Dudok et al., 2014, that describe a relatively uniform density of CB1Rs/bouton at somatic versus dendritic targets despite Lee et al., 2010, describing prominent DSI at somatic inputs versus dendritic inputs suggesting a more complex interplay between CB1Rs and downstream machinery that can be anticipated from CB1R distribution alone. Can the authors speculate further about their lack of DSI at PT connections? Do all CCK inputs tested innervate only the somatic compartment of their pyramidal cell counterparts?

The observation that DSI is prominent at IT connections but not PT connections is interesting and warrants further consideration. The authors suggest that a lower density of CB1R-positive boutons at inputs onto PT (5.7 puncta) versus IT (9.3 puncta) may explain this discrepancy. However this observation seems overly simplistic given the previous STORM study of Dudok et al., 2014, that describe a relatively uniform density of CB1Rs/bouton at somatic versus dendritic targets despite Lee et al., 2010, describing prominent DSI at somatic inputs versus dendritic inputs suggesting a more complex interplay between CB1Rs and downstream machinery that can be anticipated from CB1R distribution alone.</p><p>Can the authors speculate further about their lack of DSI at PT connections?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, which we now address in the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Please note we first observed stronger CCK+ inputs onto PT cells (Figure 4C-D), but more CB1R labeling at the cell bodies of IT cells (Figure 4H-J). The latter result suggested there might be differences in DSI at these projection neurons, and we observed more DSI at IT cells (Figure 5). The next question was whether this reflected differences in EC release (postsynaptic) or CB1R sensitivity (presynaptic). Supporting the latter possibility, we found that wash-in of AM-251 reduces CCK+-evoked IPSCs only at IT cells (Figure 6). The way the text was originally written made it seem like the CB1R labeling was an explanation, when really it was a hint that modulation was different. We have therefore rearranged both the text and the figures to make our data and interpretation clearer.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of CB1R+ and CCK+ puncta around IT and PT soma.</title><p>A) Injection schematic.

After all, there are CB1R around the soma of PT cells, yet we consistently do not see modulation in our experiments (Figures 5, 6 and 7). We think it is unlikely that differential modulation reflects somatic versus. dendritic targeting, as we have conducted new experiments that indicate that CCK+ inputs are predominantly somatic onto both IT and PT cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1; more details below). However, we agree it may reflect the nanoscale organization of coupling between presynaptic CB1Rs and the release machinery, and we have revised our Discussion to address these points and discuss other potential mechanisms (Discussion, eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do all CCK inputs tested innervate only the somatic compartment of their pyramidal cell counterparts?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new sCRACM experiments to study the sub-cellular organizations of CCK+ inputs to pyramidal cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). As in our other experiments, we first expressed ChR2 in CCK+ cells and retrogradely labeled IT and PT cells. We then isolated monosynaptic connections by including 1 ÂµM TTX to block APs and 10 ÂµM 4-AP to recover release. We mapped a 75 Âµm spot of light across the entire dendritic arbor and recorded evoked IPSCs at the cell body. Note that we have previously used this approach to map IPSCs at the soma or dendrites of pyramidal cells (Marlin and Carter, 2014). In this case, we found that CCK+ inputs are highly restricted to the soma of both IT cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A-B) and PT cells (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C-D). While there are some inputs to the dendrites of both cell types, there are no major differences in dendritic targeting. We have described this new experiment in the revised text (subsection âCCK+ interneurons make connections onto L5 pyramidal cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If there are 5.7 CB1R-positive puncta at CCK-interneuron inputs to PT cells why are they resistant to exogenous application of the CB1R agonist WIN?</p></disp-quote><p>We speculate that presynaptic CB1Rs at CCK+ inputs onto PT cells may be non-functional, perhaps due to uncoupling of these presynaptic receptors and the release machinery, as described by (Dudok et al., 2015).

In other parts of cortex and hippocampus, subtypes of CCK+ interneurons are classified by intrinsic properties, morphologies, and molecular markers such as VGLUT3 and VIP, and soma sizes (Bodor et al., 2005; Daw et al., 2009; Del Pino et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2010; Omiya et al., 2015; Pelkey et al., 2020; Somogyi et al., 2004). It is certainly possible that one subtype of CCK+ interneurons primarily contacts IT cells and undergoes CB1R modulation, and another subtype contacts PT cells and does not undergo CB1R modulation. Alternatively, individual cells in the same class could make biased connections onto IT and PT cells, or selectively express CB1Rs at the presynaptic terminals of these connections.</p><p>Unfortunately, answering this question proved to be very difficult. We tried to use intersectional genetic tools to separate CCK+ interneurons, but found that the viral tools did not work, and the triple transgenic mice would take too long to establish. We then tried to use triple recordings from CCK+ interneurons, IT cells and PT cells, but the yield was too low, and it was impossible to do these experiments in a timely fashion. We also tried optogenetics, expressing a soma-tagged opsin (st-Chrome) in CCK+ cells, but because we do not have a Dlx version, there was contamination from pyramidal cells. We think this is an extremely interesting question, but will require new technologies to answer, and we think it is beyond the scope of this paper. However, we have now provided additional discussion on this point in the revised manuscript (Discussion, ninth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors seem to assume that CB1R labeling in Figure 6A, B arises from CCK+ interneurons but there is little experimental evidence in support of this possibility.

To address this concern, we performed further immunohistochemical staining experiments, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. CCK+ axons were labeled with GFP, PT or IT cells were retrogradely labeled with tdTomato, and CB1Rs were stained. GFP+ and CB1R+ puncta and their overlap (Duo+) were quantified around the soma of PT and IT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref> â C). As before, we found more CB1R+ puncta at IT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> and C), indicating this is a robust result (see also Figure 4). However, we did not observe differences in either GFP+ puncta or Duo+ at IT and PT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref> and C). One caveat is the variable expression of AAV-Dlx-Flex-GFP virus, which will differ between animals. To address this concern, we also normalized the number of CB1R+GFP+ (Duo+) puncta to the number of GFP+ puncta and found co-labeling of 45% at PT cells and 55% at IT cells, which was a small but significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>). Because we saw no CB1R modulation of CCK+ inputs onto PT cells, this suggests these CB1R+ CCK+ innervations are non-functional. On the other hand, the presence of GFP- CB1R+ puncta could be due to either low efficiency of the viral labeling, or the possibility that they belong to other interneurons. We found these results inconclusive and have not included them in the paper. Instead, we have addressed these points in our revised Discussion, as suggested (eighth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4 and related text.

We recorded CCK+-evoked IPSCs in IT cells at -50mV, obtaining a stable baseline, then washing in 10 ÂµM AM-251 (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A and B). We observed a slight but significant increase of IPSCs after 10 minutes (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B and C; IPSC amplitude ratio AM-251 / baseline = 1.18 Â± 0.10, p = 0.01). This indicates weak tonic CB1R modulation on IT cells. We have included this experiment in the revised text (subsection âEndocannabinoid modulation depends on postsynaptic cell typeâ). However, this tonic CB1R modulation does not explain the large difference between baseline CCK+ inputs onto IT and PT cells (Figure 4D, IPSC amplitude ratio PT/IT = 4.3 Â± 0.9). Instead, we think this is likely due to biased inhibition, which we also observe for PV+, SOM+ and NDNF+ inputs onto IT and PT cells (Anastasiades et al., 2020; Anastasiades et al., 2018).</p><p>We are not sure about the comment on Figure 5, as the data in 5C and 5D were acquired in different cells, and there is no wash epoch.

To achieve this, one could cross CCK-Cre and PV-Flp mice, use CreOn or FlpOn fluorophores to label each population, and perform pair-recordings to determine the relative inputs of vHPC onto PV+ and CCK+ interneurons. However, due to the restrictions of animal ordering and breeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the need to validate the new PV-Flp mice and new FlpOn viruses, we have not yet been able to perform this experiment. If the reviewers feel it is essential, we have just ordered the mice, but it may take another half year to get the results.</p><p>Overall, we think the answer of the relative drive onto PV+ or CCK+ would be certainly interesting but is not crucial to the main findings of this paper.

This experiment was similar to our voltage-clamp DSI experiment shown in Figure 5, except that cells were now recorded in current-clamp, and the âdepolarizationâ was 5 s of 20 Hz APs induced by 5 ms 2 nA step current pulses (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3A). We observed a pronounced reduction of CCK+ IPSPs at IT neurons after the AP train (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B), suggesting possible DSI. However, some of the reduction persisted in the presence of AM-251 (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3C), suggesting other factors may contribute. In both sets of experiments, we also noticed an inevitable hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential after the AP train, which could potentially reduce the IPSP driving force and confound the conclusion of IPSP reduction by CB1R mobilization. To account for this possibility, we also recorded CCK+ IPSPs at the matched hyperpolarized potential for each cell (Vm corrected baseline input) (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3B and C). In control conditions, we found that hyperpolarization reduced the IPSP amplitude, but not as much as the AP train (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3D), confirming that some of the reduction of CCK+ IPSPs may indeed reflect genuine DSI. Consistent with this interpretation, there was also no difference between the effects of hyperpolarization and the AP train in the presence of AM-251 (Figure 5âfigure supplement 3E).
