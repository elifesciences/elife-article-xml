RGC feature selectivity arises from their synapses with a specific subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types, but how RGC dendrites arborize and collect input from these specific subsets remains poorly understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that RGCs employ molecular recognition systems to meet this challenge. By combining calcium imaging and type-specific histological stains, we define a family of circuits that express the recognition molecule Sidekick-1 (Sdk1), which include a novel RGC type (S1-RGC) that responds to local edges. Genetic and physiological studies revealed that Sdk1 loss selectively disrupts S1-RGC visual responses, which result from a loss of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and selective dendritic deficits on this neuron. We conclude that Sdk1 shapes dendrite growth and wiring to help S1-RGCs become feature selective.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal circuitry</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>two-photon</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin superfamily</kwd><kwd>retinal ganlgion cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnaswamy</surname><given-names>Arjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>discovery grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krishnaswamy</surname><given-names>Arjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rochon</surname><given-names>Pierre-Luc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rangel Olguin</surname><given-names>Aline Giselle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rangel Olguin</surname><given-names>Aline Giselle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel retinal ganglion cell requires a cell adhesion molecule to grow its dendrites, collect synaptic inputs, and become selective to edges placed in its receptive field.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the retina, each of the ~46 types of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) synapses with a unique subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types to create circuits that detect a unique aspect of the visual scene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark and Demb, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gollisch and Meister, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jadzinsky and Baccus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). A growing body of work suggests that recognition molecules guide the neurites of newborn retinal neurons to grow into sublayers of a specialized neuropil, the inner plexiform layer (IPL), where they contact hundreds of potential synaptic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rangel Olguin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanes and Zipursky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The factors that guide developing arbors to synapse with appropriate targets within a layer are not well understood. An initial idea, called Peter’s principle, posited that developing neurons synapse with nearby cells according to how often they make contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binzegger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peters and Feldman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>). However, recent connectomic studies of the IPL demonstrate no obvious relationship between contact frequency and synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, these connectomic data support a model in which neurons recognize targets in their immediate vicinity and synapse specifically with them. Key molecules in this recognition process are thought to be members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSFs).</p><p>Briefly, IgSFs are adhesion molecules that bind to themselves (homophilic) or compatible IgSFs (heterophilic) across cell-cell junctions. It has been proposed that selective IgSF expression within synaptic partners allows their neurites to adhere and synapse when they encounter each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanes and Zipursky, 2020</xref>). A recent study in mouse retina provides support for this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, the IgSF Sidekick-2 (Sdk2) in VG3-ACs and W3B RGCs drives these neurons to connect with each other far more than they connect with the Sdk2-negative neurons they contact. Loss of Sdk2 ablates the enhanced VG3-W3B connectivity but does not alter the gross structure or overlap of their arbors, suggesting that IgSFs increase the probability of synapses between this pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, direction-selective RGCs require the IgSF contactin 5 (Cntn5) to grow dendritic branches in IPL layers bearing axons of their AC/BC partners. Loss of Cntn5 from these RGCs decreases their dendritic branches and reduces synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that IgSFs influence connectivity by regulating intralaminar dendritic growth. These studies suggest a common role for these IgSFs to stabilize/promote the growth of small dendrites that lead to synapses or suggest differing roles for IgSFs in synaptic specificity and neurite growth. Too few IgSFs have been studied in the context of mammalian circuit assembly to draw a firm conclusion. To gain more insight, we investigated the closest IgSF relative of Cntn5 and Sdk2, called Sidekick-1 (Sdk1), in retinal circuit assembly.</p><p>We show that Sdk1 is expressed by a family of five RGCs whose dendrites target IPL layers bearing the processes of five Sdk1-expressing interneurons (ACs and BCs). We uncover molecular markers for each Sdk1 RGC and applied these markers following calcium imaging to investigate their visual responses, discovering that the Sdk1 family includes two ON-direction-selective RGCs and an RGC (S1-RGC) sensitive to local edges. Loss of Sdk1 disrupted responses to visual stimuli on S1-RGCs without affecting other members of the Sdk1-RGC family. Using electrophysiological recordings, we show that Sdk1 loss reduced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to S1-RGCs, decreasing its firing to visual stimuli. These synaptic deficits were specific to S1-RGCs as stimulus-evoked responses on Sdk1+ ON-alpha RGCs were unaffected by Sdk1 loss. Finally, we show that the loss of Sdk1 does not alter the IPL layer targeting of S1-RGC dendrites but selectively reduces their intralaminar complexity and size. From our results, we conclude that Sdk1 is required for S1-RGCs to develop dendritic arbors and receive AC and BC synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sdk1 labels a family of retinal circuits</title><p>To investigate the expression of Sdk1 across the retina, we used mice in which the <italic>Sdk1</italic> gene is disrupted by the presence of cDNA encoding a Cre-GFP fusion protein (<italic>Sdk1</italic><sup>CG</sup>); as heterozygotes these lines allow selective access to Sdk1 neurons, as homozygotes they are Sdk1 nulls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamagata and Sanes, 2018</xref>).

Two clusters correspond to alpha RGCs with sustained responses to light onset (ONα-RGCs) and type 2 melanopsin-positive RGCs (M2-RGCs). Four others predicted novel RGCs types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To map these clusters onto GFP+ RGCs, we compared Sdk1 clusters to all RGCs and identified five genes that combinatorially label each Sdk1-RGC type: (1) Onα-RGCs should strongly express neurofilament heavy chain isoform (Nefh), osteopontin (Ost), and the intracellular calcium buffer calbindin (Calb); (2) M2-RGCs should express high levels of Ost+, low levels of Nefh, and low levels of Calb; (3) two predicted novel RGCs should express the steroid hormone receptor Nr2f2 (Nr2f2), (4) with one of these also expressing Calb; (5) another novel RGC should express the Pou-domain containing transcription factor (Brn3c); and (6) a final RGC should not express any of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We took advantage of the mosaic arrangement of retinal types as an initial test of these predictions.

Staining retinae from these mice with our panel of molecular markers revealed the morphology of two Sdk1-RGCs: (1) Ost+/Nefh+ RGCs bore large somas and wide dendritic arbors confined to IPL sublamina 5 and matched previous descriptions of ONα-RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and P</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krieger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>); and (2) Brn3c+ RGCs had small somas and grew dendritic arbors confined to the center of sublamina 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M and Q</xref>). We refer to these Brn3c+ neurons as S1-RGCs. Ost+/Nefh- and Nr2f2+ RGCs were rarely observed using this method. These results suggest that only a subset of Sdk1-RGCs project strongly to the LGN and SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and D</xref>).</p><p>One possibility for our relatively poor labeling of Ost+/Nefh- and Nr2f2+ RGCs is that these RGCs innervate ‘non-imaging-forming’ brain regions more strongly than they innervate the LGN and SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martersteck et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this idea, brain sections taken from intraocularly infected Sdk1<sup>CG</sup> mice showed reporter-labeled RGC axons in the non-image-forming medial terminal nucleus (MTN) and olivary pretectal nuclei (OPN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). To sparsely label these RGCs, we tamoxifen-treated <italic>Sdk1</italic><sup>CreER/+</sup> mice crossed to Cre-dependent reporters and stained their retinae with Ost, Nefh, Nr2f2, and Calb.

We observed a few Ost+/Nefh- RGC somas in fields labeled densely by reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), but we were unable to mark them individually, likely due to their low density (~20/mm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>).

To relate these signals to spiking behavior, we recorded responses from control S1-RGCs to an expanding spot centered over their receptive field that flashed ON and OFF. S1-RGCs showed ON and OFF responses to this stimulus that were strongly suppressed by spot size, with OFF responses nearly silenced by spots exceeding ~300 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We suspected the inability to align bars with S1-RGC-receptive fields in the imaging studies could have activated their strong surround and attenuated their responses to this stimulus. We revisited the idea that these neurons might exhibit sensitivity to stimulus orientation, presenting stationary bars whose width matched the receptive field size of S1-RGCs and rotated through eight different orientations. As expected from their responses to moving bars, S1-RGCs responded preferentially to both bright and dark bars oriented along a single axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), whereas Onα-RGCs respond to bright bars alone with little response variation to bar orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).

We next asked if Sdk1 loss impacts the lateral anatomy of S1-RGC dendrites. We found that the loss of Sdk1 led S1-RGCs to grow dendritic arbors that were less complex than their control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Sdk1-null S1-RGC arbors contained similar numbers of dendritic branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), but they were approximately half as long on average, which led to fewer intersections across the entire dendritic arbor as assessed by Sholl analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–M</xref>). Reduced S1-RGC dendritic arbor size did not alter the spatial distribution of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). These deficits arose with little gross change in the overall structure of the IPL, as assessed by staining with a variety of markers that label AC and BC subsets targeting specific sublayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In the first section of this study, we molecularly, anatomically, and functionally defined five Sdk1 interneurons (ACs and BCs) and five Sdk1-RGCs that target an inner set of IPL lamina. This family of RGCs includes two ON-DSGC types and ON-OFF S1-RGCs; the latter shows selectivity for edges located in their receptive field. In the second section, we found that Sdk1 loss caused a significant loss of S1-RGC responsivity with smaller effects on the other Sdk1-RGC types. By comparing visual responses between S1-RGCs and Onα-RGCs in control and Sdk1 nulls, we show that the loss of Sdk1 impairs S1-RGCs’ responses to both bright and dark spot stimuli, as well as oriented bars. Finally, we show that these deficits arise from a selective loss of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input on S1-RGCs and correlates with a selective loss of small branches in this neuron’s dendritic arbor. We conclude that Sdk1 is required for the dendritic and synaptic development of a local edge-detecting RGC type.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A family of Sdk1 circuits</title><p>Transcriptomic studies indicate that RGCs can be divided into at least 46 different clusters, which include several clusters that do not correspond to any known RGC and are predicted to be novel.

Both cell types exhibit stronger responses to bars whose speed matches the preferred tuning of ON-DSGCs (200 μm/s) and elaborate medium-field dendritic arbors confined to sublamina 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lilley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsumoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>).

These results strongly suggest that Nr2f2+ Sdk1 RGCs comprise two subtypes of ON-DSGCs.</p><p>S1-RGCs are a high-density, narrow dendritic field neuron, characterized by small (&lt;200 μm) diameter dendritic arbors, strong surround suppression, and responses to both bright and dark stimuli. Similar properties have been found in several other RGCs that respond to stimuli falling in their receptive field center but are silenced when the same stimuli fall in their surround. One of these RGCs, called W3B, expresses Sdk2 and grows into sublamina 3 just like S1-RGCs, suggesting that the Sdk family plays unique roles in the development of two physically entangled, but functionally distinct local edge-detecting circuits. Four other edge-sensing types are described in a recent atlas of functionally and anatomically defined RGC types. Of these, S1-RGCs most closely resemble type 1 or type 2 high-definition RGCs (HD1 or HD2). Like S1-RGCs, HD1 and HD2 are ON-OFF cells and can respond to edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacoby and Schwartz, 2017</xref>). However, S1-RGCs also show sensitivity to edge orientation, which could arise from their orthogonally tuned excitatory and inhibitory inputs. This input arrangement has been observed in recently described horizontally and vertically selective OS-RGCs; however, these neurons show significantly stronger orientation selectivity compared to S1-RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nath and Schwartz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nath and Schwartz, 2017</xref>). We cautiously speculate that S1-RGCs are a kind of local edge detector with sensitivity to edge orientation. Such a local orientation-selective RGC was reported in a recent calcium imaging survey of RGCs (G14, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baden et al., 2016</xref>); however, a lack of molecular markers in both studies prevented us from drawing a clear correspondence.

The factors that guide neurons to synapse with targets once they reach appropriate layers are the least characterized, but preliminary work in mammals and invertebrates suggests that IgSF members play a key role in this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cosmanescu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanes and Zipursky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamagata and Sanes, 2018</xref>). Our work here adds to these findings.</p><p>We previously showed that an IgSF called Sdk2 enriches connections between VG3-ACs and W3B-RGCs, permitting this RGC to sense object motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). In a separate study, we showed that a different IgSF, contactin 5 (Cntn5), was required for ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs to elaborate dendrites within sublamina 4 and collect input from ACs and BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al., 2017</xref>). Too few IgSFs have been studied in the context of mammalian circuit assembly to know whether the differing roles for Sdk2 and Cntn5 represent distinct roles for each IgSF or whether they represent two ends of a continuum in which IgSFs direct small-scale RGC-AC/BC interactions that lead to specific synapses. Here, we show that the closest common relative of Sdk2 and Cntn5, Sdk1, has roles in both phenomena as Sdk1 loss causes deficits in both dendritic branching and appearance of functional synapses on S1-RGCs. We hypothesize that both deficits arise because of a lack of homophilic adhesion between S1-RGCs and Sdk1+ interneurons. Our histological survey of Sdk1-interneurons suggests sublamina 3 projecting wide-field ACs, and possibly type 7 BCs, as potential interneuron targets of S1-RGCs. More characterization of these Sdk1-interneuron types, independent genetic access to these neurons, and Sdk1 misexpression methods is needed to directly test this idea.</p><p>Four RGCs express both Sdk1 and Sdk2. Effects of Sdk1 deletion on RGC types that express both Sdk1 and Sdk2 were modest (ON-DSGCs) or undetectable (ONα-RGCs). We considered the possibility that Sdk1 loss led to Sdk2 upregulation, but we did not observe a significant change in Sdk2 mRNA in Sdk1 null retinae. Simple alternatives are that Sdk1 plays a subsidiary role in these cells or that it is required for structural or functional features that we did not assay. Examining the morphology and function of Onα-RGCs and/or ON-DSGCs in Sdk2 nulls and Sdk1/Sdk2 double knockouts would be a starting point to investigate the role of Sdks in these neurons.</p><p>Exactly how Sdks exert their connectivity-enriching effects is not clear, but both proteins localize to synapses through an interaction with the MAGI family of PDZ-scaffolding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamagata and Sanes, 2010</xref>). In the case of Sdk2, VG3-W3B connectivity was reduced with only minor changes to the dendritic arbors of these two neurons, suggesting that Sdks instruct synapses between interneuron-RGC pairs, which may in turn have positive effects on their dendritic arbors. Sdk1 loss causes similar losses in interneuron input to S1-RGCs but the morphological deficits on this cell are more severe, suggesting a more permissive role for Sdks in synapse formation through control of dendritic growth. The genetic and molecular definition of Sdk1 and Sdk2 expressing RGCs provided by our studies, paired with time-lapse imaging in explants, might offer a way to directly examine these alternatives.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Retrogradely infecting AAVs were used for brain injections while AAV9 was used for intravitreal injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Injections</title><p>AAVs were injected either intraocularly or intracranially to label Sdk1-RGCs. For intracranial injections, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (2.5% in O<sub>2</sub>), given a combination of subcutaneous carprofen and local bupivacaine/lidocaine mix for analgesia, transferred to a stereotaxic apparatus, and a small craniotomy (&lt;1 mm) made in the appropriate location on the skull using a dental drill. Next, a Neuros syringe (65460–03, Hamilton, Reno, NV) filled with virus was lowered into either the LGN (2.15 mm posterior from bregma, 2.27 mm lateral from the midline and 2.75 mm below the pia) or SC (3.85 mm posterior from bregma, 0.75 mm lateral from the midline and 1.5 mm below the pia) using a stereotaxic manipulator. A microsyringe pump (UMP3-4, World Precision Instrument, Sarasota, FL) was used to infuse 400 nL of virus (15 nL/s) bilaterally in dLGN or SC and the bolus allowed to equilibrate for 8 min before removing the needle. For intraocular injections, mice were anesthetized as above, given carprofen as analgesic, and 1 μL of virus injected via an incision posterior to the eye’s ora serrata using a bevelled Hamilton syringe (7803-05, 7634-01, Hamilton). Mice were given at least 2 weeks to recover before experimental use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tamoxifen</title><p>Tamoxifen (TMX) (MillliporeSigma, Cat#T5648) was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol at 200 mg/mL, diluted in sunflower oil to 10 mg/mL, sonicated at 40ºC until dissolved, and stored at –20°C. Prior to injection, TMX aliquots were heated to 37°C and delivered intraperitoneally at ~1 g/50 g body weight to Sdk1<sup>CreER</sup>xAi27D mice. The dose was repeated twice over 2 days and mice were used between 2 and 4 weeks following treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were euthanized by isoflurane overdose and transcardially perfused with chilled PBS followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS and enucleated. Eye cups were fixed for an additional 45 min and brains fixed for an additional 2–5 hr in chilled 4% (w/v) PFA. For whole-mount stains, tissue was incubated in primary antibodies for 7 days at 4°C and incubated in secondary antibodies overnight at 4°C following a series of washes. Stains following two-photon calcium imaging were performed similarly but included lectin to stain blood vessels for registration. Identical procedures were used to stain thick brain sections obtained cutting 100-μm-thick slices from tissue embedded in 2.5% low EEO agarose (MilliporeSigma, A0576) using a compresstome (VF-200-0Z, Precisionary Instruments, Greenville, NC). For cross-sections, post-fixed retinae were sunk in 40% (w/v) sucrose/PBS, transferred to embedding agent (OCT, Tissue-Plus, Fischer Scientific), flash frozen in 2-methylbutane at –45°C, and then sectioned onto slides at 30 μm thickness on a cryostat. For immunostaining, slides were first washed in PBS, blocked with blocking solution (4% normal donkey serum, 0.4% Triton-X-100 in PBS) for 2 hr and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C.

Briefly, intercellular distances from each cell to every cell were computed using Pythagoras’ theorem and binned into 15-μm-wide annuli centered upon the reference cell; for Onα- and M2-RGCs, annulus width equaled 25 μm. Counts within each annulus were divided by annulus area, averaged across a given condition, fitted with a sigmoid curve for visual clarity, and plotted alongside DRPs obtained from the entire GFP+ population for comparison. The density of each Sdk1-RGC type was obtained by dividing marker-labeled cells by image area. These values were averaged for each type and compared to mean density of all GFP+ cells as a bar graph. The mean cell density obtained from this analysis was used to assess the proportion of cells labeled by Sdk1 among BCs, ACs, and RGCs.</p><p>We analyzed dendritic morphology as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krishnaswamy et al., 2015</xref>).

Next, retinae were mounted onto a filter paper with the RGC layer facing up, placed in a recording chamber, mounted on the stage of a custom-built two-photon microscope, and perfused with oxygenated Ames solution warmed to 32–34°C.

A few microliters of sulphorhodamine 101 (SR101, 2 mg/mL, MilliporeSigma, Cat#S7635) was added to the recording chamber to label blood vessels and a map of the main blood vessels emanating from the optic disk acquired for post hoc image registration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Post hoc image registration and RGC ROI selection</title><p>Following each calcium imaging session, averages of each calcium imaged field were stitched into a single image using custom software written in MATLAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rochon et al., 2021</xref>; Dryad: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4xgxd2593">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4xgxd2593</ext-link>).

For cell-attached recordings, the patch electrodes (4–5 MΩ) were filled with Ames solution. For whole-cell recordings, patch electrodes (5–7 MΩ) were filled with an internal solution containing 112 mM Cs methanosulfate, 10 mM NaAc, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, 8 mM CsCl, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4). In both cell-attached and whole-cell recordings, fluorescein 3000 MW dextran (Thermo Scientific, D7156) was added to make the electrode visible under two-photon illumination. For whole-cell recordings, internal solution was supplemented with 5 mM QX314 Bromide. Excitatory currents and inhibitory currents were isolated by adjusting the holding potential to match reversal potentials for excitation (0 mV) and inhibition (E<sub>Cl</sub> ~ –60 mV). Signals from loose-patch and whole-cell recordings were acquired with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitized at 20 kHz using custom software written in LabView. For spikes, the MultiClamp was put into I = 0 mode and Bessel filter set at 1 kHz. For currents, the MultiClamp was put in VC mode and Bessel filter set at 3 kHz. Analysis of electrophysiological signals was performed in MATLAB (Simulink) as follows. Briefly, action potentials were detected in loose patch recordings using the <italic>peakfinder</italic> function and binned (50 ms) over the entire length of the trial; firing rate histograms for each trial were then averaged and subjected to further processing based on each stimulus. Direction and orientation-selective indices were computed from mean firing rate histograms as described for calcium imaging data. For whole-cell currents, trials were averaged, peak amplitude measured, and integral were computed using the <italic>trapz</italic> function across each stimulus epoch. For stationary bar stimuli, integrated currents for each bar flash were normalized to average maximum in controls, plotted against bar orientation for each cell, and then peak responses aligned and averaged across all RGCs in heterozygote or knockout retinae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Visual stimuli</title><p>A DLP light crafter (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX) was used to project monochrome (410 nm) visual stimuli through a custom lens assembly that steered stimulus patterns into the back of a 20× objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euler et al., 2009</xref>).

Moving bar stimuli consisted of a bright bar moving along its long axis in one of eight directions. The bar was 1200 μm wide, 3200 μm long moving at either 960 μm/s (fast) or 240 μm/s (slow). For electrophysiological experiments, the cell-receptive field center was identified using a grid of flashing spots and a small user-controlled probe and the location with the highest response assigned as the center for all subsequent stimuli. Moving bars were thinned for electrophysiological experiments to 200 μm; length and speed were the same as calcium imaging studies. Expanding spot stimuli began as a small circle that flashed at the receptive field center and grew after each ON-OFF flash. Stationary, rotating bars had the same dimensions as those for the moving bar but flashed and rotated through nine orientations.

In this study, the research is carried out in the retina where there are several features that make it a strong candidate to address these questions-namely cell types are well defined and the locations of synapses between different cell types are clearly demarcated in plexiform layers within which axons and dendrites of the neurons that comprise distinct microcircuits co-stratify.</p><p>The authors take advantage of this system to explore the role that a candidate molecular marker from immunoglobulin superfamily of adhesion molecules called Sidekicks (Sdks). A prior study showed that Sdk2 was critical for matching of a particular interneuron with a particular subtype of RGC. Here the authors explore Sdk1.</p><p>The authors use a large array of anatomical markers (derived from lists of genes in recent RNA transcript libraries) to identify the 5-6 different RGC subtypes that express Sdk1. They use multiple methods to confirm this assignment to cell types including morphology, immunofluorescence, projection patterns to the brain and light responses. They go on to show that in the Sdk1-ko mouse, only one of these subtypes exhibits a large phenotype – a significant reduction in the light responses. Using whole cell voltage clamp recordings, they show that his reduction in light response is correlated with a is a reduction in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, consistent with a lack of synapse formation. This is a convincing set of data that they have identified a factor that is critical for the formation of a microcircuit within the retina. There is also a bigger picture, which is that this class of Sdk2 adhesion molecules may be part of a molecular code used by multiple circuits to wire up during development.</p><p>This is an extremely thorough study that identifies the role that Sidekick 1 – a member of the IgSF family of adhesion molecules – plays in the wiring up a particular microcircuits in the retina. First the authors use multiple methods to identify the cells that express Sdk1 – identifying 5-6 different RGC subtypes and a few amacrine and bipolar cell subtypes. Using information from RGC sequencing atlases, they identify candidate proteins that can be used to further classify these RGC subtypes and are able to positively identify 5 of them – 2 that were named subtypes and 3 that were not. Taking advantage of some genetic tricks (i.e. sparse labeling of SDK-1-Cre x with flex mouse, non-sparse labeling for anterograde projections, retrograde AAVs injected in L and SC) the authors were able to use immunofluorescence, morphology and projections patterns to further classify the cells. Finally, they characterize the light responses if these cells using calcium imaging. By combining all of these methods, they make a strong case that they have labeled ON-α RGCs, M2-iRGCs two different ON direction selective GCs and a difficult-to-classify cell – -the S1. Note the S1 cells send dendrites in S3 of the IPL, which the authors show also contains processes from excitatory and inhibitory interneurons that are also Sdk1 positive. Hence these are good candidate for Sdk1-dependent circuit-wiring.</p><p>They then look in the Sdk1 KO mouse. First they use 2p calcium imaging to assess the impact on all the different Sdk1+ RGCs. They identify the subtypes post imaging by finding the same field of view and using antibody staining (though this method has now been used by a few labs, they do an excellent job describing their method in a supplemental figure). They find deficits in actually quite a few cell types but this biggest impact is on the S1-RGCs, which have a greatly reduced light response.</p><p>Using the intersection between GFP expression under SDK1-Cre-GFP fusion mouse + retrograde labeling from SC/LGN, they are able to target electrodes to just two subtypes of Sdk1+ RGCs, the S1s and the On-alphas. Hence they can directly compare the impact of the knockout on spiking properties and synaptic inputs to these two cell types. They see dramatic reduction in light responses and EPSCs and IPSCs onto these cells in S1-RGCs. In contrast, they see no phenotype at all on On-α RGCs. This is strong evidence that there is reduction in synapse formation onto S1 cells but not all Sdk1+ RGC subtypes.</p><p>In some ways the impact of this study seems small – one adhesion molecule impacts one microcircuit within the retina. But I would argue that the methods used and the completeness of the study represent a broader impact. There were many important insights – for example multiple cells might have a particular adhesion molecule but it is required for only one microcircuit. Also, the authors have identified more markers for different RGC types and have done this classification in the context of development. These sorts of observations are critical for ultimately understanding the molecular code for wiring up the retina. For these reasons, I think this study represent a significant step forward in the field.</p><p>I do think in a revision that perhaps the authors can zoom out a bit and give the readers a bigger picture. How big is the Sdk family of proteins? Are they alternatively spliced? How numerous are they compared to say protocadherins, or semaphorins or other factors that have been implicated. Again – I think this will make it more relevant for broader audience.</p><p>Below are a few comments that will hopefully clarify the presentation.</p><p>1. The one major issue I have is with Figure 1 H-K. The authors are strongly recommended to read a recent review (Keely, Elgen and Reese,JCN, 2020) arguing that density recover profiles that do not take into account soma size are not revealing mosaic organization and therefore this really cannot be used to &quot;verify&quot; they have a cell type. That said. I don't think the lack of the mosaic analysis will not significantly weaken their results -- the antibody staining + physiology is sufficient for indicating that they have different cell types.</p><p>2. (Lines 108-114/Figure 1 T-U )- the authors want to argue that Ost+/Nefh- are M2-ipRGCs and so they look at projections to the MTN via anterograde labeling. However, it is unclear how they correlate anterograde projections with the Ost+/Nefh- RGCs in retina. This needs to be clarified.</p><p>3. Labels in Figure 1are very hard to read. Also, I strongly recommend that the authors refer to the different RGC subtypes in subsequent figures as their better known subtypes (M2, α, ON-DSGC) rather than the immunipositive proteins. It was quite confusing. – I had to print out Figure 1V and use it several times to figure out what was going on in several figures.</p><p>4. For Figure 2 – it was not clear when the authors were using GCaMP in all RGCs (expressed under vglut-Cre – line 163) or specific for Sdk1-Cre (line 138).</p><p>5. Figure 2 – is bar velocity 1000mm/sec (which I believe is the speed of an action potential!) or 1000 µm/sec?</p><p>6. Figure 2 – would be great if there were some quantification go figures H and I – are all Pcdh-Cre stained for Nr2f2? What percentage for Calb+?</p><p>7. Figure 3 – there seems like a substantial loss of DS in the ON-DSGCs that the authors should note. Again, this broadens the impact of the study because clearly Sdk1 is important for this circuit, but the impact is more subtle. It is not that they need to study it here but it is important to emphasis the multiple impacts it has. Hence line is 220-221 are not quite accurate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study Rochon et al., elucidate the distribution of an adhesion molecule called Sidekick 1 (Sdk1) among retinal neurons. Sidekicks are a family of cell adhesion molecules, implicated in organization of dendritic arbors among retinal neurons, and also in regulating the organization of synapses across specific visual circuits. The authors show that Sdk1 is selectively expressed among 5 retinal output (ganglion cell) types, 3 inhibitory interneuron (amacrine) cells and 2 excitatory interneuron (bipolar) cell types, all in the inner retina. Using a combination of genetic tools and cell specific markers, the authors detail the identity of the cell types expressing Sdk1 in the retina. Using a loss of function approach, the authors show that lack of Sdk1 impacts the synaptic connectivity and visual response properties of a specific retinal output neuron (retinal ganglion cell or RGC) type that responds to local edges. This interesting work reveals a selective role of Sdk1 for the function of a specific visual circuit, and as such the authors succeeded in the task they set out to achieve i.e., determine the distribution and an insight into possible functional role(s) of Sdk1 in the retina. The strengths of this study are the combinatorial approach of genetic tools, electrophysiology and functional imaging and the data are of a high standard.</p><p>There are some weaknesses though, in the current version of the manuscript that if addressed would strengthen the work and its implications.</p><p>(i) The current version used Sdk1 HET animals (with one copy of Sdk1) as controls for all functional and morphological experiments, but it is unclear how cells in the HET retina compare in terms of visual responses and morphology to cells in a wildtype retina with two copies of Sdk1. It is thus difficult to extrapolate the magnitude of visual response deficits or dendritic mis-organization of cells in the Sdk1 deficient retinas.</p><p>(ii) The feature of the S1-RGC responding to local edges could be detailed further to include consideration of potential temporal sensitivity/tuning of the cells and asymmetry between their ON and OFF response profiles as is often observed for other RGCs that respond to local edges. Comparison between the ON vs OFF components in control retina are also of merit since the OFF responses are impacted more than the ON responses in the Sdk1 deficient retinas, underscoring a potential asymmetry in how Sdk1 could wire these RGCs.</p><p>(iii) The authors show that Sdk1 could be implicated in regulating the synaptic connectivity of a specific retinal ganglion cell (S1-RGC) type that responds to local edges but do not discuss whether these interactions could be homophilic or heterophilic and whether or not the 5 interneurons that express Sdk1 could serve as presynaptic partners to the S1-RGC (or the other RGC types expressing Sdk1). Such a discussion would be of benefit in consideration of the fact that some RGC types that express Sdk1, like the ON DS or ONalpha, have known presynaptic bipolar cell and amacrine cell partners that lack Sdk1 expression. Additionally, most of the amacrine and bipolar cell types shown to express Sdk1 do not co-laminate with the S1-RGC. Thus, a heterophilic mode of interaction for Sdk1's wiring of specific visual circuits seems to be likely which appears different from the homophilic interactions that underlie Sdk2 connections between VG3 amacrine cells and W3B RGCs that both express Sdk2 (authors' previous work). Because Sdk1 is a close relative of Sdk2 that appears to operate differently, a discussion would enable readers to better grasp the context and significance of the work.</p><p>(iv) Even though Sdk1 is expressed by 5 different ganglion cell types, its loss seems to selectively perturb the synaptic connectivity and functional responses of one specific (S1-RGC) ganglion type, indicating that perhaps other members of the Sdk family could compensate for lack of Sdk1 in the unaffected ganglion cell types. Inclusion of data indicating whether or not Sdk2 or other Sdk1 relatives are upregulated in these unaffected ganglion cell types in Sdk1 deficient retinas, would clarify the redundancy between these IgSF members during retinal circuit formation and also clarify why the loss of Sdk1 leaves certain retinal circuits unperturbed.</p><p>The following concerns should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>(1) How close is the Sdk1 HET retina to a wildtype retina with two copies of Sdk1? Could the authors compare RGC responses they obtain in the Sdk1 HET to responses in a wildtype retina to enable the reader to grasp the magnitude of deficits upon Sdk1 deficiency? As the authors have done an incredible job of findings cell specific markers for each of the RGC types that express Sdk1, they could use these markers to correlate responses in HET vs wildtype retina. At the minimum, responses from easily identifiable RGC types like the ONalpha or the ON DS which the authors have a specific transgenic line for, could be recorded in retinas with two copies of Sdk1 to evaluate how similar these are compared to the responses (using the same stimuli and lighting conditions) obtained from HET retinas with a single Sdk1 copy. This data would be helpful to validate the use of the Sdk1 HET as a control.</p><p>(2) Given that previous accounts of edge sensitive RGC types like the HD RGCs show that these cells are most responsive to specific speeds (Jacoby and Schwartz 2017), it would be worth determining if the S1-RGC type detailed in this work are also tuned to a specific speed of stimuli. This aspect of temporal tuning would aid the characterization of the response profile of the S1-RGC type. The authors would most likely already have this data as they have made a similar temporal tuning determination for the ON DS RGCs.</p><p>(3) Along the same lines, edge sensing RGCs can have ON and OFF responses that are not symmetrical (Jacoby and Schwartz 2017; Roska and Werblin 2001). As such it would add to the characterization of the S1-RGC response profile, if the authors could determine if the ON and OFF responses of the S1-RGC are symmetric/equivalent or not. From the examples shown in Figure 4 it appears as though the ON responses are more prominent than the OFF both for the expanding spot and orientation experiments i.e., more spikes allocated during light increments. Other edge sensing RGCs can have one component (ON or OFF) more dominant and thus it would be important for the reader to know whether the S1-RGC shows a similar asymmetry or not. Again, the authors already have this data so it should be straight forward to analyze and perhaps include plots where the ON and OFF responses (# of spikes) of the S1-RGCs are compared in the same plot.</p><p>(4) The authors indicate that Sdk2 might be compensating for Sdk1 in the RGC types unaffected by Sdk1 deficiency. However, they do not provide evidence for whether or not Sdk2 is upregulated in the unaffected RGCs upon Sdk1 deficiency. The authors have generated antibodies to Sdk2 in their previous work which could be used to determine whether or not Sdk2 expression is upregulated amongst select RGC types upon Sdk1 deficiency (this could be compared in HET vs knockout).</p><p>(5) The authors bring up the homophilic vs heterophilic interactions between IgSFs like Sdks in the Introduction section when discussing the role of IgSFs like Sdks for synapse formation but do not include a discussion of whether Sdk1 could be operating via homophilic or heterophilic interactions to set up synaptic connections in the inner retina. Given the Sdk1 expression profiles it appears that Sdk1 could operate via heterophilic interactions, which is different from how Sdk2 wires the VG3 amacrine cell-W3B RGC circuit and it would be of benefit to the reader to include a discussion of the mechanistic basis of Sdk1 interactions in the inner retina and speculation of which Sdk1 presynaptic partners (amacrine or bipolar) are likely to be engaged or not.</p><p>(6) The authors need to include more details as to how the mean cell density analysis was done from the density recovery profiles as the current version of the manuscript lacks sufficient detail for this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This paper evaluates the role of sidekick-1, a recognition molecule that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Sidekick-1 is expressed in interneurons and 3 previously-defined ganglion cell types, including the ON α, 2 ON-DS, and a novel edge detector S1-RGC. The elimination of the sidekick 1 has the most severe effects on the S1-RGC, causing its dendritic arbors to be less extensive, to receive fewer excitatory and inhibitory inputs, and in losing its orientation tuning. The knockout of sidekick-1 has less severe effects on the other ganglion cell types. This work fits into the great challenge of identifying cell types by molecular, functional, and morphological parameters. The authors have focused on one type of ganglion cell that expresses sidekick-1 and use calcium imaging, single cell recordings, and morphological assessment to demonstrate what this cell might do functionally and how it is perturbed in the absence of sidekick-1. The strength of this paper is the demonstration that elimination of Sidekick-1 has effects on the inputs to these ganglion cells. Perhaps the main weaknesses of this paper are (1) the S1 ganglion cell's functional classification as weakly tuned orientation selective and an edge detector has not been shown convincingly, and (2) how and why these cells are changed in the absence of Sidekick-1 remains speculative, yet the mechanism is attributed to sidekick-1's role in synapse formation, which has not been demonstrated directly.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The authors show that high levels of Sdk2 in On-α, M2, and ON-DSGCs compensate for the loss of Sdk1 and attenuates phenotypes. To elucidate whether intact phenotypes are truly due to compensatory increase in Sdk2 expression or the functional properties of these 3 RGC types are independent of Sdk1, it would be helpful to understand the relative expression levels of Sdk1 and Sdk2 in Sdk1-expressing RGCs. Without such data, it is difficult to distinguish between lack of a role for Sdk-1 vs a compensatory effect of Sdk2 expression in the other cell types (α, ON DS).</p><p>The authors call these ganglion cells local edge detectors without clear evidence in Figure 2.</p><p>This system used by the authors has the advantage of gaining mechanistic insight into how this recognition molecule works in the development of a well-defined circuit, yet the authors fall short of providing this insight.</p><p>The authors should confirm if there are any morphological and physiological changes in Sdk1 heterozygotes compared to control retina. (Note from Reviewing editor: experiments proposed by Reviewer 2 would address this).</p><p>Figure 1: If possible, the authors also show the ganglion cell axon terminals in the LGN and SC labeled from the Cre expression in the eye. This is important to establish that the AAV-based retrograde labeling in Figure 4 is working as the authors think it is.</p><p>Figure 1 H-K, Figure 2H: The multiple channels are difficult to evaluate. The authors should show in the supplementary material the immunolabeling in individual channels.</p><p>It is unclear what about Figure 2E demonstrates that S1-RGCs are responding to local edges since there is not information about receptive field sizes yet. Figure 2 shows that the S1-RGCs have weak OS, are not DS, and have ON-OFF light responses. Only the information from Figure 4 reveals that these cells may be local edge detectors. (Note from Reviewing editor: experiments proposed by Reviewer 2 would address this).</p><p>Figure 3. Sholl analysis is not showing a striking difference between the control and Sdk-1 KO. The ON α ganglion cells also have differences at 3 locations with significance. The authors' claim of the relative stability of ON α is not compelling and should soften these claims.</p><p>The authors speculate that the orthogonal tunings of excitatory and inhibitory inputs contribute to orientation-selective properties of S1-RGCs. While excitatory inputs retain orientation-tuning properties, inhibitory inputs completely lose the orientation selectivity. To elucidate how the loss of Sdk1 affects inhibitory inputs from amacrine cells, it would be helpful to investigate the morphology of 3 kinds of Sdk1-ACs that the author discovered in KO mice. How does the loss of inhibitory orientation-selectivity affect spike output? As shown in the supplementary material, the most striking effect of the Sdk1 KO is the obliteration of inhibition to orientation selectivity. Can the authors better elucidate the contributions of each of these inputs to orientation selectivity? Clarification of these issues is needed.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that the two mostly likely partners of the S1 RGC is the wide field amacrine cell and the type 7 ON cone bipolar cell. Have the authors examined the interaction of these interneurons with the S1 RGC in the Sidekick-1 KO?

The one major issue I have is with Figure 1 H-K. The authors are strongly recommended to read a recent review (Keely, Elgen and Reese,JCN, 2020) arguing that density recover profiles that do not take into account soma size are not revealing mosaic organization and therefore this really cannot be used to &quot;verify&quot; they have a cell type. That said. I don't think the lack of the mosaic analysis will not significantly weaken their results -- the antibody staining + physiology is sufficient for indicating that they have different cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recommending this recent paper on the limitations of the density recovery profile (DRP) in assessment of cell type. We did not intend to use the DRP as our sole assessment of cell-type and agree with the reviewer that the combination of approaches we used (histology, anatomy, physiology) are sufficient to show different RGC types. We have now softened our language regarding the use of this measurement and have referenced this review. We have also clarified our figures to indicate that the grey lines show the density of all GFP labelled RGCs in the Sdk1-CreGFP line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. (Lines 108-114/Figure 1 T-U )- the authors want to argue that Ost+/Nefh- are M2-ipRGCs and so they look at projections to the MTN via anterograde labeling. However, it is unclear how they correlate anterograde projections with the Ost+/Nefh- RGCs in retina. This needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that Reviewer 1 has thought carefully about our labelling studies. In short, we cannot directly assign staining from the MTN to specific Sdk1 RGCs in the retina using anterograde labelling. Our goal here was to illustrate why retrograde labelling from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and superior colliculus (SC) preferentially labelled the Onα− and S1-RGCs. The presence of Sdk1-RGC axon labeling in MTN and OPN are consistent with the idea that Sdk1 labels non-image forming types that might project more strongly to these areas than they do to LGN/SC. We have clarified this portion of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Labels in Figure 1are very hard to read. Also, I strongly recommend that the authors refer to the different RGC subtypes in subsequent figures as their better known subtypes (M2, α, ON-DSGC) rather than the immunipositive proteins. It was quite confusing. – I had to print out Figure 1V and use it several times to figure out what was going on in several figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviewer for the difficult figure labels and use of immunopositive proteins to refer to Sdk1 RGCs rather than their subtype nomenclature. We have increased the size of the figure labels and have replaced immunopostive protein labels with RGC type wherever possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For Figure 2 – it was not clear when the authors were using GCaMP in all RGCs (expressed under vglut-Cre – line 163) or specific for Sdk1-Cre (line 138).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our lack of clarity in this figure. We wanted to give readers a way to compare the ON-OFF index for each Sdk1-RGC group to the full RGC population. The grey lines in the On-Off index graphs shown in Figures 2B-E were obtained by calcium imaging GCaMP6f-expressing RGCs in retinae taken from the Vglut2-Cre/Rosa-LSL-GCaMP6f line. All other RGC data in this figure comes from Sdk1-RGCs infected with AAVs bearing Cre-dependent GCaMP6f. We have further clarified this in the text and the legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2 – is bar velocity 1000mm/sec (which I believe is the speed of an action potential!) or 1000 µm/sec?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the careless mistake. The reviewer is correct the bars moved at 1000µm/sec.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2 – would be great if there were some quantification go figures H and I – are all Pcdh-Cre stained for Nr2f2? What percentage for Calb+?</p></disp-quote><p>We obtained a few retinae as a gift from Dr. K. Yonehara and stained them with Nr2f2 and Calb. The Pcdh9-Cre retinae we analyzed show ~1035cells/mm2 in the GCL and we now include the proportions of Nr2f2+/Calb+/Pcdh9-Cre+ cells in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3 – there seems like a substantial loss of DS in the ON-DSGCs that the authors should note. Again, this broadens the impact of the study because clearly Sdk1 is important for this circuit, but the impact is more subtle. It is not that they need to study it here but it is important to emphasis the multiple impacts it has. Hence line is 220-221 are not quite accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. In an effort to be cautious about our interpretation we may have inadvertently downplayed phenotypes on Sdk1+ ON-DSGC types. We have altered lines 220-221 to incorporate this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The following concerns should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>(1) How close is the Sdk1 HET retina to a wildtype retina with two copies of Sdk1? Could the authors compare RGC responses they obtain in the Sdk1 HET to responses in a wildtype retina to enable the reader to grasp the magnitude of deficits upon Sdk1 deficiency? As the authors have done an incredible job of findings cell specific markers for each of the RGC types that express Sdk1, they could use these markers to correlate responses in HET vs wildtype retina. At the minimum, responses from easily identifiable RGC types like the ONalpha or the ON DS which the authors have a specific transgenic line for, could be recorded in retinas with two copies of Sdk1 to evaluate how similar these are compared to the responses (using the same stimuli and lighting conditions) obtained from HET retinas with a single Sdk1 copy. This data would be helpful to validate the use of the Sdk1 HET as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks whether Sdk1-RGCs in heterozygotes show an intermediate phenotype relative to the same RGCs bearing two functional copies of Sdk1. We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern and provide recordings and dendritic reconstructions from ONα-RGCs genetically targeted using the KCNG4-Cre mouse line. These data are shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 and show that the morphology and physiology of Onα-RGCs bearing two copies or one copy of Sdk1 are similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given that previous accounts of edge sensitive RGC types like the HD RGCs show that these cells are most responsive to specific speeds (Jacoby and Schwartz 2017), it would be worth determining if the S1-RGC type detailed in this work are also tuned to a specific speed of stimuli. This aspect of temporal tuning would aid the characterization of the response profile of the S1-RGC type. The authors would most likely already have this data as they have made a similar temporal tuning determination for the ON DS RGCs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have now provided a comparison of speed tuning for the S1-RGC and ONα-RGC obtained from our calcium imaging experiments. These results show that S1-RGC responses are stronger for bars moving at 200µm/sec versus bars moving at 1000µm/sec.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Along the same lines, edge sensing RGCs can have ON and OFF responses that are not symmetrical (Jacoby and Schwartz 2017; Roska and Werblin 2001). As such it would add to the characterization of the S1-RGC response profile, if the authors could determine if the ON and OFF responses of the S1-RGC are symmetric/equivalent or not. From the examples shown in Figure 4 it appears as though the ON responses are more prominent than the OFF both for the expanding spot and orientation experiments i.e., more spikes allocated during light increments. Other edge sensing RGCs can have one component (ON or OFF) more dominant and thus it would be important for the reader to know whether the S1-RGC shows a similar asymmetry or not. Again, the authors already have this data so it should be straight forward to analyze and perhaps include plots where the ON and OFF responses (# of spikes) of the S1-RGCs are compared in the same plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that Reviewer 2 has thought deeply about the response properties of S1-RGCs in relation to other edge-sensing RGC types. We now provide example raster plots of S1-RGC firing to a centered spot and full field flash, as well as graphs comparing their ON and OFF firing rate versus spot diameter. These data are now presented as Figure 4 —figure supplement 1 and show that S1-RGCs are ON-dominated if stimuli are larger than their receptive field center.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors indicate that Sdk2 might be compensating for Sdk1 in the RGC types unaffected by Sdk1 deficiency. However, they do not provide evidence for whether or not Sdk2 is upregulated in the unaffected RGCs upon Sdk1 deficiency. The authors have generated antibodies to Sdk2 in their previous work which could be used to determine whether or not Sdk2 expression is upregulated amongst select RGC types upon Sdk1 deficiency (this could be compared in HET vs knockout).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great idea, but difficult for a couple of reasons. First, the Sdk2 antibody stain appears as small puncta with no detectable signal in somata. Second, Sdk1/2 double positive and Sdk2-exclusive RGCs, such as W3B-RGCs, all ramify in the same region of the IPL. It would be hard to assign these puncta to Sdk1/Sdk2 double-positive RGCs and compare their intensity/number between controls and Sdk1 nulls. Instead, we have performed whole-retina real-time qPCR for Sdk2 from Sdk1-Hets and Sdk1-KOs. These results are shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C and no significant elevation of Sdk2 in the absence of Sdk1. We have incorporated this result into our results and discussion on Sdks and IgSFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors bring up the homophilic vs heterophilic interactions between IgSFs like Sdks in the Introduction section when discussing the role of IgSFs like Sdks for synapse formation but do not include a discussion of whether Sdk1 could be operating via homophilic or heterophilic interactions to set up synaptic connections in the inner retina. Given the Sdk1 expression profiles it appears that Sdk1 could operate via heterophilic interactions, which is different from how Sdk2 wires the VG3 amacrine cell-W3B RGC circuit and it would be of benefit to the reader to include a discussion of the mechanistic basis of Sdk1 interactions in the inner retina and speculation of which Sdk1 presynaptic partners (amacrine or bipolar) are likely to be engaged or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded our discussion of the differences between Sdk1 and Sdk2 which includes some discussion about potential synaptic partners.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors need to include more details as to how the mean cell density analysis was done from the density recovery profiles as the current version of the manuscript lacks sufficient detail for this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of detail. We have now provided a more thorough discussion of how mean cell density analysis was performed in the methods and clarified their presentation in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors show that high levels of Sdk2 in On-α, M2, and ON-DSGCs compensate for the loss of Sdk1 and attenuates phenotypes. To elucidate whether intact phenotypes are truly due to compensatory increase in Sdk2 expression or the functional properties of these 3 RGC types are independent of Sdk1, it would be helpful to understand the relative expression levels of Sdk1 and Sdk2 in Sdk1-expressing RGCs. Without such data, it is difficult to distinguish between lack of a role for Sdk-1 vs a compensatory effect of Sdk2 expression in the other cell types (α, ON DS).</p><p>The authors call these ganglion cells local edge detectors without clear evidence in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered the title of this segment to reflect the data shown up until Figure 2.

(Note from Reviewing editor: experiments proposed by Reviewer 2 would address this).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks whether Sdk1 heterozygotes show an intermediate phenotype relative to animals bearing two functional copies of Sdk1. We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern and provide recordings and dendritic reconstructions from ONα RGCs genetically targeted using the KCNG4-Cre mouse line.

This is important to establish that the AAV-based retrograde labeling in Figure 4 is working as the authors think it is.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that LGN/SC sections showing Sdk1-RGC terminals would reinforce our method to retrogradely label Sdk1 RGCs.

This sentence was an undetected fragment from an earlier draft of this manuscript. Please see our response to point#5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3. Sholl analysis is not showing a striking difference between the control and Sdk-1 KO. The ON α ganglion cells also have differences at 3 locations with significance. The authors' claim of the relative stability of ON α is not compelling and should soften these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a good point. In our effort to be cautious about interpreting the effects of Sdk1 loss we may have inadvertently downplayed potential effects on the Onα-RGC. We have now softened our claims about the absence of phenotypes from the ONα-RGC and included new discussion of potential functional phenotypes on the ON-DSGCs in the Sdk1-KO as recommended by reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors speculate that the orthogonal tunings of excitatory and inhibitory inputs contribute to orientation-selective properties of S1-RGCs. While excitatory inputs retain orientation-tuning properties, inhibitory inputs completely lose the orientation selectivity. To elucidate how the loss of Sdk1 affects inhibitory inputs from amacrine cells, it would be helpful to investigate the morphology of 3 kinds of Sdk1-ACs that the author discovered in KO mice. How does the loss of inhibitory orientation-selectivity affect spike output? As shown in the supplementary material, the most striking effect of the Sdk1 KO is the obliteration of inhibition to orientation selectivity. Can the authors better elucidate the contributions of each of these inputs to orientation selectivity? Clarification of these issues is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer wants to know how loss of inhibitory input from Sdk1-ACs causes the visual response deficits seen in S1-RGCs. This is a great idea, but a direct test is methodologically not possible since we cannot perturb the Sdk1-ACs independently of the Sdk1-RGCs and assess the consequences on S1-RGC function. We are in the process of generating intersectional reagents to specifically label the S1-RGC and Sdk1 interneurons to better characterize their visual responses and potential synaptic interactions. These experiments are still in early stages and are months away from completion. We now bring up this important idea in our revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors demonstrate that the two mostly likely partners of the S1 RGC is the wide field amacrine cell and the type 7 ON cone bipolar cell. Have the authors examined the interaction of these interneurons with the S1 RGC in the Sidekick-1 KO? Additional data would make this compelling but if that does not exist, the authors should soften these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We too are excited by the prospect that the likely partners of S1-RGCs would be the sublamina-3 targeting wide-field amacrine and type 7 bipolar cells. In short, we have not examined their interaction because we currently cannot access these neurons without also affecting the Sdk1-RGCs. An intersectional approach might be feasible but will require months of development and troubleshooting to deploy. We have softened these claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the major change in the Sidekick-1 KO is a change in the dendritic field sizes of S1 RGCs, then the question remains whether the mosaic of these cells is disrupted in the KO through lack of homophilic homotypic interactions.
