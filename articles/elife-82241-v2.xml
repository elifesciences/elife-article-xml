lifetimes. However, there is little evidence that sister replisomes are functionally interdependent, and the consequence of factory replication is unknown. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between sister replisomes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which naturally exhibits both factory and solitary configurations in the same replication cycle. Using an inducible transcription factor roadblocking system, we found that blocking one replisome caused a significant decrease in overall progression and velocity of the sister replisome. Remarkably, progression was impaired only if the block occurred while sister replisomes were still in a factory configuration – blocking one fork had no significant effect on the other replisome when sister replisomes were physically separate. Disruption of factory replication also led to increased fork stalling and requirement of fork restart mechanisms. These results suggest that physical association between sister replisomes is important for establishing an efficient and uninterrupted replication program. We discuss the implications of our findings on mechanisms of replication factory structure and function, and cellular strategies of replicating problematic DNA such as highly transcribed segments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>replication factory</kwd><kwd>replication fork progression</kwd><kwd>replisome dynamics</kwd><kwd>replication fork stalling</kwd><kwd>replisome localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM102679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bates</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM135368</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bates</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenberg</surname><given-names>Susan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physical association between sister replisomes early in the <italic>E. coli</italic> replication phase promotes rapid fork progression and inhibits fork stalling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA replication fork stalling is now recognized as a major cause of the genomic instability that underlies many human genetic diseases, from cancer to antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Investigations into the mechanisms of fork stalling have revealed a wide range of causative factors, including deficiencies in nucleotide pools or replication proteins, and physical impediments such as unrepaired DNA lesions, bulky secondary structures, tightly bound proteins, and transcription complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Preventative factors include proteins that promote stability of the large multi-subunit replication complex (replisome) and its association to the DNA template, as well as DNA topoisomerases and helicases that remove obstructive secondary structure and DNA-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brüning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burgers and Kunkel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xu and Dixon, 2018</xref>). Far less understood are the effects of organization and localization of replisomes within the cell or nucleus, particularly the grouping of multiple replisomes into a replication factory. Remarkably, replication factories have been observed in all three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2020</xref>), yet the functional advantage(s) of this relationship are unknown.</p><p>Because the paths of bidirectional ‘sister’ replisomes, which typically extend for tens to thousands of kilobases, are inherently divergent, it was originally assumed that the two complexes were physically and functionally independent machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cairns, 1963</xref>). This view changed with the advent of fluorescent protein fusions allowing the observation of replisome components in living cells. First in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemon and Grossman, 1998</xref>), and then other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brendler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen et al., 2001</xref>), it was shown that slow growing cells often displayed a single replication focus, suggesting that sister replisomes are often localized within a single complex. Eukaryotic replisomes also display factory behavior, often extending beyond two sister replisomes to include multiple replisomes initiated from different origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>). These large fluorescent bodies can be resolved by confocal microscopy into individual diffraction-limited (~200 nm) foci containing two replisomes each, suggesting that sister replisomes might form a stable and possibly compulsory complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saner et al., 2013</xref>). However, due to difficulties in tracking individual replisomes in a nucleus with up to hundreds of replication forks, it is unknown whether sister replisomes remain associated throughout their replication periods.</p><p>Cytological observations of slow growing bacteria in which the chromosome is replicated by a single pair of bidirectional forks show that the two replisomes are at times colocalized and at other times well separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onogi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</xref>), with possible stochastic separation and remerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkmen and Grossman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mangiameli et al., 2017b</xref>). Analysis of replisome lifecycles by synchronization or time-lapse microscopy suggests that sister replisomes are initially colocalized but then separate into two distinct foci part way through the replication period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Japaridze et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onogi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that, at least under slow growth conditions, replisomes undergo a programmed splitting event one-quarter to one-half of the way through the replication period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The mechanism and regulation of sister replisome splitting are unknown, but splitting is contemporaneous with segregation of the origin region of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</xref>), which is held together by topological linkages known as precatenanes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). It is possible that the sister origin complex, which is likely membrane associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slater et al., 1995</xref>), anchors the approximately 1 MDa replisome complexes as originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dingman, 1974</xref>.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Replisome splitting.</title><p>Under slow growth conditions, <italic>E. coli</italic> bidirectional sister replisomes (yellow spheres) are initially colocalized, then separate part way through the replication period, marking a transition from factory to tracking configurations.

In such cells it is virtually impossible to determine which round of replication each fluorescent focus corresponds to, and thus the timing of sister replisome pairing and splitting has not been accurately determined. Bulk measurements of replication foci in rapidly growing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells indicate that the total number of replication foci is about half the number of replication forks estimated from flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fossum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molina and Skarstad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sánchez-Romero et al., 2011</xref>). While this ratio implies that sister replisomes are colocalized in a factory for the entire replication period, it can also be explained by a combination of part-time colocalization of sister replisomes and part-time colocalization of ‘cousin’ replisomes initiated from different origins in the previous cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molina and Skarstad, 2004</xref>). Additional research is required to differentiate these models.</p><p>Despite broad evidence that sister replisomes localize near each other for long periods in many systems, very little is known about any benefit this association might provide, or even if sister replisomes are in any way functionally interdependent. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, it is clear that each replisome can function as an independent unit, as blocking one replication fork with either an ectopic terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breier et al., 2005</xref>) or array of transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Possoz et al., 2006</xref>), does not prevent the unblocked replisome from finishing. Similarly, in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, a double strand break on one side of an origin does not prevent replication by the opposite-side replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doksani et al., 2009</xref>). However, even though sister replisomes have the ability to function independently, there is mounting evidence that they can affect each other’s progression. For example, fork stalling at a site of strong transcription oriented toward the oncoming fork in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was shown to cause a significant impairment in progression of the sister replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2018</xref>). Also, in both yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Natsume and Tanaka, 2010</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conti et al., 2007</xref>) cells, sister replisomes exhibit highly coordinate velocities while replisomes initiated from different origins do not. Coordinate sister replisome progression is apparently also dependent on colocalization of the forks, as immobilizing both ends of the templated DNA (forcing sister replisomes to separate) leads to a disconnect between sister replisome velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the physical and functional relationship between sister replisomes in <italic>E. coli</italic> to better understand the role of replication factories. Taking advantage of the fact that <italic>E. coli</italic> replisomes naturally transition between factory and separated conformations in the same replication cycle, we tested the effects of blocking one replication fork before or after the natural splitting transition. This was accomplished by placing inducible transcription factor roadblocks at varying locations on the chromosome. Replication fork progression was analyzed by deep sequencing and timed replication runout assays, and fork stalling was assessed by the ability to complete replication in fork restart-deficient strains and by binding to a four-way DNA junction binding protein. Tests were performed under both slow and rapid growth conditions, and replisome spatial dynamics were quantified by three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging. Our results indicate that physical association between sister replisomes early in the replication period is important for establishing a rapid and uninterrupted replication program. We discuss the implications of our results on models of replication factory structure and function, and cellular strategies of replicating condensed and transcriptionally active DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying fluorescent replication proteins suggests that sister replisomes are colocalized for about half of the replication period</title><p>We sought to determine the duration of sister replisome pairing under slow and fast growth conditions in the common lab strain MG1655 using 3D fluorescence imaging.

Cells contained between 1 and 10 foci, with ~70% of cells having either 2, 6, or 8 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), and 4 or 8 chromosomes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Under these conditions, the cell cycle is comprised of three overlapping rounds of replication; the ‘grandmother’ round initiated two generations previously, the ‘mother’ round initiated in the previous generation, and the current round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The resulting cell cycle timeline predicts that cells contained either 4, 6, or 12 replication forks. Although the expected average number of forks per cell (9.9) is roughly twice the number of DnaN-YPet foci per cell (5.7), supporting the Factory model, the predicted distribution of foci from the Factory model poorly matched the observed focus distribution (<italic>D</italic> = 0.26; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The Splitting model yielded a more similar focus distribution, with optimal replisome pairing of 13 min (<italic>D</italic> = 0.18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K, L</xref>). Additional inclusion of cousin replisome pairing into the model, resulting in a transitory higher-order four-replisome structure for part of sister replisome pairing, provided the best match (<italic>D</italic> = 0.03) with an optimal sister replisome pairing time of 21 min (Splitting with cousins model). Because these inferences of replisome structures are based on indirect data (foci number), we do not exclude the possibility that replisomes form complexes no larger than two owing to missed foci or imperfect cell cycle modeling. Thus, including both splitting and splitting with cousins models, we estimate that that sister replisomes are paired between 13 and 21 min under fast growth conditions and about 20 min under slow growth conditions. These intervals correspond to 32–51% of the replication period. Imaging replisomes using a monomeric DnaN-mCherry fusion protein yielded similar focus distributions as dimeric DnaN-Ypet fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that focus dynamics were not influenced by tag multimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Blocking one replisome early in the replication cycle inhibits progression of its sister replisome</title><p>A sister replisome splitting time of 20 min corresponds to a genetic position about 1 Mb from the origin. To evaluate whether early association of sister replisomes promotes fork progression, we inserted an array of <italic>tet</italic> operators at varying distances from <italic>oriC</italic>, which, when bound by inducible Tet repressor, create a potent replisome barrier or ‘roadblock’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). After allowing one to three rounds of replication to occur with one chromosome arm roadblocked, progression of the unblocked ‘orphaned’ replisomes was analyzed by sequencing, which provides high resolution DNA copy number. Assuming the rate of replication initiation is unchanged, replication fork velocity is inversely proportional to the slope along the unblocked arm, where a steeper profile indicates slower progression, and a flatter profile indicates faster progression.

Importantly, unblocked arm slopes remained constant after 1 hr of Tet repressor induction, indicating that once all preexisting forks completed, orphaned replisome progression was similarly affected through several rounds of replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Importantly, reduced fork progression in <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal blocked cells was observed regardless of whether the blocking array was placed on the left or right chromosome arm (−0.35 Mb strain), strongly suggesting that the replication defect was not due to reduced copy number of a specific gene or region. We also observed that some replication profiles appeared to show a progression defect before the other replisome had reached its roadblock (e.g., +0.58 Mb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Assuming this is not a visual artifact of smoothing (curves are 100 kb moving average) and natural undulations in replication profiles, advanced (upstream) reductions in orphaned fork progression may result from fork stoppage several tens of kilobases before the roadblock (manuscript in prep), which is cumulative through several rounds of blocked replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>oriC</italic>-proximal roadblocks reduce sister replisome velocity by rifampicin runout</title><p>Because sequencing is a bulk assay, it is possible that the effects observed after <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal roadblocking result from poor replication in only a subset of cells. To address this concern, we analyzed replication progression by flow cytometry, which measures DNA content in individual cells. Exponentially growing cells under fast growth conditions were roadblocked at two <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal positions (−0.35 and +0.34 Mb) and two <italic>oriC</italic>-distal positions (+0.63 and +1.10 Mb), then the rate of replication was measured by timed rifampicin runout. In this assay, replication initiation and cell division are blocked with rifampicin and cephalexin, respectively, and DNA content is monitored every 5 min by DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, top). Wild-type cells (no block) initially exhibit a dispersed genomic content (black profile, 0’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which gradually matures into a characteristic biphasic distribution at 80 min with peaks at 4 and 8 genome equivalents. As expected, roadblocked cells accumulate intermediate genome contents consistent with their roadblock position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, colored profiles). Quantifying flow cytometry histograms via KS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), we find that unblocked cells achieved 90% runout by 53 ± 4 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, top panel). This time includes the interval required for forks to travel from <italic>oriC</italic> to <italic>ter</italic> (~41 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) plus the time required for drug entry and action. Conversely, the two <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal blocked strains did not achieve 90% runout until 70 ± 3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panel), while both <italic>oriC</italic>-distal blocked strains behaved similarly to unblocked cells, achieving 90% runout by 56 ± 5 min (bottom panel). Relative to cells not receiving a roadblock, this equates to a 32 ± 3% reduction in replication speed when one arm was blocked near the origin, versus a negligible reduction (3 ± 3%) in replication speed when one arm was blocked ≥0.6 Mb from the origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, −0.35 and +0.34 Mb blocked strains exhibited different flow cytometry profiles despite having blocks ~equidistant from <italic>oriC</italic>. We believe this stems from slight differences in growth rate in the two strains after roadblocking (27 and 23 min, respectively), shifting the timing of DNA replication in the cell cycle. As −0.35 and +0.34 Mb blocked strains have very similar runout times, we conclude that the observed growth differences do not affect fork velocity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The effect of replisome pairing on replication fork velocity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Replication elongation measured as a change in cellular DNA content over time after inhibiting replication initiation with rifampicin (RIF) and cell division with cephalexin (CEP).

Although the majority of stalled forks are restarted quickly via PriA-mediated reloading of the replicative helicase, an estimated 5–20% experience breakage by shearing or collision from a second fork, forming a so-called broken or collapsed fork, which requires recombination-mediated strand invasion steps to reestablish a fork structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Courcelle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michel et al., 2018</xref>). Because <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal blocked cells had replication runout histograms with peaks that could not be fully resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we reasoned that some forks probably experienced increased collapse in addition to reduced velocity. This was tested by examining whether roadblocked cells could complete ongoing rounds of replication in the absence of the RecBCD recombination-dependent restart complex. As in the previous rifampicin runout experiments, replisomes were roadblocked before or after the natural replisome splitting transition and cells were treated with rifampicin and cephalexin. Cells were incubated for an additional 2 hr to allow ongoing viable forks to complete replication and then copy number profiles of the unblocked arm were determined by deep sequencing. In the absence of a roadblock, wild-type cells produced a flat profile, indicating complete runout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, No block, <italic>recB<sup>+</sup></italic>). As expected, inactivating the RecBCD complex via a ∆<italic>recB</italic> mutation resulted in a profile with a slight downward slope, indicating that some cells experienced a spontaneous fork stalling event requiring RecB to restart at random locations on the chromosome (No block, <italic>recB<sup>−</sup></italic>).

HJs are four-way DNA junctions formed at stalled forks by either regression of the fork and subsequent annealing of the newly replicated strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson and McGlynn, 2009</xref>), or by homologous recombination during fork remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michel et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, HJs are hallmarks of stalled forks, which are effectively detected by RDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xia et al., 2016</xref>). RDG binding across the genome was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) after roadblocking at two <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal sites and one <italic>oriC</italic>-distal site. RDG-binding profiles in roadblocked cells show large peaks at the <italic>tetO</italic> array site and at the replication terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These concentrations of RDG correspond to the expected locations of fork stalling in every roadblocked strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mei et al., 2021</xref>), and are not informative to the current study. Unreplicated regions downstream of the roadblocks showed low RDG binding, and we assume this region is essentially free of stalled forks. All three roadblocked strains showed elevated RDG binding along the left chromosome arm, but visibly more so in the two <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal blocked strains. To quantify stalling of the orphaned replisome, the increase in average RDG binding along the left arm (region LA) over average RDG binding on the unreplicated portion of the right arm (region RA) was determined in all four strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, top diagram). Thus, quantification excludes hyper RDG-bound regions at the roadblock and terminus. This analysis indicates that orphaned replisomes experienced 50 ± 9% more stalling that wild-type replisomes in <italic>oriC</italic>-distal blocked cells (+1.10 Mb) and 116 ± 6% more stalling than wild-type replisomes in <italic>oriC</italic>-proximal blocked cells (+0.13 and +0.34 Mb).

Blocking one replisome within ~0.6 Mb of <italic>oriC</italic> negatively influenced the sister replisome, resulting in poorer overall fork progression measured by deep sequencing and reduced fork velocity by timed rifampicin runout. Such prematurely split replisomes were six times less likely to complete replication without the restart protein RecB and produced twice as many HJs as control cells, indicating increased fork stalling. Fork barriers placed farther than 0.6 Mb from the origin had minimal effect on progression of the unblocked replisome, suggesting that sister replisomes transition to a fully independent state part way through replication. Fluorescence imaging showed that this functional transition point roughly coincides with a physical transition of the replication machinery from colocalized (factory) replisomes to fully separate complexes. We conclude that replication fork progression through approximately the first third of the chromosome is facilitated by a physical association of leftward and rightward sister replisomes. Our data are consistent with a growing body of evidence that sister replisomes initiated from the same origin have inter-dependent fates. In both yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Natsume and Tanaka, 2010</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conti et al., 2007</xref>), sister replisomes, but not replisomes initiated from different origins, exhibit similar velocities and blocking one fork with strong head-on transcription inhibits progression of its sister fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, our data are not at odds with a those of a previous <italic>E. coli</italic> study concluding that sister replisomes are independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breier et al., 2005</xref>). That study used an ectopic termination site to block one replisome; however, the block was placed ~1 Mb from oriC, thus in a region that we would expect to have little effect on the unblocked replisome.</p><p>What is the functional advantage provided by sister replisome association? Colocalizing replisomes may facilitate replication simply by increasing the local concentration of resources at the fork. Such resources include nucleotides, replication subunits, accessory helicases, topoisomerases, fork restart proteins, and mismatch repair proteins. Most of these components have been shown to localize or interact with the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentchikou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López de Saro and O’Donnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sánchez-Romero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stracy et al., 2019</xref>). It is reasonable to assume that conservation of the spatial distribution of replication resources to a defined volume around the replisomes would promote efficient fork progression, especially in a large cell or nucleus. Alternatively, factory replication may be important for coordinating the timing of left and right replication forks. For organisms with circular chromosomes and a single replication origin, precise convergence of forks at the terminus is critical for chromosome segregation and resolution of chromosome dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dimude et al., 2016</xref>). Even though many bacteria possess emergency replication fork traps to limit extensive overtravel, most forks converge within a very narrow termination zone near the <italic>dif</italic> site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hendrickson and Lawrence, 2007</xref>), implying that movement of sister replisomes is tightly coordinated. While it is unclear if coordinating termination of sister replisomes would confer any advantage in organisms with linear chromosomes since fork convergence occurs between forks initiated at different origins, coordinating sister replisome travel may provide a mechanism for equal transfer of epigenetic marks such as histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, factories may be important for fork progression through impediments including bound protein and transcription complexes. If sister replisomes are anchored to a cell structure such as a nuclear or cell membrane, or to each other via a stable link, the resulting complex might stabilize replisomes against mechanical stress imposed on the replicative helicase as it travels through dense chromatin. Supporting this idea, up to 70% of all transcription in <italic>E. coli</italic>, including the highly active ribosomal genes, occurs within the <italic>ori</italic>-proximal ~1/3 of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grainger et al., 2006</xref>), matching closely the region in which sister replisomes are colocalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>How are sister replisomes linked together? Early models of replication proposed that bidirectional replisomes exist in an obligate binary configuration in which the two helicases are oriented head-to-head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dingman, 1974</xref>). In this configuration, one replisome copies the top strand and one replisome copies the bottom strand, and thus the two replisomes are unable to separate without either (1) pulling Watson away from Crick, or (2) completely dissociating and reassociating both replisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates, 2008</xref>) including DnaB helicase, which is thought to remain stably associated throughout replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Monachino et al., 2020</xref>). Given that sister replisome splitting occurs naturally in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates and Kleckner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkmen and Grossman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Japaridze et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mangiameli et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Onogi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2008</xref>) and under forced conditions in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yardimci et al., 2010</xref>), such an obligate factory complex seems unlikely. Perhaps more plausible is a scenario in which sister replisomes are tethered by a dedicated protein. One such protein is the eukaryotic Ctf4 protein, which can dimerize CMG helicase between two replisomes forming a stable factory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). Ctf4 may also direct the lagging strands from both replisomes to a single shared Pol α primase, which would coordinate bidirectional synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Although no analogous tethering protein has been identified in bacteria, there are fork-associated proteins capable of crosslinking, which might link sister replisomes if bound in sufficient quantities. Candidate proteins include one of the highly abundant fork-associated proteins found in bacteria; SeqA in <italic>E. coli</italic>, YabA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, and GapA in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. These proteins can form polymers and some mutants exhibit reduced fork progression and aberrant replisome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Cartin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fossum et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soufo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to protein linker models, we propose that sister replisomes are instead connected indirectly via entanglements of newly replicated DNA exiting the forks. Topological stress at the fork, totaling 100 duplex twists per second at an elongation rate of 1000 bp per second, are reduced by topoisomerases and diluted by diffusion (as supercoils) into the surrounding DNA. However, excess stress routinely builds to the point that DNA around the fork becomes entwined and highly condensed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Postow et al., 2001</xref>). These entanglements might tether sister replisomes together, possibly aided by fork-tracking proteins like SeqA, which form stabilizing crosslinks on catenated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joshi et al., 2013</xref>). Supporting this model, the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome has a higher supercoil density around the replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Visser et al., 2022</xref>), coinciding with the region replicated by colocalized replisomes, and supercoiling is highly symmetrical along left and right chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Visser et al., 2022</xref>). It has also been reported that blockage of yeast replication forks at a site of strong head-on transcription (antiparallel with the direction of replication) impairs progression of the sister replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2018</xref>), while blockage with a double strand break does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doksani et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, it would seem that the fate of sister replisomes is linked specifically when they encounter topological stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Cumulative curves were generated for all DNA histograms (DAPI fluorescence) and the curves from each time point were compared to the final time point (90 min) by Kolmogorov–Smirnov analysis. No further change was observed after 90 min in any of the samples (data not shown). Dissimilarity index values were normalized from 0% (zero time point) to 100% (90-min time point) and plotted as percent runout (1 − dissimilarity index). Data were fitted to a logarithmic regression (average <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.92 ± 0.08), which is the expected runout kinetics of an exponential culture. Regression intercepts at 90% runout equal the time of replication fork elongation from <italic>oriC</italic> to about ±2.1 Mb, plus the time required for rifampicin to enter cells and block replication initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data generated in this study have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA), BioProject PRJNA860928.

into 'factories' and that this interaction facilitates replication and has a beneficial impact on the cell. The authors provide strong evidence for replication factories being required to both coordinate and promote the progression of the colocalized forks as well as help prevent them from spontaneously and prematurely dissociating.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please address the concerns and comments noted below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have already reviewed this manuscript for a different journal. The authors took most of my comments into consideration. The manuscript is much easier to read in this new version. I have a few concerns that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) YPet forms weak dimers, could this characteristic influence the foci number count? These experiments should be confirmed with an mCherry or mVenus fusion.</p><p>2) It is not evident to me that &quot;cousin replisomes&quot; are not a consequence of the resolution limit of imaging and do not have a biological significance.</p><p>3) I am puzzled by the fact that the replication fork barrier influences the replication of the other replichore even before the replisome reaches the barrier. For example in Figure 1D, the 0.58 Mb trace ( green) appears immediately (distance from oriC &lt;0.5 Mb) below the blue traces. In my opinion, in this portion of the genome, the associated replisomes should not be influenced by a future barrier.</p><p>4) Figure 4A: The strains with the barriers at -0.35 Mb and +0.34 Mb do not show the same DNA content and run-out outcome but show the same timing of replication completion (Figure 4B). Since the two barriers are symmetrical from oriC, I would have expected similar consequences of the genome content. Could the authors comment on this difference? Is it linked to experimental variability?</p><p>5) Figure 6. I think that Figure 6B is misleading. It gives a false impression that orphaned forks collapse frequently. I am not sure of that. On panel A, we see that most of the RDG signal (not considering the barrier and ter peaks) comes directly from the activity of the TetR barriers (blue graph). Rather than using the average ratio with the no block strain, I would prefer to see a distribution of the log2 IP/input ratio for all strains. This way the RDG binding value of the no block strain will be included in the graph and the statistical analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, this reviewer finds this to be a lovely manuscript filled with excellent science. However, a few comments/quibbles:</p><p>1. Relative fork rates in Figure 3BD and Figure 5A. These are listed as &quot;Log2 relative abundance&quot; but in looking at the legend and Materials and methods it is not completely obvious how these data are normalized. Do these graphs represent the rate of the blocked fork relative to a strain (or condition, see query 4 below) lacking blocked forks? If so, the corresponding rate of the strain lacking a fork barrier (the control) would then be a simple horizontal line (i.e., the data normalized to itself) which unfortunately is not included in the figure. (I believe that this is basically what the dashed line in Figure 5A represents). Please add an explanation of how the data are normalized and add and label the comparable unblocked fork rate (possibly dotted) as a control to better highlight your results.</p><p>2. Assuming that my comments in #1 are correct, doesn't the data then also show that the distal fork blocks also affect the rate of the unblocked fork (abet a much smaller effect than for the proximal blocks)? For example, the blue data line (which corresponds to fork progression in the strain containing the 1.1 MB fork block) is not horizontal, which as mentioned above would be the case if the block had no effect on fork progression. Distal effects are listed as &quot;minimal&quot; in the discussion, but what does this mean? Please mention and discuss.</p><p>3. The +0.35 and -0.13 fork blocks are denoted by a very similar color in various panels of Figure 3. For example in Figure 3B, I cannot tell by the line color on the graph whether the -0.35 and the +0.34 fork blocks are being compared or the -0.35 and the + 0.13 blocks (the fact color is completely relied upon without additionally mentioning which blocks are used in the legend further exasperates this problem). In my opinion, I'd label the leftward fork block (-.34) a unique color.</p><p>4. In various experiments, the experimental results are compared to the unblocked control (e.g., Figure 4A). However, it is not exactly obvious what the unblocked control represents, as the strain is not explained in the figure legend and the strain list is rather cryptically brief. I can imagine one of 3 basic possibilities: (1) That the control strain lacks both the tet repressor and operator constructs, that the strain lacks either the repressor or operator constructs, or (3) that the control strain contains both the operator and repressor, but no inducer is added to facilitate binding between the operator and repressor. If the control strain lacks both tet operator and repressor, was the inducer still added? These differences can affect the interpretation of the experiment, so please add or more explicitly emphasize this information.</p><p>5. The effect of fork blocks on fork rate is featured, but what happens to the replication &quot;factory&quot; under these conditions? Does the block stabilize the factory, make it fall apart, or have no effect?</p><p>6. Figure 4. FACS analysis. As nearly as this reviewer understands, the -0.35 and +0.34 fork blocks, which individually block different forks, have similar effects on the progression of the unblocked fork. Given their symmetric locations relative to OriC, I would suppose that after blocking the fork in each strain and measuring bulk DNA content, the 2 different strains would appear very similar. However, in the FACS experiment the DNA content of these 2 populations looks very different (Figure 4A OriC-proximal blocks). Shouldn't both strains give a similar FACS profile throughout the time course? Explanation?</p><p>7. The notion that replication factories increase replication fidelity is a major selling point in the paper. However, as noted in the Public review, the data only rather indirectly supports the specific possibility of replication fork collapse. The inclusion of an independent and perhaps more direct approach to the question would considerably strengthen your argument and bring this otherwise excellent paper up a notch.</p><p>8. Lack of mechanism. Given that <italic>eLife</italic> is a rather prestigious publication, an uncharitable reviewer might complain that this paper is unsuitable for this Journal as the manuscript is long on phenomena and rather short on mechanism. This reviewer is less concerned with this problem, as it seems clear that the study of replication factories is not yet sufficiently advanced for detailed mechanistic studies. However, in the Discussion, the authors suggest that factory formation may be the mechanistic consequence of topological intertwining between the diverging replications forks. Given that necessary assays are in hand and the 2 principal authors are very well-established bacterial geneticists, this hypothesis seems testable either by engineering an inducible double-strand break in an informative location to uncouple the divergent forks, or perhaps by overexpression of gyrase to in an effort to speed-up topological resolution. Does either treatment affect factory formation or timing? (Perhaps the data is already in hand and the follow-up manuscript is in progress?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82241.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have already reviewed this manuscript for a different journal. The authors took most of my comments into consideration. The manuscript is much easier to read in this new version. I have a few concerns that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>1) YPet forms weak dimers, could this characteristic influence the foci number count? These experiments should be confirmed with an mCherry or mVenus fusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that tag dimerization could affect the number of replisome foci, and we have repeated imaging using a DnaN-mCherry construct. We conclude that these experiments strongly confirm our previous findings with DnaN-YPet. This data is provided in the revised manuscript as Figure 2 —figure supplement 2, and is described in the results and Materials and methods sections. To summarize, DnaN-mCherry foci were only quantified under fast growth conditions due to weak fluorescence (even with the new filter), which was about 10% and 30% as bright as DnaN-YPet under slow and fast growth conditions, respectively. Under fast growth conditions, DnaN-mCherry foci numbered 4.9 per cell (5.7 for DnaN-YPet), with the majority of cells having 2, 6, or 8 foci (as observed with DnaN-YPet; Figure 2H). Comparison of DnaN-mCherry focus distribution with distributions modeled from the four resplisome pairing models indicate a close match to the Splitting with cousins model (<italic>D</italic> = 0.1), as with DnaN-YPet (<italic>D</italic> = 0.03), and a sister replisome pairing time of 24 minutes after replication initiation (21 minutes for DnaN-YPet).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not evident to me that &quot;cousin replisomes&quot; are not a consequence of the resolution limit of imaging and do not have a biological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we cannot differentiate whether objects separated by less than the resolution limit are in a single complex or simply near each other, the preponderance of 2, 6, and 8 focus cells suggests that these classes represent stable states (complexes or favored interactions) and not coincidental overlap of replisomes. As for why we support cousin replisomes, when modeling replisome dynamics (Figure 2J-L), inclusion of a higher order structure consisting of four replisomes (cousins) significantly improved model fitness. Second, there is prior data supporting higher-order replisome structures both in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Molina and Skarstad, 2004) and eukaryotes (Kitamura et al., 2006). However, we realize that our evidence for cousin complexes is indirect, and we may have oversold this interpretation in our original manuscript. We have revised relevant text arguing for cousin replisomes to include the possibility that cousin replisomes do not form a complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I am puzzled by the fact that the replication fork barrier influences the replication of the other replichore even before the replisome reaches the barrier. For example in Figure 1D, the 0.58 Mb trace ( green) appears immediately (distance from oriC &lt;0.5 Mb) below the blue traces. In my opinion, in this portion of the genome, the associated replisomes should not be influenced by a future barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that some replication profiles of the unblocked replichore show negative influence before the other replichore reaches the barrier. We do not know why this occurs but we speculate that it is caused by cumulative effects during the roadblocking period. Unpublished data from our lab shows that forks stall a considerable distance (20-60 kb) upstream of <italic>tetO</italic> array roadblocks. It is likely, although unknown, that this effect is cumulative with every round of replication causing a roadblocked profile to show decreased fork progression on the free replichore 150 – 200 kb upstream (towards <italic>oriC</italic>) of the actual <italic>tetO</italic> array. Thus, replication appears to be influenced ahead of the barrier. This effect is likely visually exacerbated by sequencing noise and normal deviations in replication profiles. For example, the profiles in Figure 3BC are smoothed by a 100-kb moving average, which would result in the point of replisome influence to move upstream by 50 kb. This feature of roadblocked replication profiles is now discussed in the Results section. We have also corrected a slight misalignment of the profiles in Figure 3D, such that all curves now have an <italic>oriC</italic> log2 value of exactly zero (this affects the point at which replication visually appears to slow).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4A: The strains with the barriers at -0.35 Mb and +0.34 Mb do not show the same DNA content and run-out outcome but show the same timing of replication completion (Figure 4B). Since the two barriers are symmetrical from oriC, I would have expected similar consequences of the genome content. Could the authors comment on this difference? Is it linked to experimental variability?</p></disp-quote><p>This was also pointed out by reviewer 2, and we believe it is related to growth differences in the two strains, as it is highly reproducible and it co-vaires with growth rate. The -0.35 Mb and +0.34 Mb strains have mass doubling times of 27 and 23 minutes, respectively, at the moment of rifampicin addition. This is expected to delay the timing of replication initiation in the -0.35 Mb strain relative to the +0.34 Mb strain, resulting in a significant decrease in DNA content and change in the ratio of low (pre-initiation) and high (post-initiation) DNA peaks after RIF runout. Importantly, the fact that rifampicin runout times are very similar in the two strains (Figure 4B), suggests that growth rate does not significantly affect fork velocity. We don’t know why the -0.35 Mb strain grows more slowly, but we speculate that it is related to reduced copy number of specific genes downstream of the roadblock. We have included a brief discussion of this in the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6. I think that Figure 6B is misleading.

We have, as the reviewer suggested, changed the analysis to now directly compare RDG binding of each strain, including the no block strain (Figure 6B). Figure 6B now features a graphical representation of RDG quantification, showing that we only analyze RDG binding along internal portions of the left and right chromosome arms, avoiding the large peaks at the roadblock and terminus. Additionally, as requested, we include a new graph showing the distribution of RDG binding for all strains (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). The text has been modified according to the above figure changes, and the nature of the large RDG peaks at the roadblock and terminus are now explained. We feel that the revised figure is improved, and we hope that the reviewer agrees that it is no longer misleading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, this reviewer finds this to be a lovely manuscript filled with excellent science.

To be clear, all sequencing profiles in our manuscript are raw sequencing reads with only “field-standard” normalization. These adjustments merely adjust for repetitive DNA and sequencing bias as explained in the Materials and methods. Importantly, sequencing profiles are never normalized to any other strain or condition. “Log2 relative abundance” refers to DNA abundance relative to <italic>oriC</italic>, which in effect vertically aligns all profiles to zero at <italic>oriC</italic>. Quantification of sequencing profile slopes (Figure 3C,E) on the other hand, is aided by reporting slopes relative to the least affected strain (+1.10 Mb block). We do not attempt to compare the slopes of roadblocked cells and unblocked cells, because they have different replication initiation rates (roadblocked cells are not in steady state), which strongly affects slope. Sequencing data handling and normalization is now explicitly described in the figure legends, results, and Materials and methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This is shown by flat sequencing profiles downstream of the roadblocks. To examine whether the free unblocked replisomes remain attached to a factory structure at the blocked replisomes, we dual imaged DnaN-mCherry replisomes and TetR-YFP roadblocks under fast growth conditions. This analysis showed that cells contained multiple replisome foci dispersed throughout the cell, only rarely colocalizing with the roadblock (new Figure 3 —figure supplement 4). The foci:fork ratio also increased significantly, suggesting that unblocked replisomes remained separate and did not remain attached to the factory. We are also currently investigating factory mechanisms as discussed below, including candidate structural crosslinking proteins and topological linkages, which should shed light on the exact fate of factories after roadblocking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Standard genetic mutation assays cannot be used because most cells die after roadblocking, even when Tet repressor is removed by flooding cells with anhydrotetracycline. We believe that cell death results from extensive DNA degradation at the roadblock, as we can prevent most degradation (and death) by deleting <italic>recB</italic> or expressing a DSE-binding protein Gam-GFP. Unfortunately, both treatments lead to significantly higher mutation rate, as measured with a Lac frameshift reversion reporter on the left chromosome arm, masking any factory-mediated effects. We also attempted to detect errors along the left arm by Duplex sequencing, which separately sequences both strands of DNA with barcodes, theoretically eliminating sequencing errors, which are many orders of magnitude more prevalent than bona fide mutational base changes. Unforntuantely, mutation rates from this method were highly variable, which would require us to sequence an impractical number of replicates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
