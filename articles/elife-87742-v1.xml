To identify regulators of 2C heterochromatin establishment in mice, we generated an inducible system to convert embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to 2C-like cells. This conversion is marked by a global reorganization and dispersion of H3K9me3-heterochromatin foci, which are then reversibly formed upon re-entry into pluripotency. By profiling the chromatin-bound proteome (chromatome) through genome capture of ESCs transitioning to 2C-like cells, we uncover chromatin regulators involved in de novo heterochromatin formation. We identified TOPBP1 and investigated its binding partner SMARCAD1. SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 associate with H3K9me3-heterochromatin in ESCs. Interestingly, the nuclear localization of SMARCAD1 is lost in 2C-like cells. SMARCAD1 or TOPBP1 depletion in mouse embryos leads to developmental arrest, reduction of H3K9me3, and remodeling of heterochromatin foci. Collectively, our findings contribute to comprehending the maintenance of chromocenters during early development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>embryonic stem

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Early mammalian development is a dynamic process that involves large-scale chromatin reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2014</xref>). Blastomeres acquire a defined cell identity through the activation of a subset of genes and specific epigenetic modifications. Among the latter, there is a tailored control over histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3), a hallmark of the transcriptionally repressed constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peters et al., 2001</xref>). During the first cleavage stages, constitutive heterochromatin reorganizes in the nucleus to form highly compacted chromocenters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Probst and Almouzni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones, 1970</xref>). Systematic identification of the underlying factors involved in de novo heterochromatin establishment and maintenance - thus chromocenter compaction - is still lacking, mostly because of the minuscule amount of material available during embryogenesis.</p><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can fluctuate back to a 2-cell embryo-like (2C-like) state under defined culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Although ESCs can spontaneously revert their fate to resemble early embryogenesis, this process happens at a very low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, early mouse embryo development has been modeled with high efficiency after downregulation of chromatin assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>) or modulation of key developmentally regulated genes in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Iaco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>). ESCs can efficiently be converted into 2C-like cells by the overexpression of a single murine transcription factor, Dux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, decondensation of HP1α foci and of chromocenters in 2C<sup>+</sup> were previously reported, suggesting that 2C<sup>+</sup> cells can be used to study the remodeling of heterochromatin foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2015</xref>). Here, using the Dux-dependent reprogramming system, we show that 2C-like cells can be used as a model system to investigate de novo chromocenter formation and dynamics. Using chromatin proteomics, we profiled the dynamic changes occurring in the chromatin-bound proteome (chromatome) during 2C-like cell reprogramming and identified factors potentially involved in chromocenter reorganization. H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin foci in 2C-like cells generated via Dux overexpression became larger and decreased in number during the reprogramming of ESCs to 2C-like cells. The chromocenters re-formed upon transition of 2C-like cells into ESC-like cells. We identified the DNA TOPoisomerase II Binding Protein 1 (TOPBP1) and the chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF-Related, Matrix-Associated Actin-Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin, Subfamily A, Containing DEAD/H Box 1 (SMARCAD1) to be associated with H3K9me3 in heterochromatin foci of ESCs. The association of SMARCAD1 was reduced upon entry of ESCs in the 2C-like state, although SMARCAD1 nuclear localization was recovered after 2C-like state exit. Depletion of SMARCAD1 and of TOPBP1 induced mouse embryo developmental arrest, which was accompanied by a remodeling of the heterochromatin foci. Our results suggest a contributing role of SMARCAD1 and of TOPBP1 activity in the maintenance of heterochromatin formation during early development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Entry in the 2C-like state is characterized by the remodeling of H3K9me3 heterochromatic regions</title><p>To explore the molecular driving events for the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin during mouse embryo development, we generated stable ESC lines carrying doxycycline-inducible cassettes that drive expression of either Dux (Dux-codon altered, CA) or luciferase (control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Dux overexpression resulted in the decompaction of DAPI-dense chromocenters and loss of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), in accordance with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>).

Additionally, we looked at cell cycle progression in the heterogeneous population of cells generated after Dux overexpression since it has been previously shown that spontaneous 2C-like cells have an altered cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eckersley-Maslin et al., 2016</xref>). 2C<sup>-</sup> cells displayed a cell cycle profile comparable to that of luciferase cells, whereas 2C<sup>+</sup> cells accumulated in the G2/M cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) with a much-reduced S phase consistent in several clonal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Overall, these data indicate that the 2C<sup>+</sup> line we generated recapitulates known features of 2C-like cells.</p><p>To study remodeling of the chromocenters, we asked about the reorganization of heterochromatic regions upon reprogramming of ESCs into 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. H3K9me3 is a well-known pericentric heterochromatin histone modification that prominently associates with constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakayama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rea et al., 2000</xref>). H3K9me3 can therefore be used as a marker for chromocenters. H3K9me3 foci in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells were morphologically distinct from those of 2C<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). They were 2.3-fold fewer (3.89±0.19 foci/nucleus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and occupied 2.4-fold larger area (4.76±0.33 µm<sup>2</sup>) in 2C<sup>+</sup> compared with both ESCs (8.88±0.30 foci/nucleus; 1.99±0.07 µm<sup>2</sup>) and 2C<sup>-</sup> cells (8.72±0.25 foci/nucleus; 1.93±0.08 µm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results suggest that H3K9me3 heterochromatin undergoes massive spatial reorganization during the reprogramming of ESCs into 2C-like state. Importantly, the levels of H3K9me3 remain unchanged among ESCs, 2C<sup>-</sup> and 2C<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that the remodeling of chromocenters was not due to loss of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The increased size of the H3K9me3 foci and the reduction in the number of H3K9me3 foci per nucleus might be due to the decompaction or fusion of several chromocenters.</p><p>We then imaged global DNA organization with Stochastic Optical Reconstruction super-resolution Microscopy (STORM). DNA was labeled using the nucleotide analogue 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxycytidine (EdC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Otterstrom et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zessin et al., 2012</xref>). DNA images were quantified by Voronoi tessellation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andronov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levet et al., 2015</xref>), which can precisely determine the DNA density based on the number of localizations in each Voronoi tessel (see Materials and methods). Voronoi analysis showed a marked decrease in the localization density of the chromatin in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, Voronoi analysis confirmed the decreased DNA density as a function of the GFP intensity in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, 2C<sup>-</sup> cells were heterogeneous with respect to DNA density, with the majority of them showing low DNA density compared with 2C<sup>+</sup> cells, suggesting that DNA might undergo decompaction prior to GFP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Overall, the DNA decompaction of the chromatin fibers in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells is consistent with the chromatin landscape of early/late 2-cell embryos, which has been reported to be in a relaxed chromatin state and more accessible, as shown by Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hendrickson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>H3K9me3 heterochromatin becomes rapidly formed following exit from the 2C-like state</title><p>We then asked whether 2C<sup>+</sup> cells could undergo the reverse transition, exiting the 2C-like state and subsequently re-entering pluripotency, thereby becoming ESC-like cells. We defined ESC-like cells as those that, after being purified as 2C<sup>+</sup> cells, no longer express the MERVL reporter during the exit phase. To answer this question about the kinetics of the reverse transition, we followed the expression of EGFP in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted 2C<sup>+</sup> cells 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr, and 1 week after sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Strikingly, over 60% of the 2C<sup>+</sup> cells in culture lost the expression of the MERVL reporter 24 hr after sorting. Moreover, 48 hr after sorting, only 6% of the cells still expressed the reporter, suggesting rapid repression of the 2C program and quick re-establishment of the pluripotency network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). 72 hr and 7 days after sorting, EGFP expression levels were comparable to those derived from the endogenous fluctuation (‘<italic>steady state’</italic>) of ESC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The decay in EGFP levels was accompanied by a downregulation of MERVL, endogenous <italic>Dux</italic>, <italic>Zscan4</italic>, <italic>Nelfa</italic>, <italic>Zfp352,</italic> and <italic>Eif1a-like</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results indicate that 2C-like cells could revert their fate back to pluripotency after Dux overexpression, and that such transition occurs rapidly, as early as 24 hr after sorting.</p><p>We then quantified the number and area of H3K9me3 foci during the 2C<sup>+</sup> to ESC-like transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>). Our results indicate that chromocenters underwent rapid re-formation and increased in number (24 hr: 9.67±0.50; 48 hr: 7.07±0.46; 72 hr: 8.82±0.44 foci/nucleus) compared with 2C<sup>+</sup> cells (3.89±0.19 foci/nucleus), concomitantly to the loss of EGFP expression and to the exit from the 2C-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). The areas of chromocenters in ESC-like cells were similar across the different time points analyzed (24 hr: 1.54±0.15; 48 hr: 1.77±0.14; 72 hr: 1.75±0.10 µm<sup>2</sup>) and smaller of those of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells (4.76±0.33 µm<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and K</xref>). These results suggest that the in vitro transition of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells toward the ESC-like state can be used as a model system to study chromocenter formation and chromatin reorganization occurring during early development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromatin-bound proteome profiling allows the identification of dynamic chromatome changes during 2C-like cell reprogramming</title><p>Having characterized the Dux-CA line, we aimed to identify potential chromatin-associated factors involved in the de novo establishment of heterochromatin.

However, we identified regulators of 2C-like cells such as TET1, the non-canonical Polycomb (PcG) Repressor Complex 1 (PRC1) member PCGF6, the TGF-β regulator SMAD7, and the heterochromatic H4K20me3 methyltransferase SUV420H2 depleted from the 2C<sup>+</sup> chromatome when compared to the 2C<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aloia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F, and G</xref>). The pluripotency transcription factors NANOG, OCT4, STAT3, SOX2, and ESRRB were, as expected, exclusively enriched in the 2C<sup>-</sup> and Luc chromatomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We also identified several transcriptional regulators and epigenetic enzymes differentially enriched in the 2C<sup>+</sup>, 2C<sup>-</sup>, and Luc chromatomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, we identified marked differences in the enrichment for H3K9 histone methyltransferases SUV39H1 and SUV39H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). SUV39H2 gradually increased its abundance on chromatin as Luc cells converted to 2C<sup>-</sup> and, ultimately, to 2C<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Contrarily, SUV39H1 was overall less abundantly chromatin-bound, although with a slight enrichment in the 2C<sup>-</sup> chromatome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that ESC reprogramming toward 2C-like state correlates with a major reorganization of the chromatin-bound proteome.</p><p>We used the Significance Analysis of INTeractome (SAINT) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2011</xref>) to further interrogate protein-chromatin interactions in the iPOTD datasets. To identify molecular drivers of chromocenter reorganization, we compared the enriched proteins in the 2C<sup>+</sup>, 2C<sup>-</sup>, and Luc chromatomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We identified a total of 397 proteins shared by the 2C<sup>-</sup> and Luc chromatomes that were not enriched in the 2C<sup>+</sup> chromatome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We focused on analyzing this cluster since chromocenters are present in 2C<sup>-</sup> and Luc cells. This protein cluster included gene ontology (GO) terms associated with RNA and chromatin binding, active remodeling activity (e.g. ATPase activity), repressive chromatin (e.g. heterochromatin condensed chromosome, negative regulation of gene expression), and pluripotent stem cell identity (e.g. response to LIF, stem cell maintenance, blastocyst growth) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). To identify putative factors responsible for chromocenter reorganization, we ranked the commonly identified proteins included in 2C<sup>-</sup> and Luc chromatomes according to their fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, this protein cluster included known transcriptional regulators such as the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3L, the bromodomain-containing protein BRD2, the core pluripotency factor OCT4, and the DNA topoisomerase 2-binding protein 1, TOPBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). We focused our attention on TOPBP1, which plays crucial roles in DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan and Michael, 2009</xref>). Moreover, topoisomerases control genome structure and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang, 2002</xref>). We asked if the lack of topoisomerase activity could promote 2C<sup>+</sup> cell induction. Thus, we treated ESCs with camptothecin (CPT) and ICRF-193, inhibitors of DNA topoisomerases I and II, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pommier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downes et al., 1994</xref>). These compounds can indirectly recruit TOPBP1 to manage DNA repair following the inhibition of topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II activities. Inhibition of topoisomerase II alone increased the number of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells 1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and triggered a prominent cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Robinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Simultaneous inhibition of topoisomerases I and II resulted in an enhanced effect, leading to a 2.4-fold increase in the fraction of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). These results motivated us to further investigate TOPBP1 network. TOPBP1 has been shown to interact with chromatin remodelers such as the SWI/SNF-like remodeler SMARCAD1 in yeast and human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bantele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). We then investigated TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1 as potential candidate factors controlling the remodeling of chromocenters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 associate with H3K9me3 in ESCs and can maintain heterochromatin foci</title><p>The results of the iPOTD revealed TOPBP1 as a potential regulator of chromocenter reorganization.

Interestingly, SMARCAD1, an SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeler, is known to promote heterochromatin maintenance during DNA replication in terminally differentiated cells and silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sachs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rowbotham et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, it is not known whether SMARCAD1 plays a role in 2C-like fate transition and early embryo development.</p><p>We, therefore, decided to investigate SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells undergoing the transition to ESC-like cells, where chromocenters are formed de novo. We found that SMARCAD1 co-localized with H3K9me3 in heterochromatin foci of chromocenters in both ESCs and 2C<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). In contrast, the expression of SMARCAD1 decreased in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells, where foci were much reduced in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We then asked whether SMARCAD1 depletion would increase the fraction of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. We depleted <italic>Smarcad1</italic> using two independent single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), as confirmed comparing to a control sgRNA targeting luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). SMARCAD1 depletion resulted in no major impact in the 2C<sup>+</sup> conversion either in the endogenous fluctuation or in Dux-induced cells when inspected at the steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We then investigated <italic>Smarcad1</italic>-depleted cells 24 hr, 48 hr, and 72 hr after the 2C<sup>+</sup> exit. Control KO cells (sgLuc) followed comparable exit kinetics compared with non-transfected (NT) 2C<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, SMARCAD1 depletion resulted into a tendency to increased percentage of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells at all time points after the exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Accordingly, the nuclear distribution of SMARCAD1 during exit from the 2C-like state changed. We first observed a diminution in SMARCAD1 signal as ESCs started to express the MERVL reporter, attaining severe reduction of SMARCAD1 in 2C<sup>+</sup> at the 24 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). SMARCAD1 nuclear signal was then gradually recovered in the heterochromatin foci as 2C<sup>+</sup> cells were converted in ESC-like cells up to the 72 hr from the exit, indicating reversibility of foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Surprisingly, the fraction of cells that repressed retroelements within 24 hr from the 2C<sup>+</sup> exit (ESC-like at 24 hr) already showed SMARCAD1 enriched foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that SMARCAD1 was severely reduced from chromatin as ESCs progress to the 2C-like state and, later, SMARCAD1 nuclear distribution was reverted during the 2C<sup>+</sup> exit.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>SMARCAD1 associates with H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and its nuclear localization is reduced in the 2C-like state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence images of H3K9me3 and SMARCAD1 in ESCs.

Here, we have reported that the transition from the 2C-like to the pluripotent state is a robust in vitro model system to study heterochromatin foci establishment and their reorganization in early embryo development. During the 2C-like to pluripotency transition, we found that heterochromatin foci are re-formed along with the DNA compaction of the chromatin fibers. Unlike previous reports that focused exclusively on transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez-Terrones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2020</xref>), our study exploited chromatin proteomics by genome capture to unravel an additional layer of information and complexity in the 2C-like system. Thus, we provided a detailed characterization of the stepwise chromatome dynamics occurring during the 2C-like state transition. Remarkably, we identified the chromatin remodeler factor SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1, a binding protein interacting with topoisomerase activity, to contribute to embryo development. Depletion of SMARCAD1 or TOPBP1 in preimplantation embryos led to severe developmental arrest and to a substantial remodeling of H3K9me3 heterochromatin foci. These findings have important implications because the establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin foci during embryo development is a key step in the embryonic totipotent program of the 2-cell stage toward pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zernicka-Goetz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>ERVs are transposable elements flanked by long terminal direct repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedli and Trono, 2015</xref>). Tight control of ERVs and their transposable activity is essential for genome integrity and plays an important role in early development and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedli and Trono, 2015</xref>). H3K9me3 has been associated with retrotransposons through the KRAB-associated protein 1, KAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>). KAP1 led to the silencing of ERVs in ESCs by inducing H3K9me3 heterochromatin formation via the recruitment of the H3K9 histone methyltransferase SETDB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolf and Goff, 2007</xref>). SMARCAD1 was discovered recently to directly interact with KAP1 and therefore be an important regulator of the KAP1-SETDB1 silencing complex in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sachs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2018</xref>). SMARCAD1 is also a key factor for ERV silencing in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sachs et al., 2019</xref>), where it remodels nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Navarro et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, although SMARCAD1 is highly expressed in ESCs, its depletion does not affect pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sachs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Navarro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>SMARCAD1 has been described in ESCs, yet its function in 2C-like cells has not been explored. Our observation that SMARCAD1 enriches in H3K9me3 heterochromatin foci during the transition from the 2C-like state to pluripotency and that it contributes to early mouse embryo development is aligned with the observations previously reported in ESCs. It will be interesting in the future to study whether SMARCAD1 can tether the KAP1-SETDB1 to directly induce the formation of H3K9me3 heterochromatin foci at the exit of the 2-cell stage in the embryos. Recently, the H3K9 histone methyltransferase SUV39H2 has been reported to catalyze de novo H3K9me3 in the paternal pronucleus after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burton et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, <italic>Suv39h2</italic> downregulation in zygote-stage embryos did not translate on appreciable changes in H3K9me3 levels on the maternal chromatin. This opens up the possibility that different methyltransferases, and their regulators like SMARCAD1, could be responsible for H3K9me3 acquisition in this early developmental stage.</p><p>Topoisomerases likely cooperate with the chromatin remodeling factor SMARCAD1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bantele et al., 2017</xref>). This is in line with our observations that SMARCAD1 is reduced in heterochromatin foci in both <italic>Topbp1</italic>-depleted cells and <italic>Topbp1</italic>-depleted embryos. However, it remains unclear whether SMARCAD1 functions independently or as a part of a large remodeling complex.</p><p>We showed that topoisomerase inhibition led to an increase in the fraction of 2C-like cells and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Moreover, the knockdown of TOPBP1 leads to a severe developmental arrest. Thus, it is also tempting to speculate that cell cycle progression, especially since we observed that 2C<sup>+</sup> cells might be arrested in the G2/M phase, has a role in regulating SMARCAD1 recruitment and/or function on chromatin during the 2C<sup>+</sup> exit. Additionally, it should be noted that DNA damage response (DDR) and p53 have been reported to activate Dux in vitro, and thus, DDR and associated factors may contribute to the increased percentage of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells observed upon topoisomerase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atashpaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grow et al., 2021</xref>). In the in vivo scenario, this prolonged G2/M phase might be necessary to rewire specific epigenetic modifications in the 2-cell blastomeres to allow heterochromatin formation or control DNA repair. TOPBP1, being a DNA topoisomerase 2-binding protein and involved in DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bagge et al., 2021</xref>), might have a role in this process. This is a key step before the blastomeres can embark into the correct developmental process, as proposed for early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seller et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>By using chromatin proteomics, we have provided additional data that will help to elucidate the molecular intricacies of the 2C-like state and early mammalian development. In the current study, we focused on heterochromatin establishment and we identified SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1, which both interact with H3K9me3. SMARCAD1 might act in the complex as the remodeler factor that, by regulating methyltransferases, can facilitate H3K9me3 deposition at the exit of the totipotent 2-cell stage when heterochromatin is established de novo. Although we could not collect robust data on the alteration of the 2C program, we have indication of its prolonged activity when either SMARCAD1 or TOPBP1 are knocked down, in line with a role in regulating early development in the maintenance of heterochromatin and the regulation of the 2C program.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>E14Tg2a mouse ESCs were cultured in gelatinized plates in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS (Sigma), GlutaMAX, sodium pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, 100 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1000 U/ml mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (Millipore), 1 µM PD0325901, and 3 µM CHIR99021.

Finally, the largest 0.5% of polygons were set to black. For each nucleus, we computed the mean Voronoi density (nm<sup>−2</sup>) as a measure of global DNA compaction.</p><p>For the GFP intensity score, we quantified the GFP conventional images (488 nm channel) with lower intensities in order to assign a GFP intensity score to each nucleus. We summed the fluorescence intensity ADU counts inside each nucleus and divided it by the total number of pixels to obtain the average GFP intensity. Then, we used the distribution of GFP intensities from the different nuclei to normalize the values, obtaining a GFP intensity score ranging from 0 (less bright) to 1 (most bright). We then performed a cell-by-cell analysis of the relation between GFP intensity score and global chromatin compaction obtained from Voronoi tessellation analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-5"><title>Immunofluorescence of preimplantation embryos</title><p>Preimplantation embryos at E1.5 and E2.5 stages were fixed with 2% PFA for 10 min at RT, permeabilized (0.25% Triton X-100) for 10 min, and then blocked (3% BSA) for 1 hr at 37°C.

For SMARCAD1 nuclear signal analysis, manual selection of nuclear area was performed and integrated intensity was measured. For SMARCAD1-H3K9me3 co-immunofluorescence images, a Gaussian blur filtering (σ=0.5) was applied to the SMARCAD1 channel.

Manders’ coefficient was used as a co-localization indicator because of its independence of the intensity of the overlapping pixels. For the quantification of H3K9me3 and SMARCAD1 fluorescence intensities in preimplantation embryos, manual selection of the nuclear area was performed for each blastomere. Fluorescent signals were measured and then normalized by the average cytoplasmic signal (background) in each condition. For the normalization step, the fluorescence intensity of a squared shape of equal size was taken for each individual blastomere.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted from pelleted or sorted ESCs using the RNA isolation RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the present work the authors explore the molecular driving events involved in the establishment of constitutive heterochromatin during embryo development. The experiments have been carried out in a very accurate manner and clearly fulfill the proposed hypotheses.</p><p>Regarding the methodology, the use of: (i) an efficient system for conversion of ESCs to 2C-like cells by Dux overexpression; (ii) a global approach through IPOTD that reveals the chromatome at each stage of development and (iii) the STORM technology that allows visualization of DNA decompaction at high resolution, helps to provide clear and comprehensive answers to the conclusion raised.</p><p>The contribution of the present work to the field is very important as it provides valuable information on chromatin-bound proteins at key stages of embryonic development that may help to understand other relevant processes beyond heterochromatin maintenance.</p><p>The study could be improved through a more mechanistic approach that focuses on how SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 cooperate and how they functionally connect with H3K9me3, HP1b and heterochromatin regulation during embryonic development. For example, addressing why topoisomerase activity is required or whether it connects (or not) to SWI/SNF function and the latter to heterochromatin establishment, are questions that would help to understand more deeply how SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 operate in embryonic development.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work and the methodology we employed. We greatly appreciated the reviewer’s recognition of our study to “provide valuable information on chromatin-bound proteins at key stages of embryonic development that may help to understand other relevant processes beyond heterochromatin maintenance”. While we acknowledge the value of including mechanistic studies, such an addition would require a substantial amount of experimental work that exceeds our current resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In my opinion, the authors could improve the study by deciphering -to a certain extent- the possible mechanism by which SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 are cooperating in their system to establish H3K9me3 and consequently heterochromatin; and whether it is different (or not) from that already reported in yeast (ref 27). In fact, is it only SMARCAD1 that participates in this process or the whole SWI/SNF complex? Could the lack of SMARCAD1 compromise the proper assembly of the SWI/SNF complex? In this regard, a model describing the main findings of the study and the discussion of the possible mechanisms involved -based on the current bibliography- would be appreciated. This, although speculative, would illustrate the range of possibilities that could be operating in the maintenance of heterochromatin during embryonic development. In conclusion, it would be great if the authors could link -mechanistically- the dots connecting SMARCD1, TOPBP1, H3K9me3/HP1/heterochromatin.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer and to enrich the discussion, we have included some additional sentences and references in the revised discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a minor point, In Figure 3A, left panel it appears that the protein precipitating with H3K9me3 reacts with TOPBP1 but its molecular weight does not exactly match to the TOPBP1 band found in the input. The authors should clarify this point and it is also recommended that IPs and inputs are run in the same gel. Please replace Figure 3A right panel.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion and to improve the reading flow, we have restructured the order of the figures and removed the original Figure 3A. The revised Figure 3A-C panel illustrates the SMARCAD1 association with H3K9me3 in ESCs and 2C- cells, while capturing the reduced SMARCAD1-H3K9me3 association in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Sebastian-Perez describes determinants of heterochromatin domain formation (chromocenters) at the 2-cell stage of mouse embryonic development. They implement an inducible system for transition from ESC to 2C-like cells (referred to as 2C<sup>+</sup>) together with proteomic approaches to identify temporal changes in associated proteins. The conversion of ESCs to 2C<sup>+</sup> is accompanied by dissolution of chromocenter domains marked by HP1b and H3K9me3, which reform upon transition back to the 2C-like state. The innovation in this study is the incorporation of proteomic analysis to identify chromatin-associated proteins, which revealed SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 as key regulators of chromocenter formation.</p><p>In the model system used, doxycycline induction of DUX leads to activation of EGFP reporter regulated by the MERVL-LTR in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells that can be sorted for further analysis. A doxycycline-inducible luciferase cell line is used as a control and does not activate the MERVL-LTR GFP reporter. The authors do see groups of proteins anticipated for each developmental stage that suggest the overall strategy is effective.</p><p>The major strengths of the paper involve the proteomic screen and initial validation. From there, however, the focus on TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1 is not well justified. In addition, how data is presented in the results section does not follow a logical flow. Overall, my suggestion is that these structural issues need to be resolved before engaging in comprehensive review of the submission. This may be best achieved by separating the proteomic/morphological analyses from the characterization of TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s positive evaluation of our inducible system to trigger the transition from ESCs to 2C-like cells, and the strength of the chromatin proteomics we conducted. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have reorganized the order of the figures, particularly Figure 1 and Figure 2, and revised the text to improve readability and flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>There are some very interesting components to the study but, as noted, the narrative requires changes and the rationale for focusing on TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1 is not strong at present. Specific comments are noted below</p><p>(1) Inclusion of authentic 2C cells for comparative chromocenter analysis (or at least a more fulsome discussion of how the system has been benchmarked in previous studies).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more detail in the revised methods section, in the “Cell lines and culture conditions” paragraph. We have added: “The Dux overexpression system was benchmarked according to previously reported features. Dux overexpression resulted in the loss of DAPI-dense chromocenters and the loss of the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4 (fig. S1E) (6, 7), upregulation of specific genes of the 2-cell transcriptional program such as endogenous Dux, MERVL, and major satellites (MajSat) (fig. S1F) (6, 7, 11, 26, 58), and accumulation in the G2/M cell cycle phase (fig. S1G), with a reduced S phase consistent in several clonal lines (fig. S1H) (15).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 1A, the text indicates a loss of chromocenters, but it may be better described as decompaction because the DAPI/H3K9me3 staining shows diffuse/expanded structures (this is in fact how it is described in relation to Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text accordingly, now describing it as “decompaction”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Table S1 has 6 separate tabs but these are not specified in the text. It would be useful to separate the 397 proteins unique to Luc and 2C- cells since they form much of the basis for the remaining analysis. This approach also assumes it is the absence of a protein in the 2C<sup>+</sup> that accounts for the lack of chromocenters (noting there are 510 proteins unique to the 2C<sup>+</sup> state that are not discussed).</p></disp-quote><p>We have referenced the supplementary table as Table S1 in the text for simplicity. It includes: Table S1A - List of Protein Groups identified by mass spectrometry in -EdU, Luc, 2C- and 2C<sup>+</sup> cells; Table S1B - Input data for SAINT analysis; Table S1C - SAINT results of the comparison 2C- vs Luc and 2C<sup>+</sup> vs Luc; Table S1D - SAINT results of the comparison Luc vs 2C- and 2C<sup>+</sup> vs 2C-; Table S1E - SAINT results of the comparison Luc vs 2C<sup>+</sup> and 2C- vs 2C<sup>+</sup>; and Table S1F - Total number of PSM per protein in the different cells and conditions tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Since there is no change in H3K9me3 levels, loss of SUV420H2 from 2C<sup>+</sup> chromatin (figure 1G) coupled with potential changes in H4K20me3 could contribute the morphological differences. SUV420H2 is known to regulate chromocenter clustering in a way the requires H4K20me3 but this is not addressed or cited (PUBMED: 23599346).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added additional sentences and references in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 1C, there does appear to be overlap between the 2C<sup>+</sup> and 2C- populations (while the Luc population is distinct) even though they are morphologically distinct when imaged in Figure 2A. The 2C- cells are thought to be an intermediate, low Dux expressing population.</p></disp-quote><p>Chromatome profiling through genome capture provides a snapshot of the chromatin-bound proteome in the analyzed samples (shown in revised Fig. 2B). As indicated by the reviewer and previously reported in the literature, 2C- cells are an intermediate population before reaching 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. For this study, we have focused on H3K9me3 morphological changes. Even though 2C- and 2C<sup>+</sup> cells are distinct with respect to H3K9me3 morphology (shown in revised Fig. 1B), analysis of the chromatome data from hundreds of chromatin-bound proteins revealed some overlap between these two populations. However, replicates from the same population tend to cluster together, for example, 2C<sup>+</sup> rep1 and 2C<sup>+</sup> rep3, and 2C- rep1 and 2C- rep2. Collectively, these data suggest that a defined subset of coordinated changes in the chromatome likely triggers the transition from 2C- to 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. Further experimental investigation of the chromatome dataset during the 2C-like transition would be interesting, however, we believe it is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Data with SUV39H1 and 2 is difficult to accommodate; what about other H3K9 methyltransferases or proteins such as TRIM28 (KAP1) and SETDB1 (this comes up in the discussion but is not assessed in the results section).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that investigating the role of TRIM28 (KAP1) and SETDB1 in this experimental setting could be of interest, however, we believe that these experiments go beyond the scope of the presented study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Rationale for choosing TOPBP1 needs to be improved. How do TOPBP1 levels relate to TOPI/TOP2A/TOP2B levels across the 3 cell populations? By what criteria does topoisomerase inhibitor treatment increase 2C<sup>+</sup> like cells? Moreover, to what extent will inhibiting topoisomerases lead to global heterochromatin and cell cycle changes regardless of cell type.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have included some additional references throughout the text to strengthen our rationale for selecting TOPBP1, given its well-established critical role in DNA replication and repair. Additionally, we have revised the results and discussion sections to include new sentences that propose a potential mechanism by which topoisomerase inhibitors may indirectly recruit TOPBP1 to facilitate DNA repair, ultimately leading to an increase in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Likewise, the decision to look at SMARCAD1 based solely on its interaction with TOPBP1 seems somewhat arbitrary and it did not seem to come up as of interest in the iPOTD analysis. Moreover, they were not able to validate the interaction with their own analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to clarify the connection further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The flow of results is confusing. The first section concludes with a focus on TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1, then progresses to morphological characterization of heterochromatin regions in the next two sections before returning to TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1. It seems like it would make more sense to describe the model system and morphological characterization at the beginning of the results section and then transition to the proteomic analysis and characterization of TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1 (with the expectation that the rationale be improved).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have reordered the figures, particularly Figure 1 and Figure 2, and rephased the text to improve the overall reading flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) There has been considerable work done on characterizing chromatin structure, epigenetic changes, and morphology during early embryonic development. It is therefore difficult to see what validating some of these changes in the inducible model is adding much in the way of new knowledge. It may, but this is not articulated in the current text.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed before, we have rephrased the text to improve the overall reading flow, which we hope has improved the understanding of the impact of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) It is difficult to disentangle broader effects of both TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1 from those described here; they may induce phenotypes, but these may not be unique to this model system.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, but to address this point would require additional experiments which would go beyond the scope of the presented study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) One of the issues with this assay is global chromatin recovery; it is not focused on heterochromatin compartments. The statement &quot;We identified a total of 2396 proteins, suggesting an efficient pull-down of chromatin-associated factors (fig. S2D and Table S1)&quot; does not demonstrate efficiency. Additional functional annotation would be required to establish this claim, including what fraction are known chromatin-associated proteins (with a focus on the heterochromatin compartment).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text accordingly. The resulting statement reads as: “We identified a total of 2396 proteins, suggesting an effective pull-down of putative chromatin-associated factors (fig.

The authors identified 397 chromatin-bound proteins enriched only in ESC and 2C- cells, among which they further investigated TOPBP1 due to its potential role in controlling chromocenter reorganization. SMARCD1, a known interacting protein of TOPBP1, was also investigated in parallel. The authors observed increased size and decreased number of H3K9me3-heterochromatin foci in Dux-induced 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. Interestingly, depletion of TOPBP1 or SMARCD1 also led to increased size and decreased number of H3K9me3 foci. However, depletion of these proteins did not affect entry into or exit from the 2C-like state. Nevertheless, the authors showed that both TOPBP1 and SMARCD1 are required for early embryonic development.</p><p>Although this manuscript provides new insights into the features of 2C-like cells regarding H3K9me3-heterochromatin reorganization, it remains largely descriptive at this stage. It does not provide new insights into the following important aspects: (1) how SMARCD1 associates with H3K9me3 and contributes to heterochromatin maintenance, (2) how TOPBP1 regulates the expression of SMARCD1 and facilitates its localization in heterochromatin foci, (3) whether the remodelling of chromocenter is causally related to the mutual transitions between ESCs and 2C-like cells. Furthermore, some results are over-interpreted. Additional experiments and analyses are needed to increase the strength of mechanistic insights and to support all claims in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their positive and thorough evaluation of our manuscript. We have revised the text and hope that the overall flow is now clearer. Moreover, while we acknowledge the value of including mechanistic studies, such an addition would require a substantial amount of experimental work that exceeds our current resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) Fig.2: the DNA decompaction of the chromatin fibers shown in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells may be more related to a relaxed 3D chromatin conformation (Zhu, NAR 2021; Olbrich, Nat Commun 2021) than chromatin accessibility. The authors should discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included some additional sentences and references in the revised manuscript to address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Chemical inhibition of topoisomerases resulted in an increase in the percentage of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. Does depletion of TOPBP1 also resulted in increased percentage of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells? Please include this result in Fig. 3E. Additionally, it should be noted that DDR and p53 have been reported to activate Dux (Stashpaz, eLife 2020; Grow, Nat Genet 2021), and thus, may contribute to the increased percentage of 2C<sup>+</sup> cells observed upon topoisomerase inhibition. This point should be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have included some additional sentences and references in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Fig 3A: the TOPBP1 band in the IP sample is questionable, and therefore the conclusion that TOPBP1 is associated with H3K9me3 is difficult to draw from Fig 3A. Additionally, the authors mentioned that association of TOPBP1 and SMARCAD1 is undetected in ESCs, likely due to the suboptimal efficiency of available antibodies. As these are key conclusions in this study, the authors are suggested to try other commercially available TOPBP1 antibodies (e.g., Abcam #ab-105109, used by ElInati, PNAS 2017) or knock-in tags to perform the co-IP experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion and to improve the reading flow, we have restructured the order of figures and removed the original Figure 3A. The revised Figure 3A-C panel illustrates the SMARCAD1 association with H3K9me3 in ESCs and 2C- cells, while capturing the reduced SMARCAD1-H3K9me3 association in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fig. 3C-D, Fig. S3D: the authors claimed reduction of both SMARCAD1 expression and its co-localization with H3K9me3 foci in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells, but did not perform mechanistic studies. It is important to know if TOPBP1 expression also decreases in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. Additionally, it is unclear if the reduced co-localization of SMARCAD1 with H3K9me3 foci results from its altered nuclear localization or simply from reduced expression level? In either case, please provide some mechanistic insights.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge the value of including mechanistic studies, such an addition would require a substantial amount of experimental work that exceeds our current resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Fig. 3K, Fig. S4D-E: does SMARCAD1 expression decrease upon TOPBP1 depletion? Statistical analysis of SMARCAD1 intensity in Fig. S4E is needed, and a Western blot analysis is strongly suggested. Additionally, it is unclear if the reduced co-localization of SMARCAD1 with H3K9me3 foci results from its altered nuclear localization or simply from reduced expression level? In Fig. 3K, TOPBP1-depleted cells appear to show decreased size and increased number of H3K9me3 foci, which is inconsistent with Fig. S4B-C. The authors should clarify this discrepancy. Furthermore, statistics should be performed to determine whether Smarcad1/Topbp1 knockdown could further increase the size and decrease the number of H3K9me3 foci in 2C<sup>+</sup> cells. This would provide additional evidence for the involvement of these proteins in heterochromatin maintenance.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe Smarcad1 downregulation after Topbp1 knockdown (shown in fig. S4A). In Figs. S4B and S4C, we observed that the number of H3K9me3 foci decreased, and their area became larger after knocking down either Smarcad1 or Topbp1, compared to scramble controls. These results align with the reviewer’s comment. Additionally, it should be noted that these findings were derived from the quantification of tens of cells and hundreds of foci, as indicated in the figure legend. This resulted in statistical significance after applying the test indicated in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Fig. 3J is suggested to be moved to Fig. 4. Additionally, performing immunostaining of SMARCAD1, TOPBP1, and H3K9me3 during pre-implantation development would provide valuable information on their protein-level dynamics, interactions, and functions in early embryos. This would further strengthen the conclusions drawn in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that performing these additional experiments would provide additional valuable information, however this would require a substantial amount of experimental work that exceeds our current resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Fig. 4 and Fig. S5: the authors observed reduced H3K9me3 signal in the Smarcad1 MO embryos at the 8-cell stage, but claim that they failed to examine Topbp1 MO embryos at the 8-cell stage due to their developmental arrest at the 4-cell stage. However, based on Fig. 4A, not all Topbp1 MO embryos were arrested at the 4-cell stage, and it is still possible to examine the H3K9me3 signal in 8-cell Topbp1 MO embryos, which is critical for demonstrating its function in early embryos. Also, how to interpret the increased HP1b signal in Topbp1 MO embryos?</p></disp-quote><p>For Topbp1 silencing, we observed an even more severe phenotype compared to Smarcad1 MO. All the Topbp1 MO-injected embryos (100 %) arrested at the 4-cell stage and did not develop further (shown in Fig. 4A and 4B). Therefore, the severity of the Topbp1 morpholino phenotype posed a technical challenge in evaluating the H3K9me3 signal in 8-cell Topbp1 MO embryos, as none of the injected embryos developed beyond the 4-cell stage.</p><p>We believe the increased HP1b signal in Topbp1 MO embryos could indicate potential alterations in chromatin organization and heterochromatin stability. Specifically, we observed remodeling of heterochromatin in both 2-cell and 4-cell Topbp1 MO arrested embryos compared to controls, as evidenced by the spreading and increased HP1b signal (shown in fig. S5F-S5I). Further investigations could enhance our understanding of the underlying defects in Topbp1 knockdown embryos, extending beyond heterochromatin-related errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Page 4, the third row from the bottom: please revise the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed the text and it now reads correctly in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig. 1C: The authors claimed &quot;Luc replicates clustered separately from 2C<sup>+</sup> and 2C- conditions&quot;, however, Luc rep3 is apparently clustered with 2C conditions.</p><p>(3) The GFP signal in Fig. S1E is confusing.</p><p>(4) Please include ESC in Fig. 2D-E.
