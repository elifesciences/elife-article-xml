Here, we investigated the neuro-computational mechanisms through which mood fluctuations may bias human choice behavior. Intracerebral EEG data were collected in a large group of subjects (n=30) while they were performing interleaved quiz and choice tasks that were designed to examine how a series of unrelated feedbacks affect decisions between safe and risky options. Neural baseline activity preceding choice onset was confronted first to mood level, estimated by a computational model integrating the feedbacks received in the quiz task, and then to the weighting of option attributes, in a computational model predicting risk attitude in the choice task. Results showed that (1) elevated broadband gamma activity (BGA) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal anterior insula (daIns) was respectively signaling periods of high and low mood, (2) increased vmPFC and daIns BGA respectively promoted and tempered risk taking by overweighting gain vs. loss prospects. Thus, incidental feedbacks induce brain states that correspond to different moods and bias the evaluation of risky options. More generally, these findings might explain why people experiencing positive (or negative) outcome in some part of their life tend to expect success (or failure) in any other.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>choice</kwd><kwd>mood</kwd><kwd>iEEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012952</institution-id><institution>Université Grenoble Alpes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE37-0018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bastin</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012952</institution-id><institution>Université Grenoble Alpes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE28-0016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bastin</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012952</institution-id><institution>Université Grenoble Alpes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-TECS-0013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kahane</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastin</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20-21339S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammer</surname><given-names>Jiri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Invasive electrophysiological recordings from the human brain reveal that different mood levels translate into different brain states that predispose subjects to make risky or safe decisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans often make inconsistent decisions, even when facing seemingly identical choices. This surprising variability is a major difficulty for rational decision theory and a reason for introducing stochastic functions in choice models. However, even if stochastic functions help mimicking behavior on average, they cannot help predicting individual choice. For this, one needs to identify factors whose fluctuations are systematically associated with changes in preference, in order to replace randomness with bias. Influent factors can be related to the internal state of the decision maker and/or the external context of the choice situation. In neuroscience, many studies have shown that brain activity preceding the presentation of choice options might provide a bias on the eventual choice, particularly when alternatives are safe vs. risky options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhnen and Knutson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Persem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In some cases, baseline brain activity could be related to mental constructs such as pleasantness, satiety, or mood, which were themselves under the influence of external events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abitbol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>). These findings therefore provide a putative mechanism explaining why mood is predictive of risky choice: positive/negative events that increase/decrease mood at the mental level also modulate baseline activity at the neural level, changing the way dedicated brain regions evaluate risky options. More precisely, good mood would lead to overweighting gain prospects and bad mood to overweighting loss prospects, making the overall expected value of a risky option positive or negative, depending on circumstances. Such a mechanism could account for the well-documented impact of mood on buying lottery tickets or investing in financial markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saunders, 1993</xref>), an effect that has been reproduced in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkes et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eldar and Niv, 2015</xref>). It could also account for why depressed and manic patients have opposite attitudes toward risk, respectively, focusing on negative and positive outcomes of potential actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leahy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yuen and Lee, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of this phenomenon, producing disastrous decisions at both the individual scale in psychiatric conditions and the societal scale in real-life economics, the underlying mechanism at the neural level is still poorly understood. This is due to the limitations of functional MRI (fMRI), which has been mostly used because mood fluctuations are difficult to track in animals, while invasive techniques are forbidden in humans for obvious ethical reasons. There is nonetheless a particular clinical situation that offers the opportunity to record intracerebral EEG (iEEG) activity from deep electrodes, when patients with refractory epilepsy are implanted prior to surgery. These iEEG recordings have already been used to successfully decode mood from resting-state activity, a technical achievement that may open the route to closed-loop stimulation procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijanzadeh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sani et al., 2018</xref>). They have also been used to specify the impact of lateral orbitofrontal cortex stimulation aiming at improving mood in moderately depressed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rao et al., 2018</xref>). There is however a discrepancy between these pioneering iEEG studies, which reported that changes in mood states might correspond to changes in the frequency of oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijanzadeh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirkby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), and fMRI studies that have related mood fluctuations to the relative activity of opponent brain systems associated to either reward or punishment processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To examine whether good and bad mood are associated to activity in different brain regions or different frequency bands, we recorded iEEG activity while patients were performing a task similar to that used in a previous fMRI study to induce mood fluctuations and test their impact on risky choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>). Mood fluctuations were induced by feedbacks provided to subjects on their responses to general knowledge questions. Choices were about whether to accept a challenge rewarded with monetary gains in case of success but punished with monetary losses in case of failure. To avoid repeating self-report too frequently, a computational model was developed, building on previous suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eldar and Niv, 2015</xref>), to generate mood level as an integration of past feedbacks, the perception of which was itself modulated by mood level. This theoretical mood level (TML) was positively correlated with activity in brain regions classically associated with reward, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and negatively correlated with regions associated with punishment, such as the anterior insula (aIns). In turn, baseline activity in these regions (prior to the presentation of choice options) was predicting a bias on choice, relative to an expected utility model. Indeed, high vmPFC activity favored the risky option (accepting the challenge) by increasing the weight on potential gain, whereas high aIns activity favored the safe option (declining the challenge) by increasing the weight on potential loss. Yet, due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, there was a remaining gap in the explanation regarding the contribution of activity in mood-related regions during decision making. Here, leveraging the excellent temporal resolution of iEEG, we intended to separate brain activity related to feedback events, to the overall mood level, and to the choice process.</p><p>Thus, in an attempt to clarify the neuro-computational mechanism through which mood fluctuations might arise and bias decisions under risk, we collected iEEG data in a large group of subjects (n=30) while they were performing interleaved quiz and choice tasks. The objectives of our analytical approach were (1) to identify brain regions in which activity was related to both mood state (good or bad) and choice (safe or risky), and (2) to examine whether mood fluctuations and related decisions were associated to a shift in frequency bands or in anatomical location of oscillatory iEEG activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The aim of this study was to elucidate how intracerebral activity may underpin the impact of mood fluctuations on risky choices. iEEG data were collected in 30 patients suffering from refractory epilepsy (39.5±1.9 years old, 14 females, see demographic details in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), while they performed two unrelated but interleaved tasks. The first was a quiz task designed as a mood induction procedure, and the second was a choice task used to unravel the effects of mood fluctuations on economic choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In the quiz task, subjects were asked to answer general knowledge questions and received feedback on their response (correct, incorrect, or too late). In order to predictably modulate mood, the difficulty of questions and the validity of feedbacks were manipulated, unbeknownst to the subjects, so as to create episodes of high and low correct feedback rate (see Materials and methods, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In 25% of the trials, the effect of feedback history was assessed by asking subjects to rate their mood on a visual analog scale. Otherwise (in 75% of trials), the quiz and choice task were separated by a 4-s rest period (black screen). In the choice task, subjects had to decide whether to accept or reject a given offer before performing a challenge consisting in stopping a moving ball inside a target. The offer comprised a gain prospect (i.e. the amount of money they would win in case of success), a loss prospect (i.e. the amount of loss in case of failure), and the difficulty of the upcoming challenge (target size). When accepting the offer, subjects played for the proposed amounts of money, otherwise, when declining, they played for minimal stakes (winning or losing 10 cents). All three choice dimensions (gain, loss, and difficulty) were varied on a trial-by-trial basis. In order to avoid learning and additional effects on mood, no feedback was provided regarding performance in the challenge (actual success rate was around 30% on average but significantly varied with difficulty). Subjects were explicitly informed that the tasks were independent, such that responses to the quiz or mood ratings had no influence on choice options and hence on their monetary earnings.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task and results.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Trial structure. Each trial included a quiz task, a rest or mood assessment period, and a choice task followed by a challenge. In the quiz task, subjects answered a general knowledge question and received a feedback. The quiz task was followed by a rest period (75% of trials) or a mood rating task (25% of trials) on a visual analog scale. In the choice task, subjects had to decide whether to accept or reject a given challenge by taking into account gain prospects (represented by a bunch of regular 10-cent coins), loss prospects (crossed out 10-cent coins), and difficulty (inversely proportional to the size of the blue bar in the middle of the screen). The challenge consisted in stopping a moving ball, invisible when inside the blue target. (<bold>b</bold>) Choice behavior.

Results indicate a significantly positive association between mood ratings and choice residuals (β = 0.05 ± 0.02, t[29] = 2.32, and p=0.027,), meaning that variability in choices, beyond that induced by the three dimensions of the offer, was indeed partially explained by mood fluctuations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modeling mood fluctuations</title><p>Because frequent assessment of subjective emotional states can lead to inconsistent ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kahneman et al., 2004</xref>), mood ratings were collected in a minority of the trials (25%).

Conversely, the weight of mood on feedback (parameter δ) was also significantly positive (t[29] = 3.30 and p=0.0026). The forgetting factor was 0.69±0.04, meaning that feedback received five trials earlier still had an impact corresponding to 23% of the most recent feedback.

The regression estimates were significant predictors of TML in both regions, but with opposite signs (best cluster for the vmPFC: –0.71 to 0 s, sum[t(246)]=414.1, and p<sub>corr</sub>&lt;1.7.10<sup>–5</sup>; best cluster for daIns: –3.05 to –2.76 s, sum[t(246)]=–113.8, p<sub>corr</sub>=0.018).</p><p>Thus, BGA in the two main ROIs carried non-redundant information about mood level. To further investigate which component of mood was signaled by each region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), we regressed BGA against TML separately for high- and low-mood trials (35% with highest vs. lowest TML). In the vmPFC, regression estimates were significantly positive for high-mood trials only (β<sub>high TML</sub> = 0.17 ± 0.08, t[90] = 2.10, and p=0.039; two-sided, one-sample, Student’s t-test), not for low-mood trials. Conversely, in the daIns, regression estimates only reached significance for low-mood trials (β<sub>low TML</sub> = –0.14 ± 0.06, t[85] = –2.39, and p=0.019), not high-mood trials. This double dissociation suggests that the vmPFC signals mood level when it gets better than average and the daIns when it gets worse than average.</p><p>In order to check that TML was expressed above and beyond the component related to the last feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), we splitted TML into two regressors, one representing the last feedback only (+1 or –1) and one representing the integration of all preceding feedbacks, which is equivalent to TML estimated at the previous trial (see Materials and methods).

For each frequency band and recording site, power time series were averaged over the pre-choice time window (−4 to 0 s) and regressed against TML. In the vmPFC, regression estimates were only significant in the high-gamma band (β<sub>Hγ</sub>=0.091 ± 0.04, t[90] = 2.41, and p=0.018; two-sided, one-sample, Student’s t-test). In the daIns however, regression estimates were not only significantly negative in the gamma and high-gamma bands (β<sub>Hγ</sub>=–0.067 ± 0.03, t[85] = –2.18, and p=0.032; β<sub>γ</sub> = –0.067 ± 0.03, t[85] = –2.0, and p=0.048) but also significantly positive in the theta and beta bands (β<sub>β</sub>=0.082 ± 0.04, t[85] = 2.31, and p=0.023; β<sub>θ</sub>=0.062 ± 0.02, t[85] = 2.85, and p=6.10<sup>–3</sup>). To check whether low-frequency bands could provide additional information about mood level, we fitted TML with all possible general linear models (GLMs) containing BGA together with any combination of other frequency bands (see Materials and methods). In both vmPFC and daIns, Bayesian model selection designated the BGA-only GLM as providing the best account of TML (vmPFC: expected frequency Ef = 0.99 and exceedance probability Xp = 1; daIns: Ef = 0.99 and Xp = 1). Thus, even if other frequency band activity was significantly related to TML in daIns, it carried redundant information relative to that extracted from BGA. Hence, BGA was the best neural proxy for mood level, at least in our two main ROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Impact of baseline intracerebral activity on decision making</title><p>To identify which mood-related regions impacted choices, we regressed across trials the residuals of choice model fit against BGA (time-locked to choice onset) for every time point and recording site.</p><p>The brain regions showing a significant positive association between choice and BGA included the mid-cingulate, dorsal, rostral, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, the vaIns, the rostral inferior temporal cortex, and parts of the visual and motor cortex.

This double dissociation suggests that the vmPFC positively predicts choice when mood gets better than average, and the daIns negatively predicts choice when mood gets worse than average.</p><p>Next, we tested whether baseline activity in our two ROIs was carried over choice-related activity so as to bias decision making (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). For each contact of a given ROI, we regressed choices against BGA separately for trials with high and low baseline BGA (in the time window identified in the preceding analysis for each ROI).

In contrast, for the daIns, when baseline BGA was high, choice-related BGA negatively predicts choices (best cluster: –0.74 to –0.48 s, sum[t(85)]=–78.2, and p<sub>corr</sub>=0.022).</p><p>Finally, we investigated the computational mechanism through which baseline BGA (in the time window identified above for each ROI) could modulate decision making.

We found that (1) baseline BGA in vmPFC and daIns was respectively signaling periods of high and low mood induced by incidental feedbacks, (2) beyond BGA, oscillatory activity in other frequency bands did not provide any additional information about mood level, (3) high vmPFC baseline BGA promoted risk taking by selectively increasing the weight of potential gains, whereas high daIns baseline BGA tempered risk taking by increasing the weight of potential losses, and (4) baseline BGA in both regions was carried over BGA during decision making, which was predictive of the eventual choice. In the following, we successively discuss how BGA in these two regions relate to mood and choice.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BGA and mood</title><p>To avoid asking subjects to rate their mood on every trial, we used a computational model to interpolate mood level between mood ratings. The model was inspired from previous suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eldar and Niv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rutledge et al., 2014</xref>) and already validated in a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>). The basic assumption is that mood is nothing but a weighted sum of positive and negative events (here, feedbacks received in the quiz task), the more recent having more weight than the more distant in the past. In addition, the model postulates that the way feedbacks are perceived are also affected by mood, in the sense that a same feedback is perceived as more positive when we are in a better mood. This makes reciprocal the influence between internal states (mood) and external events (feedback). The model was inverted on the basis of mood ratings and compared to a null model, where mood is just drifting with time, without any influence of feedback. Even if the mood model was largely winning the Bayesian comparison at the group level, its evidence was surpassing the null model in about two-thirds of subjects, a proportion close to that reported in the previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>). We nevertheless kept all subjects in subsequent analyses to reach more robust conclusions that might be generalized to the entire population. Posterior estimates of free parameters confirmed the reciprocal influence between feedback and mood, the forgetting factor suggesting that mood was still impacted by the feedback received five trials in the past (about 2 min before), with a weight about four times lesser than the last feedback. Thus, the time scale of mood fluctuations was longer than acute emotional reactions to single stimuli but much shorter than those observed in mood disorders.</p><p>When looking for neural correlates of mood fluctuations, we used both raw ratings and modeled mood levels as probes. The results were qualitatively similar but statistically more significant with TML because it allowed including all trials in the analysis. To identify brain regions that could mediate the impact of mood on choice, we selected all regions that were significantly associated to both mood level (good or bad) and choice (safe or risky). We found the two main bilateral regions that were already identified with fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>), plus unilateral visual or motor regions that were likely related to the side of the behavioral response. We note however that the aIns region defined anatomically corresponds to a dorsal part of the cluster identified with fMRI (hence the appellation of daIns) and that the vmPFC region included many recorded sites located in more ventral areas than the fMRI cluster. As with fMRI, we observed that correlation with mood level was positive in the vmPFC and negative in the daIns. This is consistent with many studies implicating the vmPFC in reward learning and the daIns in punishment learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fouragnan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garrison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palminteri and Pessiglione, 2017</xref>), including studies using iEEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gueguen et al., 2021</xref>). What we additionally show here is that the vmPFC and daIns are not just sensitive to the last reward or punishment outcome as in learning paradigms but integrate feedbacks over a longer time scale. Indeed, the time course of regression estimates showed significant association with mood in time windows much later than the response to the last feedback, and the association remained significant when removing the impact of the last feedback from the computation of TML used as regressor. We note that some expected regions are missing in our list, notably the ventral striatum, which has been shown to correlate positively with mood level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eldar and Niv, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rutledge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Young and Nusslock, 2016</xref>). This region could not be investigated here because it was simply not sampled by the electrodes implanted for clinical purposes (i.e. for localization of epileptic foci). More generally, an inherent limitation to iEEG is that parts of the brain are less sampled than others, so null results should be considered with caution, because of huge differences in statistical power across regions. Nevertheless, whole-brain analysis using fMRI showed that with this induction procedure, activity in other regions such as the ventral striatum or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex adds nothing to decoding of mood level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Having identified the two main regions reflecting mood fluctuations, we tested whether mood fluctuations were associated to similar shifts in the frequency of oscillatory activity as was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijanzadeh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirkby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rao et al., 2018</xref>). On the contrary, we observed that higher mood had opposite effects on high-frequency oscillations in the two regions, with increased BGA in the vmPFC but decreased BGA in the daIns. Thus, mood fluctuations were better accounted for by relative high-frequency activity (BGA) in the two opponent regions. Indeed, when included in the same model, vmPFC and daIns BGA were both significant predictors of mood level. Conversely, including low-frequency activity in the model did not help predicting mood level. The information carried in low-frequency activity was therefore at best redundant with that of high-frequency activity, whereas the two regions carried at least partly independent information. When analyzing separately bad, neutral, and good mood levels, we found that higher BGA signaled the two extreme tertiles: good mood in the vmPFC and bad mood in the daIns. This result suggests that the two regions were specifically concerned with good and bad mood, explaining why they were not just anti-correlated, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kucyi et al., 2020</xref>). Although we used a unidimensional rating going from bad to good mood, it could be that mood is in fact bidimensional, meaning that good and bad mood would be better conceived as independent components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watson et al., 1988</xref>), relying on distinct brain systems. This is in keeping with clinical practice: absence of positive affect or excess of negative affect is considered as two independent criteria for depression.</p><p>The observation that mood is signaled by distinct brain systems and not different frequency bands all over the brain as in previous iEEG studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bijanzadeh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirkby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rao et al., 2018</xref>) might be related to the use of positive and negative events to induce mood fluctuations and not direct stimulation of the cortical surface, which might put constraints on oscillatory activity. Besides, the good correspondence with previous fMRI results validates the shared view that BGA represents a time-resolved neural index of local neuronal activity, which typically correlates with both hemodynamic response and local spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lachaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niessing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winawer et al., 2013</xref>). We have confirmed this correspondence every time we compared iEEG and fMRI activity during the same behavioral paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gueguen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Persem et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>BGA and risky choice</title><p>Choice to accept or reject the challenge in our task was significantly modulated by the three attributes displayed on screen: gain prospect (in case of success), loss prospect (in case of failure), and difficulty of the challenge. We combined the three attributes using a standard expected utility model and examined the residuals after removing the variance explained by the model. Those residuals were significantly impacted by mood level, meaning that on top of the other factors, good/bad mood inclined subjects to accept/reject the challenge. The same was true for neural correlates of mood: higher baseline BGA in the vmPFC/daIns was both predicted by good/bad mood and associated to higher accept/reject rates, relative to predictions of the choice model. Thus, different mood levels might translate into different brain states that predispose subjects to make risky or safe decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary.</title><p>A higher baseline broadband gamma activity (BGA) in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was both predicted by good mood and associated with higher accept rates in the subsequent choice task, whereas a higher baseline BGA in the dorsal anterior insula (daIns) was both predicted by bad mood and associated with higher reject rates.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-72440-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The remaining question is how baseline BGA in these regions can be mechanistically related to risky choice. To address this question, we examined BGA during decision making, which could be separated from baseline BGA thanks to the temporal resolution of iEEG recordings. We found some carry-over: higher BGA in the vmPFC/daIns again predicted the likelihood of accept/reject choices. This does not mean that the link between BGA and choice was maintained all along; it was actually lost at the offer onset and retrieved before the behavioral response. This pattern could not be observed with fMRI but was already reported regarding the subjective value signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Persem et al., 2020</xref>). It suggests that the impact of baseline activity in mood-related regions was mediated by the contribution of the same regions (vmPFC and daIns) to the decision-making process. These regions have already been implicated in computing the subjective values that are compared to make a choice, with the vmPFC and daIns, respectively, providing positive and negative value signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pessiglione and Delgado, 2015</xref>). Thus, the relative activity of two regions may provide an impulse to accept or reject an offer, depending on whether the differential is positive or negative.</p><p>An additional explanation would be that the two regions not only provide subjective values with opposite signs but also that they provide values that differ in how the different attributes are weighted. To test this idea, we compared parameters of the choice model fitted separately onto trials with high vs. low baseline BGA in the vmPFC and daIns. We found that high BGA in the vmPFC/daIns was respectively associated to overweighting of gain and loss prospects and not just the constant that captures the global tendency to accept or reject. This result makes the link with the idea that we may see a glass half-full or half-empty when we are in a good or bad mood, possibly because we pay more attention to positive or negative aspects. It is also consistent with reports that pre-stimulus spiking or hemodynamic activity in the vmPFC predicts how much rewards are liked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abitbol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lopez-Persem et al., 2020</xref>), whereas pre-stimulus activity in the daIns predicts how aversive punishments are perceived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caria et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wiech et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, our findings suggest that mood-related neural fluctuations impact the valuation process in a valence-specific way, implemented by functionally opponent brain systems.</p><p>An obvious limitation of these findings is that although the dataset was collected in patients with epilepsy, we make interpretations as if it was collected in healthy subjects, assuming that pathological activity did not influence the neural or cognitive processes of interest. What was reassuring is that the behavior was remarkably comparable to that of young subjects performing a similar task, while the iEEG results were fully compatible with fMRI results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>). Also, it does not seem very plausible that artifacts would by chance correlate, across task trials in patients with different forms of epilepsy, with the computational variables that were related to both neural and behavioral results. Indeed, in previous studies, where we compared results with and without removing artifacted trials, results were unchanged. In fact, those trials can only degrade the correlation with computational variables, such that keeping them ensures that results would be more robust to replication.</p><p>In summary, we used intracerebral recordings in humans to specify the neuro-computational mechanisms through which mood fluctuations might arise from external events and impact risky choice. At longer time scales, these mechanisms could explain why people take more gambles (or less) after incidental events such as the victory (or defeat) of their favorite sport team, an effect that might be exacerbated in pathological conditions such as during manic (or depressive) episodes. The impact of mood on choice is a form of generalization, across different sources of reward and punishment, that may be catastrophic in pathological cases, leading people to believe that because they experienced positive (or negative) outcome in some part of their life, they are likely to succeed (or fail) in any other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients and electrode implantation</title><p>Intracerebral recordings were obtained from 30 patients suffering from drug-resistant focal epilepsy (39.5±1.9 years old, 14 females, see demographic details in Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in 7 different epilepsy centers (Rennes University Hospital: n=10; Grenoble University Hospital: n=9; Lyon Neurological Hospital: n=3; Prague Motol University Hospital: n=3; Marseille La Timone Hospital: n=2; Toulouse University Hospital: n=2; Nancy University Hospital: n=1).

Subjects performed a choice task combined with a mood induction procedure adapted from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>). Subjects completed two (n=6) or three (n=24) sessions of the experiment, consisting of 64 trials each, for a total of 128 or 192 trials. Each trial included three sub-parts: a quiz task, a rest or mood assessment period, and a choice task.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Quiz task</title><p>In this task, a question and four possible answers were displayed on the screen. The question was randomly selected from a set of 256 possible questions that were adapted from the French version of the ‘trivial pursuit’ game (e.g. where is Park Güell located?) which were slightly adapted for Prague’s epilepsy center. Subjects had to select the correct answer using the up and down keys and confirm their answer using the confirmation key within a maximum of 8 s. A feedback of 1 s was finally given (either a smiling face with a bell sound or a grimacing face with a buzzer sound) immediately after the answer or at the end of the available time if no answer had been made.</p><p>In order to predictably manipulate subjects’ mood, episodes of high and low correct response rates were created unbeknownst to them by handling questions difficulty and feedbacks. Thus, questions were sorted by difficulty (assessed by mean accuracy estimated previously in a sample of healthy subjects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>) and grouped so as to create easy and hard episodes. Within a given session of 64 trials, we created one episode of 20 trials with easy questions followed by one episode of 20 trials with hard questions and three episodes of 8 trials with questions of medium difficulty. The episodes were organized so that easy and hard episodes were always preceded and followed by episodes of medium difficulty (e.g. medium – easy – medium – hard – medium). The order of easy and difficult episodes was counterbalanced across sessions and subjects. Furthermore, feedback was biased such that a wrong answer could lead to a positive feedback (whereas a correct answer always led to a positive feedback). The proportion of biased feedback depended on the difficulty of the episode: 50% in easy, 25% in medium, and 0% in hard episode. Post-hoc debriefing showed that no subject was aware of this manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Mood rating/rest period</title><p>Mood assessment or rest period began with a 500±100 ms black screen used to ensure that a reasonable delay occurred after the last quiz feedback (which lasted 1 s). In 25% of the trials (i.e. in 16 out of 64 trials), the quiz task was followed by a mood rating task in which subjects were explicitly asked to rate their mood by answering the following question: ‘how do you feel right now?’. Subjects had to answer by moving a cursor from left (very bad) to right (very good) along a continuous visual analog scale (100 steps) with left and right hand response buttons. Subjects were given at least 4 s to confirm their ratings with the confirmation button. Their response was then maintained on the screen until the end of the 4 s so that they had no reason to speed-up their estimation. However, subjects were also discouraged from being too long to respond, as when they had not confirmed their rating within 4 s, a red message was displayed on the screen saying ‘please validate your answer.’ The initial position of the cursor on the scale was randomized to avoid confounding mood level with movements’ quantity. The position of mood ratings across trials within a session was evenly distributed and pseudo-randomized so that mood ratings were not predictable for the subjects, with the additional constraints that two mood ratings were spaced by a minimum of two trials and a maximum of six trials. In the remaining 75% of trials, the quiz task was followed by a rest period consisting of a 4 s black screen. Therefore, the delay between the end of the quiz feedback and the beginning of the choice task was kept to a minimum of 4.5±0.1 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Choice task</title><p>The choice task began with the presentation of an offer consisting of three dimensions: a gain prospect (represented by a bunch of 10-cent coins, range: 1–5 €), a loss prospect (represented by crossed out 10-cent coins, range: 1–5 €), and the upcoming challenge difficulty (represented by the size of a target window located at screen center, range: 1–5 corresponding to 75–35% theoretical success; see training section for further details about how difficulty was adjusted to each subject). Subjects were asked to accept or reject this offer by pressing a left or right button depending on where the choice option (‘yes’ or ‘no’) was displayed. Subjects’ choice determined the amount of money at stake: accepting meant that they would eventually win the gain prospect or lose the loss prospect based on their performance in the upcoming challenge, whereas declining the offer meant playing the challenge for minimal stakes (winning 10 cents or losing 10 cents).</p><p>The sequence of trials was pseudo-randomized such that all possible combinations of the three dimensions (gains, losses, and challenge difficulty), continuously sampled along four intervals ([1-2], [2–3], [3–4], and [4–5]), were displayed for one subject across sessions, with greater sampling of medium difficulty combinations ([2-3] and [3–4]) to maximize the occurrence of undetermined choices during which small ongoing fluctuations were previously shown to bias subsequent choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>). The positions of gain and loss prospects were randomly determined to be either displayed on top or bottom of the screen, and similarly, the choice options (‘yes’ or ‘no’) were randomly displayed on the left or right.</p><p>Subjects had a free time delay to accept or decline the offer. If they declined the offer, a 500 ms screen displayed the new offer (only gains and loss prospects changed so that subjects performed the challenge for a minimal stake of 10 cents). Thus, an important feature of the choice task was that the challenge was performed regardless of the choice answer to prevent subjects to eventually reject more offers to decrease experiment duration.</p><p>The challenge started 200 ms after choice confirmation: a ball appeared on the left of the screen and moved, horizontally and at constant speed, toward screen center. Subjects were asked to press the confirmation button when they thought the ball was inside the basket displayed at screen center (i.e. the target window which size index the difficulty of the challenge). To facilitate the challenge, which was performed without any feedback, the ball always reached the center of the target after 1 s. Thus, the size of the target window (i.e. the difficulty of the trial) represented the margin of error tolerated in subject response time (target: 1 s after the movement onset of the ball). The larger the basket, the greater the tolerated spatiotemporal error was to consider a trial as successful, and therefore the easier was the trial. Importantly, the moving ball could only be seen during the first 500 ms (half of the trajectory), and subjects had to extrapolate the last 500 ms portion of the ball’s trajectory to assess whether the ball was inside the target. No feedback was given to subjects about their performance or payoff after the challenge to prevent learning effects and also choice feedback effects on mood. However, to improve subjects’ motivation to perform the task as accurately as possible, the total amount of money earned by the subjects during a session (calculated by adding gains and losses across all trials) was displayed at the end of a session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Training</title><p>Before the main experiment, a training – divided into three steps – familiarized subjects with all sub-parts of the task. In the first step, subjects were familiarized with the challenge by performing 28 trials with a tolerated margin of error from ±130 to ±80 ms (56 trials if the accuracy of the first 28 trials was below 50%). Each training trial was followed by feedback informing whether the challenge was successful (‘ok’ in green) or missed (‘too slow’ or ‘too fast’ in red). In the second step, subjects performed 64 trials of the full choice (i.e. the challenge was always preceded by an offer), and a feedback on the money won/lost in the trial was displayed at the end of each trial. The goal was to train subjects to properly integrate the three dimensions of the offer (gains, losses, and difficulty) when making their choice. To help subjects learning the correspondence between the target size and challenge difficulty, trials were displayed by increasing difficulty level. Finally, the third and last part of the training (10 trials including 2 mood ratings) were totally similar to the main task to allow subjects to familiarize with the quiz task and the mood ratings.</p><p>Another purpose of the training was also to tailor the difficulty of the challenge to each subject’s ability. To do so, a tolerated margin of error was computed for each difficulty level, ranging from 75 (level 1) to 35% (level 5) of theoretical success which we estimated from each individual subjects by assuming that errors were normally distributed. Note that during training, the difficulty levels were updated after each trial (average and SD of challenge performance were updated), while in the main task, the mean and SD of subject performance (and therefore difficulty levels) were set based on every challenge performed during the training. The range of tolerated margins of error between subjects ranged from (±72 ms [level 1] to ±22 ms [level 5]) in the most precise subject to (±198 ms to ±123 ms) in less precise one.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Computational models</title><p>Mood ratings and choices were fitted using published computational framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vinckier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Mood model</title><p>As mood was sampled in 25% of the trials, we linearly interpolated ratings in order to get one data point per trial.

All signals were then re-referenced with a local bipolar montage between adjacent contacts of the same electrode to increase the spatial specificity of the effects by canceling out effects of distant sources that spread equally to both adjacent contacts through volume conduction. The average number of recording sites (one site corresponding to a bipolar contact-pair) recorded per patient was 116±37. Finally, all signals were down-sampled to 512 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Neuroanatomy</title><p>The electrode contacts were localized and anatomically labeled using the IntrAnat Electrodes software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deman et al., 2018</xref>), developed as a BrainVisa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rivière et al., 2009</xref>) toolbox. Briefly, the pre-operative anatomical MRI (3D T1 contrast) and the post-operative image with the sEEG electrodes (3D T1 MRI or CT scan), obtained for each patient, were co-registered using a rigid-body transformation computed by the Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashburner, 2009</xref>) software. The gray and white matter volumes were segmented from the pre-implantation MRI using Morphologist as included in BrainVisa. The electrode contact positions were computed in the native and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) referential using the spatial normalization of SPM12 software. Coordinates of recording sites were then computed as the mean of the MNI coordinates of the two contacts composing the bipole. For each patient, cortical parcels were obtained for the MarsAtlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auzias et al., 2016</xref>) and Destrieux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Destrieux et al., 2010</xref>) anatomical atlases, while subcortical structures were generated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischl et al., 2002</xref>, as included in Freesurfer. Each electrode contact was assigned to the gray or white matter and to specific anatomical parcels by taking the most frequent voxel label in a sphere of 3 mm radius around each contact center.</p><p>The MarsAtlas parcellation scheme was mainly used to label each recording site. This atlas relies on a surface-based method using the identification of sulci and a set of 41 ROIs per hemisphere. These regions were completed with seven subcortical regions, obtained from the procedure described by Fischl et al. (as included in Freesurfer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deman et al., 2018</xref>). However, based on the literature, we applied slight modifications concerning our ROIs. First, boundaries based on MNI coordinates were set to the vmPFC region so that contacts more lateral than x=±12 and more dorsal than z=10 were excluded from the parcel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopez-Persem et al., 2019</xref>). Second, MarsAtlas parcellation scheme involved the insular cortex as a single region, making it impossible to distinguish sub-insular areas that appear to have distinct functional properties in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Droutman et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore used the Destrieux atlas (performed by Freesurfer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deman et al., 2018</xref>) and MNI coordinates to segment the region corresponding to the insula into three sub-regions: (i) the vaIns corresponds to the anterior part (y&lt;5 in MNI space) of parcels 18 (G_insular_short), 47 (S_circular_insula_ant), and 48 (S_circular_insula_inf) of the Destrieux atlas, (ii) the daIns corresponds to the anterior part (y&lt;5 in MNI space) of parcel 49 (S_circular_insula_sup) of the Destrieux atlas, and finally (iii) the posterior insula corresponds to the posterior part (y&gt;5 in MNI space) of parcels 17 (G_Ins_lg_and_S_cent_ins), 48, and 49 of the Destrieux atlas, leading to a total of 50 ROIs.</p><p>For statistical analyses, only the 42 ROIs with at least 10 recording sites recorded across at least four subjects were retained. Among the 3494 initial recorded sites, 3154 recording sites were located within one of these 42 regions and were therefore kept for analysis. Note that data from both hemispheres were collapsed to improve statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Extraction of frequency envelopes</title><p>The time course of BGA was obtained by band-pass filtering of continuous sEEG signals in multiple successive 10 Hz-wide frequency bands (e.g. 10 bands, beginning from 50 to 60 Hz up to 140–150 Hz) using a zero-phase shift non-causal finite impulse filter with 0.5 Hz roll-off. The envelope of each band-pass filtered signal was next computed using the standard Hilbert transform. For each frequency band, this envelope signal (i.e. time varying amplitude) was divided by its mean across the entire recording session and multiplied by 100. This yields instantaneous envelope values expressed in percentage (%) of the mean. Finally, the envelope signals computed for each consecutive frequency band were averaged together to provide a single time series (the broadband gamma envelope) across the entire session. By construction, the mean value of that time series across the recording session is equal to 100. Note that computing the Hilbert envelopes in 10 Hz sub-bands and normalizing them individually before averaging over the broadband interval allows to counteract a bias toward the lower frequencies of the interval induced by the 1/f drop-off in amplitude. Finally, the obtained time series were smoothed using a sliding window of 250 ms, to get rid of potential artifacts, and down-sampled at 100 Hz (i.e. one-time sample every 10 ms). BGA was normalized for each recording site by z-scoring across trials.</p><p>The envelopes of theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands were extracted and normalized in a similar manner as the BGA except that steps were 1 Hz for theta and alpha, 5 Hz for beta, and 4 Hz for gamma. BGA frequency range was defined as 50–150 Hz, gamma as 33–49 Hz, beta as 13–33 Hz, alpha as 8–13 Hz, and theta as 4–8 Hz.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiological analyses</title><p>The frequency envelopes of each recording site were epoched at each trial from 5600 ms prior choice onset to 500 ms after choice onset, encompassing the quiz feedback, the rest period (or mood assessment) between quiz and choice tasks and the choice onset (display of the offer).

Choices were then regressed across the 40% highest or lowest baseline activity trials against BGA at every time point, as in the previous GLM. To ensure that baseline activity does not interfere with the reported effect, trials with a choice response time shorter than 1.5 up to 2 s were eliminated from this analysis. Note that the response time threshold (from 1.5 to 2 s) did not affect the result. We reported results from the analysis removing trials with a response time shorter than 1.6 s (longest response time removing less than 25% of trials).</p><p>For each ROI, a t-value was computed across all recording sites of the given ROI for each time point of the baseline window (−4 to 0 s before choice onset), independently of subject identity, using two-sided, one-sample, Student’s t-tests. For all GLMs, the statistical significance of each ROI was assessed through permutation tests. First, the pairing between responses and predictors across trials was shuffled randomly 300 times for each recording site. Second, we performed 60,000 random combinations of all contacts in an ROI, drawn from the 300 shuffles calculated previously for each site. The maximal cluster-level statistics (the maximal sum of t-values over contiguous time points exceeding a significance threshold of 0.05) were extracted for each combination to compute a ‘null’ distribution of effect size across a time window from –4 to 0 s before choice onset (the baseline corresponding to the rest or mood assessment period). The p-value of each cluster in the original (non-shuffled) data was finally obtained by computing the proportion of clusters with higher statistics in the null distribution and reported as the ‘cluster-level corrected’ p-value (p<sub>corr</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Group-level analyses</title><p>To avoid making the implicit assumption, related to fixed-effect analyses across recording sites, that differences between brains are negligible, we checked that these effects remained significant using mixed-effects linear models, which separately account for inter-site and inter-individual variance (Tables S2-3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Specifically, we tested in each ROI the association between mean BGA (averaged over the best temporal cluster identified in fixed-effects analyses) and (1) mood rating, (2) TML, and (3) choice with the following linear mixed-effects models:</p><p>1.

More specifically, activity was averaged from –1.64 to –1.31 s before choice onset for the vmPFC and from –0.95 to –0.67 s for the daIns. The choice model was then run separately with data from trials whose averaged activity was above or below the median baseline activity across trials. As we expected small effects, data were restricted to trials that were not overly determined by choice parameters (i.e. trials for which acceptance probability, as computed by the choice model with all trials, was between 2/7 and 5/7 of the subject’s acceptance range). We also ensured that the mean and variance of choice dimensions (gain, loss, and difficulty) were identical between our two trial subsets (high vs. low baseline BGA). All free parameters of the expected utility were free to fluctuate (the constant k<sub>0</sub>, gain weight k<sub>g</sub>, loss weight k<sub>l</sub>, and the weight associated with difficulty σ), while k<sub>t</sub> was set with values obtained from the previously computed model (with all trials). Finally, significance of the difference between posterior parameters obtained with the two trial subsets (high vs. low activity) was tested across all contacts of a given region using two-sided, paired, Student’s t-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Code availability</title><p>The custom codes used to (i) extract the different frequency envelopes, and in particular the BGA, from the raw intracranial data, (ii) perform the regression analyses at recording site level, and (iii) compute the second level statistics (across all recording sites of a ROI) are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.com/romane-cecchi/publications-code/2022-ieeg-mood-and-risky-choice">https://gitlab.com/romane-cecchi/publications-code/2022-ieeg-mood-and-risky-choice</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:76c900a2e1dc2f0a86786c095c90a141c3fea300;origin=https://gitlab.com/romane-cecchi/publications-code/2022-ieeg-mood-and-risky-choice;visit=swh:1:snp:5b18ec6bbd08af230bd607afbb1faabb962ac7d6;anchor=swh:1:rev:8bccf85407231f5a7d9e117e8e2656a9cb43c083">swh:1:rev:8bccf85407231f5a7d9e117e8e2656a9cb43c083</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cecchi, 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All patients gave written, informed consent before their inclusion in the present study, which received approval from the local ethics committees (CPP 09-CHUG-12, study 0907; CPP18-001b / 2017-A03248-45; IRB00003888; CER No. 47-0913).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables of demographic data and statistical results.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-72440-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-72440-transrepform1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Estimates obtained from the regression of BGA against TML in vmPFC and daIns.</title><p>Rows: time course, columns: recording sites.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-72440-data1-v2.mat" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="matlab-mat"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata2"><label>Source data 2.</label><caption><title>Estimates obtained from the regression of choice residuals against BGA in vmPFC and daIns.</title><p>Rows: time course, columns: recording sites.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-72440-data2-v2.mat" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="matlab-mat"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Due to ethical restrictions on data sharing, we are unable to share raw data for this manuscript to preserve participant anonymity.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewers agreed that your study is potentially interesting and that with appropriate analysis and revisions, the results are likely to be of interest to a broad audience. However, there were fundamental concerns about some aspects of your study, including the statistical approach. It will be important that you fully address these essential issues, as the reviewers' confidence in your findings will in large part rest on your responses to these concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Reviewers were concerned about a potential confound in the task design that may explain results. In 25% of the trials, subjects were asked to provide a mood rating, whereas in the remaining 75% of trials, the screen was just blank and the subjects rested. Trials without mood ratings would be expected to trigger increased BGA activity in default mode areas such as the vmPFC, and opposite patterns in salience, visual and motor areas. It would be important to compare and plot &quot;raw&quot; BGA between trials with and without mood ratings, and discuss whether and if so how default mode activity induced by the rest period could have affected the results.</p><p>2. The analyses focus on the vmPFC and insula, which is understandable given previous work that has implicated these regions in mood. However, it appears that several areas show similar correlations, and it would be important to also analyze and report results from these other areas to show whether or not effects are specific for the vmPFC and insula.</p><p>3. Reviewers were concerned about the statistical analysis. Specifically, the authors grouped all data across all subjects and performed statistics across electrodes. Reviewers considered this approach invalid as it inflates the number of independent observations (electrodes from the same subject are not independent). It would be better to compute statistics across subjects per region. Please revise the statistical approach throughout the manuscript by replacing any and all across-electrode analyses with across-subjects analyses, with degrees of freedom reflecting the number of subjects with contacts in each particular region (one observation per subject, averaged across electrodes). In addition, it would be good to report how many subjects show statistically significant regressions between BGA and mood at any electrode.</p><p>4. There was considerable discussion among reviewers about details of the design and analyses. For instance, it was not immediately clear for which trials the regression analyses for mood ratings and TML were computed. It would be important to revise and clarify the methods throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72440.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, we do not see how this possibility could confound the results (i.e., the association of BGA with mood level), simply because the distribution of rating vs. rest trials was orthogonal to the distribution of positive vs. negative feedback trials that created mood fluctuations. There could be a potential confound, should the presence of a mood rating by itself affect TML, but this was not the case, because by construction, the presence of a rating was not integrated in the computation of TML.</p><p>A way to definitively rule out this possibility is to test the correlation between mood and BGA across rating (no rest) trials only. Even if the presence of a rating by itself affects mood or BGA, it would do so in every trial and therefore cannot bias the correlation across trials. This analysis was already provided in the initial manuscript (see Figure 2b). It shows that the association between mood and BGA in both vmPFC and daIns holds even when restricted to rating trials and therefore cannot be confounded by the absence of rating (in rest trials) inducing default mode activity in the vmPFC.</p><p>To better explain how ratings and feedbacks were distributed across trials, we have added a supplementary figure that shows a representative example (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This plot shows that ratings were collected independently of whether subjects were in high- or low-mood episodes.</p><p>We suspect the comment relates to the recent publication by the Parvizi group (Kucyi et al., 2020) reporting antagonist BGA in the default mode network (which includes vmPFC) and the saliency network (which includes daIns). Even if this anticorrelation between vmPFC and daIns was indeed triggered in our data by the alternance of rating and no-rating trials, it could not affect our results, first for the reasons explained above (this alternance is orthogonal to mood fluctuations) and second because vmPFC and daIns explained different parts of the variance in mood level (see Figure 2C of the initial manuscript). In other words, the mood-relevant information carried by vmPFC and daIns was not the same, and therefore was not a simple reflection of the same factor (presence vs. absence of mood rating). This was already explained in the initial manuscript, but we now better emphasize this point, in the revised discussion, with citation of the paper by Kucyi and colleagues (lines 440-447):</p><p>“Conversely, including low-frequency activity in the model did not help predicting mood level. The information carried in low-frequency activity was therefore at best redundant with that of high-frequency activity, whereas the two regions carried at least partly independent information. When analyzing separately bad, neutral, and good mood levels, we found that higher BGA signaled the two extreme tertiles: good mood in the vmPFC and bad mood in the daIns. This result suggests that the two regions were specifically concerned with good and bad mood, explaining why they were not just anti-correlated, as previously suggested (Kucyi et al., 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The analyses focus on the vmPFC and insula, which is understandable given previous work that has implicated these regions in mood. However, it appears that several areas show similar correlations, and it would be important to also analyze and report results from these other areas to show whether or not effects are specific for the vmPFC and insula.</p></disp-quote><p>Following this suggestion, we now provide a more systematic exploration of the dataset, with a detailed analysis of other brain regions for all three main parametric analyses testing the association between BGA and (i) mood ratings, (ii) TML and (iii) choice residuals. Interestingly, only the vmPFC was positively related to both choice and mood (whether proxied by rating or TML), and only the daIns was negatively associated with both choice and mood (whether rating or TML). Thus, our two ROI were the only ones meeting the criteria for mediating the impact of mood on choice, which we show in subsequent analyses.</p><p>We now systematically provide detailed results for all significant associations (both positive and negative) with each parametric regressor (mood ratings, TML, choice residuals) in Tables S2-S3 in Supplementary file 1.</p><p>We edited the “mood” Results section (lines 236-246) as follows:</p><p>“The vmPFC (n = 91 sites from 20 subjects) was the only ROI for which we found a positive correlation (Figure 2b; Source data 1; Table S2 in Supplementary file 1) between BGA and both mood rating (best cluster: -1.37 to -1.04 s, sum(t<sub>(90)</sub>) = 122.3, p<sub>corr</sub> = 0.010) and TML (best cluster: -0.57 to -0.13 s, sum(t<sub>(90)</sub>) = 132.4, p<sub>corr</sub> = 8.10<sup>-3</sup>). Conversely, we found a negative correlation in a larger brain network encompassing the daIns (n = 86 sites from 28 subjects, Figure 2b; Source data 1; Table S2 in Supplementary file 1), in which BGA was negatively associated with both mood rating (best cluster: -3.36 to -2.51 s, sum(t<sub>(85)</sub>) = -325.8, p<sub>corr</sub> &lt; 1.7.10<sup>-5</sup>) and TML (best cluster: -3.13 to -2.72 s, sum(t<sub>(85)</sub>) = -136.4, p<sub>corr</sub> = 9.10<sup>-3</sup>). The additional brain regions in which BGA was negatively associated with mood level (indexed with either mood rating or TML) involved the superior portion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the lateral and rostro-mesial visual cortex, the ventral motor cortex and the dorsomedial premotor cortex (Table S2 in Supplementary file 1).”</p><p>We also edited the “choice” Results section (lines 320-324) as follows:</p><p>“The brain regions showing a significant positive association between choice and BGA included the mid-cingulate, dorsal, rostral and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral anterior insula, the rostral inferior temporal cortex and parts of the visual and motor cortex. Negative association between choice and BGA was observed in regions such as the rostro-ventral premotor cortex, the posterior and dorsal anterior insula, the ventral inferior and the superior parietal cortex (Table S3 in Supplementary file 1).”</p><p>In the supplementary materials, we added the following two tables:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

What the reviewers suggest is the group-level random-effect analysis that is typically used in fMRI studies but is not the gold standard in electrophysiology studies. Should fixed-effect analyses, pooling recording sites across subjects, be invalid, the quasi-totality of single-cell recording studies in monkeys, as well as iEEG studies in humans, should be withdrawn from the scientific literature. There are two main reasons, in our opinion, why the electrophysiology community has converged on a fixed-effect approach. The first is the low number of participants (typically 2 or 3 in monkey studies, and less than 10 in most iEEG studies until recently), which would make group-level analyses severely under-powered. The second is the inhomogeneous sampling (number and location of recording sites in a given region varies a lot across patients), such that giving the same weight to every participant would severely bias statistical estimates. Thus, pooling recording sites across subjects (or monkeys) ensure that the region of interest is reasonably sampled in terms of spatial coverage and statistical power.</p><p>That being said, we agree that pooling recording sites across subjects (or monkeys) is making the implicit assumption that differences between brains are negligible, which is not satisfactory, even if standard in the field. To address this issue, we reanalyzed the entire dataset using mixed-effect models, which distinguish variance across recording sites and differences between individuals.</p><p>Specifically, we tested in each ROI the association between BGA (averaged across the best temporal cluster identified with the fixed-effect approach) and (1) mood ratings, (2) TML and (3) choices with the following linear mixed models:</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>BGA ~ 1 + mood + (1 + mood | SUBJECTS) + (1 + mood | RECORDING SITES:SUBJECTS)</p></list-item><list-item><p>BGA ~ 1 + TML + (1 + TML | SUBJECTS) + (1 + TML | RECORDING SITES:SUBJECTS)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Choice ~ 1 + BGA + (1 + BGA | SUBJECTS) + (1 + BGA | RECORDING SITES:SUBJECTS)</p></list-item></list><p>We found that all effects remained significant in our two main ROIs (vmPFC and daIns), with the same sign as in the initial fixed-effect analyses, while other regions showed associations passing the significance threshold for the other regressors (see Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary file 1).</p><p>These analyses have been incorporated into the Results section (lines 248-251), as follows:</p><p>“To avoid making the implicit assumption, related to fixed-effect analyses across recording sites, that differences between brains are negligible, we checked that these effects remained significant using generalized linear mixed-effects models, which separately account for inter-site and inter-individual variance (Tables S2-3 in Supplementary file 1).”</p><p>The methods section (lines 821-832) has also been modified, accordingly:</p><p>“Group-level analyses</p><p>To avoid making the implicit assumption, related to fixed-effect analyses across recording sites, that differences between brains are negligible, we checked that these effects remained significant using mixed-effects linear models, which separately account for inter-site and inter-individual variance (Tables S2-3 in Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Specifically, we tested in each ROI the association between mean BGA (averaged over the best temporal cluster identified in fixed-effects analyses) and (1) mood rating, (2) TML and (3) choice with the following linear mixed-effects models:</p><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>BGA ~ 1 + mood + (1 + mood | SUBJECTS) + (1 + mood | RECORDING SITES:SUBJECTS)</p></list-item><list-item><p>BGA ~ 1 + TML + (1 + TML | SUBJECTS) + (1 + TML | RECORDING SITES:SUBJECTS)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Choice ~ 1 + BGA + (1 + BGA | SUBJECTS) + (1 + BGA | RECORDING SITES:SUBJECTS)</p></list-item></list><p>We then performed F-tests on the fixed effects estimates, with significance set at p &lt; 0.05, two-tailed.”</p><p>Finally, to satisfy the reviewers, we also tested these associations with group-level random-effects analyses, where data points are subject-wise BGA averaged across recording sites (within the temporal cluster identified with the fixed-effects analyses). All associations remained significant or borderline (see Table S4 in Supplementary file 1), even with this under-powered approach. For all the reasons detailed above, we prefer to incorporate these results in a supplementary table and keep the fixed-effects analyses for the main results, as they will be better accepted by the iEEG community.</p><p>These analyses have been incorporated into the Results section (lines 356-359), as follows:</p><p>“We also verified that the main findings of this study remained significant (or borderline) when using group-level random-effects analyses (Table S4 in Supplementary file 1, see methods), even if this approach is underpowered and unadjusted for sampling bias (some subjects having very few recording sites in the relevant ROI).”</p><p>The methods section has also been edited, as follows (lines 833-837):</p><p>“To test the association between BGA and mood, TML or choice at the group level (using random-effects analyses), we performed the same linear regression as described in the electrophysiological analyses section on BGA averaged over the best time cluster (identified by the fixed-effects approach) and across all recording sites of a given subjects located in the relevant ROI. We then conducted a two-sided, one-sample Student's t-test on the resulting regression estimates (Table S4 in Supplementary file 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There was considerable discussion among reviewers about details of the design and analyses. For instance, it was not immediately clear for which trials the regression analyses for mood ratings and TML were computed. It would be important to revise and clarify the methods throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity. We have checked that this issue is now fixed in the revised manuscript. Note that regarding the specific point raised, the regression against mood rating is necessarily done over trials with mood rating, so there cannot be any ambiguity there. Regarding the regression against TML, it was done both over the trials with mood rating only and over all trials (with and without mood rating), as indicated above the corresponding plots.</p></body></sub-article></article>
