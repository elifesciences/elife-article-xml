receptors (GPCRs) transmit signals into cells depending on the G protein type. To analyze the functions of GPCR signaling, we assessed the effectiveness of animal G-protein-coupled bistable rhodopsins that can be controlled into active and inactive states by light application using zebrafish. We expressed Gq- and Gi/o-coupled bistable rhodopsins in hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons, which are involved in locomotion, or in cardiomyocytes. Light stimulation of the reticulospinal V2a neurons expressing Gq-coupled spider Rh1 resulted in an increase in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and evoked swimming behavior. Light stimulation of cardiomyocytes expressing the Gi/o-coupled mosquito Opn3, pufferfish TMT opsin, or lamprey parapinopsin induced cardiac arrest, and the effect was suppressed by treatment with pertussis toxin or barium, suggesting that Gi/o-dependent regulation of inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels controls cardiac function. These data indicate that these rhodopsins are useful for optogenetic control of GPCR-mediated signaling in zebrafish neurons and cardiomyocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>bistable rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>g protein-coupled rhodopsin</kwd><kwd>g protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>cardiac contraction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR1753</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hibi</surname><given-names>Masahiko</given-names></name><name><surname>Terakita</surname><given-names>Akihisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP26115512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hibi</surname><given-names>Masahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18K06333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shimizu</surname><given-names>Takashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18H02448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hibi</surname><given-names>Masahiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Animal G-protein-coupled bistable rhodopsins can regulate Gq- and Gi-mediated signaling in a light-dependent manner in neurons and cardiomyocytes, making them useful for analyzing the roles of GPCR signaling in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for transmitting extracellular signals into the cell. Many of them function as receptors for neurotransmitters or hormones, and activate coupled trimeric G proteins consisting of α, β, and γ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pierce et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenbaum et al., 2009</xref>). Upon activation of a GPCR, the α subunit (Gα) is converted from a GDP- to a GTP-bound form to regulate target proteins, while β and γ subunits are released from Gα as a complex (Gβγ) to control their own target proteins. GPCR regulates different signaling cascades depending on the type of Gα that they bind (e.g. Gs, Gq, Gt, and Gi/o). Gs- and Gi/o-coupled GPCRs activate and inhibit, respectively cAMP-producing adenylyl cyclase (AC) via the Gα subunits. Gi/o-coupled GPCRs also regulate G protein activated inward-rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channels (GIRKs) via the Gβγ subunit, increasing K<sup>+</sup> efflux and thereby inducing hyperpolarization. In contrast, Gq-coupled GPCRs, via their Gα subunits, activate phospholipase β (PLCβ) to generate inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), subsequently elevating intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and activating protein kinase C (PKC). For example, in the central nervous system, the neurotransmitter glutamate binds to and activates GPCRs that are referred to as metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), some of which function as Gq-coupled GPCRs (e.g. mGluR1), and others as Gi/o-coupled GPCRs (e.g. mGluR2, 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reiner and Levitz, 2018</xref>). In the heart, noradrenaline binds to and activates the Gs-coupled β1 adrenergic receptor (β1AR), which increases myocardial contraction and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Lucia et al., 2018</xref>), while acetylcholine binds to and activates the Gi/o-coupled muscarinic M2 receptor, which reduces heart rate and contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wess et al., 2007</xref>). Although the functions of many GPCR signals have been studied, exactly in which cells, when, and how they function have not yet been fully elucidated. To solve these unknowns, it is necessary to precisely manipulate the location and timing of GPCR signaling.</p><p>Several techniques have been developed to control the activity and signaling of target cells. Chemogenetics using artificially designed GPCRs that are derived from muscarinic M3 receptor and can be activated by chemical ligands (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, DREADD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaganman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roth, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wess et al., 2013</xref>) has been used to control GPCR signaling, but achieving temporally and spatially precise control has been difficult. In contrast, optogenetics using rhodopsins, which bind to a chromophore retinal and can regulate their function in a light-sensitive manner, has been used to control and study cell functions. Light-gated microbial channelrhodopsins (e.g. ChR2) and light-driven microbial ion pump-type rhodopsins (e.g. halorhodopsin, NpHR) have been exploited to control the activities of neurons and/or cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arrenberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyden et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deisseroth and Hegemann, 2017</xref>). However, these rhodopsins induce depolarization or hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of cells in a light stimulus-dependent manner at a precise timing and locations, but do not directly control GPCR signaling. In contrast, animal rhodopsins are light-activated G-protein-coupled proteins and can activate various signaling cascades, like GPCRs for neurotransmitters and hormones, while displaying a diversity of wavelength sensitivity and G-protein selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koyanagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terakita, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Most animal rhodopsins bind to 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal, which is isomerized to an all-<italic>trans</italic> form upon light absorption. This isomerization triggers a conformational change of rhodopsins and activates signal transduction cascades via the coupled G protein. Vertebrate visual rhodopsins release the chromophore all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal after light absorption and become an inactive form (bleach). The photoregeneration of these rhodopsins depends on the enzymes that generate 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal, such as retinal isomerases, which are specifically expressed in photoreceptor organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koyanagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terakita, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terakita et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the photosensitivity of visual rhodopsins might not be very stable in cells other than photoreceptor organs. In contrast, animal rhodopsins other than vertebrate visual rhodopsins retain 11-<italic>cis</italic> retinal and convert into photoproducts having the all-<italic>trans</italic> form (active state) upon light absorption, and these then revert to the original (inactive) dark state by subsequent light absorption, so they are bleach-resistant and are called bistable opsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koyanagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koyanagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Terakita and Nagata, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terakita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tsukamoto and Terakita, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsukamoto et al., 2005</xref>). Although chimeric optogenetic tools have been engineered using visual opsins with cytoplasmic loops and the C-terminal tail of adrenergic receptors (Opto-XRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Airan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spangler and Bruchas, 2017</xref>), bistable opsins have the advantage of stable optical control of GPCR signaling in various tissues.</p><p>A number of Gq-coupled bistable rhodopsin families have been identified as visual opsins in arthropods and molluscs, and as melanopsin in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2008</xref>). Among them, jumping spider rhodopsin-1 (SpiRh1) was isolated from the jumping spider <italic>Hasarius adansoni</italic> and was reported to activate the Gq-signaling cascade in a green light-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koyanagi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagata et al., 2012</xref>). Mosquito Opn3 (MosOpn3) is an invertebrate homolog of vertebrate Opn3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hill et al., 2002</xref>). The Opn3 group contains multiple members including Opn3, originally called encephalopsin, teleost multiple tissue (TMT) opsin, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackshaw and Snyder, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koyanagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moutsaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Terakita, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Terakita and Nagata, 2014</xref>). When MosOpn3 was expressed in mammalian cultured cells, it bound to both 11-<italic>cis</italic> and 13-<italic>cis</italic> retinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyanagi et al., 2013</xref>). MosOpn3 light-dependently activated Gi- and Go-type G proteins in vitro and initiated a Gi-signaling cascade in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koyanagi et al., 2013</xref>). Parapinopsin, which belongs to another group of bistable opsins, serves as a Gt-coupled opsin, like vertebrate visual opsins, and can also activate Gi-type G protein in vitro and in mammalian cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Koyanagi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Terakita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsukamoto et al., 2009</xref>). The stable photoproduct (active form) of parapinopsin has its absorption maximum at ~500 nm, which is considerably distant from that of the dark state (~360 nm). Therefore, light illumination with different wavelengths was shown to switch on and off G-protein-mediated signaling via parapinopsin in vitro and in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koyanagi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wada et al., 2018</xref>). MosOpn3 and lamprey parapinopsin (LamPP) were used to suppress neuronal activities in a light stimulation-dependent manner in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copits et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>) and in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koyanagi et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to these rhodopsins, a Gq-coupled rhodopsin, neuropsin (also known as Opn5), was used to induce the activation of neurons, the intestine, and heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagdi et al., 2022</xref>). Optogenetic activation of Gs-coupled rhodopsin jellyfish opsin (JellyOp) and Gi-coupled long wavelength-sensitive cone opsin (LWO) were shown to accelerate and suppress the excitation of cardiomyocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cokić et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makowka et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether they can control GPCR signaling in other types of cells and what mechanisms underlie optogenetic controls of GPCR signaling in each cell type. Zebrafish larvae (especially pigment-deficient mutants) are transparent, so zebrafish have been used for analyses using optogenetic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antinucci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arrenberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bernal Sierra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Umeda et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we examined the optogenetic activity of Gq- and Gi/o-coupled animal bistable rhodopsins (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) by expressing them in hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons that drive locomotion and cardiomyocytes in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activity of G-protein-coupled bistable rhodopsins in human cells</title><p>To examine the activity of G-protein-coupled rhodopsins in cells, we created two DNA constructs that expressed a rhodopsin and a fluorescent protein as a fusion protein, or that expressed a carboxy-terminal Flag epitope-tagged rhodopsin and a fluorescent protein separately using a viral 2 A (P2A) peptide system.

Light stimulation increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> at a much higher level for SpiRh1-P2A-TagCFP-expressing cells than SpiRh1-TagCFP-expressing cells, suggesting that the expression level and/or activity of bistable rhodopsins is higher with a Flag epitope-tagged protein than with a large fluorescent-fused protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The light stimulation-dependent increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with SpiRh1 was suppressed by treatment with a Gαq inhibitor YM254890 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), confirming that SpiRh1 mediates Gq-mediated signaling. We created similar Flag-tagged expression constructs for bistable Gq- and Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins from various invertebrate and vertebrate animals listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and expressed these rhodopsins in HEK293S cells.

Light stimulation of cells expressing MosOpn3, PufTMT, LamPP, or ZPP1 with 500 (for MosOpn3 and PufTMT) or 410 nm (for LamPP and ZPP1) light reduced intracellular cAMP levels to similar extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

movements. Immunohistochemistry with anti-Flag or GFP antibodies revealed ChRWR expression on the cell surface of hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons was mosaic due to methylation-dependent silencing of the UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitake et al., 2011</xref>), while SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F] were uniformly expressed in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>), light stimulation (0.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) of reticulospinal V2a neurons with ChRWR for 100 ms immediately evoked tail movements (locomotion rate 73.8 ± 9.48%, latency 0.0555±0.00879 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Activation with SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F] required longer stimulation (1 s) and 3–5 s to initiate tail movements (SpiRh1 locomotion rate 89.0 ± 3.53%, latency 3.23±0.315 s; SpiRh1[S186F], locomotion rate 91.4 ± 3.9%, latency 4.12±0.246 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2 fig2video3">Figure 2—videos 2 and 3</xref>). However, stimulation with SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F] elicited tail movements for a significantly longer duration than ChRWR (SpiRh1 4.37±0.691, SpiRh1[S186F] 3.17±0.735 s, ChRWR 0.684±0.226 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Light stimulation of control sibling larvae that did not express the rhodopsins scarcely induced tail movements, although stimulation with 405 nm light induced locomotion at a low frequency (locomotion rate of control larvae for SpiRh1, SpiRh1[S186F], ChRWR were 15.0 ± 5.88%, 35.0 ± 10.9%, 8.75 ± 3.33%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Light stimulation with SpiRh1, SpiRh1[S186F], and ChRWR induced tail movements similarly in trials 1 and 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To analyze the photosensitivity of these rhodopsins, we applied light of various intensities (0.4, 0.2, and 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) for 1 s. The rate of locomotion induced by ChRWR decreased when light intensity was reduced, that is, at 0.2 and 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, while that with SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F] did not change significantly when light intensity was reduced to 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The latency and duration of tail movements induced with SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F] did not vary with different light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data indicate that optical activation of reticulospinal V2a neurons with SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F] is robust and long-lasting, although it requires longer stimulation and longer latency than channelrhodopsin. In G-protein-mediated signaling, it is generally accepted that Gq activates PLCβ and thereby generates IP3, which induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the endoplasmic reticulum. To examine the level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, we expressed SpiRh1 or SpiRh1[S186F] with GCaMP6s in hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons. We found that light stimulation with these Gq-coupled rhodopsins increased the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2">Figure 3—videos 1 and 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optogenetic manipulation of zebrafish heart by Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins</title><p>Gi/o-coupled bistable rhodopsins MosOpn3 and LamPP were used to suppress neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copits et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mahn et al., 2021</xref>). We expressed Gi/o-coupled rhodopsin MosOpn3 and LamPP in hindbrain reticulospinal V2a neurons and examined whether they could suppress tail movements induced by a visual stimulus (white light). However, light stimulation of the hindbrain in zebrafish expressing MosOpn3 or LamPP did not suppress tail movements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It is currently unknown why Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins did not suppress the activity of reticulospinal V2a neurons. Optogenetic control of cardiac function in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arrenberg et al., 2010</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nussinovitch and Gepstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vogt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>) was reported previously. Thus, we examined whether Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins could be used to control cardiomyocyte function in vivo. By crossing <italic>Tg(myl7:GAL4FF</italic>) and <italic>Tg(UAS:opto-tool</italic>), we expressed Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins in cardiomyocytes. We again established multiple Tg lines and analyzed stable Tg lines that expressed equally high - but varying - levels of these tools. Immunohistochemical staining revealed comparable expression of these Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins in zebrafish cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We irradiated the entire heart area of 4-dpf Tg larvae expressing the Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins with 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> light of appropriate wavelengths (520 nm for MosOpn3, 470 nm for PufTMT, and 405 nm for LamPP) for 1 s. We applied light stimuli to each larva as six trials at intervals of 10 min and analyzed four Tg and control larvae for each type of rhodopsin. Videos of heartbeats (HBs) before and after light stimulation were recorded (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref> for MosOpn3, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref> for PufTMT, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref> for LamPP). HBs were analyzed and heart rates were calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Cardiac arrest rate, latency to cardiac arrest, and time to resumption of HB were determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D, E and F</xref>). Activation of the Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP in the heart led to cardiac arrest within approximately 1 s in all Tg larvae examined (812±198 ms for MosOpn3, 955±230 ms for PufTMT, and 905±153 ms for LamPP), but not in control sibling larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C, D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2 fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 1–3</xref>). The first HB occurred about 10 s after cardiac arrest (8.83±5.13 s for MosOpn3, 5.67±2.49 s for PufTMT, and 12.1±1.48 s for LamPP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), but HBs gradually recovered and took at least 1 min (sometimes a few minutes) to return to normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2 fig4video3">Figure 4—videos 1–3</xref>). In trials 1 and 6, there was no significantly change in cardiac arrest following photoactivation by MosOp3 and LamPP, while a slight but significant difference was observed for PufTMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP are efficient optogenetic tools to control the function of cardiomyocytes in zebrafish.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of cardiomyocytes by Gi/o-coupled bistable rhodopsins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP in zebrafish cardiomyocytes. 4-dpf <italic>Tg(myl7:GAL4FF);Tg(UAS:opto-tool-Flag-P2A-TagCFP, myl7:mCherry</italic>) larvae were fixed and stained with anti-Flag (green) and anti-DsRed (mCherry: magenta).

Given that these bistable rhodopsins are sensitive to stimulating light of diverse wavelengths, they may be useful for manipulating various cell and tissue functions in vivo using light of different wavelengths. Animal bistable rhodopsins are endogenously expressed in various regions of the brain including photoreceptive tissues such as pineal and parapineal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koyanagi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koyanagi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wada et al., 2018</xref>). If a wide area of the brain of Tg zebrafish is irradiated with white light, it may also activate endogenous bistable rhodopsins in addition to transgene-expressed rhodopsins and affect the functions of neurons or other tissues. It is, therefore, important to compare the effects of light stimulation between Tg and non-Tg control fish.

The inhibition of M-type K<sup>+</sup> channels is considered to involve the PLCβ-mediated reduction of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown, 2010</xref>). The same mechanism might be involved in neural activation, i.e. depolarization and generating action potentials, by SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F]. It is also plausible that when Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased, activated PKC and CaMKs phosphorylate cation channels, including neurotransmitter receptors, and this may also contribute to neural depolarization.

Whereas photoactivation of channelrhodopsins immediately induced depolarization following cation influx, photoactivation of Gq-coupled rhodopsins induced a delayed increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and neuronal activation. Similar neural activation takes place by binding of neurotransmitters to their receptors. For example, binding of glutamate to ion channel-type AMPA receptors and GPCR-type metabotropic receptors (mGluRs), which are often present on the same postsynaptic membrane, likely induces immediate depolarization and a delayed Ca<sup>2+</sup>/depolarization pathway. While the depolarization signal directly participates in the information transmission of neural circuits, the increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> may regulate changes in synaptic transmission efficiency by modifying neurotransmitter receptors and/or channels and controlling their function and localization. Given that the two signals have different roles in neural circuit function, SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F], together with channelrhodopsins, may be helpful in distinguishing the roles of these two signals in neural circuit function.</p><p>Optogenetic activation of Gq-coupled neuropsin was shown to increase heart rate in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagdi et al., 2022</xref>). However, light stimulation with SpiRh1 in zebrafish cardiomyocytes did not apparently affect heart function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). It is unknown why activation of SpiRh1 in the heart did not lead to an increase in heart rate. The contraction of heart muscles and the control of heart rate requires an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It remains elusive whether SpiRh1 activation does not induce a sufficient increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> to affect heart function, or whether cooperation of action potentials together with an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for optic control of heart function in zebrafish. Future studies with calcium and voltage imaging and/or optogenetic activation of multiple pathways may clarify this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Optogenetic control of zebrafish heart with Gi/o-coupled bistable rhodopsins</title><p>Light stimulation of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP in the heart-induced cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The effect of short-term activation of these Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins on cardiac function was persistent. The effect of trial number was minimal, although there were some differences among the rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, a dependence on stimulus light intensities was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, these Gi/o-coupled rhodospins are controllable and robust optogenetic tools for studying zebrafish cardiac function. Several physiological mechanisms could be considered for inducing cardiac arrest through the activation of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins, including changes in myocardial contractility, conduction velocity in the AV node, and HB rhythm (pacemaker). In this study, rhodopsins were expressed in all cardiomyocytes, although detailed mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Nonetheless, we carried out some additional experiments to offer greater clarity. First, the state of cardiac contraction induced by activation of MosOpn3 was compared to the states of a relaxed heart mediated by anion channelrhodopsin <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 and a contracted heart mediated by cation channelrhodopsin ChrimsonR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Those results revealed that hearts experiencing cardiac arrest following activation of MosOpn3 were in a relaxed state. This is consistent with the concept that Gi/o-couple rhosopsins induce hyperpolarization of cardiomyocytes through GIRKs (see below).</p><p>MosOpn3 gradually restored normal HBs following light stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), indicating a transition to an inactive state during this process. AV conductivity was examined in two conditions: during the transition phase of MosOpn3’s partial activation (during recovery) and in the absence of MosOpn3 activation. However, no significant difference was observed between these two conditions. This suggests that conductivity in the AV node might not be affected. However, it is necessary to investigate the expression of MosOpn3 in the AV node and the effects of localized irradiation on the AV node in Tg fish. The influence on cardiac rhythm was not assessed in this study. Future studies using electrocardiograms and electrophysiological analyses using zebrafish Tg fish will clarify what aspects of heart functions can be controlled by Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Mechanisms of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsin-mediated heart control</title><p>The effect of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins on cardiac arrest was inhibited by treatment with PTX and BaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins suppress neuronal activity by K<sup>+</sup> channel-mediated hyperpolarization, which is mediated by the Gβγ subunit. It was previously reported that MosOpn3 and LamPP decreased neuronal excitability by coupling to GIRKs, but they also suppressed neurotransmitter release by inhibiting voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copits et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mahn et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that the PTX and BaCl<sub>2</sub> treatments might have affected the functional expression of endogenous Gi/o-coupled GPCRs and indirectly affected the activity of the Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins. However, considering the complete suppression of light-induced cardiac arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), these Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins likely suppressed the heart’s function through GIRKs in cardiomyocytes. As Gi/o-coupled GPCRs also regulate intracellular cAMP level via AC regulation, light stimulation of MosOpn3, PufTMT, LamPP, or ZPP1 reduced cAMP levels in HEK293S cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The Gi/o-mediated control of cell functions may depend on cell type and subcellular location. We expressed MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP in reticulospinal V2a neurons, although light activation of these Gi-coupled rhodopsins did not suppress spontaneous tail movements (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The inability to suppress tail movements may be due to slow activation of Gi/Go-mediated signaling by these bistable rhodopsins or the lack of other components in V2a neurons. Optimization of these tools and stimulation methods may be necessary, depending on cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Bistable nature of G-coupled rhodopsins</title><p>A short duration of light stimulation (1 s) of the heart expressing MosOpn3 or PufTMT induced cardiac arrest, resumed HBs after 10 s, and returned to a steady state after a few minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), while prolonged light application returned HBs to a steady state in a shorter time after cardiac arrest than short light application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As the wavelengths of light effective for activation and inactivation were close for MosOpn3 and PufTMT, light application likely induced both activation and inhibition of these Gi-coupled bistable rhodopsins. In contrast, the light wavelengths for activation and inactivation were apart for LamPP, which is switchable between these two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copits et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koyanagi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this, cardiac arrest was induced by 405 nm light with LamPP, while irradiation of around 470 nm light resumed HBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D and E</xref>), suggesting that LamPP can be turned on and off by different wavelengths of light in the zebrafish heart. Like LamPP, ZPP1 has different light wavelengths for activation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, photoactivation of ZPP1 resulted in only a short period of cardiac arrest and its photosensitivity did not recover for a few hours. The photoproduct (active form) of ZPP1 might not be stable (i.e. it might release the chromophore easily) compared to that of MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP in zebrafish cardiomyocytes.</p><p>Since Gq-coupled SpiRh1, and Gi-coupled MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP are bistable rhodopsins, their photoproducts, which activate G protein-mediated signaling, are considered to be stable unless they receive inactivating light. The tail movements stopped several seconds after stimulation with SpiRh1 and SpiRh1[S186F], and HBs resumed a few minutes after stimulation with MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), suggesting that activity of the bistable rhodopsins gradually reduced after transient stimulation. During prolonged stimulation with light, MosOpn3 maintained cardiac arrest for about 40 s, while LamPP exhibited gradual recovery of HB frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation suggests that MosOpn3 exhibits only slight light adaptation while LamPP is more susceptible to inactivation due to light adaptation. Therefore, despite differences among these bistable rhodopsins, there are likely intrinsic light adaptation mechanisms that inactivate bistable rhodopsins other than the photo-dependent reversal from an active to an inactive form. These mechanisms might not involve the release of all-<italic>trans</italic> retinal, but instead involve the phosphorylation-dependent binding of β-arrestin to rhodopsins and the β-arrestin-mediated internalization of rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawano-Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>). In any case, by using G-protein-coupled bistable rhodopsins with different properties (activating/inactivating light wavelengths, stability, etc.), the functions of cells and tissues can be finely controlled by light stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Utility of bistable rhodopsin to study cell and tissue functions</title><p>Optogenetic tools that are proven to be useful in mammals are also effective in zebrafish, and vice versa. The bistable rhodopsin tools that we designed are effective in zebrafish, but are also active in human HEK293S cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Bistable rhodopsins were shown to be expressed in mammalian tissues and used to optogenetically manipulate GPCR signaling in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Copits et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mahn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makowka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wagdi et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, the expression plasmids for bistable rhodopsins were constructed to express tagged rhodopsin and P2A-TagCFP by the Gal4-UAS system in specific types of zebrafish cells. As small epitope-tagged bistable rhodopsins were more active than fluorescent protein-fused rhodopsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), they could also be more active in cells of other species, including mammals.</p><p>In this study, zebrafish larvae were used to study the role of GPCR signaling in cardiac function. Differences in heart structure and function were found between larvae and adult zebrafish. As a zebrafish grows, blood pressure increases and the heart becomes more complex, developing valves and ventricular trabeculae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, GPCR signaling, which regulates heart structure and function, may differ between juvenile and adult fish. Optogenetic manipulation of the heart’s function in adult zebrafish using bistable opsins should clarify this issue.</p><p>The genome of a single vertebrate species contains hundreds of GPCR genes. Many GPCRs function as receptors for sensations (e.g. odorant and taste receptors), and some function as receptors of some endogenous ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pierce et al., 2002</xref>). There are also many GPCR signals whose role in vivo is not yet known. In the nervous system, GPCRs function as metabotropic receptors for neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, and are involved in neuronal functions such as synaptic plasticity, involving long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD) in neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reiner and Levitz, 2018</xref>). Optogenetic manipulation of individual GPCR signaling should lead to a better understanding of their roles in synaptic plasticity and neural circuits. GPCRs also play important roles in regulating the function of internal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Lucia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pierce et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockman et al., 2002</xref>). Certain GPCRs that share ligands are known to activate multiple signaling pathways and confer diverse cellular responses. They can interact with multiple types of G proteins. For example, there are three types of adrenergic receptors (ARs), α1, α2, and β, which bind to Gq, Gi/o, and Gs, respectively (β2 and β3 also bind to Gi), and activate different downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hilger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pierce et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rockman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenbaum et al., 2009</xref>). Using optogenetic techniques, it may be possible to distinguish the in vivo roles of these adrenergic receptors and other GPCRs. The G-coupled bistable rhodopsins analyzed in this study may be useful tools for the optogenetic control of various cell and tissue functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene<break/>(<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChRWR-EGFP</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Umeda et al., 2013</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene<break/>(<italic>Hasarius adansoni)</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Spider Rh1 (SpiRh1)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koyanagi et al., 2008</xref>;

intracellular cAMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in rhodopsin-expressing HEK293S cells (human embryonic kidney 293 S cells, provided by Dr. Jeremy Nathans of Johns Hopkins University) were measured using the GloSensor cAMP assay and the aequorin assay, respectively, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bailes and Lucas, 2013</xref>). HEK293S cells have been confirmed to be free from mycoplasma contamination. The identity of HEK293S cells was confirmed by similarity to HEK293 and HEK293T cells through STR profiling, and by morphological observation of the cells. The pGloSensor-20F cAMP plasmid (Promega) was used for the GloSensor cAMP assay. The wild type aequorin obtained by introducing two reverse mutations into the plasmid [pcDNA3.1+/mit-2mutAEQ] (Addgene #45539) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de la Fuente et al., 2012</xref>) was used for the aequorin assay. The rhodopsin expression plasmids were constructed based on pCS2+ (see the Zebrafish section) and used for transfection. For Gαq inhibition, YM-254890 (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corp., 257–00631, Osaka, Japan) was added (1 μM) 5 min before the measurement. Green (500 nm) and violet (410 nm) LED lights were applied for 5 s in the GloSensor cAMP assay and for 1 s in the aequorin assay as light stimuli. Dual Head LED Light 505 nm (GB Life Science) and SPL-25-CC (REVOX, Inc) were used for green and violet LED light stimulation, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>All transgenic zebrafish lines in this study were generated using the <italic>mitfa<sup>w2/w2</sup></italic> mutant (also known as <italic>nacre</italic>) line, which lacks melanophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lister et al., 1999</xref>).

Individual fish were placed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 1 hr. The fixed samples were washed three times with PBST, treated with acetone for 12 min at room temperature, washed again three times with PBST and twice with PBS-DT. The solution was replaced with 5% goat serum in PBS-DT and was kept at room temperature for 1 hr for blocking. Primary antibody was added to 5% goat serum in PBS-DT to achieve the dilution factor described above and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were washed with PBS-DT six times for 15 min each wash. The incubation in secondary antibody solution, 5% goat serum in PBS-DT with the above-mentioned dilution factor, was performed overnight at 4 °C in the dark. After six washes of 15 min each in PBS-DT, the larvae were embedded in 1.5% agarose (low gelling temperature Type VII-A A0701, Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired using a confocal laser inverted microscope LSM700 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). When acquiring images, the laser intensity was not changed by more than a factor of 2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Locomotion assay</title><p>3-dpf Tg larvae were quickly anesthetized with about 0.04% tricaine methanesulfonate (Nacalai Tesque, Inc, Kyoto, Japan, Cat# 01916–32) and embedded in 2.5% agarose in 1/10 Evans solution (134 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 2.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM Hepes; pH 7.8). The tail was set free by cutting the agarose around it. The agarose containing the embedded individual fish was placed in a 90 mm Petri dish filled with rearing water and kept under the microscope for 20 min to recover from anesthesia and to get used to the experimental environment which was followed by the first light exposure. For light stimulation, a patterned LED illuminator system LEOPARD (OPTO-LINE, Inc, Saitama, Japan) and the control software PolyScan2 (Mightex, Toronto, Canada) was used. LEDs with wavelengths of 405, 470, 520, and 620 nm, which are the closest values to the maximum absorption wavelength of each optogenetic tool, were used. The irradiation area was 0.30 mm × 0.34 mm in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Tail movements were captured by an infrared CMOS camera (67 fps, GZL-C1L-41C6M-C, Teledyne FLIR LLC, Wilsonville, USA) mounted under the stage and StreamPix7 software (NorPix, Inc, Montreal, Canada) and analyzed by Tracker Video Analysis and Modeling Tool for Physics Education version 5.1.5. The timing of tail movement capture and light application of the reticulospinal V2a neurons was controlled by a USB DAQ device (USB-6008, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and programming software (LabVIEW, 2015, National Instruments). The irradiation stimulation was repeated six times every 10 or 20 min for 1 s for G-protein-coupled rhodopsins, or 100 ms or 1 s for ChRWR with a minimum of eight individuals for each strain. The start and end times of tail movements were measured visually by StreamPix7 after the end of each trial. Trials in which swimming behavior was induced within 8 s after light stimulation were defined as induced trials. The percentage of induced trials was defined as locomotion rate, excluding trials in which swimming behavior was elicited before light stimulation. The time from the start of light application to the first tail movement was defined as latency, and the time from the start of the first tail movement to the end of that movement was defined as duration. The maximum distance the tail moved from the midline divided by the body length was defined as strength. To examine the tools’ activity in the inhibition of locomotion, 4-dpf Tg larvae were pretreated with 15 mM pentylenetetrazol (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# P6500) and spontaneous tail movements were induced by white LED light (peak 640  nm; Kingbright Electronic Co., Ltd., New Taipei City, Taiwan) powered by a DC power supply (E3631A; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 5 s. After 500 ms from the onset of white LED light, hindbrain reticulospinal V2a was stimulated with the patterned LED illuminator. Trials in which swimming behavior stopped within 1 s after light stimulation were defined as locomotion-inhibition trials. The percentage of locomotion-inhibition trials was calculated and indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Graphs were created with GraphPad Prism5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Larvae embedded in agarose were placed in a 90 mm Petri dish filled with water and kept under a microscope for 20 min for recovery from anesthesia. Light stimulation was performed as described in the section of the locomotion assay. The area of irradiation was 0.17 mm × 0.25 mm, including the heart. The heart area in the Tg fish expressing MosOpn3, PufTMT, or LamPP was irradiated for 1 s with light wavelength of 520, 470, and 405 nm, respectively, which are the closest values to the maximum absorption wavelength of each optogenetic tool. The HBs of larvae were captured by an infrared CMOS camera (67 fps) and recorded with StreamPix7, as described above. The irradiation trial was repeated six times every 10 min for one fish and a total of four larvae were analyzed for each strain. The video recordings of HBs were observed using QuickTime player version 10.5 (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA). After opening videos with Fiji/ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) or Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>), the entire heart was manually set as the region of interest (ROI), the luminosity (AU: arbitrary units) data in the ROI was used to create graphs of HBs using ggplot2 version 3.2.0 of R. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsuda et al., 2017</xref>), the change in luminosity reflects the HB. To calculate the relative HB frequency, temporal changes in luminosity were obtained from the video using Bosai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>) and the frames where HBs occurred were identified by the code (HB_frequency.py) created in Python ver. 3.5.6 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA). The relative HB frequency was calculated from the HB frame data, 500 ms before and after each time point using Excel (Microsoft). Graphs of the average of relative HB frequency were created by ggplot2 in R or the code (HB_frequency_plot.py) in Python. The latency to cardiac arrest and the time to first resumption of HB were also measured. Graphs were created with GraphPad Prism5 software. All movies were created with VSDC Free Video Editor software. Simple HB experiments were also performed using a light source equipped with an MZ16 FA microscope and CFP (excitation light: 426–446 nm), GFP (460–500 nm), YFP (490–510 nm), and DSR filters (530–560 nm, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. To measure the size of the heart, image data of the heart region was captured from videos in Fiji/ImageJ. The entire heart was manually identified, and its area was measured. For stimulation of MosOpn3, <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1-EYFP and ChrimsonR-tdTomato, a fluorescence detection filter (excitation 530–550 nm, emission 575IF nm, U-MWIG3, Olympus) was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of time difference between atrial and ventricular contractions</title><p>The video recordings of HBs were analyzed by Bonsai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>). Arbitrary positions of the atrium and ventricle were set as the ROIs. The luminosity data extracted from these ROIs was used to create graphs of HBs for both the atrium and ventricle using the code (AV_conductivity_plot.py) created in Python. The time difference between atrial and ventricular contractions was computed as the interval between the peak of the atrial HB and the corresponding peak of the ventricular HB using the code (AV_conductivity.py) in Python. HBs were considered undetected and thus excluded if the difference in AV contraction exceeded 0.5 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) or BaCl<sub>2</sub></title><p>For PTX treatment, after the irradiation trial was repeated three times, the larvae were removed from agarose then immersed in a solution containing PTX (0.2 µg/mL, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Cat# 168–22471) for 3 min. After PTX treatment, larvae were embedded in agarose and placed on a Petri dish filled with deionized water. After larvae were kept in the Petri dish for 5 min, the heart area was irradiated three times every 10 min for 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For control experiments of the PTX treatment, larvae were immersed in water instead of PTX solution for 3 min. For the BaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment, 4-dpf larvae were embedded in agarose and placed in a Petri dish filled with water. After the irradiation trial was repeated twice, the water in the Petri dish was replaced with 1 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub> (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp., Cat# 025–00172) solution. After larvae were kept in this solution for 15 min, the heart area was irradiated three times every 10 min for 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). For control experiments of the BaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment, larvae were kept in water instead of BaCl<sub>2</sub>. After opening videos with QuickTime Player, cardiac arrest time was measured. Cardiac arrest ratio was calculated as the ratio to cardiac arrest time in trial 1, and plotted as a graph using ggplot2 of R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> live imaging</title><p>Tg larvae expressing GCaMP6s with or without the opto-tool in reticulospinal V2a neurons or cardiomyocytes were quickly anesthetized with 0.04% tricaine methanesulfonate and embedded in 4% agarose in 1/10 Evans solution. A 130 W light source (U-HGLGPS, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a fluorescence detection filter (excitation 470–495 nm, emission 510–550 nm, U-MNIBA3, Olympus) was used to observe the fluorescence of GCaMP6s. The same filter set was used to stimulate SpiRh1, MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP. For Tg larvae expressing SpiRh1[S186F] or LamPP, the reticulospinal V2a neurons or the heart area were irradiated with 405 nm for 1 s with the patterned LED illuminator system. A CCD camera (ORCA-R2, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) attached to the microscope was used to capture the GCaMP6s fluorescence images at 9 fps. After image acquisition of V2a neurons, the high intensity region from the hindbrain to the spinal cord was set as the ROI using Fiji/ImageJ, and fluorescence intensity was measured. The relative change in fluorescence intensity (ΔF/F) was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at each time point by the fluorescence intensity at the start of light stimulation for SpiRh1 or before stimulation (base line) for SpiRh1[S186F]. Graphs were created with GraphPad Prism5 software. After image acquisition for cardiomyocytes, videos of the heart were opened with Fiji/ImageJ, ROIs for the ventricle and atrium were set, and luminosity data were acquired. ΔF/F was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity at each time point by fluorescence intensity at the start of light stimulation for MosOpn3 and PufTMT, or by fluorescence intensity at the steady state (after HB resumption) for LamPP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using R software package (versions 3.6.1 and 4.2.1).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. More in–depth analysis that better captures the effects of manipulating GPCR signalling. For cardiac manipulation, this should include analyses of subtle changes in heart rate and contraction force. This is because modulation of cardiac activity (e.g. positive or negative chronotropic, inotropic, dromotropic, bathmotropic, and/or lusitropic responses) would represent better the physiological modulation of the heart via GPCR and downstream signaling events. In addition, different light intensities should be examined, as a light titration of observed effects could provide more meaningful insight into both rhodopsin responses and signaling mechanisms.</p><p>2. Figures should indicate when repeated measures are made on the same animal. This should be reflected in the statistical analysis. The effect of the trial number should be indicated. Additionally, the text should provide a quantitative description of the effects and statistical analysis.</p><p>3. Please provide better justification for the choice of different rhodopsins and sites of expression. For example, why were the rhodopsins tested in the reticulospinal V2a neurons selectively?</p><p>4. Please provide proper citations of relevant work in the field. This means citing all relevant papers, including those on cardiomyocytes. These papers should be discussed relative to the findings of the present work.</p><p>5. Address the issue of promiscuity of signalling via GPCRs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The conclusion on page 9, that &quot;these Flag–tagged G protein–coupled rhodopsins can be used for optogenetic manipulation of Gq– and Gi/o–mediated signaling in vertebrate cells&quot; is strictly not true. The conclusion is valid for the cell type used. Would all vertebrate cells have the same properties as HEK cells? Which invertebrate cells do not?</p><p>2. The sentence in the middle of page 9 has a number of minor errors: It should be &quot;...has been used to control GPCR signaling, but achieving temporally and spatially precise control has been difficult&quot;.</p><p>3. It should be noted that bistable rhodopsins have been used successfully in mice, e.g. see Mahn et al. 2021, as cited in the text. Thus, the third sentence in the section &quot;Utility of bistable rhodopsin to study cell and tissue functions&quot; on page 21, that states &quot;It is most likely that when they are expressed in mammalian tissues, they can be used to optogenetically manipulate GPCR signaling in vivo&quot;. is incorrect. The experiment has already been done and reported.</p><p>4. The second sentence in the abstract is not correct. The tools were developed elsewhere, and this paper tests whether they function in two cell types in the zebrafish larva.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The abstract implies that different tools were tested in neurons and cardiomyocytes. Only later it becomes obvious that both Gi and Gq pathways were optogenetically targeted in both cell types.</p><p>– The last sentence of the abstract could be more specific.</p><p>– The correct abbreviation for metabotropic receptors is mGluRs</p><p>– Activation of muscarinic M2 receptors reduces heart rate and contraction force but does not inhibit cardiac function under physiological conditions.</p><p>– Introduction of rhodopsins and retinal are kept too general. The same applies to the introduction of G protein activation upon retinal isomerization.</p><p>– Please only state the necessary amount of your own references after single statements, and if possible, please include supporting references by other teams as well. A more balanced way of citing will strengthen the meaningfulness of statements.</p><p>– In the introduction, the choice of described and later on tested rhodopsins is not clearly described.</p><p>– Papers by Copits et al., 2021 and Mahn et al., 2021 are cited in the introduction; but they are not sufficiently described. Accordingly, the observed data is not compared to the previously published data in the discussion. A detailed comparison of findings would help the reader to understand common mechanisms and to understand cell–type–specific findings.</p><p>– Please include quantitative data descriptions/numerical values in the results part, e.g. add percentages or values to statements indicating changes (reduction/increase, etc.).</p><p>– For experiments shown in Figures 2 and 3, a titration of light intensity would have been very useful.</p><p>– It is not clear why some rhodopsins showed mosaic expression whereas others were uniformly expressed.

You may want to consider including this data.</p><p>– You may want to consider further describing differences/similarities in downstream effects between dendritic, somatic, and axonal/presynaptic stimulation. This may help to dissect the molecular mechanism.</p><p>– It is not clear why SpiRh1 did not show effects in cardiomyocytes, especially taking into account recent studies using Neuropsin.</p><p>– The argument of cooperation of action potentials and ca<sup>2+</sup> is difficult to follow.</p><p>– Why did Gi rhodopsins not change tail movement? Did you also look at the speed and extent of tail movement? Did you record neuronal activity? Which downstream signaling molecules might be missing in this specific neuronal cell type?</p><p>– Wavelength &quot;were close/were apart&quot; to/from one another. Please state the numerical values of maxima. Also, you may want to link to papers with spectra included, as the spectral overlap is most important. Is this a limitation of the available LEDs or actually (biologically) impossible to selectively activate or inactivate those rhodopsins?</p><p>– Can the very different kinetics of the effects in neurons vs cardiomyocytes be explained by photoreceptor properties or the different kinetics of the downstream signaling pathways?</p><p>– How do you know that the findings are transferrable to mammalian systems?

In addition, different light intensities should be examined, as a light titration of observed effects could provide more meaningful insight into both rhodopsin responses and signaling mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to these comments, we conducted additional experiments in which we activated bistable rhodopsins in cardiomyocytes with light of various intensities (0.5, 0.2, and 0.05 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) to better examine the photosensitivity of the G protein-coupled bistable rhodopsins. We analyzed cardiac arrest rate, latency to cardiac arrest, and time to resumption of heartbeats (HBs). The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 4-supplement 2, 3 in the revised manuscript. We described the data on page 15, line 16-page 16, line 1, as follows.</p><p>To analyze the photosensitivity of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins, we applied light of various intensities for 1 s and examine their effect on HBs (Figure 4-supplement 2). Cardiac arrest was induced and sustained for over 20 s after stimulation of MosOpn3 with 0.05 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> light for 1 s. Photoactivation of PufTMT and LamPP at lower light intensities (0.2 or 0.05 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) resulted in cardiac arrest, but faster HB recovery than stimulation with 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> light (Figure 4-supplement 2). The data indicate that the ability of MosOpn3 to suppress HBs is more photosensitive than PufTMT and LamPP in the zebrafish heart. We further examined atrial-ventricular (AV) conductivity by measuring the time difference between atrial and ventricular contractions before and after light stimulation when HBs had slightly recovered. There was no significant difference in AV conductivity before and after light stimulation (Figure 4-supplement 3).</p><p>Furthermore, we examined heart contractility (or lusitropy) by comparing the heart’s morphology when arrested by three different rhodospins: Gi/o-coupled rhodopsin MosOpn3, cation channelrhodopsin (ChrimsonR), and anion channelrhodopsin <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1. Activation of ChrimsonR led to a contracted heart, while <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 induced relaxation of the heart. When arrested by MosOpn3, the heart appeared larger than the contracted heart arrested by ChrimsonR, but similar in size to the relaxed heart arrested by <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 (Figure 4G). This suggests that the cardiac arrest caused by MosOpn3 activation was not due to continuous contraction, rather by the loss of heart muscle excitation. We described these data on page 15, lines 7-16.</p><p>These data suggest that Gi/o-coupled rhodopsin effectively reduced heart rate without significantly changing conductivity in the AV node (chronotropic effects). However, when Gi/o rhodopsin was strongly activated, it led to cardiac arrest by inhibiting the excitatory-contraction (EC) coupling process. This is consistent with the relaxation of the heart and the decrease in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> levels following light stimulation. Since our experiments involved stimulating the entire heart area, the possibility that Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins are also able to inhibit AV conductivity cannot be completely excluded. Electrophysiological experiments would be necessary to fully understand how Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins exert control over the heart, particularly in terms of their bathmotropic effect. Unfortunately, such electrophysiological techniques have not yet been established for studying the hearts of zebrafish larvae. Nonetheless, we firmly believe that our detailed analysis of heartbeats under different light intensities provides strong evidence for our conclusion that Gi/o-coupled rhodopsin suppresses cardiomyocyte activity by G protein-coupled inwardly rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel (GIRK)-mediated inhibition of heart muscle excitation. We discussed this issue on page 22, line 17-page 24, line 2 in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The results of these analyses were presented in the graphs as Figure 3A-E, Figure 3-supplement 2, Figure 4D-F, H, and Figure 4-supplement 2B. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of trial number, showing the data in Figure 3-supplement 1 and Figure 4-supplement 1, and explaining the data on page 12, lines 19-20 and page 15, lines 2-4 in the Result section. In addition, we provided a quantitative description of the effects in the text. Since there are too many statistics-related data (<italic>p</italic>-values), we decided not to describe them in the text, limiting the descriptions to the Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please provide better justification for the choice of different rhodopsins and sites of expression. For example, why were the rhodopsins tested in the reticulospinal V2a neurons selectively?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the effects of several bistable rhodopsins on both reticulospinal V2a neurons and cardiomyocytes. We observed noticeable effects of Gq-coupled rhodopsins on reticulospinal V2a neurons, but no significant effects of these rhodospins on cardiomyocytes. Similarly, we found effects of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins on cardiomyocytes, but no significant effects of these rhodopsins on reticulospinal V2a neurons. These discrepancies could be attributed to differences in the target cells and experimental conditions, suggesting the need of further optimization. We described the data on page 13, lines 16-22 and page 16, lines 9-10 in the Result section and Table 1, and discussed the relationship between the activity of bistable rhodopsins and their effects on target cells on page 21, lines 6-15 and page 24, line 19-page 25, line 2 in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Address the issue of promiscuity of signalling via GPCRs.</p></disp-quote><p>Using the reviewer’s suggestion as a prompt, we discussed this issue on page 26, lines 5-12 in the Discussion section, as follows. Certain GPCRs that share ligands are known to activate multiple signaling pathways and confer diverse cellular responses. They can interact with multiple types of G proteins. For example, there are three types of adrenergic receptors (ARs), α1, α2, and β, which bind to Gq, Gi/o, and Gs, respectively (β2 and β3 also bind to Gi), and activate different downstream signaling pathways (<italic>Hilger et al. , 2018; Pierce et al. , 2002; Rockman et al. , 2002; Rosenbaum et al. , 2009</italic>). Using optogenetic techniques, it might be possible to distinguish the in vivo roles of these adrenergic receptors and other GPCRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

A detailed comparison of findings would help the reader to understand common mechanisms and to understand cell–type–specific findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have explained these studies in more detail on page 13, lines 15-16 in the Result section and page 24, lines 8-11 in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please include quantitative data descriptions/numerical values in the results part, e.g. add percentages or values to statements indicating changes (reduction/increase, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We have described quantitative data in the Result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For experiments shown in Figures 2 and 3, a titration of light intensity would have been very useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted new and additional experiments with light stimulation at various light intensities, both in the reticulospinal V2a neurons and in the heart experiments (Figure 3, Figure 3-supplement 1, 2, Figure 4-supplement 2, 3). We described the relevant data on page 12, line 20-page 13, line 4 and page 15, lines 16-22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not clear why some rhodopsins showed mosaic expression whereas others were uniformly expressed. If this is an intrinsic characteristic of the Tg lines, it is difficult to compare any functional behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an accurate observation. At present, we cannot control the mosaic state of Gal4-UAS-mediated transgene expression. Therefore, we selected fish with similar expression levels for our study. This information was included in the manuscript (page 12, lines 2-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please avoid data interpretation in the result part.</p></disp-quote><p>The final sentence in a paragraph of the Results section includes an interpretation to explain the content. We believe this is both necessary and unavoidable. Apart from that, we eliminated as much interpretation as possible from other parts of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Suppression of neuronal activity. You may want to be more specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified this to: “suppress neurotransmitter release”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Description of Figure 5. Please be more specific with time points and indicate values for each level.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the description of the Figure 5 legend. If our explanation is inadequate or unclear, we are open to revising it based on the Reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The interpretation of light adaptation effects during prolonged illumination remains difficult. How can you dissect the effects of rhodopsin inactivation from cell–intrinsic compensatory mechanisms?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we analyzed light adaptation of Gi/o-coupled rhodopsins by repeating prolonged stimulation with light of a wavelength that only activates bistable rhodopsin. The hearts of Tg larvae expressing MosOpn3 or LamPP were irradiated with 0.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> light of 520 nm for MosOpn3 or 0.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> light of 405 nm for LamPP for 80 s, using three trials at 20 min intervals. During photoactivation of MosOpn3, HBs recovered slightly after about 40 s in all trials. In contrast, HBs gradually recovered during photoactivation of LamPP (Figure 5-supplement 1). Thus, during prolonged light stimulation, MosOpn3 maintained its active state for a relatively long period, while LamPP transitioned to an inactive state more rapidly. We described the data on page 17, lines 12-20. The data suggest that despite the differences among the bistable rhodopsins, there are likely intrinsic light adaptation mechanisms that inactivate bistable rhodopsins other than the photo-dependent reversal from an active to an inactive form. We discussed this issue on page 25, lines 6-15 in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3, 5, and throughout: Please try to perform experiments in the same manner for all tools compared. Please use graphs at the same time scales for all rhodopsins compared.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we attempted to perform experiments in the same manner for all tools. However, for ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, it was necessary to change the experimental system when the excitation light of GCaMP6 activated rhodopsin (SpiRh1 and MosOpn3) and when it did not (SpiRh[S186F] and LamPP). Consequently, the manner of data extraction changes. Accordingly, we modified the presentation of graphs in Figures 3 and 5. This was explained in the text and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– From the provided data, you may not conclude that LamPP is switchable rhodopsin (which has been shown before). However, you can show that downstream signaling can be switched.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the sentence to: “Therefore, the activity of LamPP can be turned on and off by using light of different wavelengths in the zebrafish heart” on page 17, lines 10-11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please never use statements such as &quot;tended to weaken&quot;. Either an effect is statistically significant (then please state so) or no difference can be observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided that for statements related to experimental results with no significant difference, we either stated that there was no significant difference, or we did not describe the difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The explanation of the effects of using repetitive light stimulation is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed repetitive light stimulation of cardiomyocytes expressing MosOpn3, PufTMT, and LamPP every 10 min before and after PTX or BaCl2 treatment as shown in Figure 6A or 6E. Details of the experimental procedure are described in “Treatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) and BaCl<sub>2</sub>” of the Material and methods section, and in the Figure 6 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To my knowledge, BaCl2 is not specific to inward rectifying K channels.</p></disp-quote><p>According to literature, not only BaCl2 but other chemicals were used to block GIRKs. We did not analyze the specificity of BaCl2 to GIRKs in this study. We would like to maintain the assertion that the inhibitory experiments with BaCl<sub>2</sub> suggest the possibility that the Gio rhodopsins might be acting through GIRKs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please do not comment on data not shown. You may want to consider including this data.</p></disp-quote><p>Photostimulation of the hindbrain of Tg larvae expressing SpiRh1 in reticulospinal V2a neurons induced tail movements, suggesting that SpiRh1 functions in the axons of reticulospinal V2a neurons. However, we think that more robust experimental data are necessary to conclude this. Thus, we decided to delete this description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– You may want to consider further describing differences/similarities in downstream effects between dendritic, somatic, and axonal/presynaptic stimulation. This may help to dissect the molecular mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is extremely important to analyze differences and similarities in the effects of dendritic, somatic, and axonal/presynaptic stimulation, as was done in previous reports (Mahn et al., 2021; Copits et al., 2021). However, we spent considerable resources, time and effort to compare the activity of many bistable rhodopsins in two different systems, so we do not wish to complete such an analysis in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is not clear why SpiRh1 did not show effects in cardiomyocytes, especially taking into account recent studies using Neuropsin.</p></disp-quote><p>We also do not know the reason. Given the differences in the rhodopsins used and their expression systems, no easy conclusions can be drawn. We cited a relevant paper and further discussed this issue on page 22, lines 6-15 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The argument of cooperation of action potentials and ca<sup>2+</sup> is difficult to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>To assist with comprehension, we added the following sentence to page 21, line21-page 22, line 3. “While the depolarization signal directly participates in the information transmission of neural circuits, the increase in intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> may regulate changes in synaptic transmission efficiency by modifying neurotransmitter receptors and/or channels and controlling their function and localization”. If this is still insufficiently clear, we are open to making further revisions based on the reviewer’s specific suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why did Gi rhodopsins not change tail movement? Did you also look at the speed and extent of tail movement?</p></disp-quote><p>Although a slight functional inhibition of V2a neurons by MosOpn3 was observed, it was not statistically significant. While this was not mentioned in this paper (it is described in the paper that we submitted concurrently), experiments using the anion channel <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 clearly showed inhibition of tail movements, in contrast with MosOpn3. We think that further examination of experimental conditions is necessary. We described this issue on page 13, lines 16-22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did you record neuronal activity? Which downstream signaling molecules might be missing in this specific neuronal cell type?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that electrophysiological experiments are necessary to answer many of the questions raised in this study. However, in this manuscript, we did not perform electrophysiological experiments because we wanted to focus on the differences in bistable rhodopsin activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Wavelength &quot;were close/were apart&quot; to/from one another. Please state the numerical values of maxima. Also, you may want to link to papers with spectra included, as the spectral overlap is most important. Is this a limitation of the available LEDs or actually (biologically) impossible to selectively activate or inactivate those rhodopsins?</p></disp-quote><p>We listed the wavelengths of light used in this study and the light for maximum activation or inhibition in Table 1 and offered an explanation in the table legend. As shown in Table 1, we used wavelengths that were close to those that result in maximum activation or inhibition. However, for some tools, we could only use wavelengths that were slightly apart from the optimum value due to the availability of LEDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can the very different kinetics of the effects in neurons vs cardiomyocytes be explained by photoreceptor properties or the different kinetics of the downstream signaling pathways?</p></disp-quote><p>At this point, both possibilities seem likely. However, we have no data to clarify this, so we decided not to mention it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How do you know that the findings are transferrable to mammalian systems? This also applies to the co–expression of rhodopsin and fluorescent protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not argue that these findings are transferrable to a mammalian system. However, data obtained from zebrafish frequently provide valuable insight for mammalian experiments, so there is no reason to refute this. Therefore, we would like to leave the statement that notes this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The choice of wavelength for each tool is not obvious. Please include the maxima of activation/deactivation in table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Where information was available, we incorporated light wavelengths for maximum activation and inactivation of bistable rhodopsins in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why were fish transferred to dishes with deionized water?</p></disp-quote><p>In this experimental system, when treating inhibitors, small volumes of liquid were used, and photostimulation was performed in water, which has a relatively high volume, and since PTX is valuable, small volumes were used, and the experiment was performed in water after treatment. The BaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment was performed in the same way to achieve equivalent conditions. We omitted the description of the BaCl<sub>2</sub> treatment because it did not affect the interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why were fluorescence intensity values differently normalized for SpiRh1 and the mutant? The same applies to the Gi–coupled rhodopsins. Please use the same normalization throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we created expression data for the tool by incorporating raw data as much as possible. However, due to variations in staining conditions, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and generated data by normalizing all samples as much as possible based on the control RFP (mCherry) expression in Figure 2B and 4A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please explain &quot;luminosity&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We explained the method to analyze heartbeats in the material and methods section as follows: “After opening videos with Fiji/ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), the entire heart was manually set as the region of interest (ROI), and the luminosity (AU: arbitrary units) data in the ROI was used to create graphs of HBs using ggplot2 version 3.2.0 of R. As previously reported (<italic>Matsuda et al. , 2017</italic>), the change in luminosity reflects the HB.” We also explained this in the legend of Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Table 1: Why did you check for cardiac arrest when using SpiRh1? Did you assess an increase in rate/contraction force etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>We examined heart rate broadly and found no significant differences with or without stimulation. In Table 1, we only showed the cardiac arrest ratio. We changed the sentence in the figure legend as follows: “Neither cardiac arrest, bradycardia, nor tachycardia was induced with either 490-510 nm, 530-560 nm (microscope-equipped light source, <italic>n</italic>=100), or 520 nm (LED, <italic>n</italic>=2) light.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Table 1: It seems as if MosOpn3 may induce an effect in neurons. Was this effect significant?</p></disp-quote><p>It was not significant. Thus, we decided not to describe this issue in the Result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1: Please better label axes. The relative response is not sufficient, even if explained in the legend. You may want to add a sketch of the experimental design to facilitate the reader in understanding each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We created a schematic diagram to illustrate the cell culture experiments in Figure 1A. In addition, we included on the y-axis of Figure 1 “intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration” (B, C, and E) and “intracellular cAMP concentration” (D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4: Why did the HB frequency not go down to &quot;zero&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4C shows the average of the heart rate data for six consecutive stimulation trials of four rhodopsin-expressing larvae. The cardiac arrest rate was determined by the ratio of trials in which the HBs stopped due to light stimulation. The latency to cardiac arrest and the time to resumption of HB varied between trials and individuals, and there were instances where a slight HB occurred at any given time. Since these instances were included in the calculation, the average of HB frequency was not zero.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5: Why do you observe almost continuous ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations despite cardiac arrest? What is the underlying mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>As above, Figure 5 shows the average GCaMP6s fluorescence of multiple larvae, and a low value of oscillation was observed when trials that did not stop completely were included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Language:</p><p>– &quot;Light irradiation&quot; and especially &quot;light illumination&quot;, you may want to rephrase; I usually use either &quot;light application&quot; or &quot;illumination&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed “light irradiation” to “light application”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please only use the term &quot;on the other hand&quot; following &quot;on the one hand&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We rephrased “on the other hand” to “in contrast”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please correct &quot;encephalopsin&quot; and &quot;parapinopsin&quot; in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected these terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What do you mean by &quot;relatively close expression levels&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression was misleading. We changed the sentence to: “we established multiple Tg lines and analyzed stable Tg lines (F<sub>1</sub> or later generations) that expressed equally high – but varying – levels of these tools.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
