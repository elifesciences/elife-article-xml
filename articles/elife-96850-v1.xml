The domesticated transposon protein L1TD1, derived from LINE-1 (L1) ORF1p, is an RNA-binding protein that is expressed only in some cancers and early embryogenesis. In human embryonic stem cells, it is found to be essential for maintaining pluripotency. In cancer, L1TD1 expression is highly correlative with malignancy progression and as such considered a potential prognostic factor for tumors. However, its molecular role in cancer remains largely unknown. Our findings reveal that DNA hypomethylation induces the expression of L1TD1 in HAP1 human tumor cells. L1TD1 depletion significantly modulates both the proteome and transcriptome and thereby reduces cell viability. Notably, L1TD1 associates with L1 transcripts and interacts with L1 ORF1p protein, thereby facilitating L1 retrotransposition. Our data suggest that L1TD1 collaborates with its ancestral L1 ORF1p as an RNA chaperone, ensuring the efficient retrotransposition of L1 retrotransposons, rather than directly impacting the abundance of L1TD1 targets. In this way, L1TD1 might have an important role not only during early development but also in tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transposons</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.55776/P34998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seiser</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kavaklioglu</surname><given-names>Gülnihal</given-names></name><name><surname>Seiser</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC59</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mair</surname><given-names>Theresia</given-names></name><name><surname>Egger</surname><given-names>Gerda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004955</institution-id><institution>Austrian Research Promotion Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bridge Early Phase project 5722451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seiser</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016234</institution-id><institution>Austrian-South-East Asian Academic University Network</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ernst Mach Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phan-Canh</surname><given-names>Trinh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA hypomethylation in human tumor cells results in the activation of the LINE-1-derived RNA-binding protein L1TD1 and its interactions with LINE-1 transposons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular domestication of transposable elements (TEs) or TE-derived sequences give rise to novel genes and regulatory sequences in the genome contributing to both genetic and epigenetic variation in an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jangam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smit, 1999</xref>). TEs are key drivers of genome instability, and thus are constantly exposed to silencing mechanisms by the host. Yet, co-option of TEs thorough evolution has created so-called domesticated genes beneficial to the gene network in a wide range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jangam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Modzelewski et al., 2022</xref>). One example of such domesticated gene is LINE-1-type transposase containing domain 1 (<italic>L1TD1</italic>), which is the only domesticated protein-coding gene that originated from LINE-1 (long interspersed element 1 [L1]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaughlin et al., 2014</xref>). Intact L1 retrotransposons are self-propagating by a ‘copy-and-paste’ mechanism known as retrotransposition involving the function of two L1-encoded proteins L1 open-reading frame 1 (L1 ORF1p) and L1 open-reading frame 2 (L1 ORF2p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kazazian and Moran, 2017</xref>). L1TD1 shares sequence resemblance with L1 ORF1p, a nucleic acid chaperone protein with binding capacity to both RNA and DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin, 2006</xref>). L1 ORF1p contributes to the formation of L1 ribonucleoproteins (L1-RNPs), key factors for retrotransposition of L1 elements, but its co-factors are yet to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wallace et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>L1TD1, also named embryonic stem cell-associated transcript 11 (<italic>ECAT11</italic>), is expressed predominantly only in early embryogenesis and germ cells and gets rapidly downregulated upon the exit from pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwabuchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>). Although it is dispensable for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwabuchi et al., 2011</xref>), L1TD1 is essential for the maintenance of human pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Närvä et al., 2012</xref>). In the context of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), L1TD1 regulates translation of a distinct set of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2024</xref>), including core pluripotency factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Emani et al., 2015</xref>), and was recently shown to facilitate the dissolution of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2024</xref>). It has been proposed that during mammalian evolution the <italic>L1TD1</italic> gene was under positive selection due to the function in the maintenance of pluripotency in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaughlin et al., 2014</xref>). Apart from early development, L1TD1 is expressed in certain tumors, including germ cell tumors and colorectal cancers. In this context, L1TD1 was identified as a possible prognostic marker for medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2015</xref>) and colorectal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakroborty et al., 2019</xref>), where its expression is highly correlative with malignancy progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Urh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors are successfully used as anticancer drugs, and recent reports suggest that the lethal response of human tumor cells to these compounds is based to a large extent on the activation of an antiviral immune response to endogenous retroviral transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiappinelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roulois et al., 2015</xref>). DNMT inhibitor treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patient-derived cells resulted in reduced cell viability and up-regulation of L1TD1, indicating an epigenetic control of the <italic>L1TD1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altenberger et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, xenograft tumors with NSCLCs overexpressing L1TD1 showed decreased tumor growth, suggesting a negative impact of L1TD1 expression on tumor viability. In contrast, L1TD1 was shown to be required for cell viability in medulloblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the exact mechanistic function of this domesticated transposon protein in human tumor cells is still unrevealed.</p><p>We have previously discovered that conditional deletion of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in the murine epidermis results not only in the upregulation of mobile elements, such as intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) but also in the induced expression of L1TD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2021</xref>, Table S1). These findings are in accordance with the observation that inhibition of DNMT activity by aza-deoxycytidine in human NSCLCs results in the upregulation of L1TD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altenberger et al., 2017</xref>). Based on the potential role of L11TD1 as prognostic marker, we aimed at elucidating the molecular function of the domesticated transposon protein and its potential role for the control of viability in human tumor cells. To this end, we activated L1TD1 expression by inducing DNA hypomethylation via deletion of DNMT1 in the nearly haploid human cancer cell line HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carette et al., 2011</xref>). First, we found that L1TD1 expression and L1 activation correlate with local DNA hypomethylation. Next, we identified L1TD1-associated RNAs by RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq), which revealed transcripts and proteins with differential expression in the absence of L1TD1 by transcriptome and proteome analyses. We showed that L1TD1 protein binds to L1-RNPs. Importantly, L1TD1 facilitated L1 retrotransposition in HAP1 cells. Our results demonstrated that upon DNA hypomethylation L1TD1 affects gene expression and cell viability, and cooperates with its ancestor protein L1 ORF1p in the control of L1 retrotransposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>L1TD1 expression is activated through DNA hypomethylation in HAP1 cells</title><p>To address the function of L1TD1 in human tumor cells, we generated a defined human tumor cell model. To this end, we used the nearly haploid tumor cell line HAP1 cells that allows efficient gene editing by CRISPR/Cas-9 technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llargués-Sistac et al., 2023</xref>). A HAP1 DNMT1 knockout (KO) cell line has been previously validated for loss of DNMT1 protein and significant reduction in DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smits et al., 2019</xref>). Using this cell line, we examined first the effect of DNMT1 ablation on gene expression. Transcriptome analysis revealed the deregulation of 2385 genes (log2FC &gt;2, adjusted p-value&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The majority of deregulated genes were upregulated and included, in addition to L1TD1, genes with function in transcription and cell differentiation and genes encoding melanoma antigen gene (MAGE) proteins and KRAB domain containing proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The expression of MAGE proteins is restricted to reproductive tissues by chromatin-associated mechanisms, including DNA methylation, and was shown to be upregulated by DNMT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weon and Potts, 2015</xref>). In the context of tumor development, MAGE proteins interact with the transcriptional master regulator and E3 ubiquitin ligase KAP1 (TRIM28), thereby inducing the degradation of tumor suppressor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weon and Potts, 2015</xref>). On the other hand, KAP1 interacts with KRAB domain zinc finger proteins to repress the expression of transposons by chromatin-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ecco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosspopoff and Trono, 2024</xref>). Interestingly, a recent report shows that deletion of the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 in HAP1 cells also results in DNA hypomethylation and upregulation of a similar set of zinc finger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2024</xref>). In addition to these two gene classes, expression of the de novo methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B was significantly upregulated in the absence of DNMT1, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next we analyzed the effect of DNMT1 ablation on DNA methylation of the <italic>L1TD1</italic> gene in HAP1 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, DNA methylation-specific PCR (MethyLight) analysis revealed significantly reduced DNA methylation at the <italic>L1TD1</italic> promoter in DNMT1 KO cells. DNA hypomethylation at the <italic>L1TD1</italic> gene correlated with a strong induction of L1TD1 mRNA and protein expression in DNMT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Similarly, in the absence of DNMT1 the methylation of L1 transposons was reduced and expression of <italic>L1 ORF1p</italic>, the ancestor of L1TD1, was induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA hypomethylation results in the activation of L1TD1 expression and loss of L1TD1 affects cell viability in HAP1 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of DNA methylation levels at the <italic>L1TD1</italic> promoter in HAP1 wildtype (WT), DNMT1 KO, and DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells using the MethyLight assay.

In agreement with their association in protein complexes, indirect immunofluorescence experiments revealed a partial co-localization of L1TD1 and L1 ORF1p in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). In summary, our results suggest that L1TD1 associates with its ancestor ORF1p and this association does not depend on RNA intermediates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>L1TD1 has a positive impact on L1 retrotransposition</title><p>Since L1TD1 associates with <italic>L1</italic> RNA and modulates L1 ORF1p expression, we next asked whether the domesticated transposon protein can impact L1 retrotransposition in HAP1 cells. To this end, we carried out plasmid-based retrotransposition assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kopera et al., 2016</xref>) in DNMT1 KO and DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Following transfection and blasticidin selection, the rate of retrotransposition of the reporter construct was assessed through counting blasticidin-resistant colonies, transfected either with a retrotransposition-competent reporter construct or a retrotransposition-deficient control. To take into account differences in proliferation and blasticidin sensitivity, DNMT1 KO and DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells were transfected in parallel with the blasticidin resistance gene vector pLenti6.2 and the numbers of clones from the retrotransposition assay were corrected for differences in transfection efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). An average of 506 retrotransposition events were observed in DNMT1 KO cells in three independent experiments whereas DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells yielded over fivefold fewer colonies when transfected with the retrotransposition-competent reporter construct (86 retrotransposition events on average) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). No blasticidin-resistant clones were obtained for the backbone vector pCEP4, but comparable effects of L1TD1 on retrotransposition rates were observed for retrotransposition-competent reporter constructs in three independent retrotransposition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Combined, these data suggest that L1TD1 enhances L1 retrotransposition in DNMT1-deficient HAP1 cells and this effect is mediated through the association with L1 ORF1p and <italic>L1</italic> RNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>L1TD1 promotes L1 retrotransposition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of plasmids used for retrotransposition (figure modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kopera et al., 2016</xref> and generated with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://BioRender.com/k03r500">BioRender.com</ext-link>).

Numerous cellular factors have been shown in the past to affect retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariumi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pizarro and Cristofari, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Protasova et al., 2021</xref>). However, many of these proteins are part of host defense mechanisms and restrict retrotransposition, and it was speculated that L1TD1 also limits L1 retrotransposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaughlin et al., 2014</xref>). Unexpectedly, we identified L1TD1 as one of the cellular factors that has a positive impact on L1 retrotransposition, most likely by interacting with L1 RNPs and acting as RNA chaperone. L1TD1 deletion resulted in reduced L1 retrotransposition despite upregulation of L1 ORF1p, indicating that the higher levels of the transposon protein cannot fully compensate the loss of L1TD1. Interestingly, a similar effect has been previously described for the nonsense-mediated decay factor UPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). UPF1 knockdown increased the amount of L1 mRNA and proteins but simultaneously reduced the effectiveness of the retrotransposition. A positive effect of L1TD1 on retrotransposition was recently also observed upon L1TD1 overexpression in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2024</xref>). The L1TD1 protein shares with its ancestor L1 ORF1p the non-canonical RNA recognition motif and the coiled-coil motif required for the trimerization but has two copies instead of one copy of the C-terminal domain (CTD), a structure with RNA-binding and chaperone function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Januszyk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McLaughlin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Naufer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that L1TD1 not only binds to L1 transcripts but also associates with L1 ORF1p in an RNA-independent manner. Both features might contribute to the enhanced retrotransposition frequency. These observations are compatible with a model where L1TD1/ORF1p heteromultimers bind to <italic>L1</italic> RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We hence speculate that the presence of an additional CTD within the L1TD1 protein might thereby enhance the RNA-binding and chaperone function of L1TD1/ORF1p heteromultimers.</p><p>To gain insight into the regulatory function of L1TD1 in tumor cells, we performed RIP-seq, transcriptome, and proteome analyses in HAP1 cells. The RIP-seq approach identified, in addition to the known associated <italic>L1TD1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Närvä et al., 2012</xref>), a defined set of transcripts comprising mRNAs, lncRNAs, and TEs including <italic>L1</italic> transcripts. These findings indicate that L1TD1 has not only inherited its function as RNA-binding protein but also its affinity for transposon transcripts. Recently, Jin et al. published a study on the impact of L1TD1 on the translation in hESCs and identified L1TD1-bound RNAs by CLIP-seq (cross-linking immunoprecipitation-high-throughput sequencing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of L1TD1-associated transcripts in HAP1 cells (69%) identified in our study were also reported as L1TD1 targets in hESCs, suggesting a conserved binding affinity of this domesticated transposon protein across different cell types.</p><p>The same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2024</xref>) showed that L1TD1 localizes to high-density RNP condensates and enhances the translation of a subset of mRNAs enriched in the condensates. Our mass spectrometry data showed that L1TD1 ablation leads to a significantly changed proteome. None of the proteins encoded by the mRNAs associated with L1TD1 showed significantly changed steady state levels in the absence of L1TD1, suggesting that this is not a direct effect of L1TD1 association with the respective mRNAs. However, a subset of L1TD1-associated transcripts encode proteins involved in the control of cell division and cell cycle. Thus, it is possible that subtle changes in the expression of this protein that were not detected in our mass spectrometry approach contribute to the antiproliferative effect of L1TD1 depletion (see below).</p><p>In accordance with the hESC study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2024</xref>), we did not find an overlap between RNAs associated with L1TD1 and their deregulation at the RNA level. This suggests that in HAP1 cells L1TD1 does not have a global effect on RNA stability and translation of its associated RNAs. This is consistent with a recent study on L1 bodies, where RNA processing association of L1 body components did not correlate with RNA stability or translational control of the RNA targets of L1 bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Luca et al., 2023</xref>). Of note, L1TD1 associated with <italic>SINE</italic> transcripts such as AluY and L1TD1 ablation positively affected AluY transposon expression. This relatively young subfamily of SINE elements is still retrotransposition-competent and their mobilization depends on the activity of LINE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roy-Engel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Styles and Brookfield, 2009</xref>). These observations suggest that L1TD1 has not only inherited its function as an RNA-binding protein but also the affinity to <italic>L1</italic> and <italic>SINE</italic> transcripts. L1TD1 association with <italic>AluY</italic> transcripts could potentially be connected to modulation of L1 and SINE-1 transposon activities. It would be interesting to check in future experiments the impact of L1TD1 in Alu retrotransposition reporter assays.</p><p>L1 is one of the few protein-coding transposons that is active in humans and L1 overexpression and retrotransposition are hallmarks of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kazazian and Moran, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mendez-Dorantes and Burns, 2023</xref>). Similarly to the epigenetic control of the ancestral L1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanchez-Luque et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), L1TD1 expression in HAP1 cells is restricted by DNA methylation and DNA hypomethylation induced by DNMT1 ablation results in robust L1TD1 RNA and protein expression. DNMT1 ablation in human colorectal carcinoma cells results in mitotic catastrophe and loss of cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), whereas HAP1 DNMT1 KO cells show increased DNA damage response and apoptosis but are viable. The less severe phenotype of DNMT1 ablation in HAP1 cells might be due to the compensatory up-regulation of DNMT3A and DNMT3B.</p><p>We report here that L1TD1 deletion in DNMT1-deficient cells led to reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis in HAP1 cancer cells. The observation that loss of L1TD1 led to increased apoptosis and DNA damage, but decreased L1 retrotransposition is at first glance unexpected. The positive role of L1TD1 for proliferation might be due to a transposition-independent effects of L1TD1 on the expression of cell cycle regulators as discussed above. Potential deleterious effects of enhanced retrotransposition might be buffered by the upregulation of KRAB domain proteins upon loss of DNMT1. Our findings are in contrast to the negative effect of L1TD1 on cell viability and tumor growth observed in the NSCLC xenograft model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altenberger et al., 2017</xref>), but in accordance with the findings that L1TD1 has a positive impact on cell viability in seminoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Närvä et al., 2012</xref>) and medullablastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting a cancer cell type-specific effect of L1TD1 that might be related to the DNA methylation state of the tumors. Taken together, we present here a novel cellular function for a domesticated transposon protein by showing that L1TD1 associates with L1-RNPs and promotes L1 retrotransposition. This function might have a beneficial effect during early development but could also impact on tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

This revision is much clearer and has improved in terms of logical progression.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have addressed all my questions in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Revised comments:</p><p>A few points we'd like to see addressed are our comments about the model (Figure S7C), as this is important for the readership to understand this complex finding. Please try to apply some quantification, if possible (question 8). Please do your best to tone down the direct relationship of these findings to embryology (question 11). Based on both reviewer comments, we believe addressing reviewer #1s &quot;Suggestions for refinement&quot; (2 points), would help us change our view of solid to convincing.</p><p>Responses to changes:</p><p>Major</p><p>(1) The study only used one knockout (KO) cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9.</p><p>Considering the possibility of an off-target effect, I suggest the authors attempt one or both of these suggestions.</p><p>A) Generate or acquire a similar DMNT1 deletion that uses distinct sgRNAs, so that the likelihood of off-targets is negligible. A few simple experiments such as qRT-PCR would be sufficient to suggest the same phenotype.</p><p>B) Confirm the DNMT1 depletion also by siRNA/ASO KD to phenocopy the KO effect.</p><p>(2) In addition to the strategies to demonstrate reproducibility, a rescue experiment restoring DNMT1 to the KO or KD cells would be more convincing. (Partial rescue would suffice in this case, as exact endogenous expression levels may be hard to replicate).</p><p>We have undertook several approaches to study the effect of DNMT1 loss or inactivation: As described above, we have generated a conditional KO mouse with ablation of DNMT1 in the epidermis. DNMT1-deficient keratinocytes isolated from these mice show a significant increase in L1TD1 expression. In addition, treatment of primary human keratinocytes and two squamous cell carcinoma cell lines with the DNMT inhibitor aza-deoxycytidine led to upregulation of L1TD1 expression. Thus, the derepression of L1TD1 upon loss of DNMT1 expression or activity is not a clonal effect.</p><p>Also, the spectrum of RNAs identified in RIP experiments as L1TD1-associated transcripts in HAP1 DNMT1 KO cells showed a strong overlap with the RNAs isolated by a related yet different method in human embryonic stem cells. When it comes to the effect of L1TD1 on L1-1 retrotranspostion, a recent study has reported a similar effect of L1TD1 upon overexpression in HeLa cells [4].</p><p>All of these points together help to convince us that our findings with HAP1 DNMT KO are in agreement with results obtained in various other cell systems and are therefore not due to off-target effects. With that in mind, we would pursue the suggestion of Reviewer 1 to analyze the effects of DNA hypomethylation upon DNMT1 ablation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for addressing this concern. The reference to Beck 2021 and the additional cells lines (R2: keratinocytes and R3: squamous cell carcinoma) provides sufficient evidence that this result is unlikely to be a result of clonal expansion or off targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Question: Was the human ES Cell RIP Experiment shown here? What is the overlap?</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to the recently published study by Jin et al. (PMID: 38165001). As stated in the Discussion, the majority of L1TD1-associated transcripts in HAP1 cells (69%) identified in our study were also reported as L1TD1 targets in hESCs suggesting a conserved binding affinity of this domesticated transposon protein across different cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) As stated in the introduction, L1TD1 and ORF1p share &quot;sequence resemblance&quot; (Martin 2006). Is the L1TD1 antibody specific or do we see L1 ORF1p if Fig 1C were uncropped?</p><p>(6) Is it possible the L1TD1 antibody binds L1 ORF1p? This could make Figure 2D somewhat difficult to interpret. Some validation of the specificity of the L1TD1 antibody would remove this concern (see minor concern below).</p><p>This is a relevant question. We are convinced that the L1TD1 antibody does not crossreact with L1 ORF1p for the following reasons: Firstly, the antibody does not recognize L1 ORF1p (40 kDa) in the uncropped Western blot for Figure 1C (Figure R4A). Secondly, the L1TD1 antibody gives only background signals in DKO cells in the indirect immunofluorescence experiment shown in Figure 1E of the manuscript.</p><p>Thirdly, the immunogene sequence of L1TD1 that determines the specificity of the antibody was checked in the antibody data sheet from Sigma Aldrich. The corresponding epitope is not present in the L1 ORF1p sequence.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that the ORF1p antibody does not cross-react with L1TD1 (Figure R4B).</p><p>Response: Thank you for sharing these images. These full images relieve concerns about specificity. The increase of ORF1P in R4B and Main figure 3C is interesting and pointed out in the manuscript. Not for the purposes of this review, but the observation of reduced transposition despite increased ORF1P could be an interesting follow up to this study (combined with the similar UPF1 result could indicate a complex of some kind).</p><p>(4) In abstract (P2), the authors mentioned that L1TD1 works as an RNA chaperone, but in the result section (P13), they showed that L1TD1 associates with L1 ORF1p in an RNA independent manner. Those conclusions appear contradictory. Clarification or revision is required.</p><p>Our findings that both proteins bind L1 RNA, and that L1TD1 interacts with ORF1p are compatible with a scenario where L1TD1/ORF1p heteromultimers bind to L1 RNA. The additional presence of L1TD1 might thereby enhance the RNA chaperone function of ORF1p. This model is visualized now in Suppl. Figure S7C.</p><p>Response: Thank you for the model. To further clarify, do you mean that L1TD1 can bind L1 RNA, but this is not needed for the effect, however this &quot;bonus&quot; binding (that is enabled by heteromultimerization) appears to enhance the retrotransposition frequency? Do you think L1TD1 is binding L1 RNA in this context or simply &quot;stabilizing&quot; ORF1P (Trimer) RNP?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our data, L1TD1 associates with L1 RNA and interacts with L1 ORF1p. Both features might contribute to the enhanced retrotransposition frequency. Interestingly, the L1TD1 protein shares with its ancestor L1 ORF1p the non-canonical RNA recognition motif and the coiled-coil motif required for the trimerization but has two copies instead of one of the C-terminal domain (CTD), a structure with RNA binding and chaperone function. We speculate that the presence of an additional CTD within the L1TD1 protein might thereby enhance the RNA binding and chaperone function of L1TD1/ORF1p heteromultimers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 2C fold enrichment for L1TD1 and ARMC1 is a bit difficult to fully appreciate. A 100 to 200-fold enrichment does not seem physiological. This appears to be a &quot;divide by zero&quot; type of result, as the CT for these genes was likely near 40 or undetectable. Another qRT-PCR based approach (absolute quantification) would be a more revealing experiment. This is the validation of the RIP experiments and the presentation mode is specifically developed for quantification of RIP assays (Sigma Aldrich RIP-qRT-PCR: Data Analysis Calculation Shell). The unspecific binding of the transcript in the absence of L1TD1 in DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells is set to 1 and the value in KO cells represents the specific binding relative the unspecific binding. The calculation also corrects for potential differences in the abundance of the respective transcript in the two cell lines. This is not a physiological value but the quantification of specific binding of transcripts to L1TD1. GAPDH as negative control shows no enrichment, whereas specifically associated transcripts show strong enrichement. We have explained the details of RIPqRT-PCR evaluation in Materials and Methods (page 14) and the legend of Figure 2C in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Response: Thank you for the clarification and additional information in the manuscript.</p><p>(6) Is it possible the L1TD1 antibody binds L1 ORF1p? This could make Figure 2D somewhat difficult to interpret. Some validation of the specificity of the L1TD1 antibody would remove this concern (see minor concern below).</p><p>See response to (3).</p><p>Response: Thanks.</p><p>(7) Figure S4A and S4B: There appear to be a few unusual aspects of these figures that should be pointed out and addressed. First, there doesn't seem to be any ORF1p in the Input (if there is, the exposure is too low). Second, there might be some L1TD1 in the DKO (lane 2) and lane 3. This could be non-specific, but the size is concerning. Overexposure would help see this.</p><p>The ORF1p IP gives rise to strong ORF1p signals in the immunoprecipitated complexes even after short exposure. Under these conditions ORF1p is hardly detectable in the input. Regarding the faint band in DKO HAP1 cells, this might be due to a technical problem during Western blot loading. Therefore, the input samples were loaded again on a Western blot and analyzed for the presence of ORF1p, L1TD1 and beta-actin (as loading control) and shown as separate panel in Suppl. Figure S4A.</p><p>The enhanced image is clearer. Thanks.</p><p>S4A and S4B now appear to the S6A and S6B, is that correct? (This is due to the addition of new S1 and S2, but please verify image orders were not disturbed).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the input is shown now as a separate panel in Suppl. Figure S6A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure S4C: This is related to our previous concerns involving antibody cross-reactivity. Figure 3E partially addresses this, where it looks like the L1TD1 &quot;speckles&quot; outnumber the ORF1p puncta, but overlap with all of them. This might be consistent with the antibody crossreacting. The western blot (Figure 3C) suggests an upregulation of ORF1p by at least 23x in the DKO, but the IF image in 3E is hard to tell if this is the case (slightly more signal, but fewer foci). Can you return to the images and confirm the contrast are comparable? Can you massively overexpose the red channel in 3E to see if there is residual overlap? In Figure 3E the L1TD1 antibody gives no signal in DNMT1/L1TD1 DKO cells confirming that it does not recognize ORF1p. In agreement with the Western blot in Figure 3C the L1 ORF1p signal in Figure 3E is stronger in DKO cells. In DNMT1 KO cells the L1 ORF1p antibody does not recognize all L1TD1 speckles. This result is in agreement with the Western blot shown above in Figure R4B and indicates that the L1 ORF1p antibody does not recognize the L1TD1 protein. The contrast is comparable and after overexposure there are still L1TD1 specific speckles. This might be due to differences in abundance of the two proteins.</p><p>Response: Suggestion: Would it be possible to use a program like ImageJ to supplement the western blot observation? Qualitatively, In figure 3E, it appears that there is more signal in the DKO, but this could also be due to there being multiple cells clustered together or a particularly nicely stained region. Could you randomly sample 20-30 cells across a few experiments to see if this holds up. I am interested in whether the puncta in the KO image(s) is a very highly concentrated region and in the DKO this is more disperse. Also, the representative DKO seems to be cropped slightly wrong. (Please use puncta as a guide to make the cropping more precise)</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have quantified the signals of 60 KO cells and 56 DKO cells in three different IF experiments by ImageJ. We measured a 1.4-fold higher expression level of L1 ORF1p in DKO cells. However, the difference is not statistically significant. This is most probably due to the change in cell size and protein content during the cell cycle with increasing protein contents from G1 to G2. Western blot analysis provides signals of comparable protein amounts representing an average expression levels over ten thousands of cells. Nevertheless, the quantification results reflect in principle the IF pictures shown in Figure 3E but IF is probably not the best method to quantify protein amounts. We have also corrected Figure 3E.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96850-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The choice of ARMC1 and YY2 is unclear. What are the criteria for the selection?</p><p>ARMC1 was one of the top hits in a pilot RIP-seq experiment (IP versus input and IP versus IgG IP). In the actual RIP-seq experiment with DKO HAP1 cells instead of IgG IP as a negative control, we found ARMC1 as an enriched hit, although it was not among the top 5 hits. The results from the 2nd RIP-seq further confirmed the validity of ARMC1 as an L1TD1interacting transcript. YY2 was of potential biological relevance as an L1TD1 target due to the fact that it is a processed pseudogene originating from YY1 mRNA as a result of retrotransposition. This is mentioned on page 6 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Response: Appreciated!</p><p>(10) (P16) L1 is the only protein-coding transposon that is active in humans. This is perhaps too generalized of a statement as written. Other examples are readily found in the literature.</p><p>Please clarify.</p><p>We will tone down this statement in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Response: Appreciated! To further clarify, the term &quot;active&quot; when it comes to transposable elements, has not been solidified. It can span &quot;retrotransposition competent&quot; to &quot;transcripts can be recovered&quot;. There are quite a few reports of GAG transcripts and protein from various ERV/LTR subfamilies in various cells and tissues (in mouse and human at least), however whether they contribute to new insertions is actively researched.</p><p>(11) In both the abstract and last sentence in the discussion section (P17), embryogenesis is mentioned, but this is not addressed at all in the manuscript. Please refrain from implying normal biological functions based on the results of this study unless appropriate samples are used to support them.</p><p>Much of the published data on L1TD1 function are related to embryonic stem cells [3- 7].</p><p>Therefore, it is important to discuss our findings in the context of previous reports.</p><p>Response: It is well established that embryonic stem cells are not a perfect or direct proxies for the inner cell mass of embryos, as multiple reports have demonstrated transcriptomic, epigenetic, chromatin accessibility differences. The exact origin of ES cells is also considered controversial. We maintain that the distinction between embryos/embryogenesis and the results presented in the manuscript are not yet interchangeable. An important exception would be complex models of embryogenesis such as embryoids, (or synthetic/artificial embryo models that have been carefully been termed as such so as to not suggest direct implications to embryos). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb2965">https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb2965</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-018-2965-y">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-018-2965-y</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/abstract/S1534-5807(24)00363-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580724003630%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/abstract/S1534-5807(24)00363-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580724003630%3Fshowall%3Dtrue</ext-link></p></disp-quote><p>We have deleted the corresponding paragraph in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Figure 3E: The format of Figures 1A and 3E are internally inconsistent.

We keep the short version L1 ORF1p.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Intro:</p><p>- Is L1Td1 in mice and Humans? How &quot;conserved&quot; is it and does this suggest function? Murine and human L1TD1 proteins share 44% identity on the amino acid level and it was suggested that the corresponding genes were under positive selection during evolution with functions in transposon control and maintenance of pluripotency [8].</p><p>- Why HAP1? (Haploid?) The importance of this cell line is not clear.</p><p>HAP1 is a nearly haploid human cancer cell line derived from the KBM-7 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line [9, 10]. Due to its haploidy is perfectly suited and widely used for loss-of-function screens and gene editing. After gene editing cells can be used in the nearly haploid or in the diploid state. We usually perform all experiments with diploid HAP1 cell lines. Importantly, in contrast to other human tumor cell lines, this cell line tolerates ablation of DNMT1. We have included a corresponding explanation in the revised manuscript on page 5, first paragraph.</p><p>- Global methylation status in DNMT1 KO? (Methylations near L1 insertions, for example?)</p><p>The HAP1 DNMT1 KO cell line with a 20 bp deletion in exon 4 used in our study was validated in the study by Smits et al. [11]. The authors report a significant reduction in overall DNA methylation. However, we are not aware of a DNA methylome study on this cell line. We show now data on the methylation of L1 elements in HAP1 cells and upon DNMT1 deletion in the revised manuscript in Suppl. Figure S1B.</p><p>Response: Looks great!</p><p>(2) Figure 1:</p><p>- Figure 1C. Why is LMNB used instead of Actin (Fig1D)?</p><p>We show now beta-actin as loading control in the revised manuscript.</p><p>- Figure 1G shows increased Caspase 3 in KO, while the matching sentence in the result section skips over this. It might be more accurate to mention this and suggest that the single KO has perhaps an intermediate phenotype (Figure 1F shows a slight but not significant trend).</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and have changed the sentence on page 6, 2nd paragraph accordingly.</p><p>- Would 96 hrs trend closer to significance? An interpretation is that L1TD1 loss could speed up this negative consequence.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have performed a time course experiment with 6 biological replicas for each time point up to 96 hours and found significant changes in the viability upon loss of DNMT1 and again significant reduction in viability upon additional loss of L1TD1 (shown in Figure 1F). These data suggest that as expected loss of DNMT1 leads to significant reduction viability and that additional ablation of L1TD1 further enhances this effect.</p><p>Response: Looks good!</p><p>- What are the &quot;stringent conditions&quot; used to remove non-specific binders and artifacts (negative control subtraction?)</p><p>Yes, we considered only hits from both analyses, L1TD1 IP in KO versus input and L1TD1 IP in KO versus L1TD1 IP in DKO. This is now explained in more detail in the revised manuscript on page 6, 3rd paragraph.</p><p>(3) Figure 2:</p><p>- Figure 2A is a bit too small to read when printed.</p><p>We have changed this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>- Since WT and DKO lack detectable L1TD1, would you expect any difference in RIP-Seq results between these two?</p><p>Due to the lack of DNMT1 and the resulting DNA hypomethylation, DKO cells are more similar to KO cells than WT cells with respect to the expressed transcripts.</p><p>- Legend says selected dots are in green (it appears blue to me). We have changed this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>- Would you recover L1 ORF1p and its binding partners in the KO? (Is the antibody specific in the absence of L1TD1 or can it recognize L1?) I noticed an increase in ORF1p in the KO in Figure 3C.</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. Yes, L1 ORF1p shows slightly increased expression in the proteome analysis and we have marked the corresponding dot in the Volcano plot (Figure 3A).</p><p>- Should the figure panel reference near the (Rosspopoff &amp; Trono) reference instead be Sup S1C as well? Otherwise, I don't think S1C is mentioned at all.</p><p>- What are the red vs. green dots in 2D? Can you highlight ERV and ALU with different colors?</p><p>We added the reference to Suppl. Figure S1C (now S3C) in the revised manuscript. In Figure 2D L1 elements are highlighted in green, ERV elements in yellow, and other associated transposon transcripts in red.</p><p>Response: Much better, thanks!</p><p>- Which L1 subfamily from Figure 2D is represented in the qRT-PCR in 2E &quot;LINE-1&quot;? Do the primers match a specific L1 subfamily? If so, which? We used primers specific for the human L1.2 subfamily.</p><p>- Pulling down SINE element transcripts makes some sense, as many insertions &quot;borrow&quot; L1 sequences for non-autonomous retro transposition, but can you speculate as to why ERVs are recovered? There should be essentially no overlap in sequence.</p><p>In the L1TD1 evolution paper [8], a potential link between L1TD1 and ERV elements was discussed:</p><p>&quot;Alternatively, L1TD1 in sigmodonts could play a role in genome defense against another element active in these genomes. Indeed, the sigmodontine rodents have a highly active family of ERVs, the mysTR elements [46]. Expansion of this family preceded the death of L1s, but these elements are very active, with 3500 to 7000 speciesspecific insertions in the L1-extinct species examined [47]. This recent ERV amplification in Sigmodontinae contrasts with the megabats (where L1TD1 has been lost in many species); there are apparently no highly active DNA or RNA elements in megabats [48]. If L1TD1 can suppress retroelements other than L1s, this could explain why the gene is retained in sigmodontine rodents but not in megabats.&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, Jin et al. report the binding of L1TD1 to repetitive sequences in transcripts [12]. It is possible that some of these sequences are also present in ERV RNAs.</p><p>Response: Interesting, thanks for sharing</p><p>- Is S2B a screenshot? (the red underline).</p><p>No, it is a Powerpoint figure, and we have removed the red underline.</p><p>(4) Figure 3:</p><p>- Text refers to Figure 3B as a western blot. Figure 3B shows a volcano plot. This is likely 3C but would still be out of order (3A&gt;3C&gt;3B referencing). I think this error is repeated in the last result section.</p><p>- Figure and legends fail to mention what gene was used for ddCT method (actin, gapdh, etc.).</p><p>- In general, the supplemental legends feel underwritten and could benefit from additional explanations. (Main figures are appropriate but please double-check that all statistical tests have been mentioned correctly).</p><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected these errors in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(5) Discussion:</p><p>- Aluy connection is interesting. Is there an &quot;Alu retrotransposition reporter assay&quot; to test whether L1TD1 enhances this as well?</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. There is indeed an Alu retrotransposition reporter assay reported be Dewannieux et al. [13]. The assay is based on a Neo selection marker. We have previously tested a Neo selection-based L1 retrotransposition reporter assay, but this system failed to properly work in HAP1 cells, therefore we switched to a blasticidin based L1 retrotransposition reporter assay. A corresponding blasticidin-based Alu retrotransposition reporter assay might be interesting for future studies mentioned in the Discussion, page 11 paragraph 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>(6) Material and Methods :</p><p>- The number of typos in the materials and methods is too numerous to list. Instead, please refer to the next section that broadly describes the issues seen throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Writing style</p><p>(1) Keep a consistent style throughout the manuscript: for example, L1 or LINE-1 (also L1 ORF1p or LINE-1 ORF1p); per or &quot;/&quot;; knockout or knock-out; min or minute; 3 times or three times; media or medium. Additionally, as TE naming conventions are not uniform, it is important to maintain internal consistency so as to not accidentally establish an imprecise version.</p><p>(2) There's a period between &quot;et al&quot; and the comma, and &quot;et al.&quot; should be italic.</p><p>(3) The authors should explain what the key jargon is when it is first used in the manuscript, such as &quot;retrotransposon&quot; and &quot;retrotransposition&quot;.</p><p>(4) The authors should show the full spelling of some acronyms when they use it for the first time, such as RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP).</p><p>(5) Use a space between numbers and alphabets, such as 5 μg. (6) 2.0 × 105 cells, that's not an &quot;x&quot;.</p><p>(7) Numbers in the reference section are lacking (hard to parse).</p><p>(8) In general, there are a significant number of typos in this draft which at times becomes distracting.
