Excitatory postsynapses form and mature on spines composed predominantly of actin, while inhibitory synapses are formed directly on the shafts of dendrites where both actin and microtubules (MTs) are present. Thus, it is the accumulation of specific proteins that characterizes inhibitory synapses. In this study, we explored the mechanisms that enable efficient protein accumulation at inhibitory postsynapse. We found that some inhibitory synapses function to recruit the plus end of MTs. One of the synaptic organizers, Teneurin-2 (TEN2), tends to localize to such MT-rich synapses and recruits MTs to inhibitory postsynapses via interaction with MT plus-end tracking proteins EBs. This recruitment mechanism provides a platform for the exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. These regulatory mechanisms could lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, which are caused by excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalances during synaptogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>adhesion molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) 18K06499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Hirohide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) 22K06805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Hirohide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Takeda Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Research Grants</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iwasaki</surname><given-names>Hirohide</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientist 20K16104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ichinose</surname><given-names>Sotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Teneurin-2, a synaptic organizer, localizes to microtubule-rich inhibitory synapses and recruits microtubules via interaction with end-binding proteins, and this mechanism enables GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors exocytosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons connect to each other via synapses to generate dense neural circuits and exchange information via synaptic receptors to perform various physiological functions. Axon guidance, synaptic specificity, and synaptogenesis are essential processes for establishing functional synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanes and Zipursky, 2020</xref>). Excitatory and inhibitory synapses play distinct roles in information transfer, and their coordination, known as the E/I balance, is crucial for proper brain function; disruptions of this balance can lead to disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maffei et al., 2017</xref>). These two types of synapses differ significantly in their surrounding cytoskeletons. Excitatory postsynapses mainly form and mature on characteristic structures called dendritic spines, which are composed predominantly of actin. Meanwhile, microtubules (MTs) enter almost only in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaworski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McVicker et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, inhibitory synapses are formed directly on the shafts of dendrites, where both actin and MTs can be continuously present. This characteristic is believed to be shared both intra- and extra-synaptically. Therefore, the distinction between inhibitory postsynaptic and non-synaptic membranes is determined solely by the accumulation of inhibitory synapse-specific components, such as the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor Î³2 subunit and gephyrin. The major receptors at inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus are GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors, which are transported by members of the kinesin superfamily, such as KIF5 and KIF21, together with the scaffold protein gephyrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LabontÃ© et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Twelvetrees et al., 2010</xref>). Receptors transported along MTs are exocytosed at different locations by a different mechanism from that of glutamate receptors and then move to the postsynaptic region by lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dahan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). After arriving at the postsynapse, the receptor binds to actin filaments via gephyrin, thereby preventing diffusion. When receptors are no longer necessary, they are endocytosed and transported away by dynein in an MT-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kittler et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, the dynamics of inhibitory postsynaptic components rely significantly on MTs. It is important to note that MTs themselves exhibit dynamic behavior, with their plus ends undergoing continuous polymerization and depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>). Consequently, whether the plus ends of MTs reach their intended destinations becomes a crucial issue for cargo delivery. The repeated accumulation and disappearance of inhibitory synapses at the same location suggests the existence of an âintended destinationâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Villa et al., 2016</xref>). However, the central molecule that defines the intended destination remains unknown. In addition, specific subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are present in non-synaptic regions, contributing to tonic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glykys et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanisms by which these specific components selectively target inhibitory synapses and avoid accumulating in non-synaptic regions are still unclear. Motivated by these intriguing dynamics, we investigated the underlying mechanism.</p><p>Teneurin-2 (TEN2) is a type II membrane protein whose C-terminal resides extracellularly for adhesion and is one of the synaptic organizers that induces synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>). TEN2 has two alternative splicing forms: a splicing insertion-positive (SS+) form with seven amino acids inserted and a splicing insertion-negative (SS-) form with no insertion. SS+ is involved in inhibitory synapse formation, while SS- is involved in excitatory synapse formation. During excitatory synapse formation, the SS- of the presynapse shows specificity by binding to Latrophilin-2/3 in the postsynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, SS+ has been shown to potentially bind to unknown binding partners during inhibitory synapse formation. However, the process of maturing inhibitory synapses is not well understood. Meanwhile, several studies have suggested interactions between the intracellular domain of TEN2 and cytoskeletal molecules. In mammals, the teneurin family has four paralogs (TEN1-4), while in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two teneurin orthologs, ten-a and ten-m. Mutations in ten-a, present in the presynapse, result in abnormalities in MTs, while mutations in ten-m, present in the postsynapse, result in abnormalities in the spectrin skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). In avian visual pathways, TEN2, which can interact with actin in the intracellular domain, is suggested to be expressed during periods that correspond with target recognition and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubin et al., 2002</xref>). However, the specific mechanism by which interactions between these cytoskeletal molecules and synapse organizers contribute to synaptogenesis is not fully understood.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the interaction between synaptic organizers TEN2 and MTs at inhibitory postsynapses provides a platform for the exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. We also highlight the unique subsynaptic signaling systems present at inhibitory postsynapses, which facilitate efficient protein accumulation during synaptogenesis. Disruption of these accumulation systems can lead to an E/I imbalance and psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, making further research in this area highly promising.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibitory postsynapses are clustered into three types according to cytoskeletal molecules</title><p>We aimed to observe and classify the cytoskeletal states of inhibitory postsynapses.

Recently, there has been much interest in the regulatory mechanisms of kinesins, particularly at the plus end of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qu et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to determine whether the MTs in MT-rich postsynapses have their plus-ends, minus-ends, or intermediate lattice parts. To address this, we attempted to determine the polarity of MTs at inhibitory postsynapses using live imaging of end-binding proteins (EBs), which can track the plus end of MTs. Furthermore, to prevent the redistribution of synaptic proteins due to overexpression, we visualized gephyrin by immunostaining after live imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we found that pausing of EB3-EGFP comet was more likely to occur in the dendritic shaft region positive for gephyrin than in the region negative for gephyrin, both in anterograde and retrograde directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). These results suggest a mechanism by which the plus-ends of MTs are enriched at MT-rich inhibitory postsynapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NLGN2 and TEN2 with EB binding motifs localize to MT-rich synapses</title><p>Live imaging of EB suggests the presence of MT recruiters at inhibitory synapses, which may regulate cargo transport by kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qu et al., 2019</xref>). Since the regulation of protein transport and accumulation is linked to the development of synapses, we considered the possibility that synaptic organizers could act as MT recruiters to promote synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To narrow down the candidates of MT recruiters, we performed a motif search for possible binding to EB. This search was based on a previous proteomics study that explored the proteins present in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). Proteins with two motifs proven to bind to EB1, SxÏP, and LxxPTPÏ in the intracellular domain were searched for in the results of the proteomic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). After confirming the location of the motifs, we narrowed the list of seven proteins as candidate molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Neuroligin-2 (NLGN2), immunoglobulin superfamily member 9B (IgSF9b), and TEN2 were tested among these candidates because of their functions as adhesion molecules and antibody availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poulopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sando et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed four-color immunostaining of each candidate along with gephyrin, MAP2, and actin for cluster analysis at DIV 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Using the uniform manifold approximate projection (UMAP) method, we reduced the three variables of synaptic area, MT intensity, and actin intensity. We found that the clustering results were consistent with the preliminary observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), with postsynapse clustering according to whether they were enriched in MAP2 or actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâF</xref>). The postsynaptic area was slightly higher in MT-rich synapse. When we calculated odds ratios for each cluster for NLGN2, IgSF9b, and TEN2, we found that inhibitory postsynapses that were positive for NLGN2 or TEN2 were more likely to be classified in clusters 1 and 3, respectively.

To avoid misidentification due to antibody differences, we generated knock-in mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 system with a 3ÃHA tag inserted just before the STOP codon in exon 29 of TEN2, in addition to generating specific antibodies against the intracellular domain (anti-ICD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâD</xref>). We co-stained primary hippocampal neuronal cultures prepared from this mouse with anti-ICD and anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). The Manders' overlap coefficient indicated that co-localization by these two antibodies was moderate, but both antibodies colocalized with gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the number of synapses identified as positive for TEN2 by each antibody, indicating that either antibody can be used to evaluate TEN2-positive inhibitory synapses. We then evaluated the expression of TEN2 during neuronal development using knock-in neurons. The results showed that detectable levels of TEN2 were not expressed by DIV4, when axon-dendrite polarity is formed, or by DIV7, when dendritic growth is activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> ). By DIV12, when initial synapse formation occurs, TEN2 began to be expressed, and most of the TEN2 at this time was surface-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To overcome this resolution problem, we utilized stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), a super-resolution microscopy (SRM) technique, to observe precise localization. First, to investigate whether TEN2 is present in the inhibitory presynapse or postsynapse, we co-stained cells with anti-ICD antibody and the presynaptic marker Bassoon. In STORM images, there was little overlap between TEN2 and Bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, this result alone cannot rule out the presence of TEN2 in the presynaptic side because the size of the antibody is close to the synaptic cleft (~20 nm), and it does not distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Therefore, we next performed double staining with vGAT, a marker of inhibitory presynapses. vGAT is a membrane protein present in GABA-containing synaptic vesicles, while Bassoon functions as a scaffolding protein in the active zone. By observing vGlut, a membrane protein present in glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles, and Bassoon using dSTORM, the respective localizations near the presynaptic center and just below the membrane could be distinguished in the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreska et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that vGAT as well as vGlut can be used to determine presynaptic location more clearly than Bassoon. Thus, vGAT staining can solve both the problem of antibody size and the problem of distinguishing between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Even in the double-stained STORM images, little overlap between TEN2 and vGAT was observed. In contrast, overlap between TEN2 and gephyrin was observed, indicating the presence of TEN2 at inhibitory postsynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To confirm this result, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">SÃ¶derberg et al., 2006</xref>). In this assay, two antibodies were immunostained, and when they were in proximity (~20 nm), the oligonucleotides fused to the antibodies were ligated to generate circular DNA. Proximity was detected by incorporating a dye into dNTP. The PLA results showed that the proximity of TEN2 and gephyrin was significantly greater than that of normal IgG and gephyrin used as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). Furthermore, to confirm the abundance of TEN2 in dendrites, we performed mixed cultures of knock-in and wildtype neurons and stained them with an anti-HA antibody. The signal intensity of HA was reduced in wildtype dendrites that do not express TEN2 in the cell body, confirming that TEN2 is a protein that is abundant in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1P and Q</xref>). The fact that the signal did not reach zero in wildtype dendrites suggests that TEN2 is present in small amounts in axons surrounding dendrites. These results support the dSTORM data and suggest that our dSTORM images are not affected by signal misalignment between channels due to drift or chromatic aberration. Interestingly, the puncta of TEN2 and gephyrin were not always perfectly colocalized. Therefore, we measured the distance between the centroids of the fluorescence intensity of each punctum and found that they were 85 nm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Considering the width of the inhibitory postsynapse (approximately 500 nm), this distance is not far from the perisynaptic area. Alternatively, this may suggest that TEN2 is specific to a particular nanodomain in the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). These results suggest that TEN2 is more abundant at inhibitory postsynapses and is located primarily away from the center of the synapse in nano-scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>TEN2 provides a platform for the exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory postsynapses to mature synapses</title><p>TEN2 overexpression in non-neuronal cells induces formation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in attached neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). To determine whether TEN2 also induces synapse formation in neuron-neuron interactions, we knocked down TEN2 in primary hippocampal cultures using RNA interference (RNAi). Knockdown was achieved using a vector-based shRNA that contained an shRNA sequence and a fluorescence protein sequence, allowing for the expression of a fluorescence protein as a volume marker. The half-life of TEN2 in rat hippocampal primary culture neurons from DIV11 was reported to be 1.42 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heo et al., 2018</xref>).

There are 19 subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and those localized to inhibitory synapses form a heteropentamer consisting of two Î±1â3 subunits, two Î²1â3 subunits, and one Î³2 subunit, arranged counterclockwise from the extracellular side as Î³2-Î²-Î±-Î²-Î±. Quantification of Î±1, Î±5, and Î³2 subunits was performed. However, Î±5 occasionally formed elongated clusters and could not be quantified as the number of puncta, so it was quantified as the total amount of fluorescence. As a result, only the expression of Î³2 was significantly reduced by TEN2 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). As Î³2 is present in all synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, the significant decrease in gephyrin is thought to be related to the reduction in Î³2.</p><p>To confirm that TEN2 promotes the accumulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, we performed a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assay.

By performing photobleaching over a wide area and observing fluorescence recovery, we monitored the exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The puncta-shaped pHluorin recovered, supporting previous studies that showed that the accumulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors occurs through exocytosis after transport by kinesin, rather than lateral diffusion from the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Twelvetrees et al., 2010</xref>).

Efficient accumulation during synapse formation requires a mechanism for preferential delivery of components to the synaptic region rather than the extrasynaptic region. We decided to examine the hypothesis that efficient transport can be achieved by recruiting MTs to the synapse. First, synapses were classified by the cytoskeleton, and three clusters were identified: MT-rich, actin-rich, and low in either. Additionally, EB3 comets were found to be dissipated at inhibitory synapses, suggesting the presence of MT recruiters in the synapse. Motif searches and quantitative analysis identified the synaptic organizers NLGN2 and TEN2 as candidates for MT recruiters. The present study has since focused on the analysis of TEN2 to confirm its function in accumulating inhibitory postsynaptic components. Super-resolution microscopy, knockdown experiments, and FRAP assays were performed, ultimately demonstrating that TEN2 functions as an organizer by providing a platform for the exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Next, we investigated whether an TEN2-MTs interaction underlies this function. Through pull-down assays and observation of co-localization between TEN2 partial domain and EB, we found that TEN2 interacts with MTs via EBs. We also found that this partial domain functions as a dominant-negative in neurons, inhibiting the binding of endogenous TEN2 to EBs and suppressing inhibitory synapse formation. Based on these results, we conclude that TEN2 interacts with MTs via EBs at inhibitory postsynapses and induces the exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Relationship between TEN2 and exocytosis</title><p>The FRAP assay has shown that TEN2 regulates protein distribution by providing a site for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâJ</xref>). Previous studies have reported that exocytosis of glutamate and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors occurs in different locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). Our study has newly identified the site of exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. However, the detailed mechanisms of this process still require further validation. This is because TEN2N-L alone cannot induce exocytosis simply by interacting with EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These results suggest that TEN2 has additional domains and undergoes conformational changes necessary for exocytosis. The intracellular domain of TEN2, which is over 360 amino acids long, mainly consists of intrinsically disordered regions with no secondary structure, and its flexibility and structural diversity may allow for a variety of functions, including signal transduction.</p><p>The antibodies used in this study provide insight into the question of how TEN2 interacts with EBs. Antibodies targeting the vicinity of the EB-binding motif were successfully generated, but only moderate co-staining was observed when stained with anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1EâH</xref>). This result suggests that, on the one hand, the antibodies may nonspecifically recognize other molecules. On the other hand, assuming that the antibody accurately recognizes only TEN2, it may preferentially recognize specific structures. For instance, an epitope may be open around the nucleus and at synapses but structurally folded or masked at other localities due to interactions with other molecules. It is also noteworthy that only small amounts of TEN2 can bind to EBs, as seen in the pull-down assay. Furthermore, the fact that EB3 live imaging shows EB dispersing at the synapse, despite TEN2 also localizing extrasynaptically, suggests that only specific structures interact with EBs. Such conformational changes favor the EB-binding motifs in the vicinity of the epitope to be open and functional at the synapse. The mechanism by which the EB-binding motif opens and closes has also been demonstrated in the ER membrane protein STIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, to clarify the structural diversity of TEN2, differences in binding molecules, and localization, it will be essential to generate other structure-recognition antibodies and analyze the structure of complexes with interacting proteins.</p><p>We have demonstrated that TEN2 provides a platform for the exocytosis, but we have not yet determined how cargo is released by kinesin and exocytosed. Potential mechanisms for this process include phosphorylation of kinesins, post-translational modifications of tubulin (tubulin code; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>), and MAP-mediated effects on kinesins and MTs (MAPs code; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiken and Holzbaur, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monroy et al., 2020</xref>). However, phosphorylation-based regulation of kinesins poses a challenge for synaptic formation since each protein kinase has a unique distribution pattern, making the problem of how to distribute cargo equivalent to the problem of how to distribute kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichinose et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, regulatory mechanisms involving tubulin status and MAPs-mediated effects only require a single step of interaction between adhesion molecules and MTs, which may simplify the process of distributing cargo.</p><p>For example, recent studies have shown that competition between EB1 and the kinesin KIF1A reduces the affinity between kinesin and MTs, leading to cargo release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guedes-Dias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qu et al., 2019</xref>). Applying this to the transport of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, if TEN2 recruits the plus end of MTs, competition between KIF5 and EB may occur, increasing the probability of KIF5 detachment from MTs. However, it is important to avoid conflicts between âtubulin codeâ and âMAPs codeâ because KIF5 does not readily detach from GTP MTs at the plus end of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakata et al., 2011</xref>). The competition between EB and kinesin may be specific to KIF1A, or there may be signaling within TEN2 that counteracts one of the conflicting codes when both tubulin and MAPs codes are present simultaneously. Thus, detailed domain analysis of the TEN2 side and elucidation of the cargo release mechanism on the kinesin side are essential for explaining the detailed mechanisms in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Undulations of EB comets on kymographs</title><p>In experiments with partial domains, it was observed that TEN2N-L acted as a dominant-negative. Kymographs of neurons expressing TEN2TM or TEN2N-L2mut as controls exhibited undulations, while those expressing TEN2N-L showed counteraction of undulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The cause of the undulations is likely due to weaker capture compared to synapses and may reflect immature regions that will develop into synapses in the future. However, further live imaging of developing synapses over several days is necessary to test this possibility.</p><p>Our findings suggest that TEN2N-L can counteract undulations in the kymograph by activating MT elongation through the increased concentration of EBs recruited by TEN2N-L, which is supported by the biased localization of MTs toward the submembrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Nonetheless, our results also indicate that although endogenous TEN2 recruits EBs, the comet must be disrupted to counteract MT elongation. It is possible that the binding of endogenous TEN2 to its partner molecules as an adhesion molecule antagonizes MT elongation in a kinetic manner. To confirm this hypothesis, measuring the magnitude of the kinetic energy of each molecule in the neuron may be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Analysis of the relationship between synaptic organizers and cytoskeletal molecules</title><p>We investigated the function of TEN2 on the dynamics of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by combining live imaging of EB and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with immunostaining of fixed cells. Based on previous studies, we inferred that synapses that are rich in MTs exhibit active transport of components, while synapses that are rich in actin have stable receptors. Synapses that have fewer of both types of cytoskeletal elements exhibit active lateral diffusion of components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charrier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Giesemann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kittler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LabontÃ© et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakajima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Twelvetrees et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is important to note that all related proteins has dynamic properties. In our study, we observed exocytosis of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by labeling them with pHluorin. However, there are limitations to observing intracellular transport and lateral diffusion using this labeling method. Single-molecule imaging with Qdot is superior to pHluorin for observing lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dahan et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, to fully understand the dynamic relationship between the cytoskeleton and synaptogenesis, it is necessary to simultaneously visualize GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with pHluorin and Qdot while live imaging EBs and Lifeact with fluorescent proteins. However, this approach presents significant challenges, including the mismatch in the required temporal resolution for observing each molecule and the demanding scan speed and spectral separation.</p><p>In addition, it is often problematic that overexpression systems do not accurately reflect the localization of endogenous proteins, as they may undergo protein redistribution and be retained in intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum and proteolytic system. To investigate the gain-of-function effect of TEN2, we attempted to replicate the synapse formation induction assay performed in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sando et al., 2019</xref>) by overexpressing full-length TEN2 in neurons. However, we were unsuccessful as the localization pattern of the overexpressed TEN2 differed from that of the endogenous TEN2. As a result, our research primarily focuses on loss-of-function studies. Nevertheless, it is important to explore aspects of gain-of-function using alternative methods in the future, because they may hold potential for treating psychiatric disorders that arise from excitatory/inhibitory imbalance.</p><p>Since the issue of overexpression is not limited to TEN2, we selected cells with minimal observable expression and performed immunostaining after live imaging to avoid artifacts caused by unnecessary overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>). In the future, labeling endogenous proteins for live imaging will be necessary to overcome this problem. Currently, various knock-in techniques for multiple fluorescent proteins and the development of bright and stable fluorescent proteins that can mimic endogenous protein levels are being investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Droogers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirano et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, although we focused only on TEN2 in this study, it is essential to distinguish other synaptic organizers to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic development and function. For example, there are other molecules with EB-binding motifs besides TEN2, and the functions of their respective intracellular domains are still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Some of these molecules may be functionally homologous, while others may not be. On the other hand, many reports suggest that each organizer selects its binding partner based on differences in extracellular domains, contributing to the formation of dense neural circuits. Whether differences in organizers simply indicate differences in neural circuits or also reflect differences in intracellular signaling is a future focus.</p><p>Thus, to fully understand the input from individual interneurons and their signaling modalities at postsynapses, it will be necessary to perform simultaneous multicolor observations of these organizers, cytoskeletal molecules, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. This approach will allow us to distinguish between the contributions of different molecules to the formation of neural circuits and the modulation of intracellular signaling, providing important insights into the organization and function of synapses. In addition, this approach may enable us to identify specific molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders caused by certain molecular abnormalities, including E/I imbalances. By understanding the roles of different molecules in the development of psychiatric disorders, we may be able to develop more effective treatments for these debilitating conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

using a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing technology onto pronuclear stage embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>). In brief, female C57BL/6 J JAX mice (Charles River; IMSR Cat# JAX:000664, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>) were super-ovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 7.5 units of pregnant mareâs serum gonadotropin (PMSG; ASKA Pharmaceutical), followed by 7.5 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; ASKA Pharmaceutical) 48 hr later. Fifteen hours after the hCG injection, super-ovulated female mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation, and unfertilized oocytes isolated from the female mice were subjected to in vitro fertilization with freshly isolated spermatozoa from euthanized C57BL/6 J JAX male mice, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaneko et al., 2018</xref>). Introduction of Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and single strand oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) into pronuclear stage embryos was carried out using the TAKE method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaneko, 2017</xref>). Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and ssODN were purchased from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies). Mixture of crRNA and tracrRNA was used as guide RNA. Guide RNA and ssODN were designed to insert 3ÃHA tag sequences just upstream from the stop codon of the Tenm2 gene of the C57BL/6 mouse (guide RNA: 5â- <named-content content-type="sequence">GACAGAATGAGATGGGAAAG</named-content>-3â, ssODN: 5â-<named-content content-type="sequence">ACAGTAGCAGCAACATCCAGTTCTTAAGACAGAATGAGATGGGAAAGAGATACCCATACGATGTACCTGACTATGCGGGCTATCCCTATGACGTCCCGGACTATGCAGGATCCTATCCTTATGACGTTCCAGATTACGCTGTTTAACAAAATAACCTGCTGCCACCTCTTCTCTGGGTGGCTCAGCAGGAGCAACT</named-content>-3â, where 3ÃHA tag sequences are underlined). The CRISPR/Cas9 solution contained 50 ng/Î¼L Cas9 protein, 50 ng/Î¼L crRNA, 50 ng/Î¼L tracrRNA, and 100 ng/Î¼L ssODN in Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Super electroporator NEPA21 (NEPA GENE) was used to introduce Cas9 protein, guide RNA, and ssODN into embryos. The poring pulse was set to voltage: 225 V, pulse length: 2.0ms, pulse interval: 50ms, number of pulses: 4, decay rate: 10%, polarity: +. The transfer pulse was set to a voltage: 20 V, pulse length: 50ms, pulse interval: 50ms, number of pulse: 5, decay rate: 40%, Polarity: +/-. The CRISPR/Cas9 solution (45 Î¼L) was filled between metal plates of 5 mm gap electrodes on a glass slide (CUY505P5, NEPA GENE). The embryos placed in line between the electrodes were then discharged. The embryos were then cultured in HTF at 37 Â°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air. On the next day, two-cell embryos were transferred into the oviduct ampulla (40â48 embryos per oviduct) of pseudopregnant ICR (Japan SLC; MGI Cat# 5462094, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:5462094">MGI:5462094</ext-link>) females. All mice generated were genotyped by PCR amplification of genomic DNA isolated from the tip of tail, followed by sequencing. Sequence of the primers used for genotyping were as follows; Tenm2ex29+564 F; <named-content content-type="sequence">CAAGGAGCAGCAGAAAGCCAG</named-content>; Tenm2ex29+871 R; <named-content content-type="sequence">TAAAGCAGCCCGGCCTCAGTG</named-content>. The resulting PCR product was cut by BamHI, and the expected size was 308 bp for wild-type and 254 bp and 147 bp for Tenm2 3ÃHA tag knock-in mice. Mice were backcrossed with wild-type C57BL/6 J at least four times, and at least one of them was with a wild-type male to replace the Y chromosome. Mice were kept in a specific pathogens free environment according to the institutional guidelines of Gunma University. All mice have been genotyped by PCR. These experiments have passed a rigorous ethical review and have been approved by Gunma University for animal experiments (approval number: 20â061) and genetic recombination experiments (approval number: 21â042).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>COS-7 cells (RCB Cat# RCB0539, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0224">CVCL_0224</ext-link>) were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank. It was established by Yakov Gluzman and deposited at RIKEN by Kazuo Todokoro. At RIKEN, Authentic Kit (AGC Techno Glass) was used to confirm the presence of African green monkey-derived cells. This confirmation was based on the band patterns observed after the electrophoresis of cell extracts reacted with five enzymes: LD, NP, G6PD, AST, and MPI. Furthermore, the identification of the animal species was performed by detecting specific sequences of mitochondrial DNA present in the cells using 18SrRNA as an internal control (Fw: <named-content content-type="sequence">CGGGGAATYAGGGTTCGATTC</named-content>, Rv: <named-content content-type="sequence">GCCTGCTGCCTTCCTT</named-content>KGATG) and species-specific primers (Fw: <named-content content-type="sequence">AAATCAAGGCATAGCTTAACGC</named-content>, Rv: <named-content content-type="sequence">GGCCAACTATGGTAGTTATGGT</named-content>, Gene Bank: AY863426.1 as a reference) through PCR analysis. The cells were introduced to our laboratory after authentication (Lot #32). Regular DNA staining tests have confirmed the absence of mycoplasma contamination, and the results have consistently been negative. Cells were cultured in High-Glucose DMEM (FUJIFILM Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWest) in T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at not more than 80% confluency. Hippocampi were dissected from ICR mice (Charles River; IMSR Cat# CRL:022, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_CRL:022">IMSR_CRL:022</ext-link>) or knock-in mice on embryonic day 16 (E16). No gender determination was done, and three or more embryos were used. The hippocampi were digested with 0.25% trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in HBSS (FUJIFILM Wako) for 15 min at 37 Â°C. Dissociated hippocampal cells were seeded at a density of 2Ã10<sup>4</sup> cells per well on Lab-Tek II 8-well chamber coverglasses (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 8 well chamber cover (Matsunami Glass) coated with 0.04% polyethylenimine (Merck) and BioCoat poly-D-lysine (Corning), or at 8Ã10<sup>4</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on Ï12mm circular coverslips (Paul Marienfeld) for electrophysiological experiments. Circular coverslips were sonicated in 1 M KOH for 15 min, washed with ultrapure water, and UV-sterilized before use. All primary cells were cultured in MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 0.6% glucose, 2 mM GlutaMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2% B27 Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 100 U/mL Penicillin-Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were maintained at 37 Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For the full-length EGFP-Teneurin2 clone, partial Teneurin2 from KAZUSA cDNA (NCBI AB032953) and RIKEN cDNA (NCBI AK031198) were amplified by PCR and inserted into pEGFP-C1 or pmCherry-C1 (Takara Bio). The missing part was complemented by a custom gene synthesis (Eurofins Genomics). The protein translated from this plasmid is equivalent to the full-length <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> Teneurin-2 (NCBI NP_001382389), consisting of 2774 amino acids. Note that there are six mutations in our construction as follows: I418V, M431V, V590L, S659A, T720S, and L2384P. They are not located in the intracellular domain. EB1-TagRFP was generated by PCR amplification from KAZUSA cDNA (NCBI AB463888) and inserted into pTagRFP-N (Evrogen). For EB3-EGFP, the EB3 sequence was artificially synthesized (Eurofins Genomics) and inserted into EGFP-N1 (Takara Bio). GST-EB1 and GST-EB3 were amplified by PCR from EB1 and EB3 sequence, respectively, and inserted into the pGEX-6P3 vector (Cytiva). LifeAct-TagRFP was created by inserting a sequence encoding a 17-amino acid peptide derived from yeast Abp140 into the NheI-BamHI site of pTagRFP-N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedl et al., 2008</xref>). pHluorin-GABA<sub>A</sub>RÎ³2 was a gift from Tija Jacob &amp; Stephen Moss (Addgene plasmid # 49170; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://n2t.net/addgene">http://n2t.net/addgene</ext-link>:49170; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_49170">Addgene_49170</ext-link>). The shRNA target sequence was designed for protein knockdown using the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer tool (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cultured neurons were transfected with the High-Efficiency Ca<sup>2+</sup> Phosphate Transfection Kit (Takara Bio), as per the manufacturerâs protocol. Briefly, the culture medium was replaced with fresh MEM containing pyruvate, glucose, and GlutaMAX. Next, a mixture of 2 Âµg of plasmid, 3.1 Âµl of 2 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 Âµl of Hanks equilibrium salt solution was prepared and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The DNA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> phosphate suspension was then added to the culture medium and incubated in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 Â°C for 40 min to 1 hr. After the incubation, the DNA/Ca<sup>2+</sup> phosphate precipitates were dissolved for 15 min with pre-equilibrated medium in a 10% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator before being replaced with the original medium. The minimum detectable fluorescence intensity was selected for analysis, except for the co-localization assay with EB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The TEN2-specific affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a synthetic peptide sequence CSNTSHQIMDTNPDE (Eurofins Genomics) located at the amino acids 203â216 in the intracellular domain with an additional cysteine at the N-terminal. To purify the antibody, SulfoLink Coupling Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a synthetic peptide sequence CQMPLLDSNTSHQIMDTNPDEEFSPNS (GenScript), which corresponds to amino acids 196â222 in the intracellular domain, was used after crude purification of serum with ammonium sulfate. For other antibodies, commercially available antibodies were used, as indicated in Key Resources Table. When immunized animals overlapped and could not be labeled with secondary antibodies simultaneously, labeling was performed by non-covalent antibody labeling kits FlexAble (Proteintech) or Zenon (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturerâs protocol prior to immunostaining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Cells were first washed with PBS at 37 Â°C and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Next, they were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min and blocked with 5 or 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Merck) in PBS for 20 min. Primary antibodies were diluted in Can Get Signal Solution (Toyobo) and incubated with the cells for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Actin was visualized with Alexa Fluor 555 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:200) at the same time as probing with the secondary antibody. For detection of antigens on the membrane surface of live cells, anti-HA antibody was diluted at 1:250 in a culture medium and reacted for 30 min in a cell culture incubator. For detection of total/surface TEN2, an anti-HA antibody pre-labeled with FlexAble was used. Additionally, PFA fixation, detergent permeabilization, blocking treatment, and other primary antibody reactions were carried out as usual, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody. Immunostaining images were mainly acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 880; ZEISS) equipped with a 63Ã/1.4 Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective or an IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with DeltaVision (Cytiva), a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera (Teledyne Photometrics), and a 40Ã/1.35 UApo/340 oil immersion objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>dSTROM</title><p>dSTORM was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with sapphire lasers of 488 nm and 561 nm (Coherent), a 647 nm fiber laser (MPB Communications), and a Plan Apo TIRF 100ÃOil Immersion objective. The perfect focus system (PFS) was used to maintain focus during recording. The observations were conducted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl, 0.1 M MEA, 0.7 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 10% glucose, and 0.034 mg/ml catalase. The observations were taken continuously at 59 Hz for Alexa Fluor 647 and CF568 in that order, and 25,000 images were recorded for each dye. All recordings were drift-corrected, and STORM images were constructed using Nikonâs accompanying analysis software, NIS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Proximity ligation assay</title><p>The proximity ligation assay was performed using DuoLink (Merck) and following the protocol provided by the supplier. Primary antibodies were applied according to the immunostaining protocol described above. PLA Probe Anti-Mouse PLUS (Merck) and PLA Probe Anti-Rabbit MINUS (Merck) were diluted 1:10 and incubated at 37 Â°C for 1 hr. After three washes, oligonucleotides labeled with the two secondary antibodies were ligated with ligase, and DNA was amplified by rolling circle amplification. The newly synthesized DNA was then labeled with Duolink in situ detection reagent green (Merck). After three more washes and a 5 min post-fixation step, neurons were incubated with a secondary antibody against MAP2 for 1 hr. Observations were made after three additional washes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Live imaging and image analysis</title><p>Images were analyzed using FIJI/ImageJ. Live observations were recorded using a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 880; ZEISS) equipped with a 63Ã/1.4 Plan Apochromat oil immersion objective with a resolution of 512Ã150 and a pixel time of 16.48 Âµs. The frame intervals were 2.97 s for EB3-EGFP and 15 s for pHluorin-GABA<sub>A</sub>RÎ³2. During observation, the medium was replaced with Leibovitz L-15 medium (FUJIFILM Wako) and maintained at 37 Â°C in a homemade temperature-controlled chamber. Kymographs were created using the KymoResliceWide plugin (Eugene Katrukha) or Kymograph Clear 2.0 a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mangeol et al., 2016</xref>). Since dendrites have a certain thickness, the analysis was limited to 5 pixels (6.6 Âµm) from the periphery. Out-of-focus areas in the field of view were manually excluded. The detection of comets was automatic in Kymograph Clear 2.0 a and manual in KymoResliceWide. For analysis of GABA<sub>A</sub>RÎ³2, the time-dependent changes in brightness in each ROI were measured by designating the region of interest (ROI) using ImageJ, which had a constant level of pre-bleached pHluorin channel. The overlay of live imaging and fixed image was automatically adjusted for coordinate alignment using ImageJ to maximize the correlation in the overlay channel.</p><p>To correct for differences in the number of gephyrin per neuron, we can calculate the pausing probability of EB comets (<italic>p<sub>GEP</sub></italic>) using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mtext>Â </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Â </mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>l<sub>GEP</sub></italic> is the ratio of gephyrin-positive length (gephyrin positive length / total observation length), and <italic>r<sub>GEP</sub></italic> is the ratio of comets paused in gephyrin-positive regions (number of comets paused at gephyrin / number of total observed comets).

We binarized the TagRFP or MAP2 channels to enhance dendritic visualization and traced the dendrites using the NeuronJ plugin. We quantified the number of gephyrin puncta using the SynapCountJ plugin, which required two images.

After 18 hr, cells were fixed with PFA and cells expressing EB1 in MT pattern were recorded with LSM 880. To exclude regions with no signal and full of noise, EGFP channels were binarized to detect cell morphology, and these were used as regions of interest (ROI). Since the background was sufficiently reduced under these conditions, quantitative analysis was performed using the non-threshold Pearsonâs R value as the correlation coefficient between TEN2 and EB1. For the analysis of TEN2-MAP2 colocalization, neurons expressing EGFP-TEN2 were immunostained with MAP2.

All observed samples were used for statistics, and no samples were excluded. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for normal distribution prior to significance testing. Nonparametric methods were used to analyze samples that were not normally distributed. T-tests were based on the Welch method and did not assume equal variance.

Spontaneous mIPSCs were recorded in the presence of 1 ÂµM TTX, 10 ÂµM NBQX, and 50 ÂµM D-AP5 that block action potential firing and excitatory synaptic currents mediated by AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors, respectively. In this experimental condition, all the recorded synaptic currents were considered as GABAergic, because addition of 40 ÂµM bicuculline, which blocks GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, completely abolished spontaneous synaptic currents (n=3 neurons). The recorded currents were filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at 5 kHz using pCLAMP10 or pCLAMP11 software (Molecular Devices). mIPSCs were detected and analyzed using Igor Pro 8 (Wavemetrics) equipped with NeuroMatic software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/">http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rothman and Silver, 2018</xref>) and custom-written Igor procedures by NH. The algorithm of mIPSC detection was a threshold-above-baseline detector implemented in NeuroMatic software, and continuous 300 s records were used for the event detection. The detection threshold was mostly more than three times the standard deviation of event-free baseline noise, and all the detected events were checked by eye.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>GST pull-down</title><p>Recombinant proteins were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3) (Agilent). The cells were cultured in Lennox LB medium (Merck) containing ampicillin at 37 Â°C and induced with 0.6 mM isopropyl-Î²-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 18 hr at 16 Â°C. The harvested cells were lysed by sonication (UD-201; TOMY DIGITAL BIOLOGY) in a purification buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. The supernatant was then purified using Glutathione 4B Sepharose beads (Cytiva). Brain lysate was obtained from the brains of 4-month-old male knock-in mice after cervical dislocation. Brain was homogenized with a Potter homogenizer in pull-down buffer (20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, pH 7.4) containing Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Merck). The obtained brain lysate was used as the input after centrifugation at 100Ã<italic>g</italic> for 10 min and 20,000Ã<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The purified GST fusion protein and Sepharose beads were equilibrated in the pull-down buffer and then mixed with the input at 4 Â°C for 1 hr under agitation. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with pull-down buffer and then eluted with 2Ãsample buffer. Proteins were denatured by heating samples for 10 min at 95 Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>SDS-PAGE and Western blotting</title><p>SDS-PAGE was performed using homemade gels consisting of a 3% acrylamide stacking gel and a 7.5% or 10% acrylamide running gel. Electrophoresis was conducted under conditions of upper limitations with 30 mA and 250 V for 1 hr. For gel staining, the gel was stained overnight in staining solution (0.25% CBB-R, 10% acetic acid). For western blotting, semi-dry blotting was performed, and the proteins were transferred to a PVDF Immobilon-P membrane (Merck) under constant current conditions of 3.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for 40 min. The membrane was dried completely, then reactivated with methanol and equilibrated with TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween-20). Subsequently, the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk (Morinaga Milk Industry) in TBS-T for 20 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in Can Get Signal Solution (Toyobo). Membrane was incubated with each diluted solution for 1 hr at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, chemiluminescence was performed using Immunostar Zeta (FUJIFILM Wako). Detection and quantification were performed using a LAS4010 imager (Cytiva).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experiments in this study have passed a rigorous ethical review and have been approved by Gunma University for animal experiments (approval number: 20-061) .</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>The results of motif search.</title><p>In order to narrow down the candidates for MT recruiter, a motif search was conducted to investigate the potential binding with EB.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After extensive discussion, it is clear that the authors must perform a number of experiments to strengthen their paper and make substantial textual changes to present their findings in a consistent and valid way. We highly recommend that you address each point of all three reviews and perform the necessary experiments, if feasible, and edit the text accordingly. However, the major experiments agreed upon by all three reviewers are below.</p><p>1. All three reviewers agreed that some of the major overstatements by the authors are also contradictory and these need to be addressed. One major question is how TEN2 is recruiting microtubules to the membrane. Additional experiments are necessary to address this if the authors do indeed believe it is through EB1. It was suggested by the reviewers that since the authors have access to the HA-TEN2 neurons, many of the COS7 cell experiments should be performed in this more relevant neuronal model. In addition, the authors should perform pull-down experiments to show an interaction between TEN-2 and EB1. Ideally, the pull-down assays should be performed from the brain lysates of the HA-TEN2 mouse model.</p><p>2. Reviewer 1 suggested that cargo transport assays, like GABAr trafficking as shown in Twelvetrees et al., 2010 need to be performed to arrive at any conclusion about cargo unloading at TEN-2 sites.</p><p>3. As a proper negative control, TEN2N-L2mut, not TEN2TM, should be used for the experiments presented in Figures 3 and 6.</p><p>4. All three reviewers agreed that the authors should take the advantage of the HA-TEN2 mouse model. First, the authors must validate the model by at least performing colocalization studies between HA and TEN2 antibodies via immunocytochemistry. It should also be straightforward for the authors to discern the subcellular localization of TEN2 (intracellular versus plasma membrane) at each stage/cluster by combining surface and intracellular staining.</p><p>5. All three reviewers agreed that the authors should perform electrophysiology to determine the actual role of TEN2 in a functional context. Please refer to Reviewer 2's comment. If you are not technically able to perform this experiment, please include a statement about this limitation in the paper.</p><p>6. All three reviewers discussed the importance of controlling for the expression levels of all versions of TEN2 because some of the results could be misconstrued if the expression levels of the different constructs are different. Please provide the necessary control western blots.</p><p>7. Please refer to the reviewers' comments on textual changes that will help bolster the findings and strengthen the story. In addition, please display the best images possible for the manuscript. There were concerns that the readers would not be able to see the result stated by the authors in some of the images provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional experiments:</p><p>â While there may be support to the idea that end binding proteins facilitate cargo release in literature, several experiments need to be done by the authors before they can make the same conclusion for TEN-2 and its potential interaction with EB1 in neurons. Firstly, the current evidence for a direct link between EB1 plus ends and TEN-2 in neurons is quite weak and could be strengthened by assaying (a) EB1 dynamics in the shTEN2 and TEN2N-L dominant negative conditions and (b) pull-down experiments to show an interaction between TEN-2 and EB1. Second, cargo transport assays, like GABAr trafficking as shown in Twelvetrees et al., 2010 for example, need to be performed to arrive at any conclusion about cargo unloading at TEN-2 sites.</p><p>Experimental methods:</p><p>â It is unclear how actin is labeled in Figure 1 experiments.</p><p>â The motif search process is well explained in the text of the Results section, it seems unnecessary to devote two separate figures (Figure 1-supplement 2B and figure 1D) to it.</p><p>â In figure 3G, it is unclear which region was used to analyze the number of comets. Was it the entire cell or a predefined ROI?</p><p>â Figure 6D portrays a ratio of neurons, but it is unclear from the text or legends as to what the authors mean by that.</p><p>Writing:</p><p>â MT and MTs are used interchangeably throughout the text. For example, line 22 in the abstract should read &quot;MT recruitment&quot; instead of &quot;MTs recruitment&quot;.</p><p>â The introduction and the Results section repeat the same paragraph: lines 38-42 and lines 93-97 are nearly identical.</p><p>â In the introduction, how the authors arrive at their hypothesis (line 73) is unclear from the writing since there is no reference to the relationship between teneurins and the cytoskeleton from previous work (eg., Mosca et al., 2012).</p><p>â Is there a previous classification of the semi-periphery region of inhibitory post synapses?</p><p>â Reword line 245 to &quot; observed precise localization using a form of super-resolution microscopy (SRM)&quot;.</p><p>â Line 268 &quot;and gephyrin were not always perfectly colocalized&quot;.</p><p>â Line 310 is not supported by evidence.</p><p>â The Discussion section has portions that are not relevant to the results presented and can be cut short.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present paper clearly has potential, but it appears premature in its current form. Although it has documented several interesting findings, there are some loose ends listed below.</p><p>1. The results of knockdown and dominant-negative (DN) approaches suggest that TEN2 is important for inhibitory synapse formation. However, it is necessary to identify which stage(s)/cluster(s) of the inhibitory synapse complex is regulated by TEN2. This should be addressed by the cluster analysis against TEN2 KD and TEN2-DN overexpressed neurons. In addition, it is important to address how extracellular and intracellular TEN2 domains regulate cluster 3 synapse formation. The authors often refer that TEN2 &quot;promotes&quot; receptor accumulation (rows 21, 78, 306, 411) which cannot be addressed just by loss-of-function approaches. The authors should test whether full-length TEN2 overexpression has a gain-of-function effect in cluster 3 synapse formation.</p><p>TEN2N-L2mut, not TEN2TM, should be chosen as a proper negative control. It is recommended to test TEN2N-L2mut in at least a few critical experiments in Figures 3 and 6.</p><p>2. The rationale for testing the HA-TEN2 KI mouse model is weak and I don't think that the authors take the advantage of this mouse model. Performing MT-trapping assay as in Figure 3 to HA-TEN2 KI primary neurons should be able to address the TEN2 function in neurons. The authors hypothesize that TEN2 protein is critical for the transition from cluster 1 to 2. However, it is not clear whether cytosolic or membrane-targeted TEN2 plays a role in this step. It'll be very interesting to identify the subcellular localization of TEN2 (intracellular versus plasma membrane) at each stage/cluster by combining surface and intracellular staining. I do not expect all of these additional experiments to be performed but some further information would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>It is important to perform the proper validation of the HA-TEN2 mouse model.

We highly recommend that you address each point of all three reviews and perform the necessary experiments, if feasible, and edit the text accordingly. However, the major experiments agreed upon by all three reviewers are below.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to thank Dr. Anna Akhmanova, Senior Editor, Dr. Kassandra Ori-McKenney, Reviewing Editor, and the anonymous reviewers for taking the time out of their busy schedules to review our manuscript. Your expertise and insightful feedback were invaluable in shaping the submitted version of the manuscript. Thank you for your diligent efforts and constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. All three reviewers agreed that some of the major overstatements by the authors are also contradictory and these need to be addressed. One major question is how TEN2 is recruiting microtubules to the membrane. Additional experiments are necessary to address this if the authors do indeed believe it is through EB1. It was suggested by the reviewers that since the authors have access to the HA-TEN2 neurons, many of the COS7 cell experiments should be performed in this more relevant neuronal model. In addition, the authors should perform pull-down experiments to show an interaction between TEN-2 and EB1. Ideally, the pull-down assays should be performed from the brain lysates of the HA-TEN2 mouse model.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, live imaging of EBs was performed in the neuron (Figures 1C-H and 7A-E). In addition, pull-down assay was performed using brain lysate of HA knock-in mice to detect the interaction between EB1/3 and TEN2 (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Reviewer 1 suggested that cargo transport assays, like GABAr trafficking as shown in Twelvetrees et al., 2010 need to be performed to arrive at any conclusion about cargo unloading at TEN-2 sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We first performed live imaging of EGFP-GABAARÎ³2 in the neuron (data not shown). We noticed the presence of several types of vesicles, which may contain newly synthesized receptors as well as endocytosed vesicles. We felt that we needed to observe only the newly synthesized receptors. Instead, we performed a FRAP assay with pHluorin-GABAARÎ³2 to detect &quot;exocytotic platforms.&quot; As a result, we were able to observe exocytosis of GABAARÎ³2 at TEN2-positive positions (Figure 4G-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As a proper negative control, TEN2N-L2mut, not TEN2TM, should be used for the experiments presented in Figures 3 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous version of Figure 6 was retested using TEN2N-L2mut together (Figures 7F-H). We have removed the previous version of Figure 3 in order to appropriately incorporate the improved EB1 capture by immobilized TEN2 in neurons as well as COS-7 cells, as mentioned in point #1 above. However, at present, culturing neurons on cover glasses coated with HA-antibody is not feasible due to viability issues. Therefore, this issue remains for future investigation, and alternative methods, such as measuring kinetic force, need to be employed for validation. This matter is also discussed in the Discussion section (line 415-422).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. All three reviewers agreed that the authors should take the advantage of the HA-TEN2 mouse model. First, the authors must validate the model by at least performing colocalization studies between HA and TEN2 antibodies via immunocytochemistry. It should also be straightforward for the authors to discern the subcellular localization of TEN2 (intracellular versus plasma membrane) at each stage/cluster by combining surface and intracellular staining.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for valuable suggestion. We have performed the co-localization analysis of HA and TEN2ICD, as suggested, and the results are presented in Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1E-G. The co-localization is observed to be moderate, which could be attributed to the fact that the anti-TEN2ICD antibody used in the study is a structure-recognition antibody, thereby selectively detecting a specific population of TEN2. Additionally, we have also included the extra/intracellular localization patterns for each developmental stage in Figures 3A-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. All three reviewers agreed that the authors should perform electrophysiology to determine the actual role of TEN2 in a functional context. Please refer to Reviewer 2's comment. If you are not technically able to perform this experiment, please include a statement about this limitation in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we conducted electrophysiological experiments (Figure 5). Our analysis of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) revealed a significant prolongation in the inter-event interval of mIPSCs in TEN2 knockdown neurons. However, we observed no significant difference in the amplitude of mIPSCs between the control and knockdown neurons. These findings suggest that TEN2 knockdown leads to a decrease in the frequency of mIPSCs without affecting the individual synaptic strength.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. All three reviewers discussed the importance of controlling for the expression levels of all versions of TEN2 because some of the results could be misconstrued if the expression levels of the different constructs are different. Please provide the necessary control western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous version, it was suggested that the interpretation of certain data could be confusing due to differences in the expression levels of EGFP-TEN2. We have thoroughly considered this matter, but due to insufficient quantification and reproducibility, we have decided to withdraw these data. However, we have conducted new experiments using live imaging, taking sufficient care for quantification (Figures 1D-H, 4G-J, 7A-E). Therefore, we believe that we can present reliable data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please refer to the reviewers' comments on textual changes that will help bolster the findings and strengthen the story. In addition, please display the best images possible for the manuscript. There were concerns that the readers would not be able to see the result stated by the authors in some of the images provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised both the text and figures, focusing on narrowing down the central points of discussion. We believe that this version adequately meets the requirements and expectations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Additional experiments:</p><p>â While there may be support to the idea that end binding proteins facilitate cargo release in literature, several experiments need to be done by the authors before they can make the same conclusion for TEN-2 and its potential interaction with EB1 in neurons. Firstly, the current evidence for a direct link between EB1 plus ends and TEN-2 in neurons is quite weak and could be strengthened by assaying (a) EB1 dynamics in the shTEN2 and TEN2N-L dominant negative conditions and (b) pull-down experiments to show an interaction between TEN-2 and EB1. Second, cargo transport assays, like GABAr trafficking as shown in Twelvetrees et al., 2010 for example, need to be performed to arrive at any conclusion about cargo unloading at TEN-2 sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you once again for providing constructive suggestions. We have strengthened the evidence by conducting additional experiments, as Reviewer #1 proposed, including observing EB dynamics under TEN2N-L dominant-negative conditions and performing pull-down experiments to demonstrate the interaction between TEN-2 and EB1. However, we determined that it is not appropriate to perform cargo transport assays, such as GABAAR transport in Twelvetrees et al., 2010, because we cannot distinguish between newly synthesized proteins and endocytosed ones. In our study, it is crucial to differentiate between these two vesicles, as mixed quantification could lead the misinterpretation. Therefore, direct observation of cargo unloading from kinesin at TEN-2 sites was not possible. Instead, we evaluated exocytosis at TEN-2 positions using FRAP assays with pHluorin-GABAAR (Figure 4G-J). The results showed a significant increase in GABAAR exocytosis at TEN-2-positive positions. Although we could not provide direct evidence of &quot;cargo unloading,&quot; we should be able to claim that &quot;TEN2 provides a platform for exocytosis.&quot; Therefore, we are reviewing the expression of our claims, including the title.</p><p>Regarding EB1 dynamics in shRNA experiments (we used EB3 in our experimental system due to poor signal/noise ratio for EB1 comet/diffusion in the dendrite), it was not feasible due to the following temporal inconsistencies: It takes 2-3 days for TEN2 knockdown after transfection, but by that time, the expression levels of EB3 have increased, leading to its localization on the MT lattice. Shifting the timing of shRNA and EB transfection (i.e., two-times transfection) decreased cell viability, so it was not possible to implement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental methods:</p><p>â It is unclear how actin is labeled in Figure 1 experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback.

Therefore, we have explicitly mentioned both methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The motif search process is well explained in the text of the Results section, it seems unnecessary to devote two separate figures (Figure 1-supplement 2B and figure 1D) to it.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current version, we have included Figure 2A (previously shown in Figure 1D) only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â In figure 3G, it is unclear which region was used to analyze the number of comets.

Although it has documented several interesting findings, there are some loose ends listed below.</p><p>1. The results of knockdown and dominant-negative (DN) approaches suggest that TEN2 is important for inhibitory synapse formation. However, it is necessary to identify which stage(s)/cluster(s) of the inhibitory synapse complex is regulated by TEN2. This should be addressed by the cluster analysis against TEN2 KD and TEN2-DN overexpressed neurons. In addition, it is important to address how extracellular and intracellular TEN2 domains regulate cluster 3 synapse formation. The authors often refer that TEN2 &quot;promotes&quot; receptor accumulation (rows 21, 78, 306, 411) which cannot be addressed just by loss-of-function approaches. The authors should test whether full-length TEN2 overexpression has a gain-of-function effect in cluster 3 synapse formation.</p><p>TEN2N-L2mut, not TEN2TM, should be chosen as a proper negative control. It is recommended to test TEN2N-L2mut in at least a few critical experiments in Figures 3 and 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestions. We have incorporated cluster analysis to examine the localization tendencies of each synaptic organizer. However, recognizing that cytoskeletal molecules are dynamic and cannot be assessed solely in a fixed state, we conducted a new live imaging experiment to assess the impact of dominant-negative (Figure 7A-E). In knockdown experiments, there was a discrepancy in the time window because knockdown requires 3 days post-transfection, whereas the optimal period for live imaging is 1 day post-transfection. Furthermore, utilizing endogenous proteins is considered ideal. Overcoming these limitations and developing techniques to track the developmental stages of neurons remain challenges within the scientific community. We extensively discussed these matters in the Discussion section (lines 408-413, 425-461).</p><p>Regarding gain-of-function experiments, it seemed feasible to transfer the experiments conducted in non-neuronal cells (previous version of Figure 3 and Sando et al., 2019) to neurons. However, the immobilized TEN2 experiment we conducted in COS-7 cells could not be carried out in neurons due to the significantly reduced cell viability when culturing neurons on antibody-coated cover glasses. Induction of synaptic formation experiments, which are commonly performed using non-neuronal cells, showed that overexpression of TEN2 in neurons led to its retention in the ER, resulting in a different localization than endogenous TEN2. Therefore, determining how to achieve gain-of-function that reflects endogenous functionality remains a challenge.</p><p>We conducted additional experiments using TEN2N-L2mut as a negative control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The rationale for testing the HA-TEN2 KI mouse model is weak and I don't think that the authors take the advantage of this mouse model. Performing MT-trapping assay as in Figure 3 to HA-TEN2 KI primary neurons should be able to address the TEN2 function in neurons. The authors hypothesize that TEN2 protein is critical for the transition from cluster 1 to 2. However, it is not clear whether cytosolic or membrane-targeted TEN2 plays a role in this step.

I do not expect all of these additional experiments to be performed but some further information would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>It is important to perform the proper validation of the HA-TEN2 mouse model. It is essential to present the colocalization of HA and ICD antibody signals in immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting.</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to perform the MT-trapping assay due to the low viability of neurons cultured on antibody-coated coverslips. Therefore, we have postponed the claim regarding the enhancement of microtubule recruitment through the binding of TEN2 with its extracellular binding partner.</p><p>We have demonstrated the surface expression of TEN2 in regions excluding the cell body and proximal dendrites in Figures 3A-D and S3I. Additionally, we have shown that TEN2 provides a platform for GABAAR exocytosis in Figures 4G-J. We assumed in the previous version that the expression of TEN2 on the cell surface is required for the transition from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2, and we believe that this aspect has been demonstrated through the additional experiments. However, as mentioned in point 1 above, we are unable to show whether there is an actual change in the clusters to which TEN2 belongs before and after exocytosis because of different time windows required for live imaging.</p><p>The validation of antibodies was performed through immunocytochemistry (Figure S3E-G), where moderate co-localization was observed. Assuming there is no non-specific detection, it can be said that the antibody specifically recognizes a particular population of TEN2. Unfortunately, this TEN2ICD antibody did not detects TEN2 in Western blotting. These results suggest that the antibody may be a conformation-specific antibody. This is also mentioned in the Discussion section (lines 365-381).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is interesting that shTenm2 has a moderate effect on GABAAR expression. In which cluster are the receptors located? Are they targeted to the plasma membrane or stayed in cluster 1? Performing electrophysiology recording in addition to the cluster analysis should give a clear-cut result to understand the roles of TEN2 in functional inhibitory synapse formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the valuable feedback and the interest in cluster analysis. However, as mentioned above, we did not employ cluster analysis as a crucial tool due to the dynamics of cytoskeletal molecules. Instead, we opted for an alternative approach using FRAP assays with pHluorin-GABAARÎ³2, which led us to interpret that TEN2 acts as a platform for exocytosis (Figures 4G-J). Notably, we observed fluorescence recovery even in TEN2-negative puncta, suggesting the presence of functionally similar molecules. Additionally, our electrophysiological analysis revealed a decrease in the frequency of mIPSCs without affecting their amplitude (Figure 5). This implies the existence of intact synapses that are not dependent on TEN2. Immunostaining of knockdown cells also showed no significant difference in the quantity of Î±1. Therefore, we propose that the impact of TEN2 on exocytosis is specific to certain subunit compositions rather than a general exocytosis. It is this specificity that explains why TEN2 knockdown only results in a moderate loss rather than complete absence of inhibitory synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Although gephyrin puncta are found in all clusters (Figure 1C), it is not clear how gephyrin is transferred in the models presented in Figures 1-supplement 2 and 7. The model should be based on experimental results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.
