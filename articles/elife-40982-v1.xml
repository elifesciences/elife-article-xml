Here, we present a novel platform - Affinity Capture of Polyribosomes followed by RNA sequencing (ACAPseq) - for identifying PPIs. ACAPseq harnesses the power of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to quantify the enrichment of polyribosomes based on the affinity of their associated nascent polypeptides for an immobilized protein ‘bait’. This method was developed and tested using neonatal mouse brain polyribosomes and a variety of extracellular domains as baits. Of 92 baits tested, 25 identified one or more binding partners that appear to be biologically relevant; additional candidate partners remain to be validated. ACAPseq can detect binding to targets that are present at less than 1 part in 100,000 in the starting polyribosome preparation. One of the observed PPIs was analyzed in detail, revealing the mode of homophilic binding for Protocadherin-9 (PCDH9), a non-clustered Protocadherin family member.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>secretome</kwd><kwd>extracellular interactome</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>protocadherin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY018637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>David Labovitz Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nathans</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Affinity capture of polyribosomes followed by RNAseq(ACAPSeq) is a technique that harnesses massively parallel sequencing to identify protein-protein interactions from any source from which polyribosomes can be purified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Current platforms for large scale unbiased identification of PPIs utilize a variety of methods, each of which has strengths and limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Legrain and Rain, 2014</xref>). Mass spectrometry of purified protein complexes provides an unbiased approach to identifying PPIs, but it is limited to relatively high affinity interactions as well as by sample quantity and purity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frei et al., 2012</xref>). Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems use libraries that direct fusion protein expression intracellularly and are therefore not readily applicable to extracellular domains (ECDs), which generally do not fold correctly in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fiebitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rajagopala, 2015</xref>). Direct binding assays using immobilized fusion proteins have high sensitivity but require production, purification, and analysis of hundreds or thousands of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bushell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tom et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Visser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). Identifying PPIs based on a bioassay has high specificity and biological relevance but requires some knowledge of protein function (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Proximity labeling assays, such as BioID, tag nearby proteins but only a subset of these is likely to interact directly with the protein of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernández-Suárez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roux et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schopp et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We have developed an approach to identifying PPIs in which immobilized protein baits are used to capture polyribosomes via their binding to ribosome-associated nascent polypeptide targets. The identities of the targets are revealed by NextGen sequencing of the captured mRNA. This method was inspired by the work of Schimke and colleagues, who developed immuno-affinity capture of polyribosomes as a method for purifying specific eukaryotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palmiter et al., 1972</xref>). Immuno-affinity capture of polyribosomes was subsequently used to enrich several low abundance mRNAs to facilitate their cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korman et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraus and Rosenberg, 1982</xref>). More recently, affinity capture of polyribosomes followed by ribosome profiling has been used to interrogate interactions between nascent polypeptides and chaperones or targeting factors, such as signal recognition particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schibich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Döring et al., 2017</xref>). A further variation on this method, ribosome display, was developed as an in vitro approach for identifying high affinity interactions between libraries of mutant proteins and an immobilized ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zahnd et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Plückthun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schilling et al., 2014</xref>). The ribosome display technique has been further adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2013</xref> for the discovery of PPIs and protein-drug interactions by in vitro transcription, translation, and ribosome capture starting from a normalized collection of human cDNAs, a method referred to as parallel analysis of translated open reading frames (PLATO). ACAPseq is conceptually similar to PLATO.</p><p>In developing ACAPseq, we focused on mammalian protein domains that reside in the extracellular space, because (1) many of these proteins have biologically important interactions, (2) many extracellular binding interactions involve domains that are likely to fold independently (e.g. cadherin, fibronectin, and Ig domains), (3) most single-pass transmembrane proteins, including many cell surface receptors, consist of an amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and a carboxy-terminal intracellular domain (ICD), the optimal arrangement of the ECD for a method that relies on binding in the context of a nascent polypeptide, and (4) most extracellular domains contain one or more disulfide bonds and, in general, these domains do not fold properly in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and are therefore not amenable to yeast or mammalian two-hybrid approaches. Moreover, the potential for poly-valent interactions between several immobilized bait proteins and several nascent polypeptides associated with a single polyribosome suggested that ACAPseq might be useful for identifying relatively weak interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ACAPseq methodology</title><p>Protein baits were produced as secreted human IgG1 Fc fusion proteins following transient transfection of mammalian (HEK/293T) cells, immobilized on the surface of Protein-G-coated magnetic beads, and used to capture polyribosomes prepared from neonatal mouse brain, a tissue that expresses a large and diverse set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Capturing polyribosomes with multiple baits in parallel permitted a comparison of capture efficiencies among different baits, minimized batch effects in library preparation and NextGen sequencing, and was cost-effective since multiple bar-coded libraries could be sequenced simultaneously. Typical RNA yields from ACAPseq capture reactions were in the several nanogram range. In our experience,~10 million RNAseq reads per bait are sufficient for identification of captured mRNAs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40982.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Principle of ACAPseq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for the ACAPseq protocol.

[In this and all other genome browser images, each panel shows the aligned RNAseq read coverage from parallel ACAPseq reactions that started with equal amounts of a common polyribosome stock solution, unless stated otherwise.] EFNA1-Fc specifically captured Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor a5 (Epha5) mRNA, and FLRT3-Fc specifically captured Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor L3 (Adgrl3) mRNA, both of which reside on mouse chromosome 5. The high signal-to-noise ratio for this pair of ACAPseq bait-target combinations is apparent in the genome browser image spanning the entire length of chromosome 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel) and likely reflects the low level of non-specific polyribosome trapping by the non-porous magnetic beads. This result serves as a technical validation, as both interactions have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frisén et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himanen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ranaivoson et al., 2015</xref>). Based on RNAseq read counts, Epha5 and Adgrl3 transcripts were present in the whole brain polyribosome preparation at abundances of 0.014% and 0.080%, and were each enriched ~500 fold by bait capture.</p><p>In the paragraphs that follow, we describe (1) the quality and reproducibility of the primary ACAPseq data using a diverse set of baits, (2) quantitative analyses of ACAPseq performance using genome-wide visualization of capture efficiency and with different thresholds for fold enrichment of target RNAs, (3) validation of a subset of bait-target combinations, and (4) an in-depth investigation of the binding interactions responsible for a novel PPI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ACAPseq with diverse mammalian ECD baits</title><p>Varying the level of either the EFNA1-Fc bait or the polyribosomes over a 25-fold range [0.4, 2, or 10 ml of serum-free conditioned medium (SFCM) containing EFNA1-Fc; and 4, 20, or 100 ug polyribosomes] produced little variation in capture efficiency for multiple bona fide targets, in the present instance Epha3-Epha8 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). The relative insensitivity of ACAPseq to bait levels implies that EFNA1-Fc saturates the magnetic beads at each of these three levels of serum-free conditioned medium. The relative insensitivity of ACAPseq to polyribosome dilution suggests that the affinities of EFNA1 for nascent EPHA receptors is sufficiently high that the polyribosome concentrations used here are also saturating. Another EFNA1-Fc target, HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (Hectd1) mRNA - that is likely a technical artifact since it is a cytosolic protein and the bait is extracellular - showed a dose-dependence for polyribosomes in the same experiment, implying a lower affinity interaction with the EFNA1 bait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Based on these results, standard ACAPseq reactions utilized ~5 – 20 mls of serum-free conditioned medium (corresponding to ~10 ug of bait-Fc), and 40 ug of polyribosomes.

Captured Pcdh9 mRNA also shows a ~ 100 fold enrichment over its starting mRNA abundance.

If we assume that potential binding interactions between PCDH9 and other cadherin/protocadherin targets involve cadherin domains that are close to the amino-terminus and are therefore accessible in the context of the nascent polypeptide, then these data imply that PCDH9 interactions with cadherin/protocadherin family members in the neonatal mouse brain are largely limited to homophilic binding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40982.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ACAPseq with PCDH9-Fc is highly selective for Pcdh9 polyribosomes relative to polyribosomes from other cadherin and protocadherin family members.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ASPs showing PCDH9 vs. EFNA1 capture of mRNA coding for cadherin and non-clustered protocadherin family members (left) and clustered protocadherin family members (right).

In vertebrates, the highest complexity transcriptomes are found in brain and testis. RNAseq data indicate that ~ 16,000 (~70%) of protein-coding genes are expressed in testis, most likely as a consequence of a genome-wide process that resets the chromatin landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>). If most or all of these testis transcripts are translated, then testis-derived polyribosomes might serve as an especially useful starting point for ACAPseq, since the majority of the proteome would be displayed as nascent polypeptides on this polyribosome population. We note that if some genes exhibit sex-limited expression in testis, then this starting material could be systematically biased against genes that are expressed specifically in females.</p><p>When EFNA1-Fc was incubated with adult mouse testis polyribosomes, multiple Epha targets were captured with a high signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), even though most of the Epha targets are present at &gt;10 fold lower abundance in testis compared to brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

First, ACAPseq interrogates the entire repertoire of translated proteins from the tissue of interest, including all splice isoforms, in a single reaction. Second, ACAPseq is extremely sensitive. Starting with 40 ug of polyribosome input, the starting abundance of target mRNAs can be as low as one part in 100,000 (~10 pg mRNA; for example Celsr1 and Flt1). For such rare mRNAs, the amount of specific mRNA captured is ~1 pg. Third, even a modest enrichment (e.g. 20–40 fold) of RNAseq reads in the bait of interest vs. control baits provides a signal that is substantially above background. Fourth, polyribosome capture depends on binding but not on biological function. Fifth, the high valency of the bait-coated magnetic beads and the poly-valent nature of the polyribosome suggest that relatively weak interactions can be detected. Sixth, ACAPseq surveys protein products representing the full range of mRNA transcript diversity in the starting polyribosome population. An analogous survey with high throughput binding to immobilized fusion proteins would require a plasmid collection coding for the full set of protein isoforms for all potential baits. ACAPseq could also be used to explore the effects of naturally occurring genetic diversity on target binding by starting with a genetically heterogenous pool of polyribosomes, for example, by mixing polyribosomes from diverse strains or from different species.</p><p>In its current form, ACAPseq also has limitations, as indicated by (1) the presence of multiple targets that pass the TPM thresholds but are likely to be false positives and (2) the failure of multiple baits to identify known PPIs, that is, false negatives. These are discussed in the paragraphs that follow.</p><p>False positives might have a variety of explanations. First, false positives could reflect interactions with unfolded or partially folded polypeptide targets that might normally be resolved in vivo by chaperones or by interactions with bone fide binding partners but that persist in vitro under ACAPseq binding conditions. Second, false positives could reflect adventitious interactions between proteins that are spatially sequestered in vivo, for example between a secreted protein bait and a cytoplasmic protein target. Third, false positives could arise from a non-optimal setting and/or weighting of threshold parameters. As illustrated by the analysis of sensitivity, specificity, and FDR for VEGF and EFNA1 baits, the number of false positives is highly sensitive to these parameters. The wide range of affinities underlying different PPIs imply that it would be useful to explore different TPM cut-offs or weightings for different baits.</p><p>False negatives might also have a variety of explanations. First, some of the baits may not have a polypeptide binding partner – that is, the negative finding is a true negative. Second, the binding partner might not be expressed at high enough levels (or at all) for its mRNA to be detected. In the present study, this explanation seems particularly plausible for those baits that are not detectably expressed in the mouse brain, including FGF21, HEPACAM2, TIGIT, VSIG1, and VSIG8. Third, the configuration of the bait-Fc fusion protein may not allow bait-target binding, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for VEGF-Fc and NRP1. Fourth, the critical binding domain(s) in the target protein might not be correctly folded in the context of the nascent polypeptide. Studies of several artificial and natural multi-domain proteins have revealed native folding of individual domains while the nascent polypeptides are still associated with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holtkamp et al., 2015</xref>), but the extent to which these observations generalize to the rest of the proteome is not known. Fifth, binding could require co-assembly of two or more polypeptides or could require post-translational modifications that do not occur (or do not occur efficiently) in the context of the nascent polypeptide. For example, post-translational modifications that occur in the Golgi apparatus would be absent from polyribosome-bound nascent polypeptides, which are derived from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Sixth, a PPI could occur with a domain of the target protein that is too close to the carboxy-terminus for efficient binding when the nascent polypeptide is bound to the ribosome. Conveniently, many cell-surface proteins are oriented with their amino-termini facing the extracellular space (type one topology; for example tyrosine kinase receptors), and this is the optimal arrangement for capturing their nascent polypeptides with ECD baits, as used here. Seventh, the ACAPseq signal may be too small to rise above the noise of non-specific interactions. This last point can be appreciated by assessing the signal-to-noise ratio in the ASPs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and it suggests that modifications to the protocol to reduce non-specific sticking and enhance reproducibility of polyribosome capture could reveal both lower affinity interactions and lower abundance mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Prospects for improvements and future applications</title><p>The possibility that bait binding to nascent polypeptides might be limited by protein folding efficiency or post-translational modifications suggests that the addition of chaperones or modifying enzymes to the polyribosome sample might improve ACAPseq performance. Alternately, if unfolded or incompletely folded domains in nascent polypeptides are bound to chaperones and if the chaperone-polypeptide complex occludes access by the bait to adjacent folded domains, then removing chaperones from the polyribosomes might improve ACAPseq performance.</p><p>It will be of interest to determine how well ACAPseq performs with intracellular proteins as baits and with baits that consist of molecules or structures other than single proteins. For example, baits could consist of naturally occurring or synthetic organic molecules or polymers (e.g. carbohydrates), or complex biological structures such as intact viruses, bacteria, or fungi.</p><p>For humans and a small number of model organisms, extensive collections of sequenced cDNA clones currently exist and can be used for biochemical PPI screens, as seen, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al. (2017)</xref>. However, for the vast majority of organisms, including most microbes, plants, and insects, such collections do not exist. ACAPseq may be especially suitable for PPI discovery in these organisms because the nascent polypeptides displayed on polyribosomes present a target pool that approximates the complexity of the entire proteome.</p><p>In sum, ACAPseq is a novel PPI discovery platform that could complement existing PPI discovery platforms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were housed and handled according to the approved Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol MO16M367 of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Bait-Fc plasmids were prepared by cloning the PCR amplified ECD region of the protein of interest into a CMV immediate early region enhancer/promoter-based expression plasmid (pRK5) with a human IgG1 Fc coding region distal to the insert.

The final concentrations in CHB are: 100 ug/ml cyclohexamide, 1 mg/ml heparin, 10 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex, and 1X protease inhibitors. Addition of ribonucleoside vanadyl complex is optional for tissues that have low ribonuclease levels, such as neonatal brain. Resuspension buffer (RB) is identical to CHB except that it lacks ribonucleoside vanadyl complex and sucrose, and it contains 0.5% Igepal-630% and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Binding buffer (BB) is identical to RB, except that it additionally contains 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 250 mM sucrose.</p><p>Neonatal mouse brains were dissected, snap frozen in a tube in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −80°C. For polyribosome preparations, all solutions were ice cold, and samples were kept cold by placing the glass homogenizer and tubes on ice. Centrifuges, centrifuge rotors, and centrifuge buckets were pre-chilled before use. End-over-end rotations and micro-centrifugations were performed in the cold room. Other procedures (e.g., tissue homogenization) were performed outside of the cold room with chilled reagents. All buffers in contact with polyribosomes contained 100 ug/ml cyclohexamide and 1 mg/ml heparin (a general RNAse inhibitor).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Polyribosome preparation</title><p> To prepare polyribosomes from 9 grams of frozen brain tissue, frozen tissue was powdered between two metal blocks chilled with liquid nitrogen or dry ice. This was done by striking the upper block with a hammer. The powdered tissue was homogenized in five volumes (45 mls) CHB, with eight strokes of a homogenizer fitted with a motor-driven Teflon pestle. The pestle was rotated at ~100 rpm during homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 x g in a swinging bucket rotor at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and the nuclear pellet discarded. One-tenth volume each of 10% Igepal-630% and 10% sodium deoxycholate (final concentration of each is 1%) was added to the supernatant and gently mixed at 4°C for 10 min with end-over-end rotation. The detergent solubilized homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected, care being taken to avoid the residual nuclei in the pellet.</p><p>~30 mls of the supernatant was gently loaded onto a two-part sucrose shelf (3 ml of 2.5 M sucrose underneath 1.5 ml of 2.0 M sucrose, each in 25 mM Tris, pH = 7.5, 150 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> with 100 ug/ml cyclohexamide, 1 mg/ml heparin, 1X protease inhibitors, and with 1% each of Igepal-630 and sodium deoxycholate added on the day of the experiment) in an SW28 tube. The location of the sucrose interfaces was marked on the side of each tube, and the tubes were topped off with CHB containing 1% each of Igepal-630 and sodium deoxycholate. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rpm, for 17 hr, at 4°C. At the end of the run, the polyribosomes are present in the 2.5 M sucrose shelf, but are not pelleted to the bottom of the tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraus and Rosenberg, 1982</xref>). We favor the use of a 2.5 M sucrose shelf over the standard polyribosome preparation procedures that produce a pellet of polyribosomes at the bottom the tube because, in our experience, ACAPseq is significantly more efficient if the polyribosomes have not been pelleted. After centrifugation, the supernatant layer was removed with a pipette, the walls of the tube were carefully washed with 3 ml resuspension buffer (RB), and the RB and the 2 M sucrose layer were then removed with a wide-bore pipette tip. Chromatin from residual nuclei in the sample resides in the upper sucrose layer and contributes to its viscosity. The walls of the tube were washed again with 3 ml RB, and then the RB was removed from the top of the 2.5 M sucrose shelf.</p><p>The 2.5 M sucrose layer was transferred to a 50 ml tube, 10 volumes of RB was added to lower the sucrose concentration to 0.25 M, and the sample was mixed well. A 100 ul aliquot was removed, clarified by microcentrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, and 25 ul of the clarified sample used for RNA extraction with the RNAeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) for quality control (gel electrophoresis and optical density) and NextGen sequencing. The remaining ~25 ml of polyribosomes was divided into 1 ml aliquots, snap frozen in a dry-ice ethanol bath, and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Preparation of bait-Fc proteins</title><p> Bait-Fc proteins were produced in serum-free DMEM/F12 supplemented with Hepes, sodium bicarbonate, and penicillin/streptomycin (SFM) when using adherent HEK293T cells, or in Freestyle medium (Thermo-Fisher/Gibco 12338) with penicillin/streptomycin when using suspension cells (HEK293F). Bait-Fc protein production was first tested on a small scale and the yield estimated based on either (1) capturing the bait-Fc from 1 ml of conditioned SFM (SFCM) using Protein-G sepharose beads and analyzing the captured protein on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, or (2) running 10 – 20 ul of SFCM on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-human Fc. Bait-Fc proteins with yields greater than ~0.5 ug/ml were used for ACAPseq.</p><p>For larger scale protein production, 2 – 4 10 cm plates with adherent HEK293T cells or 50 – 100 mls of a suspension culture of HEK293F cells were transiently transfected with the bait-Fc expression plasmid. For adherent HEK293T, cells were transfected at ~80% confluence using polyethyleneimine (PEI). One day after transfection, each plate was washed 3 times with 5 ml of SFM to remove calf serum, before adding 5 ml SFM per plate. Extensive washing is essential to reduce the concentration of bovine IgG, which is ~10 mg/ml in serum and competes for binding to Protein-G magnetic beads. At daily intervals for the next 2 – 3 days, SFCM was collected and replaced with 5 ml fresh SFM per plate. SFCM was stored at 4°C for up to several months after filtering through a 0.2 um filter and adding sodium azide to 0.01%, or at −80°C for longer intervals. The bait-Fc concentration was estimated as described in the preceding paragraph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Capturing polyribosomes on Protein-G magnetic beads. </title><p>Approximately 10 ug of each bait-Fc in SFCM was used to coat Protein-G magnetic beads (75 ul of 30 mg/ml Protein-G Dynabeads; Thermo-Fisher). The Dynabeads were first washed twice with PBS or SFM. For each bait-Fc, washed Dynabeads were incubated with 5 – 20 ml of SFCM overnight at 4°C with end-over-end rotation. The following day, the bait-Fc-Dynabeads were washed once with PBS, transferred to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, and washed once with 1 ml binding buffer (BB).</p><p>Polyribosome capture was generally performed with 8 – 10 baits in parallel, with EFNA1-Fc as one of the baits in each group. Bait-Fc-coated Dynabeads were incubated with polyribosomes (40 ug RNA, determined by OD<sub>260</sub>) in 600 ul BB in a 1.5 ml tube. The tube tops were secured with parafilm and the tubes were rotated end-over-end overnight at 4°C. The next day, the Dynabeads were washed 4 times with BB, and the bound RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Plus Micro Kit. RNA was eluted twice with 11 ul of water. Yields were ~5 ng per sample. Bar-coded libraries for NextGen sequencing (Illumina) were prepared using the Ovation Single Cell RNAseq Library Kit (NuGen). Sequencing was performed with 50 bp single-end reads, and ~10 million reads per library.</p><p>A rough cost analysis for materials includes (1) cell culture plasticware and medium for producing 10 – 30 ug of bait protein, (2) materials for RNA purification, quality control, and small-scale library construction, (4) Illumina sequencing costs for 10 million reads. In 2017, this came to ~$400 per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of RNAseq data</title><p> RNAseq reads were aligned to the GRCm38/mm10 mouse genome using the RSEM-1.3.0 program with the command ~/RSEM-1.3.0/rsem-calculate-expression -p 20 --bowtie2 --bowtie2-path ~/bowtie2-2.2.9 --estimate-rspd --append-names --output-genome-bam --sort-bam-by-coordinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh and Chan, 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kai Zinn (Reviewer #2); Rachelle Gaudet (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Peng and colleagues provides a thorough evaluation of an RNAseq method, which they name ACAPseq, to identify protein-protein interactions using a large panel of extracellular domains of proteins as a test set. The methodology combines pulldown of polyribosomes from frozen tissue using Fc-tagged proteins as bait and the highly-multiplexed mRNA sequencing of the pulldown. Overall the experiments are convincing and the analyses appropriate. As described in the Discussion, this method has both strengths and weaknesses, but when implemented carefully and with understanding of the system's limitations it can provide useful information about potential protein-protein interactions of a protein of interest. Because many of the well-established techniques for discovery of protein-protein interactions do not work well for extracellular proteins, ACAPseq can fill a void in the protein-protein interaction discovery space. The method also has some clear advantages absent from other competing technologies: for example, the ability to link binding to specific splice variants.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We have the following suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) 1209 candidate interactors seems like a lot to examine; but the authors might wish to point out that number is as high as it is mostly because a few baits identify many partners. It is likely that most of the interactions with baits that identify &gt;10 partners are artifacts and indicate that the baits are &quot;sticky.&quot; If you add up all the interactions for baits that identify &lt;10 partners, there are only 187 of those, which is a more manageable number.</p><p>2) The authors might wish to indicate how much the sequencing cost. This looks like a lot of lanes, but I couldn't estimate how many samples were done. The cost of this method might be beyond the resources available to most labs. Related to this, can the authors provide an indication of the throughput? What was the size grouping for sequencing? Did they always sequence a pair (test bait plus EFNA-1 control)? Any recommendations based on their experience?</p><p>3) Two reviewers noted that Figures 9-11 don't really belong in this paper, as they are investigations of the binding sites on some of the candidates. These are probably included because they didn't have data for full papers on APP-CNTN3 (for example) and the other interactions and wanted to have a format in which to publish them. These figures make the paper rather long and unwieldy, and distract a bit from the description of the method. However the reviewers did not insist that they be removed. Perhaps the APP-CNTN3 section, which is particularly long, could be deleted or shortened.</p><p>4) Subsection “ACAPseq with diverse mammalian ECD baits”, second paragraph:</p><p>Supplementary file 1 should include additional columns for (1) database entry code for the relevant cDNA sequence and (2) the corresponding start and end positions of the cDNA (or corresponding translated protein) used in the bait construct.</p><p>5) &quot;… in which domain 2 pairs with itself (in the domain 3 deletion mutant), domain 3 pairs with itself (in the domain 2 deletion mutant)…” etc.: these are unwarranted inferences, because the authors do not know which domain interacts with which domain in their constructs, only that the construct is or isn't sufficient to cause bead aggregation. This paragraph should thus be carefully reworded.

The signal-to-noise challenge is non-trivial, and using a single set of threshold parameters for the entire set of 92 baits, as we did here, is useful for illustrative purposes but is not optimized for the different PPI affinities. A more in-depth analysis with different threshold parameters, as demonstrated for VEGF and EFNA1 in Figure 5, is needed to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio for each bait. For example, using the threshold parameters defined in Supplementary file 1, EFNA1 had 21 candidate PPIs, 7 of which are bona fide partners. Similarly, LPHN1 had 21 candidate PPIs, 5 of which are bona fide partners. Thus, a cut-off of &lt;10 partners, as suggested by the reviewer, would have eliminated these PPIs. We have expanded this section of the text to clarify these issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors might wish to indicate how much the sequencing cost. This looks like a lot of lanes, but I couldn't estimate how many samples were done. The cost of this method might be beyond the resources available to most labs. Related to this, can the authors provide an indication of the throughput? What was the size grouping for sequencing? Did they always sequence a pair (test bait plus EFNA-1 control)? Any recommendations based on their experience?</p></disp-quote><p>Those are good points. Costs include cell culture materials for production of 10-30 ug of bait protein and protein-G magnetic beads, which total ~$100 per bait. RNA purification and library preparation reagents cost ~$200 per sample. We sequence ~10 million reads per sample. 150 million reads on an Illumina NextSeq500 costs $1400, and, therefore, ~10 million reads costs ~$100. That adds up to ~$400 per bait for all material costs. We typically capture polyribosomes with 8-10 baits in parallel, and we always include a control EFNA1-Fc sample in the group. We have now added this information to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Two reviewers noted that Figures 9-11 don't really belong in this paper, as they are investigations of the binding sites on some of the candidates. These are probably included because they didn't have data for full papers on APP-CNTN3 (for example) and the other interactions and wanted to have a format in which to publish them. These figures make the paper rather long and unwieldy, and distract a bit from the description of the method. However the reviewers did not insist that they be removed. Perhaps the APP-CNTN3 section, which is particularly long, could be deleted or shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a fair critique. We have now removed the APP-CNTN3 experiments from the manuscript (text, 2 figures, and 1.5 supplemental figures). The APP-CNTN3 site-directed mutagenesis experiments are less central to the overall body of work. Additionally, APP-CNTN3 is a PPI that has been previously reported. We will publish it separately. However, we would like to keep the PCDH9 experiments in the paper as this is a previously unreported PPI, and the follow-up experiments are a nice validation showing that low affinity PPIs can be detected by ACAPseq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “ACAPseq with diverse mammalian ECD baits”, second paragraph:</p><p>Supplementary file 1 should include additional columns for (1) database entry code for the relevant cDNA sequence and (2) The corresponding start and end positions of the cDNA (or corresponding translated protein) used in the bait construct.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have added that information to the revised Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;… in which domain 2 pairs with itself (in the domain 3 deletion mutant), domain 3 pairs with itself (in the domain 2 deletion mutant)…” etc.: these are unwarranted inferences, because the authors do not know which domain interacts with which domain in their constructs, only that the construct is or isn't sufficient to cause bead aggregation. This paragraph should thus be carefully reworded. A more conservative conclusion: it seems that the data in Figure 11 suggest that construct pairs in which a domain 1 – domain 4 interaction is possible have the strongest binding?</p></disp-quote><p>Good points. We have reworked the text to describe the inferences more carefully, as indicated.</p></body></sub-article></article>
