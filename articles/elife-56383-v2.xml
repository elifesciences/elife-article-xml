of daughters that leave the niche to differentiate. We discovered a mechanism of stem cell niche exit in the canonical <italic>C. elegans</italic> distal tip cell (DTC) germ stem cell niche mediated by previously unobserved, thin, membranous protrusions of the adjacent somatic gonad cell pair (Sh1). A disproportionate number of germ cell divisions were observed at the DTC-Sh1 interface. Stem-like and differentiating cell fates segregated across this boundary. Spindles polarized, pairs of daughter cells oriented between the DTC and Sh1, and Sh1 grew over the Sh1-facing daughter. Impeding Sh1 growth by RNAi to cofilin and Arp2/3 perturbed the DTC-Sh1 interface, reduced germ cell proliferation, and shifted a differentiation marker. Because Sh1 membrane protrusions eluded detection for decades, it is possible that similar structures actively regulate niche exit in other systems.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stem cells have the rare ability to divide and specialize into the many different types of cells necessary for an organism to survive. For instance, germ stem cells can multiply to produce precursor cells that go on to become eggs or sperm needed for reproduction.</p><p>When a stem cell divides, the daughter cells can either remain ‘naïve’, or start to specialize into a given cell type. In many cases, this decision is strongly influenced by the properties of the environment that surrounds the stem cell. However, in the microscopic worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, how the daughters of germ stem cells specialize was thought to be a random process, with nearby cells equally likely to specialize or remain naïve.</p><p>In this animal, germ stem cells reside in tube-shaped structures called gonads, which are enclosed by a large ‘distal tip’ cell. In addition, cells known as Sh1 surround the gonad. Here, Gordon et al. tracked dividing germ stem cells in the gonads of live worms. This revealed that both the distal tip cell and Sh1 cells have finger-like extensions that form contacts with the germ stem cells. The fate of dividing germ stem cells is shaped by these interactions. If they touch only the distal tip cell, they remain in a naïve state. However, if they contact both the distal tip cell and an Sh1 cell, one daughter of the stem cell becomes an egg precursor – with the daughter closest to the distal tip cell staying naïve. In fact, germ stem cells that are prevented from contacting Sh1 cells divide less often.</p><p>Many other types of stem cells, for example in human skin, are believed to make the decision to remain naïve or undergo specialization randomly. The results from Gordon et al. could provide a roadmap to discover hidden layers of control in other organisms, some of which may be potentially relevant in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell niche</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd><kwd>gonadal sheath</kwd><kwd>distal tip cell</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>niche exit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM079320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherwood</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 MIRA GM118049</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sherwood</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM121015-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Kacy L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A previously undetected dynamic cell structure orients the mitotic spindle of germ stem cells and grows over one daughter cell, thus helping to balance niche retention with niche exit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells and their associated supportive niche cells are centrally important to development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murry and Keller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhu and Huangfu, 2013</xref>), homeostatic tissue maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>), aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rao and Mattson, 2001</xref>), regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sánchez Alvarado and Yamanaka, 2014</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reya et al., 2001</xref>), and tissue engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ruder et al., 2011</xref>). For this reason, the ways in which a niche anchors and signals to its stem cells is an area of active inquiry. Balance must be struck between retaining a sufficient pool of stem cells in the niche and generating a robust population of stem cell descendants that go on to differentiate. Therefore, the question of how stem cell progeny leaves the niche in a regulated fashion is likewise important, but has been less intensely studied. Most of what is known about stem cell niche exit is understood in the context of how the niche retains the self-renewing stem cell daughter rather than how the differentiating daughter escapes the influence of the niche. Examples include stochastic displacement in the mammalian intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van der Flier and Clevers, 2009</xref>), migration in the larval tracheal system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Krasnow, 2014</xref>), oriented division to a basal lamina in the mammalian epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>), and oriented division to the niche cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line is supported by a canonical stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubbard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lander et al., 2012</xref>) called the distal tip cell (DTC). Because of the ease of visualization and experimental manipulation, many general principles have been obtained by analysis of this simple system, including the first demonstration of stem cell niche properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimble and White, 1981</xref>). The genetics controlling stemness and differentiation are very well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubbard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kimble and Seidel, 2013</xref>), and a cell biological understanding of the system is growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Linden et al., 2017</xref>). The adult DTC has a jellyfish-like appearance, with a flattened cell body at the distal end and long trailing processes that extend proximally and enwrap germ cells, including the presumptive stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Byrd et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon et al., 2019</xref>). The germ line is partially syncytial, with membrane-bound germ cell bodies connected to a common cytoplasmic core (the rachis) by narrow bridges of cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirsh et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Seidel et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the cytoplasmic connections that facilitate the sharing of intracellular fate determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), the germ line segregates cell fates across its distal-proximal axis, with germ cells undergoing meiosis proximal to the undifferentiated germ cells dividing stochastically in the distal ‘progenitor zone’. The progenitor zone is approximately 20 germ cell diameters long (~100 μm) and contains 243 + / - 25 cells in one-day adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>). A subset of the progenitor zone germ cells makes up the germ stem cell pool. The DTC niche expresses the Notch ligands LAG-2 and APX-1 that activate Notch signaling in the germ stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henderson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nadarajan et al., 2009</xref>). It has been hypothesized that divisions within the stem cell population simply push daughters out of the niche to eventually differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rosu and Cohen-Fix, 2017</xref>), however stem cell progeny breaking contact with the niche have not been visualized. Previous work by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Linden et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that a simple distal-to-proximal model of stem cell position does not take into account the effect of DTC geometry on Notch activation. When the DTC is asymmetrically shaped, only the germ cells closest to it express a Notch reporter, and other equally distal germ cells lack reporter expression, suggesting that close proximity to the DTC rather than distal position defines stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Linden et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, while downstream effects of localized Notch signaling on germ cell stemness vs. differentiation are well understood, how the niche-stem cell association is organized and how it terminates and releases germ cells to differentiate given the complex and varied niche geometry is not known.</p><p>Proximal to the DTC, the remainder of the somatic gonad comprises five pairs of gonadal sheath cells that lie between the germ cells and the gonadal basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). Sheath cell pair 1 (Sh1) covers germ cells in the distal gonad, with one cell on its superficial surface closer to the cuticle and the other on the deep surface closer to the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). Between the distal boundary of Sh1 and the DTC, a ~ 20 germ cell diameter-long (~100 μm) ‘germ line bare region’ has been described, in which germ cells are thought to contact the gonadal basement membrane directly, not somatic cells. This germ line bare region makes up the entire progenitor zone outside of the distalmost cells under the DTC. Evidence for the bare region comes from scanning EM of dissected gonads and cytoplasmic GFP expressed in the gonadal sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). How the differentiating germ cells navigate the putative somatic cell void between the DTC and Sh1 cells is unclear.</p><p>We set out to investigate the process by which germ cells break their contacts with the DTC niche and interact with the other cells of the somatic gonad. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, live cell time-lapse imaging, and RNAi-mediated gene knockdown to probe the relationships among germ cells, the DTC, and Sh1 sheath cells. Unexpectedly, we discovered that thin membranous processes from the Sh1 cells extend distally and intercalate among undifferentiated germ cells and the processes of the DTC, with soma contacting nearly every germ cell. There is no germ cell bare region. As a result, germ cell divisions take place in three anatomical compartments—in contact with the DTC niche alone, at the DTC-Sh1 boundary, and in contact with Sh1 alone. Divisions on the elaborate interface between the DTC and Sh1 are more frequent and are polarized, with daughters segregating between them, suggesting a mechanism for germ cell niche exit via the first documented asymmetric cell divisions in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line. Sh1 actively grows over and between daughter cells that divide at the interface in an Arp2/3- and cofilin-dependent manner, which strengthens the association between one daughter cell and the sheath. When Sh1 was impeded from growing towards the DTC by RNAi against actin regulators, the dividing populations at the boundary and under Sh1 were reduced and a marker of differentiation was shifted in the same direction as the Sh1 cell, suggesting that distal Sh1 cell processes assist stem cell niche exit. We conclude that Sh1, a cell neighboring the niche, is an overlooked regulator of adult stem cell niche dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The stem cell niche is closely apposed to Sh1</title><p>To investigate how the elaborate DTC germ line stem cell niche interacts with other cells in the gonad we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dickinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>) to endogenously tag cell membrane-localized gap junction proteins (INX-8 and INX-9) that were previously found to be expressed in the DTC and the gonadal sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>inx-8</italic> and <italic>inx-9</italic> genes are genetically redundant with both single mutants fertile and the double mutant sterile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Starich et al., 2014</xref>). As innexins have not been endogenously tagged with genetically encoded fluorophores previously, we used this <italic>inx-9(ok1502)</italic> mutant allele to ascertain function of the <italic>inx-8</italic> genome-edited alleles. We found that a homozygous C-terminal-tagged <italic>inx-8::mCherry</italic> in an <italic>inx-9(ok1502)</italic> mutant background was sterile. However, a homozygous N-terminal-tagged <italic>mKate2::inx-8(qy102)</italic> in this mutant background was fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We used the sequence similarity between the genes to tag the <italic>inx-9</italic> locus in the same N-terminal position. The atomic structure of another <italic>C. elegans</italic> innexin, INX-6, has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oshima et al., 2016</xref>); the N-terminus of <italic>C. elegans</italic> INX-6 is extracellular, flexible, and located in the pore of the gap junction. If INX-8 and INX-9 have the same structure, this means the fluorescent tags (from multiple monomers in a hexameric hemichannel) are linked to extracellular extensions from the pore of the gap junctions formed by tagged INX-8 or tagged INX-9.</p><p>Upon coexpression of each of these tagged innexins with a DTC membrane marker and examination by live-animal confocal microscopy, we observed expression in the DTC and in the gonadal sheath. Unexpectedly, we found that the long cellular processes of the DTC niche cell were directly bordered by membranous extensions from Sh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), contrary to the accepted model of gonad anatomy with a bare region separating DTC and Sh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lints and Hall, 2018</xref>). We verified this pattern with another endogenously tagged protein that localizes to the membrane, integrin α subunit INA-1::mNeonGreen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jayadev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and by crossing our mKate::INX-8 strain to a strain expressing cytoplasmic GFP (<italic>tnIs6(lim-7p::GFP)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 1999</xref>]) to reveal that the Sh1 membrane protrusions can extend farther distal than the brightest cytoplasmic GFP signal in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A revised model positions the DTC and Sh1 intercalating among the distal germ cells in the stem cell zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

The anterior and posterior DTCs are born from the second division of the gonad primordium cells Z1 and Z4.

We found that the larval Sh1 cells were thin, elongated, irregular cells that extended away from the midline over the germ cells and reached towards the DTC with at least one long, thin projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, arrows); the DTC sent at least one reciprocal projection back to touch Sh1 (n = 27/28 gonad arms have DTC and Sh1 in apparent contact). These thin projections persisted as the forming gonad made its first (n = 16/17) and second (n = 10/10) turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). By the end of L4, the Sh1 came to rest with a smooth distal boundary approximately one germ cell diameter from the DTC, which typically extended one or more short, thin projections that touched or nearly touched the distal Sh1 boundary (n = 14/17 within one germ cell diameter at the end of migration).

The DTC transformed from its high, narrow larval cap morphology to a broad, thin, distended structure with proximal projections. As the DTC elaborated, Sh1 filled in the gaps between extending DTC processes (n = 13/14 young adults, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) instead of residing in the middle of the distal arm of the gonad as was previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Korta and Hubbard, 2010</xref>). It has been hypothesized that the distal boundary of Sh1 would need to treadmill over germ cells to counter the distal-to-proximal movement of the underlying germ cells from the distal stem cell zone towards the bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 1999</xref>). We found support for this hypothesis from time-lapse imaging of Sh1 and the DTC (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). While the DTC was sometimes observed to stretch proximally, Sh1 almost always (n = 12/13) appeared to rapidly remodel its edges, moving both towards and away from the DTC on a scale of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations suggest Sh1 is a more active cell than the DTC, which changes shape on a slower time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Time course analysis of the same cells revealed that Sh1 persisted in the distal zone well into adulthood (n = 18/18 animals 73 hr post L1 arrest, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> bottom). Taken together, these results indicate that cellular extensions from the Sh1 cells interdigitate with the processes from the DTC as the DTC elaborates and are then present in this interlaced pattern during adulthood.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nearly every germ cell contacts the DTC, Sh1, or Both</title><p>Because Sh1 extensions are interlaced among DTC processes, we postulated that they likely interact with the actively dividing germ cells in the progenitor zone, including perhaps even germ stem cells in the DTC niche.

Since the DTC is necessary and sufficient to maintain a mitotic germ cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimble and White, 1981</xref>), these contacts could directly inform the regionalization of the mitotic zone into stem cells and mitotic cells that have lost their stemness.</p><p>To examine germ cell-somatic cell associations in the progenitor zone, we generated worms with fluorescent cell membrane markers of the germ cells, DTC, and mKate2::INX-8 marking Sh1.

We focused only on the superficial portion (~10 μm deep) of each gonad arm because resolution and brightness diminish when imaging deeper. Viewed at 1000x magnification, we observed an average of 70 undifferentiated germ cells in the superficial distal gonad (n = 26 distal gonad arms). The DTC alone contacted an average of 17 germ cells in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Sh1 alone contacted an average of 40 germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The territory in which dividing germ cells are found (the progenitor zone) contains three groups of dividing cells (uncovered germ cells in 3A and 3B were not found in substantial numbers and were not observed dividing). Previous research suggests the cells directly in contact with the DTC are stem cells, but we now can resolve two groups—those contacting the DTC alone (yellow) and DTC-Sh1 interface cells (magenta). The remaining dividing cells are outside the niche and in contact with Sh1 alone (cyan). Based on frequent divisions that segregated one daughter cell under the Sh1 in DTC germ cells that divided at the DTC-Sh1 boundary, we hypothesized that DTC-Sh1 interface cells might divide asymmetrically and thereby allow stem cell daughters to leave the niche.

Because some of these divisions did not resolve during the time-lapse interval or sunk out of the plane of focus, 64 were scored further (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All 64 divisions ended with at least one daughter cell directly beside or under the Sh1 cell. In most of these cases (56/64) one daughter remained under the DTC or at the interface and the other ended up under or beside Sh1, suggesting a polarized division. In the rare instances in which both daughter cells stayed at the DTC-Sh1 interface (8/64 divisions), the divisions still appeared polarized between the DTC and Sh1, but irregular cellular projections from these cells extended the DTC-Sh1 interface beyond the division plane such that both cells remained at the interface. Intriguingly, in 26/64 cases, Sh1 actively grew during the time-lapse interval to cover the closest daughter or grew into the cytokinetic furrow between the daughters to enwrap the closest daughter (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Given that our results suggested that the DTC-Sh1 interface promoted proliferation, we next assessed the effect of Sh1 and the underlying germ cells by perturbing its position with <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi. The undifferentiated germ cells at the distal end of the gonad in the progenitor zone are sometimes called ‘mitotic’ germ cells because of their cell fate (they are not in meiosis, as differentiated germ cells are). Mitotic germ cell nuclei are smaller and less bright by histone fluorescence than meiotic germ cell nuclei, and reside distal to the crescent-shaped nuclei of the meiotic ‘transition zone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hubbard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> magenta arrows). However, the mitotic fate must not be conflated with active mitotic events; germ cells can fail to proliferate but also remain undifferentiated (or ‘mitotic’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seidel and Kimble, 2015</xref>). We hypothesized that if distal Sh1 is pro-proliferative (due to its association with most observed cell divisions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), its mispositioning by RNAi would cause fewer active divisions in the progenitor zone. Indeed, the average number of actively dividing cells in the progenitor zone in age-matched control animals was 2.29, while the average number of dividing cells in <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi animals was 1.37 at the endpoint 48 hr after RNAi exposure beginning in the early L4 (n = 31 control, n = 35 experimental, linear mixed model: F<sub>1, 62</sub> = 5.46813, Tukey post-hoc test p&lt;0.05). While just 5/31 control animals lacked active cell division, 14/35 <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi animals lacked active cell division (chi-squared = 4.5694, p&lt;0.05). The lengths of the progenitor zones were not different between the <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi-treated animals and control. However, because Sh1 was shifted so profoundly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the amount of the mitotic germ line covered by Sh1 was dramatically reduced (linear mixed model: F<sub>1, 62</sub> = 42.566, Tukey post-hoc test p&lt;0.005). While the control animals had about 29 μm of undifferentiated germ cells in contact with Sh1, after treatment with <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi on average no undifferentiated germ cells contact Sh1. RNAi against <italic>unc-60</italic> can cause germ cell defects under certain exposure conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ono et al., 2008</xref>). However, the RNAi-treated animals still had normally sized progenitor zones, normally elaborated DTCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and a number of visibly dividing germ cells.</p><p>We assessed the positions and somatic cell contacts of these dividing cells as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The numbers and positions of actively dividing germ cells in contact with the DTC alone are similar in the control and <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, yellow solid and hashed), indicating that the RNAi treatment did not dramatically affect divisions of germ cells in the DTC plexus. Among the animals with active divisions (ignoring the 40% of RNAi-treated animals that lack dividing cells entirely), the control (n = 46/26 or 1.77 DTC divisions/animal) and treatment (n = 38/21 or 1.81 DTC divisions/animal) groups had roughly equivalent average numbers of DTC-associated divisions. However, the number of DTC-Sh1 interface divisions was dramatically different between control (n = 23/26 or 0.88 DTC-Sh1 divisions/animal) and treatment (n = 5/21 or 0.24 DTC-Sh1 divisions/animal), since the interface was greatly reduced. We never observed a germ cell dividing without contact to a somatic cell.</p><p>Finally, we examined GLD-1::GFP expression in animals after <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–G</xref>). In this experiment, we again observed a stringy Sh1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, compare to control in 7D) and a robust proximal displacement of the distal Sh1 boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, compare to Sh1 distance in 7B). Additionally, we observed a small (~8 μm) but significant (Welch two-sample t-test, p&lt;0.001) shift of the distal boundary of GLD-1::GFP expression in the direction that Sh1 shifted. From this we infer that Sh1, while not required for differentiation, helps germ cells differentiate by maintaining its distal position, possibly by competing with the DTC niche for germ cell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the dividing population of undifferentiated, Sh1-associated germ cells are nearly eliminated when Sh1 is mispositioned, leading to an overall deficit of germ cell proliferation and regulated exit from the niche, suggesting that Sh1 is an important but overlooked regulator of germ cells in the progenitor zone.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic depicting DTC-Sh1 interface germ cell division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DTC (yellow) and Sh1 (cyan) contact germ cell membranes (magenta lines) in the distal gonad.

Tubulin spindles (red, Step two and Step 3) and Arp2/3 (orange, Step 2–4) transiently localize in germ cells and Sh1, respectively.

Only by studying stem cells and their associated support cells in vivo can we understand how this balance is regulated. Challenges of in vivo imaging have recently been overcome in the zebrafish larval hematopoietic niche, mammalian epidermal stem cell niche, and mouse intestinal crypt, revealing important behaviors such as ‘endothelial cuddling’ of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tamplin et al., 2015</xref>), different rates of division across stem cells and their daughters, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rompolas et al., 2012</xref>), and different trajectories for stem cells depending on their position within the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ritsma et al., 2014</xref>). By developing genome-edited alleles to act as in vivo cellular markers in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad, we made the surprising discovery that some cells in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line stem cell niche divide in an asymmetric manner towards a niche-adjacent cell. Germ cells that contact this cell instead of the niche have begun to differentiate. This discovery raises the possibility that facilitated niche exit is part of the repertoire of cellular behaviors that regulate the balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation and a new player to a canonical stem cell niche system.</p><p>It was previously thought that a germ line bare region extended over most of the progenitor zone, with the Sh1 cells contacting only differentiating germ cells in the adult. By generating endogenously tagged alleles of somatic gonad-expressed innexins, we have demonstrated that adult Sh1 cells extend much farther distal than was previously understood. They contact putative stem cells in the progenitor zone and grow distally into this zone against the proximal flow of germ cells in an Arp2/3- and cofilin-dependent manner. The sheath is known to interact with and promote proliferation of larval germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCarter et al., 1997</xref>), to interact with differentiating adult germ cells to facilitate exit from meiotic pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCarter et al., 1997</xref>), and to phagocytose physiologically apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2012</xref>). It was not thought to contact the progenitor zone in the adult. Our results demonstrate not only that Sh1 processes extend into the progenitor zone, but also that Sh1 plays an important role regulating adult stem cells and their progeny. A somatic gonad cell directly bordering the DTC is also observed in the filarial nematode <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Landmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foray et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility that this cellular arrangement and function are widespread within the clade. During larval development, Sh1 develops in close contact with the DTC niche, implying an intimate relationship between the niche and its neighboring somatic cells as well.</p><p>By performing live-cell imaging of cell divisions at the border of the DTC and Sh1 we revealed that while this population comprises a minority of progenitor zone cells, it is more proliferative than cells under the DTC alone or Sh1 alone. As we observed this excess of DTC-Sh1 interface divisions, we noted that dividing cells polarized their spindles between the DTC and Sh1 and divided asymmetrically between them, often with Sh1 actively extending over the nearest daughter. Such divisions were the only times we observed germ cells lose contact with the DTC to exit the niche—we never saw spontaneous growth of Sh1 over a non-dividing cell, nor displacement of germ cells from the niche by distal-to-proximal pushing produced by other cells dividing entirely under the DTC. Previous lineage tracing of germ stem cells and their progeny as they leave the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rosu and Cohen-Fix, 2017</xref>) revealed that progenitor zone cells move very slowly, with photoconverted populations being displaced about five germ cell diameters over 8 hr. Coupled with the slow rate of division in this population (about 1% of adult germ cells dividing at any given time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roy et al., 2016</xref>]), we think it is reasonable that our time-lapse imaging captured the full range of movements made by the cells in the progenitor zone. Based on these observations, we propose a simple model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) for germ cell exit from the stem cell niche: germ cells at the DTC-Sh1 interface divide asymmetrically, with one daughter remaining anchored to the DTC and the other becoming enwrapped by Sh1. Those stem cell daughters that maintain their connections to the DTC would comprise an anchored, <italic>sygl-1p::</italic>H2B::GFP positive, asymmetrically dividing stem cell population, while those associating with Sh1 are set on a path to differentiation and dramatically increase levels of GLD-1::GFP. Our results show that Sh1 is not required for germ cell differentiation—GLD-1::GFP is visible in germ cells in the gap between the DTC and Sh1 when Sh1 is shifted proximally—much as we would expect given that differentiation is still observed in the reduced germ cell pools of sheath-ablated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCarter et al., 1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Killian and Hubbard, 2005</xref>). Instead, we hypothesize that Sh1 promotes differentiation indirectly through its positional exclusion of the DTC from germ cells born from polarized interface divisions (thus allowing these daughter cells to escape the influence of the DTC, which maintains stem cell fate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Since cells born from polarized divisions that contact Sh1 lack DTC-contact-mediated Notch signaling from birth, they can then derepress meiosis-promoting factors and initiate differentiation.</p><p>Our findings also have implications for the organization of the progenitor zone of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line. The three somatic cell-associated compartments—DTC, DTC-Sh1 interface, and Sh1—may host three types of progenitor cell divisions: symmetric-stem cell renewing (under the DTC), asymmetric (at the DTC-Sh1 interface), and symmetric-differentiating (or transit-amplifying, under Sh1 alone), which might be comparable to the ‘mixed mode’ of stem cell division that acts in the mammalian epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rompolas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This layer of Sh1 control needs to be studied in the context of other factors that influence germ cell proliferation and their increasingly appreciated regulation by age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cinquin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kocsisova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seidel and Kimble, 2015</xref>) and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Most of what we know about how stem cell progeny leave the niche is understood as the absence of the mechanisms that retain the self-renewing stem cell daughter in the niche, be that oriented division to a basal lamina in the mammalian epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Poulson and Lechler, 2010</xref>) or to niche cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Casanueva and Ferguson, 2004</xref>) or stochastic displacement in mammalian intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van der Flier and Clevers, 2009</xref>) and epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doupé et al., 2010</xref>). One study that specifically addresses how stem cell progeny leave a niche found they do so by migration in the larval tracheal system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Krasnow, 2014</xref>), a very different mechanism to the one we observe in this study. Cells outside the niche had previously been known to guide stem cell progeny only after they leave the niche. For example in the larval trachea of <italic>Drosophila,</italic> stem cell progeny follow external cues as they migrate from the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Krasnow, 2014</xref>), and in adult mammalian neurons, niche-adjacent cells send differentiation cues to stem cell progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). Some niche-adjacent cells limit the range of niche cues to restrict the stem cell population, like the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis cyst cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). Active processes like Sh1 segregating the nearest daughter may take place in other cases of niche exit that appear stochastic, like the mammalian intestinal niche in which ‘border cells’ are thought to be passively displaced from the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ritsma et al., 2014</xref>). Similar niche-infiltrating structures may not have been discovered because of the difficulty of observing thin, membranous cellular structures deep inside tissues in vivo that also may not survive dissection or fixation necessary for observing them by immunostaining or electron microscopy, as in the case of cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</xref>). Given the consequences of failing to maintain stem cells and failing to provide sufficient progeny for homeostatic tissue maintenance, mechanisms that balance niche exit with niche retention may be important but overlooked features of many stem cell niches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Kacy L.

The plasmid was coinjected with sgRNA+Cas9 plasmid into N2 animals, and genome-edited animals were selected by hygromycin B treatment and phenotypic identification (roller).

While the germ cell membrane maker was helpful in determining whether a germ cell bare region exists, it was ultimately dispensable for inferring germ cell-somatic cell associations in the presence of a germ cell nuclear marker due to the tight packing of germ cells and the close intercalation of the somatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Time-lapse imaging</title><p>Worms were anesthetized with 0.02% tetramisole in M9 buffer for 15 min prior to mounting on 4% noble agar pads with coverslips sealed with valap and flooded underneath with 0.02% tetramisole to prevent drying (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gerhold et al., 2015</xref>, which used 0.04% tetramisole and grooved agarose pads). We found that tricaine and sodium azide, two commonly used worm anesthetics, caused germ cell divisions to cease. Acquisition intervals were set for every five minutes, but the relatively light anesthetic meant that some worm movement still occurred, and pauses to reposition the field of view were occasionally necessary. We found that lowering the laser power of the 402 nm and 488 nm lasers helped decrease spontaneous worm movement and photobleaching. Animals with cell divisions that did not progress were not analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microscopy and image acquisition, processing, and analysis</title><p>Confocal DIC and fluorescent images were acquired on an AxioImager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an EMCCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics), a 100x or 40x Plan-Apochromat (1.4 NA) objective, and a spinning disc confocal scan head (CSU-10; Yokogawa Electric Corporation) driven by μManager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>) at 20°C, except <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>, which were acquired on a Leica DMI8 with an xLIGHT V3 confocal spinning disk head (89 North) with a 63x Plan-Apochromat (1.4 NA) objective and an ORCA‐Fusion Gen‐III sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics). Worms were mounted on 4% noble agar pads containing 0.01 M sodium azide for imaging during endpoint experiments. Images were processed with FIJI 2.0 and Photoshop CC (Adobe Systems Inc). Images are displayed as single confocal z-slices or maximum intensity projections generated in FIJI, as noted. Supplemental videos were generated with FIJI. Graphs generated by R and MS Excel were refined using Illustrator CC (Adobe Systems Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Timed RNAi</title><p>We performed timed RNAi by feeding on worms carrying a DTC membrane marker (<italic>lag-2p::mTagBFP::PLC<sup>δPH</sup></italic>) the <italic>inx-9(qy79)</italic> GFP-tagged allele and the <italic>nasi2(mex-5p::H2BmCherry)</italic> transgene marking germ cell nuclear histones. We did not expose animals to L1 larval RNAi for fear that early knockdown of actin associated proteins might lead to arrest of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ono et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ono et al., 2003</xref>). To circumvent the early defects caused by their loss of function, we applied post-embryonic RNAi by feeding starting at the early L4 larval stage. By the time RNAi knockdown is achieved, gonad migration is complete. Worms were terminally anesthetized in 0.01 M sodium azide and imaged after 48 hr on RNAi (in the second day of adulthood). Note that these animals are ~24 hr older than most of the other worms shown in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurements of RNAi-treated gonads</title><p>Gonad images were measured in FIJI for the length of the longest continuous DTC process, length of the mitotic zone, and distance of distal Sh1 from the distal end of the gonad. Mitotic figures and their positions relative to the fluorescently labeled somatic cells were noted. Germ cells were assessed for their general condition (germ cell number, large germ cells, gaps among germ cells, etc.) and the Sh1 cell was assessed for its condition (normal or stringy). We noted variation in the extent of germ line damage due to <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi knockdown, with one replicate showing highly abnormal distal germ lines (as noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ono et al., 2008</xref>) with gaps among the misshapen germ cell nuclei presumably caused by the collapse of the rachis and the failure of cytokinesis, which both require proper actin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Priti et al., 2018</xref>). In this replicate, germ cell nuclear size was a more reliable marker of the end of the proliferative zone than nuclear crescent shape. The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are pooled from three replicates of exposures starting on three consecutive days for a total of 31 control animals and 35 <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi-treated animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification</title><p>Dividing germ cells were identified by chromatin condensations at metaphase and anaphase; their distance from the distal tip of the gonad was measured in FIJI. Distal gonads encompassed by the field of view at 1000x magnification do not always contain the entire progenitor zone, so our estimates of the numbers of undifferentiated germ cells in contact with Sh1 alone is conservative. This distal field of view did contain the DTC-Sh1 interface in every non-RNAi-treated animal in the study. Germ cell-somatic cell contacts were scored by eye, and typically only germ cells in the superficial layer were counted, as deeper contacts are more ambiguous. Angles of dividing cells, the gonad axis, and the shortest path through the dividing cell from DTC to Sh1 were measured in FIJI and analyzed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> schematic. The angles were expressed as the acute angle between the lines shown. RNAi scoring could not be meaningfully blinded because of the strength of the phenotypes, although the dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> was nominally blinded before acquisition and unblinded after scoring. Sample sizes were evaluated a posteriori for statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Scoring of differentiation markers</title><p>Genomically encoded fluorescent markers were used to analyze cell fate asymmetry across the DTC-Sh1 boundary. The marker of a stem-like fate is <italic>sygl-1p::H2B::gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kershner et al., 2014</xref>), and we set a threshold in the images to exclude all residual GFP below the expression level of the distal most cells, based on findings that the <italic>sygl-1</italic> gene is actively transcribed in a distal subpopulation but its transcripts perdure in more cells further proximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). We analyzed whether every part of the DTC was in contact with <italic>sygl-1p::H2B::GFP</italic> (+) cells—in most cases, DTCs had long processes that extended proximal to the proximal boundary of <italic>sygl-1p::H2B::GFP</italic> expression. Then we analyzed the region of overlap between Sh1 and <italic>sygl-1p::H2B::GFP</italic> (+) cells, and found it confined to the DTC-Sh1 interface. The marker of the differentiating fate is a <italic>gld-1p::gld-1::GFP</italic> transgene (<italic>ozIs5;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner and Schedl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schumacher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Seidel et al., 2018</xref>). Looking only at the green channel with the DTC marker and GLD-1::GFP, we examined the farthest distal perinuclear GFP speckles that we could detect in the germ line, and marked their position in the image. We also marked the length of the longest DTC process. We then turned on the red channel and noted the position of the distal extent of Sh1. These data are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This manuscript by Gordon et al., describes germline stem cell divisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and provides compelling evidence that GSCs, which have been believed to be maintained at a population level, may divide asymmetrically to create one stem cell and one differentiating cell. This changes a long standing paradigm in the field. The study is well conceived and executed beautifully. The authors addressed the reviewer comments well, and I believe the manuscript is ready for publication.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Stem cell niche exit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> via orientation and segregation of daughter cells by a cryptic cell outside the niche&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yukiko M Yamashita as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Senior Editor, Utpal Banerjee. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dave Hansen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we decided that we cannot consider the publication of your manuscript in its current form.</p><p>However, all the reviewers are very enthusiastic about your fascinating observation, and see the potential of breakthrough in the field. Converged concern of reviewers is that the current manuscript does not provide the evidence for 1) Sh1 promoting germ cell differentiation, 2) germ cell division at the border of DTC-Sh1 being truly asymmetric (with respect to the cell fate).

They provide series of very intriguing observations describing how undifferentiated cells physically interact with DTC and Sh1, leading to their proposal that Sh1 creates the microenvironment that promote differentiation. They found that Sh1 cells form thin protrusions that interdigitate with DTC protrusions, where germ cells divide at a high frequency in an oriented manner. This is potentially a significant advancement to the field, but I felt that certain claims are not well supported at this point. The following are the main points that I feel need to be more strongly supported.</p><p>Although the authors postulate that Sh1 contact stimulates “niche exit” and thus differentiation of germ cells, they show no evidence that Sh1 indeed promotes differentiation. Although it has been well established that DTC is the niche component, and thus by the extension of logic, Sh1, which exhibits mutually exclusive positional pattern, would correlate with differentiation. However, no evidence is presented that Sh1 indeed plays any roles in differentiation. I don't necessarily think that they have to go too far showing signaling mechanism etc that is elicited by Sh1, but they need to show something that demonstrates Sh1's role in differentiation.</p><p>Germ cells that are contacting DTC and Sh1 have disproportionally high incidence of division. They further observed that division orientation of these cells is biased such that one daughter will remain attached to the DTC, and the other attached to Sh1. This is certainly a very interesting observation but it remains unclear why division must be promoted there, and why they divide asymmetrically (promotion of cell proliferation and potentially asymmetric division are two entirely distinct process, which do not have to be tied together). Also, other than the asymmetry in the cell contact (DTC vs. Sh1), no other asymmetry was shown (such as one keeps expressing high Notch vs. the other one low Notch), leaving the functional significance of their observation unclear.</p><p>Their only attempt to show the significance of Sh1 encapsulation is in Figure 6 by perturbing actin cytoskeleton. The only outcome they show is reduced proliferation of germ cells at the interface.

This stem cell system is intensively studied and has contributed significantly to our general understanding of how the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is controlled. This manuscript challenges our understanding of the stem cell population in two significant ways. First, that the first pair of somatic sheath cells are quite far away from the somatic distal tip cell that caps the distal end of the gonad. There has long been thought to be a bare region in between the DTC and sheath cells. Gordon et al., through the use of new markers, demonstrate that the sheath cells are present much more distally than previously appreciated, and that the sheath cells appear to coordinate with the DTC as to the extent of their position. Second, Gordon et al. demonstrate that the plane of germ cell division for the cells at the interface between the DTC and sheath cells is largely perpendicular to the shortest distance between the DTC and sheath cells. Previously, it had been reported and accepted that the orientation of germ cell division is largely random. That it may not be random brings up the possibility of asymmetric cell division, whereas previously it was largely thought to be symmetric. These finding significantly change our understanding of the stem cell population in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad, and stem cell populations in general.</p><p>My primary concerns do not have to do with the experiments themselves, but rather with some of the conclusions that were reached. In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;our findings demonstrate that cells outside the niche can play an equal and opposite role to the niche in the balance that maintains stem cell pools with the production of differentiating progeny&quot;. At the end of the Introduction, they state &quot;We conclude that Sh1… is an orchestrater of stem cell exit from the niche&quot;. While the authors have nicely demonstrated that dividing cells in the DTC-SH1 interface often have one daughter in contact with SH1, and the other with the DTC, they have not directly demonstrated that SH1 helps to regulate the balance between self-renewing and differentiating cells, or that Sh1 helps stem cells exit from the niche. For example, they have not shown that in the absence of SH1 that this balance is affected. Indeed, when they shortened SH1 through RNAi “…the lengths of the progenitor zones were not different between the <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi-treated animals and control”, suggesting that cells were able to enter meiosis (differentiation) normally. Indeed, McCarter et al., 1997, demonstrated that in the absence of any sheath cells, while proliferation levels are lower and cells do not progress through meiosis normally, cells do enter meiosis (differentiate). Therefore, at a minimum, the sheath cells are not “equal” to the DTC (niche) in balancing maintaining stem cell pools and production of differentiating progeny-ablation of DTC renders cells incapable of self-renewal, while cells are still able to enter meiosis in the absence of sheath cells. The authors can easily address this concern by limiting their conclusions and discussing more explicitly the limitations of their data. A brief description of the McCarter results in the Discussion may be of help.</p><p>The authors make a very significant observation in that the orientation of cell division does not appear random in the Sh1-DTC interface. From this they conclude that the cell divisions are asymmetric, which I take to mean that the two daughters are different (perhaps one remaining a stem cell, and the other entering a differentiation pathway). I wonder if this is an accurate conclusion. They show that these daughter cells differ with respect to which somatic cells contact the daughters, and perhaps their position in the gonad arm; however, there isn't really any data that the two daughter cells are different (markers, entered a differentiation pathway, etc.). Perhaps the authors need to be more less strong in the conclusion that this is asymmetric cell division. This could be easily addressed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stem cell niche exit in <italic>C. elegans</italic> via orientation and segregation of daughter cells by a cryptic cell outside the niche&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is well established that the distal tip cell (DTC) serves as a niche component of <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline stem cells (GSCs): any germ cells that are associated with the DTC maintains GSC identity, and those that are “pushed away” from DTC-covered region will initiate meiotic program. It has been long believed that GSCs do not divide asymmetrically, and are maintained as a population. This paper fundamentally changes this view by finding that sheath cell (Sh1) generates an alternate pattern as DTC (DTC's cellular processes and Sh1's cellular processes intercalate), and along this boundary between DTC and Sh1, GSCs likely divide asymmetrically.</p><p>Their live imaging provides convincing case that GSC divisions, which happens most frequently at the border of DTC and Sh1, are mostly oriented such that one daughter remain associated with DTC, and the other associated with Sh1.</p><p>In the previously-reviewed version, the authors did not provide the evidence that this oriented division and daughter cells' association with DTC vs. Sh1 indeed correlates with asymmetric cell fate. In the revised version, they provide convincing evidence that indeed DTC association vs. Sh1 association nicely correlates with stem cell fate (monitored by sygl-1 expression) vs. differentiating cell fate (monitored by gld-1 expression).</p><p>Together, this study significantly contributes to our understanding of how the stem cell niche is formed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad. Also, the study reveals that <italic>C. elegans</italic> GSCs divide asymmetrically, completely flipping the previous notion (and the evidence is very strong). I do not have any major concerns at this point, and I predict that this study will be a landmark paper that will be cited for a long time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I appreciate the efforts the authors made to address the reviewers' comments and strengthen their conclusions. This manuscript reports beautifully-executed experiments, and makes a significant contribution to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline field and, more broadly, to the stem cell field. I am not completely sold in on the implications of the term &quot;facilitated niche exit&quot;, but the data are solid, the observations are highly novel and impactful, and the authors are well within their right to propose this interpretation.</p><p>There is just one major point left that I cannot wrap my head around. The authors state: &quot;we never saw spontaneous growth of Sh1 over a non-dividing cell, nor displacement of germ cells from the niche by distal-to-proximal pushing produced by other cells dividing entirely under the DTC&quot;. If that is correct, and if cells can only leave the &quot;DTC region&quot; by a mitotic division with one daughter cell that remains in the DTC region, then division of cells &quot;entirely under the DTC&quot; should cause a continuous increase in the number of cells in that region. Is that really compatible with the data? I think it would be useful for the authors to resolve this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>As I stated when I first reviewed this paper, Gordon et al. describe their analysis of a pair of somatic cells and the effect that these cells have on the stem cell population in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line.

Since the last submission, the authors have significantly improved the manuscript. Importantly, they have more accurately described the conclusions that can be made based on their data. They have also added more data that supports the model of daughters of asymmetrically divided cells are different. They do this through the use of GLD-1 and SYGL-1. This is a valuable experiment and supports their model; however, it does have its limitations. For example, I am somewhat confused as to their model for GLD-1 expression. As they mention, previous experiments have shown that the sometimes observed steps of increasing GLD-1 accumulation could be due to folds. Other than these dramatic steps, I thought the increase in GLD-1 accumulation is gradual. Therefore, I am not clear as to the boundary of GLD-1 accumulation that they are showing on Figure 5. Is this where GLD-1 is first detected, or is it at one of the steps? If it is where it is first detected, then this seems to contradict previous studies that show GLD-1 accumulation all the way to the distal end of the gonad, though at low levels. If it is at a step, and if these steps are due to folds, then this increase may not be due to the position of SH1. Is there some way that the folds are affected by SH1 position, or vice versa? Therefore, the use of GLD-1 as a marker could use some additional explanation. The interpretation of this data was made more difficult by the absence of a figure legend for Figure 5. It seems like the labeled Figure legend 5 corresponds to new Figure 6.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56383.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We also show that when we perturb Sh1 position by <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi, the distal boundary of GLD-1::GFP expression is shifted proximally (Figure 7), suggesting that Sh1 promotes entry into the differentiation program. As Sh1 is not absolutely required for differentiation (see discussion of McCarter et al., 1997 and Killian and Hubbard, 2005), what our data suggest is that Sh1may act to remove germ cells more effectively from the influence of the DTC/Notch signaling through promoting asymmetric cell division and subsequently its enwrapping Sh1-facing daughters might contribute to preventing DTC contact and Notch signaling. We have also now modified the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“Instead, we hypothesize that Sh1 promotes differentiation indirectly through its positional exclusion of the DTC from germ cells born from polarized interface divisions (Figure 8).

While the DTC promotes the mitotic fate through active Notch signaling, it is not yet known what factors stimulate proliferation in germ cells. As it is clear from our data that both the DTC and Sh1 cells are associated with proliferating germ cells, perhaps proliferative signals from both of these somatic cells have an additive effect on the germ cells at the interface. The interface is the only part of the gonad where the soma can create asymmetric cell contacts (Figure 6), and we have now shown that this asymmetry correlates with cell fate asymmetry (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, other than the asymmetry in the cell contact (DTC vs. Sh1), no other asymmetry was shown (such as one keeps expressing high Notch vs. the other one low Notch), leaving the functional significance of their observation unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The new Figure 5 with germ cell fate markers helps address this question of asymmetry.

If we focus on the animals with active divisions (ignoring the 40% of RNAi-treated animals that lack dividing cells entirely), the control (n = 46/26 or 1.77 DTC divisions/animal) and treatment (n = 38/21 or 1.81 DTC divisions/animal) groups have roughly equivalent average numbers of DTC-associated divisions.

This is described in the Results section:</p><p>“These dividing interface cells were the only cells (out of 468 total interface cells examined) that changed their germ cell-somatic cell contacts during observation. Similarly, out of the 55 scored cell divisions that occurred in contact with the DTC alone (Supplementary file 1), none of the daughters appeared to leave the niche, so division alone is not sufficient to displace a daughter cell out of the niche.”</p><p>We hypothesize that niche exit is one of many biological events that is overdetermined, or for which there is an added layer of regulatory control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The manuscript assumes that germ cell division is regulated by the Sh1-DTC interface. But why could it not be the other way around? (Or could both be downstream of something else?) The Sh1-DTC interface is a very dynamic structure, as reported in this manuscript. Could Sh1 and the DTC not actively remodel their interface in response to germ cell changes that lead up to division?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very thoughtful comment. Indeed, we favor the hypothesis that Sh1 growth is stimulated by the precursors of cytokinesis. The fact that a germ cell’s spindles orient to the DTC and Sh1 points of contact before it divides suggests that the interaction between the germ cells and Sh1 initiates before division. We present these data and their interpretation in the following Results section:</p><p>“Spindle orientation was observed across the DTC-Sh1 interface prior to division, which is consistent with a model in which the DTC-Sh1 interface dictates the asymmetric division (as opposed to the completed cell division later triggering remodeling at the DTC-Sh1 interface).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) &quot;In most of these cases (56/64) one daughter remained under the DTC or at the interface and the other ended up under or beside Sh1, suggesting a polarized division.&quot; If cell division was randomly oriented, would it not often be the case that a division at the Sh1-DTC interface results in one cell closer to the DTC and one cell closer to Sh1? In other words, how strongly do the reported numbers suggest a &quot;polarized division&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this probing question, and agree that the positional data alone is suggestive but not definitive evidence for oriented division. Stronger evidence comes from investigating the spindle positions of dividing cells at the interface with marked DTC, Sh1, germ cell histones, and tubulin (Figure 6). If the spindles were <italic>not</italic> polarized between the DTC and Sh1, then we would expect our rosette plot in Figure 6E to resemble the plot in Figure 6C, which shows no relationship between the spindle orientation and the gonad axis. Instead, the division angles to the DTC-Sh1 axis are significantly smaller (more aligned).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Various places where functional purpose is assumed without substantiation: &quot;enwraps the closest daughter to remove it from the niche&quot; (it is not clear why a cell would need to be enwrapped to leave the niche, or that enwrapping plays any role in that exit), &quot;facilitated niche exit&quot;, &quot;Sh1 grows over the Sh1-facing daughter, removing it from the niche&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful observation. Our fate markers give us additional evidence niche exit occurs when a germ cell is in contact with Sh1 and not the DTC, we have modified the language to remove any implication of goal-directed behavior by cells, or to reach beyond the functions we have evidence to support.</p><p>The first quoted phrase has been replaced:</p><p>“…we made the surprising discovery that some cells in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line stem cell niche divide in an asymmetric manner towards a niche-adjacent cell.

While this first paper may not prove that the Sh1 cell is performing this role, we do feel it is a justified point of discussion to name the phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Gordon et al. describe their analysis of a pair of somatic cells and the effect that these cells have on the stem cell population in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line. This stem cell system is intensively studied and has contributed significantly to our general understanding of how the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation is controlled. This manuscript challenges our understanding of the stem cell population in two significant ways. First, that the first pair of somatic sheath cells are quite far away from the somatic distal tip cell that caps the distal end of the gonad. There has long been thought to be a bare region in between the DTC and sheath cells. Gordon et al., through the use of new markers, demonstrate that the sheath cells are present much more distally than previously appreciated, and that the sheath cells appear to coordinate with the DTC as to the extent of their position. Second, Gordon et al. demonstrate that the plane of germ cell division for the cells at the interface between the DTC and sheath cells is largely perpendicular to the shortest distance between the DTC and sheath cells. Previously, it had been reported and accepted that the orientation of germ cell division is largely random. That it may not be random brings up the possibility of asymmetric cell division, whereas previously it was largely thought to be symmetric. These finding significantly change our understanding of the stem cell population in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> gonad, and stem cell populations in general.</p><p>My primary concerns do not have to do with the experiments themselves, but rather with some of the conclusions that were reached. In the Discussion, the authors state &quot;our findings demonstrate that cells outside the niche can play an equal and opposite role to the niche in the balance that maintains stem cell pools with the production of differentiating progeny&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate greatly that the reviewer recognizes the importance of our work to the field of stem cell biology. In this statement, they are correct that “equal” is an overstatement and this sentence has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the end of the Introduction, they state &quot;We conclude that Sh1… is an orchestrater of stem cell exit from the niche&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this language and in the interest of not overinterpreting our results (also mentioned by the other reviewers), we have removed the reference to “orchestration” at the end of the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the authors have nicely demonstrated that dividing cells in the DTC-SH1 interface often have one daughter in contact with SH1, and the other with the DTC, they have not directly demonstrated that SH1 helps to regulate the balance between self-renewing and differentiating cells, or that Sh1 helps stem cells exit from the niche. For example, they have not shown that in the absence of SH1 that this balance is affected. Indeed, when they shortened SH1 through RNAi “…the lengths of the progenitor zones were not different between the unc-60 RNAi-treated animals and control”, suggesting that cells were able to enter meiosis (differentiation) normally. Indeed, McCarter et al., 1997, demonstrated that in the absence of any sheath cells, while proliferation levels are lower and cells do not progress through meiosis normally, cells do enter meiosis (differentiate). Therefore, at a minimum, the sheath cells are not “equal” to the DTC (niche) in balancing maintaining stem cell pools and production of differentiating progeny-ablation of DTC renders cells incapable of self-renewal, while cells are still able to enter meiosis in the absence of sheath cells. The authors can easily address this concern by limiting their conclusions and discussing more explicitly the limitations of their data. A brief description of the McCarter results in the Discussion may be of help.</p></disp-quote><p>We were inspired by this reviewer’s thoughtful comment to directly test GLD-1::GFP expression (a meiosis-promoting factor that is repressed in stem cells by active Notch signaling) in the <italic>unc-60</italic> RNAi-treated worms. We found a significant but minor shift away from the distal end (~8 μm) in treated vs. control animals. The magnitude of the change may explain why the overall length of the progenitor zone is not different between controls and RNAi treated animals.</p><p>We agree that McCarter et al., 1997 is the most comprehensive previous work done on Sh1 and that it demonstrates germ cells are able to differentiate in the absence of Sh1, meaning Sh1 is not required for differentiation as the DTC is for the mitotic fate. We have removed the phrasing “equal” and have expanded the Discussion of McCarter et al., 1997:</p><p>“Our results show that Sh1 is not required for germ cell differentiation—GLD-1::GFP is visible in germ cells in the gap between the DTC and Sh1 when Sh1 is shifted proximally—much as we would expect given that differentiation is still observed in the reduced germ cell pools of sheath-ablated animals (McCarter et al., 1997 and Killian and Hubbard, 2005). Instead, we hypothesize that Sh1 promotes differentiation indirectly through its positional exclusion of the DTC from germ cells born from polarized interface divisions (Figure 8).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make a very significant observation in that the orientation of cell division does not appear random in the Sh1-DTC interface. From this they conclude that the cell divisions are asymmetric, which I take to mean that the two daughters are different (perhaps one remaining a stem cell, and the other entering a differentiation pathway). I wonder if this is an accurate conclusion. They show that these daughter cells differ with respect to which somatic cells contact the daughters, and perhaps their position in the gonad arm; however, there isn't really any data that the two daughter cells are different (markers, entered a differentiation pathway, etc.). Perhaps the authors need to be more less strong in the conclusion that this is asymmetric cell division. This could be easily addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, and it agrees with the other reviewers’ comments that more experimental support was needed to make this conclusion. We have now included two germ cell fate markers, one for stem-like cells (<italic>sygl-1p::H2B::</italic>GFP, Kershner et al., 2014) and one for cells that will differentiate (<italic>gld-1::GFP,</italic> Brenner and Schedl, 2016). The data are shown in Figure 5, and are consistent with our cell biological studies of asymmetry across the DTC-Sh1 interface. In animals in the first day of adulthood, all of the GLD-1::GFP positive germ cells are associate with Sh1, suggesting germ cells associating with the Sh1 cell have left the niche and begun to differentiate. Additionally, all of the sygl-1p::H2B::GFP positive cells are limited to the region distal to the DTC-Sh1 interface, inclusive, and do not correlate with long DTC processes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I appreciate the efforts the authors made to address the reviewers' comments and strengthen their conclusions. This manuscript reports beautifully-executed experiments, and makes a significant contribution to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline field and, more broadly, to the stem cell field. I am not completely sold in on the implications of the term &quot;facilitated niche exit&quot;, but the data are solid, the observations are highly novel and impactful, and the authors are well within their right to propose this interpretation.</p><p>There is just one major point left that I cannot wrap my head around. The authors state: &quot;we never saw spontaneous growth of Sh1 over a non-dividing cell, nor displacement of germ cells from the niche by distal-to-proximal pushing produced by other cells dividing entirely under the DTC&quot;. If that is correct, and if cells can only leave the &quot;DTC region&quot; by a mitotic division with one daughter cell that remains in the DTC region, then division of cells &quot;entirely under the DTC&quot; should cause a continuous increase in the number of cells in that region. Is that really compatible with the data? I think it would be useful for the authors to resolve this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the astute observation—the number of DTC-alone associated germ cells does indeed increase dramatically from the end of larval gonad elongation through the first days of egg laying.</p><p>The reason we do not directly address this question is that there is still somewhat surprising disagreement about the cell cycle length of mitotic germ cells in the adult. The cell cycle length in the adult proliferative zone has been estimated at 5-6 h (Rosu and Cohen-Fix, 2017; Chiang et al., 2015), to 9-12 h (Fox and Schedl, 2015), up to 16-24 hours (Crittenden et al., 2006). My data do not directly bear on this question, so I decided to avoid commenting on the issue in the manuscript.</p><p>However, I can take these published estimates and some data I have at home on hard drives to try to answer the question.</p><p>I find an average of 10 germ cells under the DTC alone in animals of the last larval stage, L4 (this is unpublished data from a strain imaged at the stage shown in Figure 2 “end migration”).</p><p>A day later an average of 34 germ cells are under the DTC alone (This number comes from doubling the 17 germ cells on average shown in Figure 3B “DTC-alone”, since we imaged only the superficial half of the gonad; it’s a rough estimate admittedly).</p><p>If we have 10 cells under the DTC alone x doubling rate of 2/12 hours x 24 hours = 40, which is close enough to an average of 34.</p><p>We can apply the doubling rate again.</p><p>34 cells under the DTC alone x doubling 2/12 hours x 24 hours = 136.</p><p>Counting the number of germ cells under the DTC of worms aged 48 hours after the L4 stage for two different strains (one with the DTC and germ cell histones marked, and one with GFP::INX-9 and germ cell histones marked), we get averages of 145 and 125 germ cells, respectively (this is also unpublished data, counted in a dozen full-thickness Z-stacks I made as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>; two different projections were made through the top and bottom halves of the gonad to avoid double counting or losing cells by projecting them onto one another). The estimate of 136 falls right into this observed range.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56383-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Of course these calculations assume all germ cells divide at the same rate, which we do not believe is true, and it assumes a division rate in the middle of the pack of estimates, which may or may not ultimately be accurate. Actual cell cycles may also vary among the DTC-associated germ cells either over time or spatially within the niche. In fact, as we note in the manuscript, the peak in cell division frequency observed by Maciejowski et al., 2006, overlaps the region of the DTC-Sh1 interface, with a lower rate of division distal to this peak, so cells under the DTC alone may correspond to those that were found in a row-by-row analysis by Maciejowski et al., 2006, to have a lower frequency of division/longer cell cycle length.</p><p>Additionally, Chiang et al., 2015, find evidence for a population that balances longer lived, slower cycling distal stem cells with faster dividing progeny that subsequently differentiate, with about a ~1.5-2 fold difference between the slower-cycling cells at the distal end and those more proximal mitotic cells closer to ~10 germ cell diameters from the distal end of the gonad (this corresponds to the neighborhood of the DTC-Sh1 interface).</p><p>Finally, remodeling at the distal edge of Sh1 combined with proliferation of DTC-associated germ cells must sometimes lead to a daughter of a DTC-only-associated germ cell landing at the DTC-Sh1 interface, where its subsequent divisions will result in daughters leaving the niche. Longer-term time-lapsing will eventually shed light onto these dynamics.</p><p>Taken together, it does appear feasible that germ cells born under the DTC-alone can remain associated with the DTC for the medium and slow estimates of germ cell proliferation rate. Future studies will determine whether these cells ever contribute to gamete formation, if there are certain environmental conditions that “tap into” this reservoir of distal germ cells, or if this is perhaps a hedge against germ cell death of progenitors outside the niche. Alternatively, as we expand our long-term imaging technique, we may see that some germ cells do indeed leave the niche without dividing, albeit at a rate that is too infrequent to have captured with our time-lapsing so far.</p></body></sub-article></article>
