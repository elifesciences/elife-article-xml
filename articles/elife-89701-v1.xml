during chondrogenesis can lead to a better understanding of OA. microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression in chondrocytes/OA, and we have used a combined experimental, bioinformatic, and systems biology approach to explore the multiple miRNA–mRNA interactions that regulate chondrogenesis. A longitudinal chondrogenesis bioinformatic analysis identified paralogues miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Experimental work in human cells demonstrated alteration of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p expression led to significant inverse modulation of key chondrogenic genes and extracellular matrix production. miR-199a/b-5p targets <italic>FZD6, ITGA3</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> were identified by inhibition experiments and verified as direct targets by luciferase assay. The experimental work was used to generate and parameterise a multi-miRNA 14-day chondrogenesis kinetic model to be used as a repository for the experimental work and as a resource for further investigation of this system. This is the first multi-miRNA model of a chondrogenesis-based system, and highlights the complex relationships between regulatory miRNAs, and their target mRNAs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>chondrogenesis</kwd><kwd>systems biology</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>kinetic modelling</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000377</institution-id><institution>Dunhill Medical Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R476/0516</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>Krutik</given-names></name><name><surname>Barter</surname><given-names>Matt</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Shanley</surname><given-names>Daryl P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17OC0027812</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shanley</surname><given-names>Daryl P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012041</institution-id><institution>Versus Arthritis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P020941/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Proctor</surname><given-names>Carole</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012041</institution-id><institution>Versus Arthritis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R502182/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Proctor</surname><given-names>Carole</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012041</institution-id><institution>Versus Arthritis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soul</surname><given-names>Jamie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multi-disciplined approach uncovered microRNA-199a/b-5p as important regulators of chondrogenesis, which negatively regulate mRNAs such as FZD6, ITGA3, and CAV1 for protective purposes during chondrogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into chondrocytes occurs by the process of chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosnakovski et al., 2006</xref>). This is an important process during development as it is a pre-requisite for skeletogenesis. Chondrocytes perform the vital role of generating cartilage during embryogenesis, but also maintain cartilage throughout life, including at the ends of long bones in articulating joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkiraju and Nohe, 2015</xref>). The master transcription factor responsible for chondrogenesis is SOX9 and during this process chondrocytes secrete anabolic proteins such as type II collagen and aggrecan, encoded by <italic>COL2A1</italic> and <italic>ACAN</italic>, which constitute a significant functional portion of the cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akkiraju and Nohe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoshi et al., 2017</xref>). With increasing age and influenced by a mixture of factors such as (epi)genetics, obesity, and mechanical injury/stress, chondrocytes will increasingly express catabolic proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases which degrade the cartilage ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoshi et al., 2017</xref>). Ultimately the chronic loss of cartilage contributes to the extremely debilitating condition osteoarthritis (OA), which remains incurable with treatment options limited to pain relief medication and end-stage joint replacement surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grässel and Muschter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loeser et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>miRNAs are short non-coding RNAs – roughly 19-22 nt long that negatively regulate target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sevignani et al., 2006</xref>). Mammalian miRNA–mRNA interactions occur via complementary sequence specificity between a 7 and 8 nt stretch of the miRNA known as the seed sequence, and positions along the 3′UTR of the target mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doench and Sharp, 2004</xref>). miRNA–mRNA interactions are complex because a single mRNA can be targeted by many miRNAs, and a single miRNA can target many mRNAs. Our previous work identified significantly altered miRNAs during chondrogenesis and demonstrated the role of miR-140 in regulating chondrocyte gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barter et al., 2015</xref>). miR-140 has emerged as a vital regulator of chondrogenesis, cartilage, and OA, and have been hypothesized as effective drug targets due to their pro-chondrogenic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miyaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katoh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swingler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karlsen et al., 2016</xref>). Additional miRNAs, such as miR-455, have also been shown to be important regulators in maintaining healthy cartilage and protecting against OA development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ito et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To identify further important miRNAs from this dataset, and to overcome the complexity of miRNA–mRNA interactions, we performed a combined bioinformatic, experimental and systems biology approach to better understand the relationship between miRNAs which may be important to chondrogenesis, and their predicted targets. We identified miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic miRNAs. Just as with miR-140-5p and miR-455, we anticipated miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p (miR-199a/b-5p) to target multiple mRNAs during chondrogenesis. To this end we used experimental, informatic, and literary data to build kinetic models to explain how miR-199a/b-5p regulated chondrogenesis. The models included three targets identified through RNAseq analysis (<italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3,</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic>), and were used to make predictions to fill experimental gaps and predict novel interactions between miR-199a/b-5p and the chondrogenesis machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis with <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> identified miR-199b-5p to be upregulated during chondrogenesis</title><p>Our previously generated 14-day chondrogenesis time-series dataset was analysed with the <italic>TimiRGeN R/ Bioconductor</italic> package – a novel tool we developed to analyse longitudinal miRNA–mRNA expression datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patel et al., 2021</xref>).

Eight signalling pathways were found enriched in at least three of the five timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> pipeline was then used to predict miRNA–mRNA interactions that may regulate each of the eight pathways. miRNA–mRNA interactions were kept if the miRNA and mRNA involved in the interaction has a Pearson correlation &lt;−0.75 across the time series and if the interaction was predicted in at least two of the following three databases: TargetScan, miRDB, or miRTarBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Wang, 2020</xref>).

To elucidate which genes are most affected by miR-199 inhibition, we performed an RNAseq experiment to identify candidate targets during the early phase of MSC chondrogenesis comparing MSC samples which were undifferentiated (day 0) and MSC samples which were in the early stages of chondrogenesis (day 1). Chondrogenic markers were downregulated by miR-199 inhibition in the early stages of chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), so we reasoned that identifying mRNAs which are positively enriched during the first few days of chondrogenesis may identify the most important mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p.

This included the addition of transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) as a trigger for chondrogenesis initiation – just as we had during our chondrogenesis MSC experiments. We found strong mechanistic links between TGFB signalling and <italic>CAV1</italic> expression via SRC kinase. Based on our previous work, we also included miR-140-5p as it has been proven as a vital regulator of chondrogenesis, and with our kinetic model we predicted how miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p inhibition indirectly affected miR-140-5p. Further to this, we identified several flaws in our initial model, which we attempted to rectify using the enhanced chondrogenesis model. Firstly, by simulating the miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p inhibition to last until day 7, we saw that <italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA, <italic>COL2A1</italic> mRNA, and <italic>ACAN</italic> mRNA dynamics between days 1 and 7 of miR-199b-5p inhibition were flat. Furthermore, our CAV1 dynamics were also flat during miR-199b-5p inhibition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows, from miR-199b-5p inhibition, the chondrogenesis biomarkers had a sharp decrease followed by a steady rise until day 7, and to match the effect of the miR-199b-5p inhibition experiments, we simulated the inhibition to last until day 4.5 instead of day 7. Doing so increased the similarities between our experimental data and simulations. Secondly, we wanted to include other miR-199a/b-5p targets which were alluded to in our RNAseq experiment, but not further explored, such as <italic>MYH9</italic> and <italic>PDE4D</italic>. We added a blackbox named ‘OtherTargets’ to represent other targets which miR-199a/b-5p regulate during chondrogenesis. Also, to delay the decrease in <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1,</italic> and GAG levels after miR-199a/b-5p inhibition, we slowed down the interactions between the miR-199a/b-5p targets and <italic>SOX9</italic> by including SOX9 protein and SOX9 phospho-protein as objects in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). In the enhanced model, 14/18 (77.7%) of the objects with experimental data had an MSE of &gt;3, indicating the model – even with additional data from the literature – still captured much of the experimental data. Also, the average MSE was 12.08, indicating an improvement over the initial model.</p><p>From the enhanced model, we saw improved dynamics for several model objects, for example, GAG, <italic>CAV1</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, <italic>ACAN</italic>, <italic>COL2A1</italic>. Our MSE values which were used to quantify how similar our models’ simulations were in contrast to our experimental data. Generally, our MSE values were better in our enhanced model for the chondrogenesis biomarkers and GAG levels, though our MSE values were better in our initial model for the miR-199a/b-5p targets. Overall, we saw the dynamics improved in the enhanced model, and in addition, we could make predictions on how miR-140-5p levels would indirectly be influenced from knock-down of miR-199a-5p or miR-199b-5p and such a multi-miRNA model has not yet been created before. Further pathways such as the Wnt signalling pathway may also play an important role in this system but could not be explored via modelling with our current level of data.

ITGA3 is a cell surface integrin which forms a heterodimer with ITGB1 to form α3β1 heterodimers through which chondrocyte–fibronectin ECM connections can be created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LaPointe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Loeser, 2014</xref>). Conditional deletion of <italic>Itgb1</italic> in cartilage impacts profoundly on skeletogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>). α3 integrins have been found to increase in OA cartilage, though a direct mechanism between ITGA3 regulating SOX9 is not clear. Regulation of SOX9 via CAV1 has been more studied, which has shown that the relationship between SOX9 and CAV1 is complex and requires further testing. CAV1 may be affecting SOX9 levels, via its activation of RHOA/ROCK1 signalling, which leads to phosphorylation of SOX9. RHOA/ROCK1 inhibition has been shown to both increase levels of SOX9 and chondrogenesis biomarkers in mouse ATDC5 cells, but also decrease levels of <italic>SOX9</italic> and chondrogenesis biomarkers in 3D-chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woods and Beier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woods et al., 2005</xref>). It is likely that other mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p also contributed towards chondrogenesis regulation, such as the other genes identified as miR-199a/b-5p targets from the RNAseq analysis, for example, <italic>MYH9, NECTIN2</italic>. Based on this limitation, a ‘blackbox’ called OtherTargets was added to the kinetic model to represent all other anti-chondrogenic miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis which were not explored in this study. A major limitation of the kinetic models is that we were not able to provide any multi-omic data – as no protein level, or phosphor-protein data were available. We generated a broader GRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which showcases how the models we created could be enhanced with such data.</p><p>While the in silico model can serve as a resource for researchers interested in this system, there were certain genes such as <italic>CAV1</italic> and <italic>FZD6</italic> which proved difficult to model. At the time of building the models we assumed, miR-199a-5p inhibition would lead to a greater effect than miR-199b-5p inhibition due to miR-199a-5p being more abundant. However, we clearly see now this was a misconception and miR-199b-5p inhibition leads to a greater decrease in GAG levels and a greater increase in <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3,</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> levels. This could be because miR-199b-5p increases by a greater magnitude than miR-199a-5p; therefore, the inhibition of miR-199b-5p has a bigger effect on chondrogenesis. Such time-series analysis would have been unavailable by only using differential expression analysis, and the <italic>TimiRGeN</italic> R package was highly useful in finding this microRNA during our reanalysis.</p><p>Our results validate miR-199a/b-5p interacting with <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3,</italic> and <italic>CAV1</italic> and for miR-199a/b-5p to provide vital pro-chondrogenic regulatory effects, as observed previously for miR-140 and miR-455. Deletion of miR-140 in both humans and mice affects skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grigelioniene et al., 2019</xref>). Further, from in vivo mouse models miR-140 and miR-455 were additionally shown to be pivotal in protecting from OA. Recently, intra-articular injection of a miR-199a-5p mimic has been shown to reduce cartilage damage in a rat post-traumatic OA model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2023</xref>). Mouse genetic studies examining the loss of both –199a/b-5p, specifically in cartilage, are required to better understand the function of these miRNAs in skeletogenesis and chondrocyte development. Our results demonstrate early interest and provide a detailed kinetic model to aid researchers interested in this important topic.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our combined bioinformatic, laboratory, and systems biology methodology was a multi-faceted approach to explore miR-199a-5p and miR-199b-5p as pro-chondrogenic regulators. Based on our bioinformatic analysis, the three most significantly positively changing miR-199a/b-5p were predicted targets <italic>FZD6</italic>, <italic>ITGA3,</italic> and <italic>CAV</italic>. Laboratory experiments validated these as direct miR-199a/b-5p targets and confirmed that miR-199a/b-5p positively regulate chondrogenesis. However, the complex nature of miRNA function means there are likely multiple mRNA targets of miR-199a/b-5p which may work synergistically to modulate chondrogenesis. The GRN and kinetic models were created to capture the behaviours of the system which act as a useful resource for further experimental design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data processing and differential expression analysis</title><p>mRNA and miRNA data were produced using Illumina and Exiqon microarray technologies, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barter et al., 2015</xref>). mRNA data was processed using the <italic>lumi</italic> R package, and the miRNA data was processed using the <italic>affy</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gautier et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>limma</italic> was then used to perform pairwise differential expression (DE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>).

I would now like to thank the authors for their hard work in responding to my comments. I am happy with the changes they have made, in particular the inclusion of further experimental evidence in Figures 2 and 4. I have no further comments to make.</p><p>In 'Systems analysis of miR-199a/b-5p and multiple miR-199a/b-5p targets during chondrogenesis', Patel et al. present a variety of analyses using different methodologies to investigate the importance of two miRNAs in regulating gene expression in a cellular model of cartilage development. They first re-analysed existing data to identify these miRNAs as one of the most dynamic across a chondrogenesis development timecourse. Next, they manipulated the expression of these miRNAs and showed that this affected the expression of various marker genes as expected. An RNA-seq experiment on these manipulations identified putative mRNA targets of the miRNAs which were also supported by bioinformatics predictions. These top hits were validated experimentally and, finally, a kinetic model was developed to demonstrate the relationship between the miRNAs and mRNAs studied throughout the paper.</p><p>I am convinced that the novel relationships reported here between miR-199a/b-5p and target genes FZD6, ITGA3 and CAV1 are likely to be genuine. It is important for researchers working on this system and related diseases to know all the miRNA/mRNA relationships but, as the authors have already published work studying the most dynamic miRNA (miR-140-5p) in this biological system I was not convinced that this study of the second miRNA in their list provided a conceptual advance on their previous work.</p><p>I was also concerned with the lack of reporting of details of the manipulation experiments. The authors state that they have over-expressed miR-199a-5p (Figure 2A) and knocked down miR-199b-5p (Figure 2B) but they should have reported their proof that these experiments had worked as predicted, e.g. showing the qRT-PCR change in miRNA expression.

They first re-analysed existing data to identify these miRNAs as one of the most dynamic across a chondrogenesis development time course. Next, they manipulated the expression of these miRNAs and showed that this affected the expression of various marker genes as expected. An RNA-seq experiment on these manipulations identified putative mRNA targets of the miRNAs which were also supported by bioinformatics predictions. These top hits were validated experimentally and, finally, a kinetic model was developed to demonstrate the relationship between the miRNAs and mRNAs studied throughout the paper.</p><p>I am convinced that the novel relationships reported here between miR-199a/b-5p and target genes FZD6, ITGA3, and CAV1 are likely to be genuine. It is important for researchers working on this system and related diseases to know all the miRNA/mRNA relationships but, as the authors have already published work studying the most dynamic miRNA (miR-140-5p) in this biological system I was not convinced that this study of the second miRNA in their list provided a conceptual advance on their previous work.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this study is an enhancement on our previous work for two reasons, which have been alluded to in new text within the introduction. Firstly, our previous work used experimental and bioinformatic analysis to identify microRNAs with significant regulatory roles during chondrogenesis. This new manuscript additionally uses a systems biology approaches to identify novel miRNA-mRNA interactions and capture these within an in silico model. Secondly, this work was initiated by the analysis of our previously generated data – using a novel tool we developed for this type of data <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TimiRGeN.html">(Bioconductor - TimiRGeN)</ext-link>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was also concerned with the lack of reporting of details of the manipulation experiments.

Hence, Supplementary Figure 1 is now included which provides validation of the effects of miR-199a-5p overexpression</p><p>(Supplementary Figure 1A) and inhibition of miR-199a/b-5p (Supplementary Figure 1B). Within the main manuscript, Figure 2B has been amended to include the consequences of inhibition of miR-199a-5p, with 2C showing the consequences of miR-199b-5p inhibition. Further, we include new data with regards to miR-199a/b-5p inhibition on CAV1 (Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I had a number of issues with the way in which some of the data was presented.

Figure 1A is now pathway enrichment plots from the TimiRGeN R Bioconductor package, and the table which previously showed the pathways enriched at each time point is now in the supplementary materials (supp. Table 1). Figure 2 and 4 now have color instead of shades of grey. Figure 3C has now been moved to supplementary materials (Supplementary Figure 2) and is referenced in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, while I think that this is an interesting and valuable paper, I think its findings are relatively limited to those interested in the role of miRNAs in this specific biomedical context.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study represents an ambitious endeavor to comprehensively analyze the role of miR199a/b-5p and its networks in cartilage formation. By conducting experiments that go beyond in vitro MSC differentiation models, more robust conclusions can be achieved.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This research investigates the role of miR-199a/b-5p during chondrogenesis using bioinformatics and in vitro experimental systems. The significance of miRNAs in chondrogenesis and OA is crucial, warranting further research, and this study contributes novel insights.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While miR-140 and miR-455 are used as controls, these miRNAs have been demonstrated to be more relevant to Cartilage Homeostasis than chondrogenesis itself. Their deficiency has been genetically proven to induce Osteoarthritis in mice. Therefore, the results of this study should be considered in comparison with these existing findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers comments. miR-455-null mice develop normally but miR-140-null (or mutated) mice and humans do have skeletal abnormalities (e.g. Nat Med. 2019 Apr;25(4):583-590. doi: 10.1038/s41591-019-0353-2), indicating a role in chondrogenesis. We have made an addition in the description to point towards the need to assess the roles miR-199a/b-5p may play during skeletogenesis and OA. We anticipate miR-199a/b-5p to be relevant in OA and have ongoing additional work for this – but this beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Beyond the issues raised in the public review, I had a few minor recommendations that are largely designed to help improve the understanding of the manuscript as it is currently written.</p><p>(1) Please provide the statistical tests used to obtain p-values in the Figure 2 and 4 legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added statistical test information to the figure legends of figures 2 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is stated on p. 9 that both miRNAs may share a functional repertoire because 25 and 341 genes are interested between their inhibition experiments. Please provide statistical support that this overlap is an enrichment over the null background in this experiment. Total DE genes – chi squared. Expected / Observed.</p></disp-quote><p>A chi-squared test is now presented in the manuscript which shows that the number of significant genes which were found in common between miR-199a-5p knockdown and miR-199b-5p knockdown were significantly more than expected for day 0 or day 1 of the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The final sentence on p. 12 (beginning 'Size of the points reflect...') seemed out of place - is it part of a legend?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this mistake - it was part of figure 3C and now is in the supplementary materials.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A sentence on p. 14 reads that 'FZD6 and ITGA3 levels increased significantly' but this should read decreased, rather than increased. Quite an important typo!</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this error out. It has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Theoretical transcripts are mentioned in the legend of Figure 5A but these were not present in the figure.

Currently, it reads as if these references support your luciferase assays which you claim are the first evidence for this target relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this change and have corrected the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The reference to Figure 5D on p. 20 should be a reference to Figure 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this error out – this has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The paper is based on the importance of miR-140 and miR-455 as miRNAs in chondrogenesis, citing only Barter, M. J. et al. Stem Cells 33, (2015). Considering the scope and results of this study, this citation is insufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewers comments. For many year miR-140 and miR-455 have been experimented on and their importance in OA research has become apparent. We included additional references within the introduction to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Analyzing chondrogenesis solely through differentiation experiments from MSCs is inadequate. It is essential to perform experiments involving the network within normal cartilage tissue and/or the generation of knockout mice to understand the precise role of miR199a/b-5p in chondrogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional paragraph in the discussion to state this, and do believe it is highly important that miR-199a/b-5p be tested in OA samples – however this would be beyond the intended scope of this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In light of the above points, it is imperative to investigate the role of miR-199a/b-5p beyond the in vitro differentiation model from MSCs, encompassing mouse OA models or human disease samples.</p></disp-quote><p>In tangent with the previous address, we agree with the pretense and believe additional experiments should be performed to gain more insight to the mechanism of how miR-199a/b-5p regulate OA.
