divergence, the extent to which these genes still perform their ancestral functions is largely unknown. To test principles governing retention of ancient function, we asked if prokaryotic genes could replace their essential eukaryotic orthologs. We systematically replaced essential genes in yeast by their 1:1 orthologs from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. After accounting for mitochondrial localization and alternative start codons, 31 out of 51 bacterial genes tested (61%) could complement a lethal growth defect and replace their yeast orthologs with minimal effects on growth rate. Replaceability was determined on a pathway-by-pathway basis; codon usage, abundance, and sequence similarity contributed predictive power. The heme biosynthesis pathway was particularly amenable to inter-kingdom exchange, with each yeast enzyme replaceable by its bacterial, human, or plant ortholog, suggesting it as a near-universally swappable pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25093.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25093.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25093.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All life on Earth – from bacteria to human beings – can be traced back to a common ancestor that lived over three billion years ago. As a result, modern-day organisms share many essential parts of life’s molecular machinery, such as certain genes and proteins. Yet there are also vital differences that allow scientists to divide almost all living things into one of two groups, known as prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes are all simple, single-celled organisms, such as bacteria; while eukaryotes include more complex organisms, such as plants, animals and fungi.</p><p>Scientists have previously found that eukaryotes and prokaryotes have hundreds of genes in common, even though they have evolved separately for over two billion years. As different species evolve, however, their genes mutate and change, potentially affecting the way they work. So, although scientists can recognize equivalent genes between species, they are not sure if they work the same way as they did in the species’ ancient ancestors.</p><p>To investigate this, one-by-one Kachroo, Laurent et al. replaced over 50 genes in baker’s yeast (a eukaryote) with their equivalent gene from <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria (a prokaryote). If the yeast cells grow healthily after the gene is replaced, it means that that gene works in a similar way in both bacteria and yeast. That, in turn, suggests it is likely that the genes work as they did in the last common ancestor of bacteria and yeast.</p><p>The experiments found that most of the tested <italic>E. coli</italic> genes (61% to be precise) could successfully replace equivalent genes in yeast cells. Moreover, genes often work together in groups, and Kachroo, Laurent et al. found that genes in some groups were more successfully replaced than others. For example, nearly every gene that is important for producing a molecule called heme could be freely swapped from bacteria, plants and humans into yeast. This group of genes has probably worked the same way in different species for billions of years.</p><p>Understanding why genes sometimes change how they work is an important question for scientists studying evolution, but this knowledge has other uses. For example, people need heme to, amongst other things, carry oxygen in their blood, and a mutation in a gene in the heme production pathway causes a disease called porphyria. Scientists could replace genes in yeast cells to better model the disease in humans, leading to a better understanding of its causes and more efficient development of new drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25093.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25093.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>bacterialization</kwd><kwd>gene swapping</kwd><kwd>heme biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>orthology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 GM119021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F1515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD085901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1 GM106408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK110520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcotte</surname><given-names>Edward M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite billions of years of divergence, a majority of prokaryotic genes can functionally replace their essential eukaryotic counterparts, revealing broad preservation of ancestral functions and identifying heme biosynthesis as a near-universally swappable pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite over 2 billion years of divergence, eukaryotes and prokaryotes still share hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Theobald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Brien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown and Doolittle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Müller, 1998</xref>). Though these ancient genes are identifiable as orthologs at the sequence level, the preservation of original protein function across such deep timescales has not been systematically explored. The function of certain genes could potentially become frozen in place in the course of evolution, sheltered from lineage-specific functional alterations introduced by mutations, gene fusions, and non-orthologous gene displacements. Such functionally frozen genes would in principle be able to substitute for their least-diverged ortholog in any other species. Searching for such gene replaceability between species thus serves to test a core assumption of the ortholog-function conjecture: that orthologs retain ancestral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabaldón and Koonin, 2013</xref>). This conjecture forms the basis of most modern biomedical research and is widely used to predict new gene function across organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>There are many individual examples of genes from one species functioning for their orthologous counterparts in a different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cherry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinicke et al., 2007</xref>), but this trend has only recently begun to be explored systematically, with several large-scale studies substituting human genes for yeast genes and confirming that many human orthologs can successfully replace their yeast counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kachroo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamza et al., 2015</xref>). At the level of evolutionary divergence of yeast and humans, such data demonstrate widespread functional conservation, even after 1 billion years of divergence. The ability of human genes to functionally replace their yeast orthologs is not strongly predicted by the similarity of sequences, but rather at the level of specific pathways or processes, wherein all genes in a process or pathway tend to be similarly replaceable, or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kachroo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>However, in the timescale of evolution, yeast and humans are relatively similar – both eukaryotes that share thousands of genes and the majority of their core biological processes. Data on eukaryote – prokaryote functional gene replacement are sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinicke et al., 2007</xref>). These cross-domain replacements represent a maximum test of the ability of genes to retain their ancestral function across time. Eukaryotic and bacterial genes have been, for the most part, evolving independently since at least the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes endosymbiotically acquired its bacterial mitochondrion. In eukaryotes, the function of these genes would have had to survive the development of vastly different genome structures, cell division modalities, cell wall compositions, and subcellular compartmentalizations which occurred during eukaryogenesis. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic orthologs also diverged significantly at the amino acid sequence level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Brien et al., 2005</xref>) and evolved distinct expression patterns and codon usages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharp et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bulmer, 1991</xref>). Nonetheless, eukaryotes and bacteria are known to use many of the same orthologs to perform the same metabolic enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jardine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peregrin-Alvarez et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in order to more systematically determine the replaceability of orthologs across such deep timescales, we asked in this study how many conserved <italic>E. coli</italic> genes can successfully substitute for their yeast orthologs. We focused on those genes that are essential for viability in yeast, allowing us to assay for the complementation of otherwise lethal growth defects. We analysed many features of the proteins and ortholog pairs to identify which properties best explained replaceability, finding that replaceability was often determined at the level of specific pathways and processes, with all genes in a pathway or process similarly replaceable. Start codon choice and eukaryote-specific subcellular localization were also critical determinants of replaceability. We discovered that certain core biological processes have remained largely unchanged since the last common ancestor of bacteria, yeast, and humans. In particular, heme biosynthesis pathway enzymes appear to be generally exchangeable between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, broadly retaining ancestral functions across the tree of life over 2 billion years of independent evolution, even when accompanied by evolved changes in enzyme subcellular localization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Many <italic>E. coli</italic> genes successfully complement lethal defects in their yeast orthologs</title><p>We focused our efforts on the set of genes with 1:1 orthology between <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast and that are known to be essential for yeast growth in standard laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each <italic>E. coli</italic> open reading frame (ORF) was cloned into a single-copy yeast centromeric (CEN) plasmid under the transcriptional control of a constitutive GPD promoter. Complementation assays were carried out using two types of conditionally essential yeast alleles, consisting of temperature-sensitive (TS) haploid and heterozygous diploid deletion strains. In the case of the heterozygous diploid deletion strains, the respective yeast gene null allele could be genetically segregated via sporulation, allowing selection for haploid yeast with the null allele (selected for in the presence of the antibiotic G418) or the wild-type yeast gene (in the absence of G418) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Top panel). In the case of TS haploid yeast strains, the temperature sensitive yeast proteins functioned normally at the permissive temperature (25°C) but could be conditionally inactivated at the non-permissive temperature (36°C) in order to test for gene replaceability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Bottom panel).

This trend was most evident in the observation that a gene was more likely to replace (or not) if it had a higher fraction of interaction partners that also replaced (or not). Consequently, different biological processes (as defined by GO) displayed varied replaceability, with metabolic processes being largely replaceable, while processes known to be divergent, including ribosomal processing, were much less replaceable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

This is thus consistent with the notion that replaceability is determined at the level of the pathway or process, with codon choice and gene expression levels reflecting functional constraints of that process. Combining all of these features into a single predictor (after accounting for mitochondrial localization and alternative start codons), using a random forest classifier, improved our predictive power to a 0.79 AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), demonstrating that the features we investigated provide moderately orthogonal predictive information.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Each yeast heme biosynthesis enzyme can be replaced by its <italic>E. coli</italic> equivalent, irrespective of orthology or localization</title><p>Nearly all the genes that we tested from the heme biosynthesis pathway were replaceable by their <italic>E. coli</italic> orthologs, which in combination with the evidence that replaceability was determined at the level of processes, led us to investigate the heme pathway in more depth.

Nonetheless, both EGFP-tagged genes were able to efficiently rescue the growth defect of the corresponding yeast gene deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We, therefore, sought to complete tests of the remaining human genes in the pathway. In the case of <italic>Hs-UROS</italic>, we reasoned that toxicity was due to expression from the heterologous constitutive promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Indeed, similar to the results obtained with the yeast version of this gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>Sc-HEM4</italic>), we found that toxicity could be abrogated by inserting the human gene at the native yeast chromosomal locus, thus providing native yeast gene expression and regulation for the human ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This suggests that, at least in yeast, this step is regulated transcriptionally for optimal function. We also found that the human ORFeome clone of <italic>Hs-UROD</italic> contained a mutation (G303V) that when reverted to wild-type sequence allowed it to replace the yeast gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>), and we additionally confirmed that human <italic>Hs-PPOX</italic> could complement the severe growth defect of the yeast <italic>Sc-hem14</italic> deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Finally, in humans, the initial step of heme biosynthesis is identical to that of yeast (<italic>Sc-HEM1</italic>) but is encoded by two co-orthologs, <italic>Hs-ALAS1</italic> and <italic>Hs-ALAS2</italic>. We found that both of these human genes could individually replace the yeast gene function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>The subcellular localization of heme biosynthesis differs slightly between humans and yeast, such that the last three proteins in the human heme biosynthesis pathway are mitochondrially localized, as opposed to only the last two in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grandchamp et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferreira et al., 1988</xref>). As all three of these genes replaced, we tested if the human genes were localized to the mitochondria in yeast. Indeed, EGFP-tagged Hs-FECH, Hs-PPOX, and Hs-CPOX all localized to mitochondria in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and efficiently rescued the growth defect of the corresponding yeast gene deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), confirming that the human mitochondrial localization signal is recognizable by the yeast localization machinery. Thus, across our attempts to humanize, plantize, and bacterialize this pathway, the presence of mitochondrial leader peptides from the human genes and the chloroplast leader peptides from the plant genes, as well as the absence of bacterial leaders, all overrode the native yeast localization of the heme biosynthesis pathway. However, the pathway function was largely resilient to these effects, with the exception of protoporphyrin IX accumulation in the mislocalized bacterialized strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Heme biosynthesis is a near-universally swappable pathway</title><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the heme pathway has had a complicated evolutionary trajectory in eukaryotes due to endosymbiotic events, which has served to increase its similarity between bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kořený and Oborník, 2011</xref>).

These results largely agree with previously published work on humanization of yeast genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kachroo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sun et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that functional replaceability is predominantly determined at the level of pathways and processes, even across very large evolutionary distances. As our assays can be considered a form of forced horizontal gene transfer, our results provide support for the ‘complexity hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jain et al., 1999</xref>), which posits that informational (transcription, translation, etc.) genes are less likely to be horizontally transferred than those genes that are operational (metabolism, housekeeping, etc.). Consistent with this expectation, we see metabolism-associated genes replacing more often than those involved in ‘informational’ processes like transcription or translation.</p><p>In the course of these studies, we found that heme biosynthetic reactions were entirely replaceable across the prokaryote-eukaryote divide, despite non-orthologous functional displacement and lack of eukaryotic subcellular localization by native <italic>E. coli</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although the archaeal pathway is considerably diverged, our studies across bacteria and eukaryotes showed a high degree of replaceability: Plant heme biosynthesis enzymes functionally replaced yeast enzymes in all but one reaction. Swaps of the corresponding human enzymes into yeast in this and prior studies all suggest that heme biosynthesis is a near universally replaceable pathway.</p><p>Our results thus demonstrate that orthologous genes carry out similar functions that allow for their ability to functionally replace each other across even the 2 billion year evolutionary rift separating prokaryotes and eukaryotes from their last common ancestor. These swaps allow engineering of orthologous pathways in model organisms highly amenable to genetic perturbations, like yeast and bacteria, for further characterization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Construction of ORFs from bacteria, plants, and humans in yeast expression vectors</title><p>Refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> for all the primers used in this study.</p><sec id="s3-1-1"><title><italic>E.coli</italic> ORF yeast expression vectors</title><p>Initial <italic>E. coli</italic> ORF primers were designed such that the 3' ends of the primers had homology to <italic>E. coli</italic> genes and 5’ ends contained a universal flanking sequence.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eugene Koonin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper analyzes systematically the replaceability of yeast gene by their bacterial orthologs and discusses general differences between 'replaceable' and 'non-replaceable' genes. All three reviewers appreciated the study and found it suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. As you will see, the comments are related mostly to the Discussion and explanations. Please relate and try to address all of these suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript titled: &quot;Systemic Bacterialization of yeast genes identifies a near-universal swappable pathway&quot; Kachroo et al. describe their attempt in examining the complementation of 60 essential yeast genes with their bacterial counterparts. Of the 60, for 51 they were able to perform complementation assays. Complementation was tested in a plasmid based expression with the GPD1 promoter, CDS was cloned with the <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA sequence, tested with either the TS library yeast strain or in a heterozygous diploid from the deletion collection. 25 of the 51 complemented their yeast counterparts with no modification. Another 4 of 10 yeast mitochondrial genes complemented once a mitochondrial localization sequence was added. 2 of the 4 genes that lacked the canonical ATG start codon, complemented following mutation of the start codon to ATG. All told 31/51 showed complementation.</p><p>The authors then followed this up with statistics about the characteristics that determine replaceability between Bacteria and Yeast, taking into account 22 features, they find that protein sequence similarity is not a highly predictive feature, while specificity of pathway and/or process is highly predictive. Metabolic pathways show high replaceability while highly expressed genes, such as ribosomal genes, are more sensitive to codon choice.</p><p>The authors then turn to the heme pathway; they first examine the complementation of each of the bacterial genes for its yeast counterpart. For the first step in yeast (Sc-Hem1) there are two genes in bacteria (Ec-hemA and Ec-hemL) and in yeast it is performed in the mitochondria, they added MLS sequences to both bacterial genes and with co expression showed complementation and localization using a EGFP tag. For two more steps (Sc-HEM4 and Sc-HEM14), there only functional analogs (Ec-hemD and Ec-hemG), not orthologs, and they indeed complemented for the yeast genes. The final two steps in the yeast pathway are carried out in the mitochondria, however, the bacterial genes complemented without an MLS sequence, and surprisingly localized to the plasma membrane. However, when trying to complement for both yeast genes in a single strain there was a fitness defect. When integrating the bacterial genes to express them from their native yeast gene counterparts, all but two complemented, and those two complemented following MLS addition.</p><p>In complementation of Sc-HEM15 by Ec-hemH, authors noted that colonies are pink, they analyzed and found this to be due to accumulation of protoprophyrin IX, the substrate of Ec-hemH, determining that mislocalization to the plasma membrane caused reduce enzyme activity and accumulation of the substrate, similarly to the human disease protoporphyria. They suggest that this indicates that the yeast can be used to study mutations in the corresponding human gene.</p><p>The authors show that they can also replace most of the yeast heme pathway genes with the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes that encode enzymes that form precursors for chlorophylls; this pathway is localized mostly to the chloroplast. Similarly to the bacterial pathway, the first step from yeast is performed in two steps in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, only when both genes (At-HENA1 and At-GSA) were expressed was complementation of Sc-HEM1 observed.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> most of the heme genes are duplicated, in most, individually replaced their yeast orthologs, in one case only one and in one case neither replaced (At-HEME1 and At-HEME2 replacing Sc-HEM12). Due to its interest in commercial herbicides, the step producing protoporphyrin IX was tested for complementation by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes (At-PPOX1 and At-PPOX2) as well as the soybean ortholog, Gm-HEMG; both complemented for Sc-Hem14. The authors also noted that the chloroplast localization signal on a couple of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> proteins caused their localization to the mitochondria, and complemented for their yeast orthologs.</p><p>Similarly, the authors assayed for complementation by the human orthologs of the heme pathway. Similar to what was shown in previous papers, they saw toxicity when overexpressing Hs-UROS from a plasmid using a constitutive promoter, thus they integrated it to the native locus of Sc-Hem4, and it showed reduced toxicity when integrated. They also showed complementation by Hs-UROD and Hs-PPOX. Two human orthologs complement for Sc-HEM1 individually. Although no yeast MLS was added to the human genes of the last three steps in the pathway they all were found to localize to the mitochondria.</p><p>I would consider acceptance of this paper following the authors' response to these issues:</p><p>1) The authors do a very poor job of describing the basis for choosing and refining the 60 coli genes. It is really hard to believe that there are only 60 good orthologs between yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic>. What exactly were the criteria for choosing those? Further, they did not indicate what possibly was the issue with the 9/60 that did not have a complementation assay. Was it a problem with the corresponding yeast host strain(s) or was it difficult to clone these genes? This should be spelled out, perhaps as an explicit description in the Materials and methods section. Complete tables of all orthologs attempted for all the donor species tested, along with reasons for failure for the 9 that missed in bacteria for example, should be provided in the supplement.</p><p>2) From what I could conclude, in both bacteria and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> there was an issue with complementing Sc-hem12. The bacteria one could not be integrated and both <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> orthologs failed to complement. What is the issue with Hem12? How come the human ortholog Hs-UROD did complement? Even if there is no single clear answer to these questions a hypothesis would be welcome.</p><p>3) For the hemH pink phenotype, to show that this is actually due to the specific substrate proposed, they should delete Sc-HEM14 (or another upstream function) to genetically verify that the pink phenotype disappears because formation of protoprophyrin IX should be prevented by this &quot;upstream&quot; mutation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting and important study on the replaceability of yeast gene by 1:1 orthologs from bacteria. To my knowledge, it is the largest systematic analysis of this kind and as such appears to be the best test of the 'Ortholog-Function Conjecture' to be reported so far (see Gabaldon &amp; Koonin 2013, as cited here). The proverbial glass is more than half-full which in itself not particularly surprising but, given the gulf between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, should be considered a resounding vindication of the conjecture.</p><p>Apart from the general point above, the main interest of this work lies in the analysis of various predictors and correlates of ortholog replaceability. I do not share the authors' surprise regarding the lack of correlation between replaceability and sequence conservation. It has been shown in a number of analyses that there is at best a very limited connection between sequence conservation and gene essentiality (Jordan IK, Rogozin IB, Wolf YI, Koonin EV.

It is really hard to believe that there are only 60 good orthologs between yeast and E. coli. What exactly were the criteria for choosing those? Further, they did not indicate what possibly was the issue with the 9/60 that did not have a complementation assay. Was it a problem with the corresponding yeast host strain(s) or was it difficult to clone these genes? This should be spelled out, perhaps as an explicit description in the Materials and methods section. Complete tables of all orthologs attempted for all the donor species tested, along with reasons for failure for the 9 that missed in bacteria for example, should be provided in the supplement.</italic> </p><p>To obtain clear loss-of-function phenotypes, we chose all <italic>E. coli</italic> orthologs of essential yeast genes with no lineage specific duplications (i.e., only 1:1 orthologs). Though in total there are 460 shared orthogroups between <italic>E. coli</italic> and yeast (as per InParanoid 8), only 58 fit the criteria of 1) yeast essentiality and 2) 1:1 orthology. We have now clarified this process in the text and in the Materials and methods section, and corrected a typo in the prior <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A(60</xref> vs. 58). As now described in the text (subsection “Many <italic>E. coli</italic> genes successfully complement lethal defects in their yeast orthologs”, first paragraph; subsection “Ortholog inference”), we used Inparanoid 8 to identify the 58 <italic>E. coli</italic> genes that are 1:1 orthologs of essential yeast genes. We cloned and confirmed the sequence of all 58 of these <italic>E. coli</italic> genes in yeast expression vectors. Of these, 51 provided informative assays, 5 were inconclusive, and 2 had no matched yeast strains available to test replaceability. We have modified the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>appropriately.</p><p><italic>2) From what I could conclude, in both bacteria and Arabidopsis there was an issue with complementing Sc-hem12. The bacteria one could not be integrated and both Arabidopsis orthologs failed to complement. What is the issue with Hem12? How come the human ortholog Hs-UROD did complement? Even if there is no single clear answer to these questions a hypothesis would be welcome.</italic> </p><p>Our observations were that the bacterial ortholog (<italic>Ec-hemE</italic>) of Sc-<italic>HEM12</italic> functionally replaced only when constitutively expressed under the GPD promoter. Human <italic>Hs-UROD</italic> also replaced when so expressed. However, plant versions did not work when constitutively expressed on plasmids. Thus, to address the issue of why we observed differential replaceability across variants of this gene, we performed the following analyses:</p><p>A) In the case of the Ec-<italic>HemE</italic> bacterial replacement at the yeast genomic locus, we suspect that the reason for not obtaining a replacement is that we used only 60bp of sequence homology to the flanking yeast locus, limiting the efficiency of the homologous repair. However, it is still possible that the bacterial version at the yeast native locus does not replace the yeast gene function, explaining the lack of positive clones. We did not pursue this particular case in more depth.</p><p>B) The human <italic>Hs-UROD</italic> version available in the human ORFeome had a single mutation resulting in a single amino acid change G303V. This variant is non-replaceable as explained in the text (subsection “Each yeast heme biosynthesis enzyme can be replaced by its human ortholog”, first paragraph). Reverting this mutation back to wild type (encoding glycine) allowed successful replacement of the yeast gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>C) The plant co-orthologs of the yeast gene Sc-<italic>Hem12 (</italic>AtHEME1/E2) did not replace the yeast gene when expressed under the control of the GPD promoter. In response to the referee’s queries, we have now tested and eliminated two possible reasons for this lack of replacement:</p><p>i) Plant heme pathway proteins possess chloroplast localization signals (CLS) at their N-termini, and we showed two cases where GFP-tagged plant proteins localize to mitochondria in yeast (At-PPOX1 and At-FC-I). However, the Sc- <italic>Hem12</italic> reactions take place in the cytosol. We therefore first suspected mislocalization to the mitochondria to be the likely reason for non-replaceability. We have now tested whether the removal of the At-HEME1 or AtHEME2 CLS would allow functional replacement; however, this was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>’’’). We also tested At-HEMC, an initially poor replacer. For this gene, removal of the CLS significantly enhanced replaceability compared to the wild type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>’’), demonstrating that the CLS did indeed contribute to non-replaceability in some cases.</p><p>ii) We next suspected functional divergence or sub-functionalization as a potential contributor to the lack of complementation. We co-expressed both paralogs (testing both the wild type and CLS-less versions) under the control of a GPD promoter on two different plasmids with different selections for transformation (SD-Ura and Hygromycin). Co-expression of both genes in the same strain failed to functionally replace the yeast gene function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>’’’), ruling out sub-functionalization as a likely reason for the failure to complement.</p><p>We speculate that there could be several other reasons why complementation failed, including unknown intermediate reactions, required localization in a special compartment (e.g. chloroplast) or different transcriptional/translational regulation in plants that might contribute to the lack of functional replaceability.</p><p>We have incorporated the new data into the manuscript, and indicate (subsection “Most yeast heme biosynthesis enzymes can also be successfully plant-ized”, last paragraph) that we tested multiple hypotheses to attempt to explain these trends.</p><p><italic>3) For the hemH pink phenotype, to show that this is actually due to the specific substrate proposed, they should delete Sc-HEM14 (or another upstream function) to genetically verify that the pink phenotype disappears because formation of protoprophyrin IX should be prevented by this &quot;upstream&quot; mutation.</italic> </p><p>We have now performed additional experiments to confirm our hypothesis regarding protoporphyrin IX accumulation. Using CRISPR, we deleted the <italic>Sc-HEM14</italic> ORF in wild type BY4741, Sc-<italic>hem15</italic>Δ::Ec-<italic>HemH,</italic> and Sc-<italic>hem15</italic>Δ::Ec-MLS-<italic>HemH</italic> strains.

I do not share the authors' surprise regarding the lack of correlation between replaceability and sequence conservation. It has been shown in a number of analyses that there is at best a very limited connection between sequence conservation and gene essentiality (Jordan IK, Rogozin IB, Wolf YI, Koonin EV.

Those genes in the 40-50% category had an enrichment in glucose metabolism (3 of the 7 genes).

We previously tested the general complementation rate of deletion alleles of essential yeast genes by plasmid-based copies of the same genes under the GPD promoter and found they replaced at a rate of 100% in 29 strains tested (Kachroo et al., Science, 2015). As we are using the same strain collections here, we expect a comparable (high) rate. We have now performed additional control experiments to confirm this: First, we tested whether 6 yeast deletion strains, which could not be rescued by their corresponding <italic>E. coli</italic> orthologs, became replaceable if the corresponding yeast genes were similarly heterologously expressed on a CEN plasmid. In all 6 cases, complementation was successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and Sc-HEM1 as reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we specifically tested the entire heme biosynthesis pathway for replaceability by the corresponding yeast genes when expressed either under the control of the heterologous GPD promoter or the native promoter (using MOBY collection yeast ORF plasmids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all but one case, the yeast genes replaced and the mode of expression was irrelevant to the efficiency of replaceability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, similar to the human ortholog Hs-UROS, the expression of the yeast gene, Sc-HEM4, was toxic when expressed under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A, 3B</xref>). This toxicity was relieved if the yeast protein was expressed under the native promoter, again similar to the human Hs-UROS, which showed functional replacement when integrated at the genomic locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These additional experiments have now been incorporated into the manuscript where indicated above.</p><p>Additional changes in the revised version: In addition to the suggestions of the reviewers, we also now plot all growth assays as a mean and standard deviation of N=3 replicate growth curves.</p></body></sub-article></article>
