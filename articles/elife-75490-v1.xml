candidalysin (CL) which damages target cell membranes. However, the mechanism that CL uses to permeabilize membranes is unclear. We reveal that CL forms membrane pores using a unique mechanism. Unexpectedly, CL readily assembled into polymers in solution. We propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL oligomer, which is sequentially added into a string configuration that can close into a loop. CL loops appear to spontaneously insert into the membrane to become pores. A CL mutation (G4W) inhibited the formation of polymers in solution and prevented pore formation in synthetic lipid systems. Epithelial cell studies showed that G4W CL failed to activate the danger response pathway, a hallmark of the pathogenic effect of CL. These results indicate that CL polymerization in solution is a necessary step for the damage of cellular membranes. Analysis of CL pores by atomic force microscopy revealed co-existence of simple depressions and more complex pores, which are likely formed by CL assembled in an alternate oligomer orientation. We propose that this structural rearrangement represents a maturation mechanism that stabilizes pore formation to achieve more robust cellular damage. To summarize, CL uses a previously unknown mechanism to damage membranes, whereby pre-assembly of CL loops in solution leads to formation of membrane pores. Our investigation not only unravels a new paradigm for the formation of membrane pores, but additionally identifies CL polymerization as a novel therapeutic target to treat candidiasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is the most common cause of yeast infections in humans.

This pathogen is part of the commensal flora, but can infect the skin, mouth, vagina, and gut, both in healthy and immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, <italic>C. albicans</italic> causes invasive candidiasis, an infection of the blood, heart, and other organs, which is common in hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015</xref>). Invasive candidiasis causes high rates of mortality (~50%), even when patients are treated with antifungal therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015</xref>).</p><p>It has been recently discovered that <italic>C. albicans</italic> causes toxicity by secreting onto the surface of epithelial cells a peptide toxin named candidalysin (CL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moyes et al., 2016</xref>). This virulence factor binds to the plasma membrane of target human epithelial cells and compromises the permeability barrier, causing uncontrolled Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and release of cellular proteins on to the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Naglik et al., 2019</xref>). The resulting cellular damage activates a signaling cascade that triggers the release of pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Naglik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson et al., 2018b</xref>), which participate in the immune response to <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. Furthermore, CL plays a second pathogenic role, as it also attacks the membrane of mononuclear phagocytes which would otherwise fight the fungal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasper et al., 2018</xref>). CL is necessary for infection by <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of CL activity is a promising avenue to fight infection of this human pathogen. However, the development of drugs to counter the action of CL is hampered by the lack of understanding of how this peptide damages membranes.</p><p>Here, we describe how the use of biophysical techniques (mass photometry, native mass spectrometry, analytical ultracentrifugation, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, oriented circular dichroism, and liposome dye release assay), modeling, and cellular assays allowed us to elucidate that CL damages membranes by forming pores that are assembled through a unique molecular mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CL assembles into polymers in solution</title><p>When we ran CL on an SDS-PAGE, we observed not only the expected monomeric band running at ~4 kDa, but also a band of slower electrophoretic mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result suggests that CL self-assembles in solution, and we hypothesized that this event might be related to its ability to damage cellular membranes. We therefore investigated CL oligomerization, first using native ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS), a sensitive analytical technique that can isolate and characterize transient oligomers based on their mass-to-charge ratio (<italic>m/z</italic>), shape, size, and charge. IM-MS analysis of CL revealed several oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The mass spectral peak at <italic>m/z</italic> 3311, which corresponds to a nominal oligomer-to-charge ratio (<italic>n/</italic>z) of <italic>1/1</italic>, was notable due to its high intensity when compared to the surrounding oligomers. Analysis of the arrival time distributions (ATD) of this mass spectral peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) revealed two features that correspond to higher-order CL oligomers. We conservatively assigned the longest arrival time feature (salmon) as an 8-mer with <italic>z = +8</italic>. This assignment was performed comparing the isotopic spacing and drift time of the features within the ATD with other mass spectral peaks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since a species with a high charge will travel faster than one with a lower charge, the fastest arrival time species (green) is proposed to be a large oligomer resulting from the self-assembly of the 8-mer. The ATD data therefore suggest that CL forms an 8-mer that self-assembles. Given that CL adopts helical structure in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moyes et al., 2016</xref>), we built an atomistic model of the 8-mer by aligning CL’s sequence into the eight-helix coiled coil formed by CC-Type2-II (PDB ID 6G67). After the resulting structure was energy minimized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the theoretical collisional cross-section of the model, 2500 Å<sup>2</sup>, agreed with the experimental value of 2567 Å<sup>2</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CL forms complex assemblies in solution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE of CL shows a~4 kDa monomeric band, and a band corresponding to a large oligomer.

It is unambiguous from the isotope spacings that the peaks represent multiple very high charge state species. Our instrument can routinely discern up to <italic>z = +6</italic> within the ion mobility plot, but in this case, the spacing of the most abundant species is too small to be resolved. The trimer is largest species with a resolved isotopic spacing as shown in panel A. We conservatively assigned the feature next to the trimer as a tetramer. Note that the difference in arrival time of the features decrease from the dimer to the trimer (4ms), and the trimer to the tetramer (1.61ms). One would expect the arrival time difference between the tetramer and a pentamer to be smaller than 1.61ms, since the contribution of one monomeric unit decreases as the oligomeric assembly grows. However, the difference in arrival time of the tetramer to the most intense feature is 2.92ms, which allows us to deduce that this feature must be a large oligomer (n&gt;5). (<bold>B</bold>) Mass spectral peak of <italic>m/z 3311</italic>. Spacing that roughly correlates to <italic>z = +8</italic> are highlighted within the spectrum.

This follows the expectant logic since <italic>n/z</italic>=8/9 has a higher charge state than <italic>n/z</italic>=8/8, and thus traverses the drift cell faster. On the other hand, <italic>n/z</italic>=7/8 has the same charge state as <italic>n/z</italic>=8/8, but is a smaller oligomer, which results in a shorter arrival time.

We first performed analytical ultracentrifugation of CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The sedimentation velocity results reveal a low sedimentation peak, likely corresponding to a CL monomer, and several larger assemblies, in agreement with the IM-MS data analysis. We next used mass photometry (MP), a technique that allows mass determination of biomolecules with single-molecule resolution from their combined light scattering and reflection signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asor and Kukura, 2022</xref>). While MP is insensitive to the mass of an CL 8-mer (26.5 kDa), as the resolution of the instrument is limited to particles &gt;50 kDa, MP has high sensitivity to larger species. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> displays MP data of CL, consisting of a main peak and a long tail. The main peak agrees with the mass of two bound 8-mers, while the larger mass peaks would correspond to the progressive assembly of 8-mers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The long tail of the MP data reaches beyond 600 kDa, which would correspond to the assembly of tens of 8-mers. Taken together, the four techniques reveal that CL readily forms large oligomers in solution and suggest that the 8-mer is the seed for CL self-assembly into large structures.</p><p>We employed microscopy to resolve the assemblies that CL forms in solution. We first performed negative-stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and observed that CL does not form amorphous aggregates, but instead assembles into linear structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The TEM data revealed a basic structural unit, which seemed to grow in a step-wise fashion into polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, side panels). The longer polymers curved, and in some cases closed in on themselves, forming a loop with diameter ≥10 nm. We further studied CL polymerization by atomic force microscopy (AFM) since this technique provides high resolution images of single particles and can also be readily used to image membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dufrêne et al., 2017</xref>). AFM images of CL adsorbed onto mica in buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) agreed with the TEM results and confirmed that CL polymerizes and can form loops.

We tested this possibility by using the CL 8-mer model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to generate simulated AFM images through morphological dilation of the estimated tip geometry for the 8-mer, either on its horizontal or vertical orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, insets).

Taken together, these results support the notion that CL assembles into an 8-mer in solution that acts as an intermediate step in the self-assembly process.</p><p>Polymer growth of CL 8-mers in the horizontal orientation (lying flat on a surface) can occur by addition of a second 8-mer in two fundamental modes, side-by-side or head-to-toe.

To differentiate between the two types of pores, they are henceforth referred to as ‘unrimmed’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and ‘rimmed’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) pores, respectively. Both types of pores were free to diffuse in the bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that CL is not immobilized by interactions with the mica surface. Occasionally rimmed and unrimmed pores were observed in the same image area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that variations in imaging conditions were not responsible for driving the system between rimmed and unrimmed states. Rimmed pores generally have a smaller area than unrimmed pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Unrimmed pores have a broad area distribution, with the main population at 41 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, gray), while the rimmed pores have a narrower distribution, and an area peak at 26 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, black). Selected areas of the samples were imaged repeatedly to produce a time series of both unrimmed and rimmed pores. A representative unrimmed pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top row) shows dynamic behavior, with large variations over time. The pore depth visibly varies, flickering between deep and shallow states. On the other hand, the rimmed pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom row) appears deeper, and is more stable, as shown by the constant profile over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Upon imaging the exact same area again, we observed features similar to the CL polymers and loops detected in the absence of lipid bilayers. Indeed, loops, often inter-connected, were observed where pores were previously present (see blue arrows). Linear features similar to the CL polymers observed for solution samples were also present, which had been previously obscured by the presence of a bilayer.

Loops with a side-by-side orientation were rare in the solution data, but were common in CL samples that had been exposed to lipid. Indeed, comparison between the model and the rimmed pores data suggest that in these pores the 8-mers switch from the head-to-toe orientation found in the unrimmed pores (gray square, side panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), to a side-by-side orientation (black square). Specifically, the modeled areas predict that unrimmed pores contain six to eight head-to-toe 8-mers, while rimmed pores are formed by six to twelve side-to-side 8-mers. Therefore, we propose that a rimmed pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) appears when the 8-mer subunits in an unrimmed pore rotate 90 degrees, switching from the head-to-toe to the side-by-side arrangement (compare insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>We interrogated the results of the modeling using circular dichroism (CD). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows that CL forms, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moyes et al., 2016</xref>), an α-helical structure in solution, as evidenced by the spectral minima at 208 and 222 nm. We also observed that the presence of lipid vesicles promotes modest additional helix formation, possibly by growth of the α-helix and its ends. The orientation of the CL α-helix with respect to the membrane plane can be determined using oriented CD (OCD), which is performed using supported lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). OCD can discriminate between helices aligned along the membrane plane, and transmembrane (TM) helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, inset). The OCD data of CL displayed low intensity, and a minimum at ~225 nm and a maximum at ~195 nm, similarly to the expected result for TM helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stefanski et al., 2021</xref>). The OCD spectrum therefore indicates that the predominant orientation of helices in CL in membranes was inserted across the membrane, in a TM orientation. This is the proposed helical alignment that is expected in the side-by-side 8-mer arrangement of the rimmed pores. However, the presence of a depression at ~210 nm agrees with the presence of a population of α-helices oriented along the plane of the membrane, like those expected for the unrimmed pore. Therefore, the OCD result supports the presence of a combination of rimmed and unrimmed CL pores with the respective helical orientations predicted by the AFM modeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mutational analysis of CL provides mechanistic insights</title><p>Our experimental data and modeling indicate that CL 8-mers in solution polymerize in a head-to-toe fashion.

The AFM results agreed with the MP, as I9A formed long polymers and closed loops, while G4W formed few large structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, compare top and bottom panels). We quantified the AFM images by measuring the volume of all particles, and compared these results with AFM data of WT CL. The resulting <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows that G4W does not efficiently assemble into large (&gt;1000 nm<sup>3</sup>) structures, while WT and I9A do. However, only the I9A variant forms a significant number of very large assemblies (&gt;3000 nm<sup>3</sup>), which generally corresponded with over-sized loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, side panel). Since the AFM data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) indicate that linear polymers need to close to form membrane pores, a key parameter for membrane disruption would be the ability of polymers to close into loops. We determined the frequency of loop formation for the three peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), and observed that there is overall agreement between the ability to form polymers and the loop formation propensity. Consistent with the model that loops in solution become pores, we observed that I9A formed larger membrane pores than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), while we did not observe membrane pores formed by G4W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Additionally, the higher I9A pore area has a corresponding increase in the inner area of the loops compared to WT CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the pore architecture is defined by the loops.</p><p>We studied next the ability of CL WT and the two variants to disrupt the integrity of POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) vesicles in suspension. Specifically, we carried out an assay where membrane damage is measured by the fluorescence de-quenching that occurs when the dye calcein is released from vesicles. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> shows the kinetics of membrane disruption caused by the addition of WT and the two CL variants. We observed that G4W did not induce membrane disruption, in agreement with the lack of membrane pores observed by AFM. WT CL efficiently disrupted membranes, but I9A was the most efficacious at disrupting membrane integrity, as expected from the high loop formation probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and the presence of larger membrane pores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The differences in leakage were consistent over a variety of peptide concentrations in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). To study why the G4W mutation impacted the ability to disrupt membranes, we performed CD and OCD experiments on the variants. CD revealed that G4W showed reduced helical structure in solution and in the presence of POPC liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> also shows changes in the OCD spectrum for G4W in comparison to WT and I9A, which indicate substantial differences in how this variant interacts with lipid membranes. When we performed SDS-PAGE of the variants, we observed that I9A displayed higher levels of oligomeric intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This result suggests that the higher tendency of I9A to polymerize is due to its enhanced oligomerization ability. G4W, on the other hand, displayed similar levels of oligomers as WT. We therefore speculate that a W present at the N<sub>t</sub> might impair the ability of two oligomers to bind. This effect would therefore reduce the formation of polymers, and explain the loss-of-function effect of this mutation. Overall, the mutational data confirm that CL uses a novel molecular mechanism, where the peptide first self-assembles in solution to form linear polymers that close into pore-competent soluble loops. The results of the loss-of-function G4W variant revealed that formation of polymers in solution is a necessary step for the formation of membrane pores.</p><p>CL pores damage the plasma membrane of epithelial cells. This attack triggers the activation of danger response signaling, which induces phosphorylation of MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP1) and subsequent overexpression of the transcription factor c-Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richardson et al., 2018a</xref>).

The I9A variant also induced strong MKP1 phosphorylation, but significantly higher c-Fos expression. Conversely, G4W CL failed to activate the danger response signaling pathway altogether, revealing an overall agreement between the effect of CL mutations in biophysical and cellular assays. Our data therefore indicate that mutations that alter polymerization impact epithelial cell damage response signaling.

Here, we show that CL follows a different molecular mechanism for pore formation. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that CL forms both linear and closed loop polymers <italic>before</italic> binding to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Further, acting as soluble pre-pores, closed loop CL polymers insert into lipid bilayers to cause membrane damage without any observable conformational change.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Candidalysin utilizes a novel mechanism of pore formation to attack human cell membranes.</title><p>The CL monomer oligomerizes into an intermediate oligomer, which we propose is 8-mer.

Scale bars in the AFM images are 10 nm.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75490-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is interesting to compare the topography and mode of action of CL pores to those formed by other PFTs and other proteins. AFM imaging revealed that CL (3.3 kDa) assembles into intermediate size membrane pores, of diameter ≤80 Å, deduced from area distribution peaks &lt;50 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>) and assuming circularity, which matched many of the pores observed. This diameter is smaller than the well-studied aqueous pores formed by the proteins gasdermin-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mulvihill et al., 2018</xref>), suilysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leung et al., 2014</xref>) and perfringolysin O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramachandran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>), of molecular weights in the 50–60 kDa range, but is probably larger than pores formed by α-hemolysin (diameter: 14–46 Å, 33 kDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song et al., 1996</xref>). Further differences exist between the assembly mechanism of these proteins and the mode of action of CL. Multiple PFT families such as hemolysins form large pre-pore structures at the membrane surface prior to insertion and pore maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dal Peraro and van der Goot, 2016</xref>). In contrast, CL unrimmed pores present no features above the upper leaflet of the bilayer. Instead, these dynamic structures appear topographically similar to those induced by the antimicrobial peptide melittin and its derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pittman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). The rimmed CL pores are quite distinct from the unrimmed pores. Not only are they more stable on the timescale of AFM imaging (&gt;0.1 s), but rimmed pores have a punctate pattern about their periphery. Such structure is reminiscent of the pores formed by the N-terminal segment of gasdermin-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mulvihill et al., 2018</xref>) however, the overall size of the CL rim is smaller, only reaching ~0.3 nm outside each side of the bilayer surface. This height corresponds to the difference between the 8-mer (4.6 nm) and the DOPC bilayer thickness (4.0 nm, as measured by AFM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This observation suggests that the pore rims arise when the ends of the TM helices of the 8-mer stick out of the bilayer surface upon 90 degree rotation of the 8-mer in the unrimmed pore, which transitions from the head-to-toe into the side-to-side arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Some rimmed pores were decorated with protrusions covering the whole pore periphery, forming a corona (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, other pores were only partially covered with puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This observation suggests that maturation into rimmed pores occurs progressively and is not an all-or-none process.</p><p>Pore maturation for perfringolysin O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Czajkowsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>) and suilysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leung et al., 2014</xref>), involves a <italic>vertical collapse</italic> that allows formation of a TM pore. In contrast, the rearrangement of the 8-mer orientation that leads to rim formation causes CL to protrude from the bilayer and could be defined as a <italic>vertical swell</italic> between the two types of pores. The reason why pore maturation in CL occurs is not clear, but it might be related to the three K residues located at the C<sub>t</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the unrimmed pores, the head-to-toe orientation of the 8-mers would likely place the positive charges of the K side chain in contact with lipid molecules, resulting in a meta-stable configuration. However, in the vertical 8-mer orientation found in the rimmed pore, the K residues are expected to be solvent-exposed, resulting in a more stable conformation. An additional difference with some pore-forming proteins is that imaging of bilayers in the presence of CL did not show open polymers. However, bilayer removal revealed that linear CL polymers insert into the membranes, but they cannot be readily observed as they do not disturb the bilayer surface or protrude significantly from it. This behavior contrasts with the arcs formed by suilysin, as these rigid open polymers were able to remove lipid molecules from the bilayer to cause perforations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leung et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we compare the CL mechanism with the membrane attack (MAC) system that forms membrane pores in pathogens. MAC employs the 71 kDa C9 protein, which polymerizes in solution prior to forming pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Song et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dudkina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiScipio and Hugli, 1985</xref>). However, C9 needs other components of the MAC system inserted into the membrane (e.g. C7 and C8), which then serve to recruit multiple C9s. Hence significant distinctions remain between the pore-forming mode of action of CL and that of the MAC system.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we elucidate how CL forms the membrane pores that damage cells infected by <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Our data show that CL preassembles into a pore-competent loop conformation in solution. To the best of our knowledge, this process represents a novel mechanism of pore formation, since other PFT that form aqueous pores require binding to the plasma membrane as monomers to self-assemble. The assembly of CL into an insertion-competent state in solution might provide an infectivity advantage for <italic>C. albicans</italic>, as it could facilitate faster membrane damage. At the same time, we propose that this assembly mechanism might constitute a therapeutic opportunity to inhibit CL pore formation. Targeting membrane pores presents several drug delivery drawbacks, and it is therefore significantly more challenging than a soluble target. However, drug molecules that prevent CL polymerization in solution could be used as therapeutics to fight <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection. Specifically, a molecule that inhibits the formation of CL loops would be expected to prevent the assembly of the membrane pores that damage human epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Our data suggest that the oligomeric state of the basic assembly unit is a CL 8-mer, as indicated by the native mass spectrometry data and this assignment is consistent with AFM volume analysis. However, it is intrinsically challenging to precisely determine the stoichiometry of large oligomeric assemblies. We therefore cannot rule out that CL assembles instead through an intermediate of different stoichiometry (e.g., a 7-mer or a 9-mer). High resolution methods will also be required to confirm the directionality that the CL oligomers adopt in the polymer, to confirm that they are aligned head-to-tail. We additionally identified the loss-of-function variant G4W, and the possible gain-of-function I9A. Future studies that unravel how these mutations affect the biophysical parameters that govern peptide self-assembly and membrane interaction, are expected to shed light on the specific reasons behind the disparate effects of the mutations. Additionally, these investigations could allow us to determine if CL pore formation is indeed under kinetic control, as we suspect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the two interacting 8-mers was performed using the same package and force field. The initial structure was minimized using the steepest decent method and solvated in a TIP3P cubic water box (a=14.03 nm). Chloride anions were added to neutralize the charges. Solvent and volume equilibration simulations in NPT ensemble (T=300 K and <italic>P</italic>=1 bar) were performed to optimize the box size, followed by 45-ns NPT simulations at 300 K. The LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hess, 2008</xref>) was employed to constrain bonds between heavy atoms and hydrogen, and the SETTLE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>) was used for water molecules. These constraints allowed an integration time step of 2.0 fs.

Lipids were dried under argon gas and stored in a vacuum overnight prior to use in experiments. Lipid films were resuspended as described below. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared using a Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) with a 100 nm filter (Whatman, United Kingdom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Atomic force microscopy</title><p>A sample of one hundred milligrams of DOPC in chloroform was divided into microcentrifuge tubes and dried under argon gas to form uniform films.

A dry mechanical roughing pump (XDS5, Edwards) was used to minimize the probability of contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schaefer et al., 2022</xref>). Samples were back-filled with argon, sealed, and stored at –20 °C. At the time of extrusion, AFM imaging buffer was added to swell the lipids. The lipid solution was extruded (Liposofast, Avestin) through 100 nm membranes 25 times to form unilamellar vesicles. The solution was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until the time of the experiment. A phosphorus assay was conducted to determine lipid concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stewart, 1980</xref>). For AFM imaging of CL in solution, stock aliquots of CL were diluted in imaging buffer to the desired concentration (typically 333 nM). A 90 µL droplet was added to freshly cleaved mica and incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. Samples were rinsed from above the surface using buffer exchange (~100 µL of imaging buffer were exchanged over the surface 5–6 times). Images were collected in imaging buffer with biolever mini tips (Olympus, <italic>k</italic>~0.1 N/m, <italic>f</italic><sub>o</sub>~30 kHz in fluid) using tapping mode (Cypher, Asylum Research). Care was taken to keep the magnitude of the tip sample force to ≤100 pN during imaging deduced by comparing the free space tapping amplitude (∼5 nm) to the imaging set point amplitude (∼4 nm). Under such conditions, minimal protein distortion is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanganna Gari et al., 2013</xref>). As is typical in AFM, lateral image scales are significantly larger than the false color vertical scales.</p><p>To image pores, a method for forming lipid bilayers via vesicle rupture was adapted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schaefer et al., 2022</xref>). An aliquot of DOPC liposomes was diluted to 300 µM and CL was diluted to specific concentrations The DOPC + CL solutions were incubated in a microcentrifuge tube for 10 min, with an additional mixing at the 5-min mark to encourage peptide diffusion (a pipette was inserted into the solution and the plunger depressed and released 5–6 times). Immediately after incubation in solution, 75 µL of the solution was deposited onto freshly cleaved mica and incubated for another 30 min. Material remaining in solution and loosely bound particles were removed by washing via buffer exchange (~100 µL of imaging buffer exchanged 5–6 times). All incubations were performed at room temperature (25 °C). Imaging was done in imaging buffer at ~35 °C. The underlying structure of CL peptides was revealed by removing the lipid bilayer with the non-ionic detergent dodecyl beta-D-maltoside (DβM). Stock DβM (196 mM) was diluted in the imaging buffer to 1.5 times the critical micelle concentration (CMC). After imaging pores, the AFM tip was lifted and 75 µL DβM added to the surface and incubated 15 min. To ensure all lipid and detergent molecules were removed from the surface, the samples were heavily rinsed (~100 µL of imaging buffer were exchanged 10–12 times). The remaining CL was then imaged in the imaging buffer. Analysis of solution data was performed using commercial software (Asylum Research, Inc). Pores were analyzed using the Hessian blob algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marsh et al., 2018</xref>). Probability density plots were generated using Epanechnikov kernels and the vertical axes were normalized (integrated to unity area). The number of Gaussian distributions was selected by minimizing the Bayesian information criterion for each model.</p><p>For AFM simulations, the tip was modeled as two overlapping spheres of different radii (<italic>R</italic>=8 and 4 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schaefer et al., 2022</xref>) and the CL 8-mer was positioned in specified orientations. For a single octamer, the geometry of the simulated image (volume = 360 nm<sup>3</sup>) roughly corresponds with the geometry of the smallest subunits observed in AFM (volume of primary experimental peak ± σ=234 ± 130 nm<sup>3</sup>). Polymeric arrangements of the octamer subunit were made by aligning them head-to-toe in linear or in loop conformations. The inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> compares the first four peak locations in the experimental data to the volumes of simulated curved arrangements of 1–4 subunits. Each of the simulated volumes agree with the experimental volume peaks within error. Curved simulations were chosen for this comparison because a linear model underestimates the measured volume due to a lack of curvature-dependent convolution in the simulation. To avoid volume degeneracies, only small (1–4 subunit) features are analyzed. The persistence length was calculated using Easyworm software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lamour et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Circular dichroism spectroscopy</title><p>The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of candidalysin was collected in the presence and absence of POPC liposomes.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ioan iacovache (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all agreed that this is an interesting study that demonstrates a novel mechanism for membrane permeabilization by toxins, but found that some of the claims require additional experiments. These experiments are considered to be minimal, and already overlap with some of the studies already presented. Therefore, it is anticipated that they could be carried out in a reasonable amount of time and included in the revised manuscript. If this is not possible, then another option is to revise the manuscript significantly to tamper these claims.

This raises the question of what defines the size of the polymers in solution. If these polymers are in equilibrium, the probability would maximum for either the shortest unit (an octomer) or to a maximum size, which in practice means that the size distribution would be determined by some kinetic trapping. In that case, the polymer size is expected to be strongly dependent on detailed experimental protocols and not be very robust. And I would expect that the size/area distribution for the &quot;rimmed pores' would be much wider than for the &quot;unrimmed pores&quot;, since the latter have a area that is (to within some flexibility) defined by the loop-shaped polymers in solution. Figure 3C shows some difference in area distributions, but it is far from clear how robust this areal analysis is given the difference in pore profiles. Remarkably, the AFM data in Figure 3A, B, D suggest that rimmed and unrimmed pores have very similar areas, suggesting that their size is set by a very similar assembly mechanism. The manuscript conclusions should be clarified, substantiated or adjusted in light to this. Another way of interpreting this is by noting that the assembly mechanism appears relatively robust, with the total pore assembly being rather robust against whether that assembly happens in solution or on the membrane.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the majority of the presented data is clear and easily accessible several additions could benefit the reader:</p><p>1.

We suspect that the additional data obtained using some of the experimental techniques suggested might not definitively support that the oligomer is indeed an 8-mer (and not, for instance, an 7-mer or a 9-mer). Therefore, we consider that the most prudent course is to follow the route suggested by the editor, and we have tempered our claim that the 8-mer definitively is the particles that assembles into a polymer. Accordingly, the updated manuscript has been modified to include this change throughout the text. Additionally, we have added a new closing section, titled “Limitations of the study”, where we discuss that we cannot rule out that the stoichiometry of the oligomer is slightly different, despite the presence of an 8-mer being supported by three different techniques (mass photometry, atomic force microscopy, and mass spectrometry). Instead of mentioning that the mechanism for polymer formation does require an 8-mer, we introduce the term “intermediate oligomer“, the presence of which is observed by AUC, AFM and TEM. We have additionally modified the abstract to point out that we merely propose that the basic structural unit in polymer formation is a CL 8-mer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the model shown in Figure 1D should be moved to a supplementary figure where a more complete description of the modeling variability and quality can be depicted.

We also provide additional explanation of the interpretation of the IM-MS data a new Figure 1- Supplementary 2. We briefly summarize our major points here: given a nominal of n/z (oligomer size to charge ratio), one can determine n if z is known. The isotope spacings (mainly due to the difference between <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C) suggest that the octamer (Δm/z = 0.125) is among the major oligomers at m/z 3311. Because CD data showed that CL adopts a largely α-helical conformation in the absence of lipid, we modeled the 8-mer as a cylinder composed of 8 helices. The resulting theoretical collision cross section (CCS) agrees well with the experimental CCS if we assign the ATD feature at ~ 32 ms to be an octamer.</p><p>We followed the reviewers’ suggestion and we explicitly considered whether the feature could be assigned as a 9-mer. Based on structural similarity and polypeptide length, the closest 9-helix structure found corresponded to the central segment of the integral membrane light-harvesting complex II (LH2) (PDB ID 1NKZ; 2 Å resolution). The resulting 9-mer model of CL is shown In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. We computed its theoretical CCS, and the value is significantly larger than our experimental value (if the feature at 32 ms were assigned as a 9-mer), i.e., 4,723 Å2 vs. 2,923 Å2. This result argues against the possibility of CL forming an 9-mer.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75490-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mutants studied here should be featured more completely with additional data characterizing their behavior, particularly SDS and native-PAGE, CD and oriented CD and solution oligomerization to determine that the effect observed is specific to the change in oligomerization.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments for the G4W and I9A mutants (shown in figure 5C and Figure 6—figure supplement 3), which support our previous conclusions.

Oriented CD (OCD) results also showed agreement between WT and I9A, while G4W again showed changes; in this case, the OCD spectrum of G4W showed less transmembrane features compared to WT, as revealed by a ratio closer to 1 of the ellipticity at 208 and 225 nm.

To address this potential problem, we have repeated the OCD experiments. Initially these were performed using lipid bilayers composed of cholesterol, PE and PC lipids. The updated figure 5C shows data performed in POPC, which shows similar results. With regards to the rest of experiments, DOPC was used for the AFM experiments because we have had more success with this lipid spreading on the mica surface than with POPC. However, we do not anticipate qualitative changes in experimental results between DOPC and POPC bilayers. The new experiments allow for a better comparison between experimental results, as all were performed in lipids of identical headgroup composition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific queries/requests for revision to what is overall a fine manuscript, in my opinion:</p><p>– A really confusing aspect of the authors' interpretation is that they postulate a mechanism by which linear polymers of octamers can land on the membrane to form &quot;rimmed pores&quot; (see Figure 8).

Thus, it is unsurprising that the areas of the rimmed and unrimmed pores are similar.

A slight area reduction is consistent with our AFM data comparing unrimmed and rimmed pores (Figure 3C). The kinetics of the loop assembly itself are intriguing and under investigation, but outside the scope of this work. However, we have added a new section at the end of the discussion where we mention that the loops that we observed might not be in equilibrium, and hence are under kinetic control.

We thank the reviewer for giving us a chance to clarify the construction of the octamer model. In the new Figure 1 —figure supplement 2, we show the isotope spacing roughly corresponding to z = +8, indicating that the most abundant species is n/z = 8/8 (an octamer with +8 charges). Our assignments were consistent with the ion mobilities of species with the same number of charges but smaller in size (n/z = 7/8) and species with the same size but higher charge state (n/z = 8/9). We modeled the octamer by taking into account two pieces of evidence: (a) the circular dichroism data showed that CL has α-helix structure, and (b) the homology modeling using ROSETTA that also suggested that the peptide monomer is α-helical. Thus, we start with an α-helix monomeric unit and construct an octamer. To do so, we searched the RCSB databank for α-helix multimers. The hits included 1PI7, 2H6Y, 3R3K, 6O35, 6G56, and 6G67. We then used EMBOSS to align the primary sequence of CL with the primary sequences of the structures from the RCSB. The best alignment was obtained with 6G67 which is a parallel eight-helix coiled coil CC-Type2-II. We then threaded the primary sequence of CL onto the backbone of 6G67 and minimized the structure with molecular dynamics (MD) using the Gromacs software and the CHARMM force field. Finally, we calculated the theoretical collision cross-section (CCS) of the octamer model and compared it with the experimental CCS. It appears that the theoretical CCS (in helium; 2500 Å2) is in an excellent agreement with the experimental CCS (2539 Å2). We used the Mobcal software and the trajectory method to compute the theoretical CCS.</p><p>The primary sequence alignments of CL and candidate peptides from the RCSB databank are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75490-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We purposely avoided to try to correlate the AUC peaks observed at 2 S, 4.5 S and 9 S with specific oligomeric states, as we suspect that the different oligomeric states of CL are dynamically interacting in the time resolution of the AUC experiments. In interacting systems, the boundaries are “reaction” boundaries and not species (Ann N Y Acad Sci; 1969 Nov 7;164(1):192-225. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb14039.x.). According to this, unless you have a kinetically frozen system, the sedimentation coefficients cannot be accurately explained as species, as they merely represent the extent of reaction. Therefore, to avoid an erroneous interpretation, we think it is safer to acknowledge that AUC might not be able to quantitatively identify the identity of the oligomers we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Can you comment on possibility (or impossibility) of head-to-head dimerization of 8-mers?</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to speculate! One can certainly contemplate the possibility of head-to-head dimers. However, in this situation polymer growth would require two types of interactions, head-to-head and tail-to-tail, instead of one. However, these two interaction modes would have to overcome electrostatic repulsion, as both the Nt and Ct would be charged at neutral pH. We are of the philosophical opinion that Nature is more likely to find the easiest solution, i.e. only head-to-tail. Despite any hypotheses that we might have, the fact is that we don’t have data to support either orientation possibility for 8-mer dimerization. We indicate this in the updated version of the manuscript (in the results and the new Limitations of the Study s in the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

Model of the dimer of 8-mers, Suppl Figure 6. How was the model prepared? Please mark N and C termini. Is the depicted dimer head-to-toe? Hard to see.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Molecular Dynamics Simulation section, we describe how the 16-mer model was obtained. Briefly, starting from the octamer, we manually align the two octamer units in different orientations (head-to-head, head-to-toe, toe-to-toe) and then performed 45-ns simulations in explicit water using the GROMACS software and the CHARMM force field. The resulting structure of the head-to-toe, which is the most stable, is shown below. We have added a Figure 6—figure supplement 1, which contains the detailed figure of two 8-mers interacting in a head-to-toe orientation, where the N-termini are highlighted in red, and the C-termini in blue.</p><p>More importantly, we noted that in the IM-MS data of m/z 3311, there is another major feature with shorter arrival time than the octamer. Based on the difference in arrival time between the two features, the left feature should be a larger oligomer than the octamer (in IM-MS, higher-order oligomers travel faster than smaller one due to the effect of charges outweighs the effect of size). Now, if we assign the feature to a 16-mer, the experimental CCS is 4446 Å2. We computed the theoretical CCS of the 16-mer model from MD and the theoretical CCS is 4517 Å2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

As with regards of a helical extension being part of the conformational change, it is certainly an interesting possibility, but out data cannot resolve it. We think that both types of pores would be functional (able to permeate membranes), but the rimmed pore would probably be slightly more stable. Transmembrane pores are difficult to identify in AFM due to tip size constraints. This is mentioned on page 7 of the manuscript. A study of the energetic landscape of the peptides in the lipid bilayer would be very interesting. Such studies are challenging (usually involving force spectroscopy) and beyond the scope of this work. Any comments on the energetics of the conformational change undergone by the CL assemblies cannot be made at this point based on the experiments performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18.

Monomeric forms of CDCs (perfringolysin) is 50-60 kDa, in the text it sounds as this was the Mw of the pore.

It sounds confusing. Please revise this.The pores of CDCs and hemolysins are very different to those of CL, the mechanism of pore formation is very different (to the one proposed by you).</p><p>Hemolysins, CDC, MACPF etc undergo large conformational changes upon pore formation.
