Due to its oxidative effects, iron accumulation is implicated in the process of aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism for this increase in iron with aging, and whether this increase is localized to specific cellular compartment(s), are not known. Here, we measured the levels of iron in different tissues of aged mice, and demonstrated that while cytosolic non-heme iron is increased in the liver and muscle tissue, only the aged brain cortex exhibits an increase in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial non-heme iron. This increase in brain iron is associated with elevated levels of local hepcidin mRNA and protein in the brain. We also demonstrate that the increase in hepcidin is associated with increased ubiquitination and reduced levels of the only iron exporter, ferroportin-1 (FPN1). Overall, our studies provide a potential mechanism for iron accumulation in the brain through increased local expression of hepcidin, and subsequent iron accumulation due to decreased iron export. Additionally, our data support that aging is associated with mitochondrial and cytosolic iron accumulation only in the brain and not in other tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Aging</kwd><kwd>Iron</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 HL127646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leducq Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL140973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL138982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ardehali</surname><given-names>Hossein</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aging is associated with mitochondrial and cytosolic iron accumulation in the brain, which is through increased local expression of hepcidin, and subsequent iron accumulation due to decreased iron export through ferroportin-1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron is an essential molecule for almost every organism on earth. It is generally found naturally in two oxidation states, either as the oxidized form of ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), or as the reduced form of ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>). Ferrous iron is the major form of iron used in mammalian cells, and due to the scarcity of the reduced form of iron on earth, mammalian cells have developed mechanisms for efficient uptake of oxidized iron through its solubilization by acidification, followed by reduction and its cellular transportation. Iron can donate and accept electrons from various substrates due to its unique oxidation-reduction properties, making it an important cofactor in mammalian cells. Iron is also essential for heme and Fe-S clusters and exerts other biological effects through its role in processes such as demethylation, dehydrogenation, and reduction of sulfur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koleini et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Due to its oxidative effect, iron accumulation is hypothesized to lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage that accelerates the process of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Aging has been shown to be associated with iron accumulation in various organs and tissues both in humans and in animal models of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether iron accumulation occurs in all organs or is specific to one organ is not known. In the brain, iron accumulation has been demonstrated both in animal models of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benkovic and Connor, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hahn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roskams and Connor, 1994</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartzokis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartzokis et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartzokis et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zecca et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, it is now believed that iron accumulation may be the cause of neuronal cell death in some of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lei et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the importance of iron in brain disorders, the mechanism by which iron accumulates in the brain with aging is not known. Previous studies suggest that iron homeostasis in the brain is dependent on normal expression of genes involved in iron uptake into the cells and its cellular storage and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Qian and Wang, 1998</xref>). Another study demonstrated that only one protein involved in the iron import pathway, divalent metal transporter (DMT1) was altered in aged brain, while the levels of key proteins involved in iron import and export, transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), and ferroportin-1 (FPN1) were unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanism for the age-related increase in iron accumulation in the brain remains unclear.</p><p>In this paper, we assessed the levels of iron in different tissues and cellular compartments with aging in mice. Since it has been reported that age-related brain atrophy, which is associated with age-related cognitive decline, is evident in the brain cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nyberg et al., 2010</xref>), we selected the cerebral cortex as the brain region in the present study. We demonstrate that the cytosolic non-heme iron is increased in the muscle and liver tissue, while the brain cortex has increased non-heme iron both in the mitochondria and in the cytosol. We also demonstrate that hepcidin levels are upregulated in the brain cortex of aged mice, which is associated with ubiquitination of FPN1 and a reduction in its protein levels. Thus, our studies suggest that local expression of hepcidin in the brain may be a driver in increasing iron levels due to a reduction in iron export by FPN1 degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Iron is increased in the brain cortex with aging</title><p>To determine whether iron accumulates in tissues with aging, we measured heme and non-heme iron levels in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of liver, skeletal muscle, and brain tissues. These organs were selected since liver is the main iron storage organ, while skeletal muscle is a major iron-consuming organ. Additionally, brain iron accumulation is reported with neurodegenerative diseases. We chose two time points for our studies: 4 months for young mice and 22 months for old mice. The almost 2 years age of the old mice is considered sufficient to result in senescence of some organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flurkey et al., 2007</xref>). Our data demonstrated that cytosolic non-heme iron in the liver was increased with age, whereas liver iron contents in the mitochondria, where iron accumulation is associated with cell dysfunction and cell death, were unchanged with age for both heme and non-heme forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Similarly, we observed an increase in the cytosolic, but not mitochondrial, non-heme iron in the gastrocnemius muscle. We also did not see a change in the cytosolic heme iron; however, we were not able to detect heme iron in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle tissue, possibly due to technical limitations associated with the isolation of intact mitochondria from skeletal muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Non-heme iron is increased in the cytosol and mitochondria of the brain cortex with aging.</title><p>Liver non-heme (<bold>A</bold>) and heme (<bold>B</bold>) iron in young (4 months old) and old (22 months old) mice from the cytosol and mitochondria (n=6).

However, there was no increase in heme iron levels in the either compartment in the brain cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The purity of the mitochondrial fraction in the brain cortex tissue was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Consistent with increased non-heme iron levels, we also observed increased protein levels of ferritin light and heavy chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). This increase may be a cellular protective mechanism because free or loosely bound iron in the form of non-heme iron is detrimental to the cells, and iron stored in ferritin is considered redox-inert. Additionally, an elevated level of cellular iron leads to the degradation of IRP2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore measured IRP2 protein levels in the brain cortex and observed a decrease in IRP2 protein levels in the brain cortex of aged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and J</xref>), consistent with an increase in iron levels with aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hepcidin levels are increased in the brain with aging</title><p>Since non-heme iron is increased in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments of the brain cortex and previous reports suggest a potential role for iron in neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 1997</xref>), we then focused our studies on the mechanism for the increase in iron in the brain tissue. We measured the mRNA levels of all proteins involved in cellular iron homeostasis. We conducted these studies both in the tissues of liver and brain cortex.

Thus, the levels of cellular iron, particularly in the mitochondria, are tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koleini et al., 2021</xref>). Iron has been implicated in the development of some neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with aging, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism for the increase in brain iron in aging is not known. In this paper, we showed that iron accumulates in the mouse brain cortex with aging and that this is associated with a significant increase in hepcidin production in the brain cortex. Since the major function of hepcidin is to bind to FPN1, leading to FPN1 degradation, we assessed levels of FPN1 in extracts of brain cortex from young and aged mice and showed that while its mRNA is not changed, protein levels of FPN1 are significantly decreased. We also demonstrate that brain FPN1 ubiquitination is increased with aging. Finally, we demonstrate that there is increased oxidative stress in the brains of aged mice, which may well reflect, at least in part, accumulation of iron, perhaps in the context of other age-dependent changes in oxidative damage and defenses against oxidative injury.</p><p>Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP1) is a small 25–amino acid hormone peptide that is secreted by hepatocytes in conditions of iron sufficiency, and which binds to FPN1 and promotes its internalization and degradation. FPN1 degradation inhibits iron absorption from the digestive tract and the release of iron from macrophages. Although liver is believed to be a major source of systemic hepcidin production, this peptide has recently been shown to be expressed by other tissues. A recent study demonstrated that hepcidin is expressed in the heart and that its cardiac-specific deletion has detrimental effects on cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, hepcidin has been inferred to play a role in colorectal cancer by sequestering iron to maintain the nucleotide pool and sustain proliferation in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schwartz et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies have also demonstrated that hepcidin overexpression in astrocytes protects against amyloid-β induced brain damage in mice and also protects against mouse models of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, it has been reported that upregulation of local hepcidin expression is associated with brain iron accumulation in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhary et al., 2021</xref>). However, it was not known whether hepcidin is increased with changes in its target FPN1 in the aged brain in mice. In the present study, our data show that brain hepcidin is increased with aging and that it likely leads to a reduction in FPN1 levels and iron accumulation. Since the results of this study are based on a small number of immunoblot samples using single-gender of mice, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in a larger cohort of mice of both genders.</p><p>Previous reports have suggested that inflammation plays a role in the brain-derived hepcidin expression via lipopolysaccharide- or interleukin-6-mediated STAT3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lieblein-Boff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), and another study suggested that toll-like receptor 4/myD88-mediated signaling of hepcidin expression cause brain iron accumulation and oxidative injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiong et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, age-related inflammation may be a regulator of iron accumulation in the brain via increased brain-derived hepcidin expression and subsequent FPN1 downregulation. In contrast, BMP6 secreted by the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in response to iron binds to BMPR and induces hepcidin production via the SMAD pathway. However, it is not known whether BMP6 regulates hepcidin expression in the brain. Indeed, our data showed that gene expression of BMP6 was not increased in the aged brain. Additionally, TfR2 is associated with positive regulation of hepcidin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silvestri et al., 2014</xref>), and mitochondrial iron transport in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mastroberardino et al., 2009</xref>). However, the expression of brain hepcidin is altered in TfR2-deficient mice in response to systemic iron deficiency or iron overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pellegrino et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that TfR2 is not the sole regulator of brain hepcidin expression. Further studies are needed to clarify whether increased TfR2 in the aged brain contributes to the increase in brain-derived hepcidin expression or alternatively contributes to iron accumulation with age.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2017</xref> have shown that, compared to younger animals, 24-month-old rats have significant increase in hepcidin expression in the brain cortex, in addition to hippocampus, striatum, and substantia nigra. However, FPN1 levels were not significantly changed in different brain regions. The authors concluded that increased DMT1, rather than TfR1 or FPN1, may be responsible for the increased brain iron with aging. Although the increase in hepcidin is consistent with our data, their proposed mechanism differs from what we observed, which could be due to differences in species, and sample size between our studies. Additionally, our data showed that mRNA and protein levels of TfR1 do not change with aging. TfR1 is regulated by both iron-dependent and iron-independent mechanisms. For iron-dependent pathways, IRPs are well-known positive regulators of TfR1. However, TfR1 is also regulated by iron-independent immune response, such as NF-kB- and/or HIF-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Samavati et al., 2008</xref>). Since we found that decreased IRP2 in the aged brain, it is possible that TfR1 gets downregulated via decreased IRP2-mediated pathway, but iron-independent regulation of TfR1 cancels IRP2-mediated decrease in the aged brain. Our data therefore cannot resolve whether TfR1 is central to age-mediated iron accumulation in the brain and if so, by what mechanism. Additional studies are necessary to clarify this important point.</p><p>A recent study reported that in patients with Parkinson’s disease, the activity of heme oxidase-1, which is regulated by HMOX1 and degrades heme, is increased in the serum and brain and its activation is associated with anemia and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra, but not other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Considering that cytosolic and mitochondrial heme iron levels were not changed with aging in both liver and brain in the present study, the increase in ALAD expression (which can catalyze heme synthesis) might be a compensatory mechanism against increased degradation of heme via increased HMOX1. However, the changes noted in HMOX1 and ALAD would not explain the increase in non-heme iron in the brain.</p><p>The mechanism for iron-mediated aging is likely due to the oxidative effects of iron and cellular damage. Mitochondria are the major site of reactive oxygen species production in the cells, thus, the levels of mitochondrial iron are tightly controlled. In our studies, we noted an increase only in the cytosolic non-heme iron in the liver and the skeletal muscle of aged mice, while non-heme iron was increased in both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fraction of the brain cortex tissue. The significance of sole increase in cytosolic iron is not clear, but the increase in mitochondrial iron in the brain is significant since it likely contributes to the oxidative damage that occurs in this tissue with aging. It is also possible that cytosolic iron accumulation in the liver and muscle tissue is due to mild increased systemic iron. Since the brain is not an iron storage organ and iron movement to the brain has to go through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), iron accumulation in the brain with aging is likely independent of systemic iron metabolism.</p><p>Our studies have clinical implications for neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging through two possible mechanisms: (1) by targeting brain iron with iron chelators that can cross the BBB, and (2) through a reduction in locally produced hepcidin. There is currently interest in taking the first approach and clinical studies support this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). However, targeting hepcidin in the brain is technically challenging and may require the design of small molecule hepcidin inhibitors that can also cross the BBB. We also acknowledge that we do not identify the specific cells in the brain that express hepcidin and FPN1. Further studies are needed to address cellular specificity and interaction among increased brain-derived hepcidin regulation, <italic>Fpn1</italic> expression, and cytosolic and mitochondrial iron accumulation with aging. Identification of these pathways may have therapeutic potentials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Mice were given diet Purina 5LG6 containing 345 ppm iron, which is similar to the published normal iron diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutschow et al., 2015</xref>). For hepcidin immunohistological analysis, young (4 months old) and aged (22 months old) female C57BL/6 mice were used. This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Briefly, for the non-heme iron measurements, equal amounts of protein were mixed with protein precipitation solution (1:1 1 N HCl and 10% trichloroacetic acid) and heated at 95°C for 1 hr to release iron. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 16,000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was mixed with the equal volume of chromogenic solution (0.5 mM ferrozine, 1.5 M sodium acetate, 0.1% [v/v] thioglycolic acid), and the absorbance was measured at 562 nm. For the heme iron measurements, equal amounts of protein were mixed with 2.0 M oxalic acid and were heated at 95°C for 1 hr to release iron from heme and generate protoporphyrin IX. Samples were then centrifuged at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 minat 4°C and the fluorescence of the supernatant was assessed at 405 nm/600 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>RNA was isolated from tissues using RNA-STAT60 (Teltest). Reverse transcribed with qScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Quanta) according to the manufacturers’ instruction, and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2021</xref>). The resulting cDNA was amplified quantitatively using PerfeCTa SYBR Green Mix (Quanta) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The relative gene expression was determined using differences in Ct values between gene of interest and housekeeping control genes β-actin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 (<italic>Hprt1</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentration in lysates was determined using BCA Protein Quantification Kit (Pierce) and as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sawicki et al., 2018</xref>). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved on 4–12% Novex Bis-Tris poly-acrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). After blocking with tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5% milk, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody against HPRT (ProteinTech), succinate dehydrogenase complex flavoprotein subunit A (SDHA, Invitrogen), FTN (Sigma-Aldrich), IRP2 (Novus Biologicals), TfR1 (Invitrogen), FPN1 (Novus Biologicals), Hepcidin (Abcam), Ubiquitin (Cell Signaling Technology), GAPDH (ProteinTech), and α-Tubulin (ProteinTech). The following day, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hr and proteins were visualized using Super Surgical Western Pico ECL substrate (Pierce). Quantification of immunoblotting image was done using ImageJ (NIH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoprecipitation of FPN1</title><p>Tissues were lysed in IP buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40 with protease inhibitor cocktail (G-Biosciences). 400 μg of protein was pre-incubated with 40 μl of protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at 4°C. After the beads had been discarded, the supernatant was incubated with FPN antibody (Novus Biologicals) or IgG at a rotator overnight at 4°C. The mixture was then incubated with 40 μl of fresh beads for 1 hr at 4°C. A magnetic field was applied to this mixture, and the supernatant was removed. The magnetic beads were washed three times with 400 μl of IP buffer, re-suspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 70°C. Finally, 20 μl of the supernatant was collected after applying a magnetic field to the mixture and was used for immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry of hepcidin</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 250 mg/kg dose of freshly prepared Tribromoethanol (Avertin). They were then transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to wash out the blood, and following the discoloration of liver, the buffer was replaced to freshly prepared ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) with the assistance of circulating pump to supply sufficient perfusion pressure. After 20 min perfusion, the brain tissue was extracted from the skull and was fixed overnight in 4% PFA. The fixed brain tissue was placed in 30% sucrose for 48 hr at 4°C. Brain tissue was then submerged into OTC compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 30 µm coronal sections were cut using a cryotome (Leica) and mounted on Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus Microscope Slides. Sections were permeabilized using 0.25% Triton-x100 in PBS for 30 min, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with primary antibody against hepcidin overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor594 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 hr at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI containing ProLong Gold Antifade mounting media (Invitrogen) and images of frontal cortex were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Aconitase activity measurements</title><p>Aconitase activities in cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction of the brain cortex lysates were measured using Aconitase Enzyme Activity Microplate Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± SEM. There was no randomization of the samples, but the investigator performing the measurements was blinded to the group assignment. For sample size estimation, our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2016</xref>) indicated that changes in mitochondrial non-heme iron contents of about 20% can affect iron-dependent cytotoxicity in the mouse heart. Given an estimated standard deviation of iron of 15% in each group, we estimated that six samples would be needed to detect a 20% difference in change of iron contents. For other experiments, power analysis was not performed a priori because we could use sufficient numbers of stored tissue samples that had already been cryopreserved and there was no risk of wasting unnecessary animals. We determined n=10 for the RNA levels and n=3–6 for the immunoblots and enzyme activities for our analysis. This was based on our prior experience performing similar experiments. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests were used to determine statistical significance. p&lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, as indicated by an asterisk. Analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 9.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

In this Short Report format, it would be reasonable for the authors to extend the discussion regarding the shortcomings of the current approach, especially addressing the prior art and aligning a more modest conclusion given the relatively superficial presentation.

This is a timely question because iron accumulates in the brains of aged individuals and is believed to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD.</p><p>However, the data are not clear, and do not support the major conclusion that local hepcidin is responsible for iron accumulation in the brain. Some examples are given below:</p><p>1. In Figure 1, the ferrozine method used to quantitate iron levels also measures iron released from ferritin. Iron sequestered in ferritin is in the ferric form, and not redox-active. Levels of ferritin in the brain increase with ageing, which is well-known, and could contribute to the observed increase in iron with aging noted by the authors.</p><p>2. The mitochondrial fraction was not tested for purity. Mitochondrial markers should be evaluated and compared with the cytosolic fraction to determine the efficacy of the procedure.</p><p>3. In Figure 2 A and B, the fold change in mRNA expression is not as accurate as qPCR analysis. In the methods section the authors mention that qPCR was used. In that case, the results should be presented as ΔΔCt instead of mRNA expression. Moreover, the change in mRNA expression of HAMP1 is marginal given the standard deviation.</p><p>4. In Figure 2 C, the hepcidin band is not clear. In the raw data for Figure 2, it seems that recombinant hepcidin peptide was fractionated in parallel in the last lane, though it is not labeled. It is unclear why the bands marked in the last lane of the 'middle exposure' are absent in the overnight longer exposure.</p><p>5. The brain homogenate should be depleted of capillary endothelial cells that synthesize hepcidin, or appropriate controls need to be used to remove their contribution.</p><p>6. In the immunostained brain sample in Figure 2 E, a positive control, perhaps a section of the liver from iron depleted and iron overloaded mouse would provide confidence that the reaction is from hepcidin, though it could be hepcidin from the peripheral circulation.</p><p>7. In Figure 3 A, TfR1 is expected to decrease if the cells are iron loaded. The authors need to discuss this discrepancy.</p><p>In conclusion, though the study is well conceived and asks an important question, the experimental design lacks appropriate controls, and the results do not support the conclusions drawn by the authors.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Aging is associated with increased brain iron through brain- derived hepcidin expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Several additional components need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Findings of significantly decreased FPN in the western from this outbred strain with N=3 biological replicates need to be repeated and confirmed. In lieu of a repeated experiment, the authors may choose to add to the Discussion section on this point that &quot;additional experiments are needed to confirm these findings in a larger cohort of mice of both genders.&quot;</p><p>2) Given the authors' response regarding the selection of the frontal cortex as the main site of analysis, the Introduction is no longer relevant and should be edited to fall in line with the current focus, not focused on the substantia nigra and striatum.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have substantively responded to most of the reviewers' comments. Several elements remain to be resolved.</p><p>1) The authors suggest in their response that they focused on the frontal cortex due to prior evidence of the importance of cortical atrophy with age. However, the introduction has a very different read and in fact states that the &quot;substantia nigra and stratum&quot; (misspelled striatum?), subcortical structures, are central to disease pathophysiology. Please edit the introduction more in line with the selected area of the brain studied in the current manuscript and to remove the substantive delineation of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases which are NOT the focus of the current manuscript.</p><p>2) Change the title to &quot;Aging is associated with increased brain iron through cortex-derived hepcidin expression.&quot;</p><p>3) Please spell out HPRT1 and SDCF in the methods section.</p><p>4) Discussion section regarding TFR1 regulation: please change &quot;HIF-medicated&quot; to &quot;HIF-mediated&quot;.</p><p>5) Please add the following sentence to the Discussion section regarding TFR1, at the end: &quot;Our data therefore cannot resolve whether TFR1 is central to age-mediated iron accumulation in the brain and if so, by what mechanism. Additional studies are necessary to clarify this important point.&quot; Alternatively, please measure other pathways that regulate TFR1.</p><p>6) Aconitase is involved in iron responsiveness regulation in other tissues (Bullock Blood 2010). As a consequence, using aconitase as a read out of oxidative stress when iron is altered between the 2 groups is insufficient. Please remove the phrase &quot;indicating increased oxidative stress&quot; in the last sentence of the Results section.</p><p>7) Please add &quot;Further studies… increased TFR2 in the aged brain contributes to increased brain-derived hepcidin expression or alternatively contributes to iron accumulation with age.&quot; to the TFR2 part of the Discussion section.</p><p>8) Question about muscle was intended to understand how data in muscle is relevant in a paper about the brain. This remains unclear.</p><p>9) Please add components of mouse strain and gender and haematologica reference for iron diet to the methods section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed a number of concerns, including identifying the region of brain studied and validating the enriched mitochondrial fraction. Identifying the cell types with increased Hamp1/Hepc mRNA and protein and decreased Fpn protein is important, but this has not been done. In addition, the important finding of decreased Fpn is shown in a Western with an N of only 3. This is inadequate, especially with an outbred strain and documented high variability in Hamp1/Hepc levels in Figure 2. The N for the Fpn Western should be increased, and should be correlated with Hamp1/Hepc levels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73456.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found significant merit in the work.

In the present study, we used frozen tissue from brain cortex for iron measurement and frontal cortex for immunohistochemistry of hepcidin. The purpose of the present study was to explore if and how cellular iron levels change in the brain with aging, but not in the brain of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Since it has been reported that age-related brain atrophy (which is associated with age-related cognitive decline) is evident in the cortex (specifically in the frontal cortex) and not in other parts of the brain (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2010 Dec 28;107(52):22682-6), we focused our studies on the frontal cortex. Our studies revealed that increased hepcidin is associated with iron-accumulation in the aged brain cortex. The information about the part of the brain is now added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Validation of the purity / enrichment of the mitochondrial fraction,</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the careful review of our data. We have performed immunoblotting experiments using cytosolic marker (HPRT1 = hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1) and mitochondrial marker (Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex Flavoprotein Subunit A) in the samples used for iron measurement, and confirmed the purity of mitochondrial isolation as <italic>shown in the revised Figure 1G</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Addition of means or changing data to δ δ Ct in place of &quot;mRNA expression&quot; in Figure 2A and B graphs,</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.

For iron-dependent pathways, IRPs are well-known positive regulators of TfR1. Since our data showed that the protein level of IRP2 was decreased in the aged brain, it is plausible that TfR1 would be concomitantly downregulated via decreased IRP2 activity. However, TfR1 has also been known to be regulated by iron-independent immune response, such as NF-κB- and/or HIF-medicated pathways (<italic>J Biol Chem. 2008 Jul 25;283(30):20674-86</italic>). Thus, it is likely that activated iron-independent regulation of TfR1 cancels IRP2-medicated regulation of TfR1, resulting in unchanged TfR1 expression in the aged brain. This discussion is now added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Including additional corroborating markers of oxidative stress (in addition to aconitase activity) would increase enthusiasm. A complete list of reviewer comments can be found below.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. It has already been established that oxidative stress is increased in the aged brain, as summarized in the following review (<italic>Front Mol Neurosci. 2020 Mar 18;13:41</italic>). In addition, our data already suggest the presence of oxidative stress in the aged brain by measuring both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aconitase activities. Therefore, we did not measure canonical oxidative stress markers such as lipid-peroxidation in the present study, and instead, cite previous reports that show age-related oxidative stress, in addition to the inclusion of aconitase activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Why is it important that cytosolic heme iron in the muscle is not found? Can the authors clarify and add to the Discussion section?</p></disp-quote><p>The precise reason why we were not able to detect heme iron in the mitochondria of gastrocnemius muscle is unclear, but it could possibly due to technical limitations associated with the isolation of intact mitochondria from skeletal muscle tissue. Since gastrocnemius muscle is a fast-twitch muscle containing low concentration of mitochondria, it is also possible that low mitochondrial yield was insufficient for detecting measurable iron, especially heme iron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Decreased Steap3, an endosomal ferrireductase, is associated with anaemia due to decreased import of ion into erythroblasts (Blanc AJH 2015). This is worth at least a mention in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this suggestion. We hope that the Reviewer agrees that since our paper focuses on brain iron and Steap3 is not changed in the brain with aging, we do not think a discussion on this protein would be relevant to the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that the same genes in the liver are not related to iron loading as the genes in the brain that are (e.g. Hox1 and Alad).

Levels of ferritin in the brain increase with ageing, which is well-known, and could contribute to the observed increase in iron with aging noted by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As the reviewer mentioned, our iron measurements may include ferritin-binding iron. However, our data showed that in addition to the cytoplasmic iron, mitochondrial iron (which is directly associated with cellular damage) is increased in the brain with aging, suggesting elevated total cellular iron in the aged brain. In addition, the activity of aconitase in both cytosol and mitochondria was decreased, suggesting the involvement of iron-mediated oxidative stress in the aged brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The mitochondrial fraction was not tested for purity. Mitochondrial markers should be evaluated and compared with the cytosolic fraction to determine the efficacy of the procedure.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to the “Essential Revision-2” and the reviewer’s comment of #2-additional limitation-3, we have confirmed the purity of mitochondrial isolation as shown in the revised Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2 A and B, the fold change in mRNA expression is not as accurate as qPCR analysis. In the methods section the authors mention that qPCR was used. In that case, the results should be presented as ΔΔCt instead of mRNA expression. Moreover, the change in mRNA expression of HAMP1 is marginal given the standard deviation.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we assessed many genes associated with cellular iron regulation, we believe that showing the relative change is a better way to demonstrate the differences in their expression. We also provide the original data including CT values in the supplementary tables that readers can access. We acknowledge that the mRNA level of hepcidin in the aged brain, but not in the aged liver, showed increased SD, but the difference was statistically significant. We also confirmed that hepcidin protein expression is increased in Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 2 C, the hepcidin band is not clear. In the raw data for Figure 2, it seems that recombinant hepcidin peptide was fractionated in parallel in the last lane, though it is not labeled. It is unclear why the bands marked in the last lane of the 'middle exposure' are absent in the overnight longer exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the careful review of our data. The last lane was just a ladder and marked by a pen (3-, 6- and 10-kDa). The second lane form the right was lysate from the liver tissue, which is the major organ for hepcidin production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The brain homogenate should be depleted of capillary endothelial cells that synthesize hepcidin, or appropriate controls need to be used to remove their contribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As mentioned in our response to comments of #1-3 and #2-1, we acknowledge the limitation that we cannot reveal cell-specificity of hepcidin expression in the aged brain. This limitation has been included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the immunostained brain sample in Figure 2 E, a positive control, perhaps a section of the liver from iron depleted and iron overloaded mouse would provide confidence that the reaction is from hepcidin, though it could be hepcidin from the peripheral circulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your careful review of our data. Our data showed that protein and mRNA levels of hepcidin are increased in the brain of aged mice compared to young mice, suggesting that brainderived hepcidin is actually up-regulated with aging. Therefore, the possibility that contamination of circulating hepcidin affected our analysis would be quite low. We hope the Reviewer agrees with no additional experiments, and that our current data are sufficient to show increased hepcidin expression in the aged brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 3 A, TfR1 is expected to decrease if the cells are iron loaded. The authors need to discuss this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As we responded in the “Essential Revision-4”, our possible explanation for the unchanged TfR1 levels in spite of iron accumulation in the aged brain has been added to the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers appreciate the much improved revision of this manuscript. Several additional components need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Findings of significantly decreased FPN in the western from this outbred strain with N=3 biological replicates need to be repeated and confirmed. In lieu of a repeated experiment, the authors may choose to add to the Discussion section on this point that &quot;additional experiments are needed to confirm these findings in a larger cohort of mice of both genders.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion. We have added the statement of &quot;Since the results of this study are based on a small number of immunoblot samples using single-gender of mice, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in a larger cohort of mice of both genders&quot; at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the authors' response regarding the selection of the frontal cortex as the main site of analysis, the Introduction is no longer relevant and should be edited to fall in line with the current focus, not focused on the substantia nigra and striatum.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this valuable suggestion. According to the suggestion, we edited the introduction section. Especially, we removed the sentences mentioning Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and substantia nigra and striatum and added the sentence mentioning the reason why we focused on the brain cortex in the present study. As a result, the four paragraphs in the previous introduction section have been combined into three in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have substantively responded to most of the reviewers' comments. Several elements remain to be resolved.</p><p>1) The authors suggest in their response that they focused on the frontal cortex due to prior evidence of the importance of cortical atrophy with age. However, the introduction has a very different read and in fact states that the &quot;substantia nigra and stratum&quot; (misspelled striatum?), subcortical structures, are central to disease pathophysiology. Please edit the introduction more in line with the selected area of the brain studied in the current manuscript and to remove the substantive delineation of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases which are NOT the focus of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We have revised the introduction section by removing the sentences mentioning Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and substantia nigra and striatum and added the sentence mentioning the reason why we focused on the brain cortex in the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Change the title to &quot;Aging is associated with increased brain iron through cortex-derived hepcidin expression.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and the title has been changed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please spell out HPRT1 and SDCF in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the comment, and now this is amended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Discussion section regarding TFR1 regulation: please change &quot;HIF-medicated&quot; to &quot;HIF-mediated&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this typographical errors. All of &quot;medicated&quot; words have also been changed to “mediated” in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please add the following sentence to the Discussion section regarding TFR1, at the end: &quot;Our data therefore cannot resolve whether TFR1 is central to age-mediated iron accumulation in the brain and if so, by what mechanism. Additional studies are necessary to clarify this important point.&quot; Alternatively, please measure other pathways that regulate TFR1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. The sentences suggested by the reviewer have been added to the end of 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Aconitase is involved in iron responsiveness regulation in other tissues (Bullock Blood 2010). As a consequence, using aconitase as a read out of oxidative stress when iron is altered between the 2 groups is insufficient. Please remove the phrase &quot;indicating increased oxidative stress&quot; in the last sentence of the Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, we have removed the phrase “indicating increased oxidative stress” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please add &quot;Further studies… increased TFR2 in the aged brain contributes to increased brain-derived hepcidin expression or alternatively contributes to iron accumulation with age.&quot; to the TFR2 part of the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. This is now corrected in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Question about muscle was intended to understand how data in muscle is relevant in a paper about the brain. This remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in the introduction section, whether iron accumulation occurs in all organs or is specific to one organ was unclear despite aging has been shown to be associated with iron accumulation in various organs and tissues. Thus, we assessed aging-associated iron changes not only in the liver and the brain, but also in the skeletal muscle in the present study. We hope that the reviewer agrees that we show the iron data in the skeletal muscle in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please add components of mouse strain and gender and haematologica reference for iron diet to the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the information suggested by the reviewer in the method section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed a number of concerns, including identifying the region of brain studied and validating the enriched mitochondrial fraction. Identifying the cell types with increased Hamp1/Hepc mRNA and protein and decreased Fpn protein is important, but this has not been done. In addition, the important finding of decreased Fpn is shown in a Western with an N of only 3. This is inadequate, especially with an outbred strain and documented high variability in Hamp1/Hepc levels in Figure 2. The N for the Fpn Western should be increased, and should be correlated with Hamp1/Hepc levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful concern about the limitations of our experimental results. We acknowledge that the experiments proposed by the reviewer are important. However, due to the limited amount of sample and the time it takes to age these mice, it is unfortunately difficult to perform the additional experiments or analyses that are suggested by the reviewer. Instead, as recommended by the editor, the statement of &quot;Since the results of this study are based on a small number of immunoblot samples using single-gender of mice, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in a larger cohort of mice of both genders&quot; has been added to the 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section in the revised manuscript as the limitation. We hope that the reviewer would agree with our response.</p></body></sub-article></article>
