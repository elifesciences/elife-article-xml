not always clear. Here we describe the use of proximity labeling using TurboID and site-specific quantification of biotinylated peptides to measure changes to the local protein environment of selected targets upon perturbation. We apply this technique, which we call PerTurboID, to understand how the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-exported kinase, FIKK4.1, regulates the function of the major virulence factor of the malaria-causing parasite, PfEMP1. We generated independent TurboID fusions of two proteins that are predicted substrates of FIKK4.1 in a FIKK4.1 conditional KO parasite line. Comparing the abundance of site-specific biotinylated peptides between wildtype and kinase deletion lines reveals the differential accessibility of proteins to biotinylation, indicating changes to localization, protein–protein interactions, or protein structure which are mediated by FIKK4.1 activity. We further show that FIKK4.1 is likely the only FIKK kinase that controls surface levels of PfEMP1, but not other surface antigens, on the infected red blood cell under standard culture conditions. We believe PerTurboID is broadly applicable to study the impact of genetic or environmental perturbation on a selected cellular niche.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Enzymes known as protein kinases regulate a huge variety of biological processes inside cells by attaching small tags known as phosphate groups onto specific locations on certain proteins. For example, the parasite that causes malaria infections in humans and great apes, injects a protein kinase called FIKK4.1 into certain cells in its host. This enzyme then adds phosphate groups to various parasite and host proteins that, in turn, causes them to form a large group of proteins (known as the cytoadhesion complex) to protect the parasite from being cleared by the hosts’ immune defences. However, it remains unclear how and where the complex forms, and how the parasite regulates it.</p><p>Proximity labelling is a well-established method that allows researchers to label and identify proteins that are near to a protein of interest. To investigate how the FIKK4.1 enzyme alters host cells to make the cytoadhesion complex, Davies et al. combined proximity labelling with methods that disturb the normal state of cells at a specific timepoint during development. The team used this new approach – named PerTurboID – to identify the proteins surrounding three components in the cytoadhesion complex. This made it possible to create a map of proteins that FIKK4.1 is likely to modify to build and control the cytoadhesion complex.</p><p>Further experiments examined what happened to these surrounding proteins when FIKK4.1 was inactivated. This revealed that some protein targets of FIKK4.1 become either more or less accessible to other enzymes that attach a molecule known as biotin to proteins. This could be a result of structural changes in the cytoadhesion complex that are normally regulated by the FIKK4.1 kinase.</p><p>In the future, PerTurboID may be useful to study how genetics or environmental changes affect other groups of proteins within specific environments inside cells, such as protein complexes required for DNA replication or cell division, or assembly of temporal structures required for cell movement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphoregulation</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>mass-spectrometry</kwd><kwd>protein kinases</kwd><kwd>parasitic diseases</kwd><kwd>host–pathogen interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Heledd</given-names></name><name><surname>Belda</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name><name><surname>Broncel</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalimot</surname><given-names>Jill</given-names></name><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC0199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broncel</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new mass spectrometry-based method to identify and quantify changes in a subcellular local protein environment shows the impact of deletion of a kinase the human malaria parasites export into the host cell.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is caused by parasites of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Of at least six <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species that infect humans, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the vast majority of the approximately 600,000 annual malaria-associated deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). The particular severity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria is largely due to the cytoadhesion of the infected red blood cell (iRBC) to the endothelium of the host vascular system. Cytoadhesion is mediated by the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 (PfEMP1), a surface protein family of ~60 variants, which bind to different endothelial receptors including ICAM1, CD36, EPCR, and Chondroitin Sulfate-A (CSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baruch et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salanti et al., 2004</xref>). Cytoadhesion-induced accumulation of iRBCs in the vasculature of various organs, particularly the brain and placenta, can lead to fatal outcomes for the patient.</p><p>PfEMP1 is trafficked through the parasite’s secretory pathway into the parasitophorous vacuole, then exported by the PTEX translocon into the RBC. Here it is believed to be transported via protein complexes called J-dots into Maurer’s clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Külzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriek et al., 2003</xref>), which are membranous sorting stations established by the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Przyborski et al., 2003</xref>). Around 20 hr post-infection (hpi), PfEMP1 is translocated onto the RBC surface and assembled into parasite-derived knob protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crabb et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watermeyer et al., 2016</xref>). This process is poorly understood, and it is unclear whether other surface proteins, such as the immunomodulatory RIFIN family proteins, are trafficked by the same machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2017</xref>). Coinciding with PfEMP1 surface translocation is an increase in RBC rigidity, likely through re-arrangement of the RBC spectrin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rug et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Parasite proteins which are exported into the host cell mediate the assembly of knobs on the iRBC cytoskeleton and the trafficking of PfEMP1 via Maurer’s clefts. Knob-associated histidine-rich protein (KAHRP) is a key component of the knobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rug et al., 2006</xref>), and a subset of proteins from the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> helical interspersed subtelomeric (PHIST) family interact with the PfEMP1 cytosolic domain and are thought to anchor it to the erythrocyte cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oberli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Proellocks et al., 2014</xref>). Seven proteins have been specifically designated as PfEMP1-trafficking proteins (PTPs) due to the loss or reduction in surface PfEMP1 presentation upon their deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmo et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We have previously shown that a parasite-exported kinase belonging to the FIKK family, FIKK4.1, is important for efficient surface translocation of the PfEMP1 variant Var2CSA and its adhesion to its receptor CSA, as well as for modulating iRBC rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). Using a DiCre-mediated conditional FIKK4.1 knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2013</xref>) and quantitative phosphoproteome analysis, we identified 66 parasite and RBC proteins that are phosphorylated in an FIKK4.1-dependent manner. KAHRP, several PTPs, and PHIST proteins are among these likely substrates of FIKK4.1, as well as proteins involved in nutrient acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2017</xref>) and several proteins of unknown function. Phosphorylation likely alters the dynamics of several of these proteins to ultimately influence PfEMP1 presentation, while other substrates may be non-functional or play a role in an unrelated phenotype. This is true for kinase–substrate relationships in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ochoa et al., 2020</xref>), and therefore mutation of individual phosphorylation sites is rarely informative for understanding the complex interactions at play.</p><p>Here, we developed a method that relies on proximity labeling using TurboID fusion proteins and mass spectrometry to identify changes to protein accessibility in a targeted manner. TurboID is a biotin-ligase that, if fused to a bait, biotinylates lysines on proteins within an ~10 nm radius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). By using a protocol designed for enrichment and detection of biotinylated peptides rather than whole proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Udeshi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), we identify protein domains accessible to biotinylation. We generated FIKK4.1 conditional KO lines harboring TurboID fusions of two FIKK4.1 substrates, KAHRP and PTP4, allowing us to monitor protein dynamics in both these proteins’ vicinity in the presence and absence of FIKK4.1. Using this novel combination of cell perturbation and TurboID, which we call PerTurboID, we gain insights into protein localization, topology, protein–protein interactions, and post-translational modifications upon FIKK4.1 deletion. We show that among the 17 exported FIKK kinases, modulation of PfEMP1 surface translocation is unique to FIKK4.1, and that other surface proteins such as RIFINs are not affected by FIKK4.1 deletion, indicating a specific pathway for the surface translocation of this key virulence determinant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the FIKK4.1 subcellular niche using TurboID</title><p>To measure the effect of FIKK4.1-dependent phosphorylation of its substrates using proximity labeling, we first identified appropriate bait proteins that are likely direct substrates of FIKK4.1 and present in its vicinity. To do so, we generated a C-terminally tagged TurboID fusion of FIKK4.1 using CRIPSR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnbaum et al., 2017</xref>). Clones were selected, PCR validated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the specific labeling of proteins in the presence of biotin was validated by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Substantial biotinylation could be observed in FIKK4.1-TurboID transgenic parasites (hereafter called FIKK4.1T) but not in NF54 wildtype controls, where only minimal background biotinylation is present. We visualized the localization of biotinylated proteins in transgenic parasites in the absence and presence of biotin using streptavidin conjugated to a fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In biotin-free media, some background labeling was observed within the parasite, while the addition of biotin leads to substantial biotinylation of proteins within the parasitophorous vacuole and the red blood cell compartment, particularly at the iRBC periphery where FIKK4.1 is localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). To ensure that the FIKK4.1-TurboID fusion does not impact FIKK4.1 function, we performed PfEMP1 surface translocation assays by flow cytometry. The PfEMP1 variant Var2CSA was trafficked normally onto the iRBC surface in the absence of biotin and after a 4 hr biotin pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Collectively these data show that the FIKK4.1T fusion is expressed, active, and does not compromise FIKK4.1 function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proximity-dependent protein labeling of the FIKK4.1 subcellular niche.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of parental NF54 and the FIKK4.1-TurboID (FIKK4.1T) fusion line probed with streptavidin conjugated to a fluorophore.

Wildtype (NF54) and FIKK4.1T parasites were pulsed with biotin between 16–20 hpi or 40–44 hpi in triplicate then lysed in 1% SDS buffer. We chose the above timepoints to capture changes occurring as PfEMP1 is assembled onto the iRBC surface starting at ~16 hpi. In total, we quantified 101 parasite proteins and 39 human proteins that showed at least a 1.5-log2 fold enrichment in the FIKK4.1T samples compared to NF54 at either timepoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). 62.3% of the 101 identified parasite proteins are predicted to be exported, a significant enrichment compared to the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteome which only contains ~8% exported proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aurrecoechea et al., 2009</xref>). The parasite proteins with the strongest enrichment include FIKK4.1 itself and three PfEMP1 trafficking proteins (PTP4, PTP2, and PTP3), which are also predicted FIKK4.1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The most abundant human proteins include members of the 4.1R complex, suggesting that FIKK4.1 specifically interacts with this complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We also detect proteins which FIKK4.1 presumably encounters as it is trafficked into the RBC, such as the protein export translocon component PTEX150 which is located in the parasitophorous vacuole membrane surrounding the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Koning-Ward et al., 2009</xref>).

In later stages it is likely that the majority of FIKK4.1 protein is located within the RBC, rather than within the trafficking pathway, and proteins biotinylated at this point are more likely to operate within the same subcellular niche.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation and validation of PerTurboID parasite lines to monitor the local protein environment upon FIKK4.1 deletion</title><p>Of the 101 proteins identified in the proximity of FIKK4.1, we selected two candidates to use as sensors of the local protein environment upon FIKK4.1 deletion: PfEMP1-trafficking protein 4 (PTP4) and KAHRP.

All non-biotinylated peptides were excluded from the dataset, eliminating the background signal often observed using the classical BioID/TurboID protocol. The biotinylation sites, as well as co-occurring phosphorylation sites, were then mapped to proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> for site-specific analysis and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> for peptide-specific analysis). In the KAHRP-T dataset, we identified 195 proteins, while 150 were found in the PTP4-T dataset. To identify shared and unique proteins in the local protein environment of FIKK4.1, PTP4, and KAHRP, we mapped all interactions in a network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). All three proteins are observed in each other’s datasets, suggesting that they co-localize at least transiently. Interactions with several other host and parasite exported proteins from Maurer’s clefts, J-dots, and the iRBC periphery are also observed in all three datasets, suggesting that these subcellular organelles partially co-localize. The export translocon component, PTEX150, was the only protein not predicted to be exported which appeared in all three datasets, highlighting the specificity of the TurboID labeling for proteins in the proximity of the three exported bait proteins. The identification of PTEX150, which resides in the parasitophorous vacuole, indicates that some of the shared targets may originate from the common trafficking pathway. However, since the KAHRP- and PTP4-T parasites were pulsed for 4 hr at late stages, it is likely that the majority of the observed interactions are the result of partial co-localization at the proteins’ final locations.</p><p>The site-specific proteomics workflow we used allows us to localize the biotinylated peptides within protein sequences. From such data, one can infer information about the accessibility of lysines to biotinylation. For example, biotinylation on either side of a transmembrane domain provides an insight into protein topology, and we predict that biotinylation would be largely excluded from protein–protein interaction interfaces and within structurally buried regions. Movement of a domain away from the TurboID fusion protein can also result in reduced biotinylation of protein sequences. To investigate to what extent the localized biotinylation sites correspond to accessible domains of proteins and with predicted protein topology, we looked at some examples in detail.

This parasite-exported protein complex is inserted into the RBC membrane where it is thought to form the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) which is essential for the acquisition of nutrients for parasite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Desai et al., 2000</xref>).

Interestingly, however, biotinylation sites 1321 and 1323 within the component Clag3.1 are partially buried within the complex, suggesting that a state exists where these sites are more exposed to the TurboID-fusion proteins, potentially upon insertion into the iRBC membrane. RHOPH3 is biotinylated on both sides of its transmembrane domain, indicating that it was likely biotinylated in the soluble state represented by the structure, where the transmembrane domain is sequestered within the core of the complex during trafficking and both biotinylated sites are exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schureck et al., 2021</xref>).

Twenty-nine PHIST proteins were identified in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). These proteins contain an alpha-helical PRESAN domain, a subset of which have been shown to interact with the cytosolic domain of PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oberli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Proellocks et al., 2014</xref>). Mapping the location of either KAHRP- or PTP4-T-mediated biotinylation on these proteins demonstrates a substantial reduction in biotinylation within the PRESAN domain itself as opposed to most of the surrounding sequences, despite no reduction in the number of lysines in this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). It is therefore likely that lysines in this domain are occluded from biotinylation by protein–protein interactions, potentially with PfEMP1.</p><p>As neither KAHRP nor PTP4 contain transmembrane domains, their TurboID tags likely remain within the RBC cytosol and can only biotinylate protein domains in this compartment or within the trafficking pathway. This gives us added insight into the topology of exported proteins with transmembrane domains which are inserted into the membrane of Maurer’s clefts or the iRBC. For example, we observe biotinylation only at the N-terminus of Maurer’s cleft protein SEMP1, meaning that it is likely that its single transmembrane domain is inserted into the membrane with the N-terminus exposed to the RBC cytosol. Conversely, several other Maurer’s cleft proteins with N-terminal transmembrane domains appear to be inserted into the Maurer’s clefts in the opposite orientation, with the C-terminus exposed to the TurboID tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The biotinylation of the surface proteins Var2CSA and RIFIN shows contrasting patterns, with Var2CSA biotinylated only on the cytosolic C-terminal ATS domain, while RIFIN is biotinylated on the N-terminal extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmann et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that this RIFIN biotinylation occurs during the trafficking process where this domain may be at some point accessible to the RBC cytosol, or within the parasitophorous vacuole.</p><p>While many of the biotinylated proteins were found in both KAHRP and PTP4 TurboID experiments, we also found several that were specific or highly enriched for one of the two fusion proteins.

An increase in biotinylation upstream of the kinase domain was observed, likely as the remaining N-terminus of the protein is more exposed to biotinylation due to loss of the folded kinase domain. This serves as a useful control for FIKK4.1 excision and illustrates the capability of the PerTurboID protocol to reproducibly detect changes in protein accessibility in both PTP4 and KAHRP-T lines.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Changes in site-specific biotinylation observed upon FIKK4.1 deletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Barcodes representing selected proteins from the PerTurboID dataset.

An increase in biotinylation upon FIKK4.1 deletion is observed in the PTP4 C-terminus, while the N-terminus appears mostly unchanged. For KAHRP, the most substantial changes occur around position 351–364 (denoted by asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This section encompasses predicted FIKK4.1 phosphorylation sites observed in our previous phosphoproteomics experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). In the PerTurboID datasets, both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated versions of the biotinylated peptides encompassing this section of KAHRP are detected. As expected, the phosphorylated peptides become less abundant upon FIKK4.1 deletion due to the loss of kinase activity. This leads to an increase in the relative abundance of the non-phosphorylated counterparts of the same sequence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> for schematic). A similar effect is seen for the FIKK4.1 substrate acyl CoA synthetase 7 (ACS7) around position 876, whereas the nutrient channel component RHOPH3 is more phosphorylated at position 853 upon FIKK4.1 deletion, shifting the ratio of phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated peptides in the opposite direction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref> for non-phosphorylated/phosphorylated peptide ratios). These observations are supported by our earlier phosphoproteomics experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>) and demonstrate the ability of PerTurboID to detect changes in post-translational modifications without specifically enriching for modified peptides.</p><p>Across all proteins, a similar number of peptides increased and decreased in biotinylation intensity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> for site-level volcano plots and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for peptide-level plots). While KAHRP and PTP4 display changes to protein accessibility on a local level, other proteins show substantial changes to all biotinylated peptides. Most notably, PTP3, SEMP1, and PF3D7_0702500 each show an increase in biotinylation upon deletion of FIKK4.1 at almost all sites in both datasets, suggesting a more substantial change to the localization or the accessibility of the proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). SEMP1 and PF3D7_0702500 co-localize at the Maurer’s clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietz et al., 2014</xref>), while PTP3 appears to localize to the iRBC cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maier et al., 2008</xref>), although the presence of two predicted transmembrane domains suggests it may also associate with membranes. Of note, one site (position 2694) on Var2CSA PfEMP1 itself exhibited significantly increased biotinylation upon FIKK4.1 deletion, suggesting that it becomes more exposed. Other nearby biotinylation sites on Var2CSA do not change; the alterations leading to the defect in surface presentation may therefore be very subtle. Collectively these results indicate that FIKK4.1 activity leads to altered protein dynamics in the local environment of the cytoadhesion complex, including some previously identified PfEMP1 trafficking proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>FIKK4.1 is the only FIKK kinase important for trafficking multiple PfEMP1 variants but not RIFINs</title><p>Since other exported FIKK kinases localize to the periphery of the RBC or the Maurer’s clefts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nunes et al., 2010</xref>), we wanted to test whether any of the FIKK kinases in addition to FIKK4.1 play a role in the surface translocation of PfEMP1. To do so, we performed PfEMP1 surface translocation assays with all conditional FIKK kinase deletion lines we previously generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). Parasites were treated with rapamycin to delete the kinase domain and Var2CSA PfEMP1 surface translocation was assessed by flow cytometry at ~40 hpi in the subsequent cycle. Only FIKK4.1 showed a significant reduction in anti-Var2CSA antibody binding under the conditions tested here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This reduction in antibody binding is unlikely caused by misfolding of Var2CSA PfEMP1 as a reduced signal is observed upon FIKK4.1 deletion using four different antibodies raised against various domains of the protein (antibodies kindly gifted by Lars Hviid, University of Copenhagen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barfod et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that the defect arises from reduced PfEMP1 exposure on the iRBC surface rather than changes in the conformation of the extracellular region, as this would be less likely to affect all domains equally.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>FIKK4.1 is the only FIKK kinase to modulate surface translocation of PfEMP1, but not of RIFINs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Var2CSA surface translocation analysis by flow cytometry using anti-Var2CSA antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srivastava et al., 2011</xref>). y-axis, ratio of median fluorescence intensity of Var2CSA-positive cells between RAP and DMSO-treated parasites lines. x-axis, conditional kinase domain deletion lines for the indicated FIKK kinase. ‘FIKK 9s’ represents the deletion of seven FIKK kinases on chromosome 9.

To do so, we selected for binding to other endothelial cell receptors by panning over CD36-expressing CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lubiana et al., 2020</xref>). Treatment of these FIKK4.1 cKO parasites with rapamycin results in a 51.5 ± 13% reduction in cytoadhesion under flow to CHO cells expressing CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is similar to the 54% reduction in binding of Var2CSA-expressing parasites to CSA-expressing HBEC-5i cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that FIKK4.1 likely has a general role in modulating PfEMP1 surface translocation, and our previous observations were not limited to Var2CSA PfEMP1.</p><p>To further dissect how cytoadhesion is affected by FIKK4.1 deletion, we investigated how mimicking blood flow affects the avidity of binding. Wildtype and FIKK4.1 cKO lines were divided into two, treated with either rapamycin or DMSO, then stained with different DNA dyes and premixed before flowing over CSA-coated channels. Exposing both lines to the same conditions allowed us to control for differences in CSA coating, fluctuations in flow rates, and initial parasitemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The quantification of relative binding was automated by fluorescent image analysis in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Parasites were initially allowed to flow over CSA-coated channels at 4.5 mL/hr for 10 min, a slow rate which allows cells to roll along the surface of the channel. A difference in binding between the FIKK4.1 KO and wildtype parasites is already apparent at this point, suggesting that some cells lose their ability to bind CSA entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). By gradually increasing the flow rate to 150 mL/hr, a much stronger reduction in binding was observed in the FIKK4.1 KO line, indicating that the avidity of binding is also affected.</p><p>RIFIN family proteins are also exposed on the iRBC surface and several have been shown to bind immune cell receptors LILRB1 and LAIR1, leading to a downregulation of the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2017</xref>). We previously found that one RIFIN was differentially phosphorylated upon FIKK4.1 deletion, suggesting that the kinase may also be important for its trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). To test this, we used flow cytometry analysis of iRBC binding to Fc-tagged LILRB1 and LAIR1 to test the surface translocation of RIFINs. No difference was observed upon FIKK4.1 deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>), suggesting that FIKK4.1 is restricted to the trafficking of PfEMP1, indicating that there are independent mechanisms for the surface translocation of RIFINs and potentially other surface proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have combined conditional gene deletion with a peptide-centric TurboID proximity labeling approach, which we have termed PerTurboID, to better understand the complex downstream effects of gene deletion on a subcellular niche. We believe that this powerful method is widely applicable to study the effects of protein deletion or inactivation in a local environment. Here, we used PerTurboID to study the functions of FIKK4.1, an important regulator of efficient PfEMP1 surface translocation, a key factor for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>). We identified several proteins that undergo accessibility changes upon FIKK4.1 deletion, which may be connected to the PfEMP1 surface translocation defect. KAHRP and PTP4 were selected as molecular surveillance tools in the FIKK4.1 cKO line as they are highly phosphorylated in a FIKK4.1-dependent manner and are important for the presentation of PfEMP1 in knobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rug et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maier et al., 2008</xref>). Changes to the biotinylation pattern were observed for both KAHRP and PTP4 upon FIKK4.1 deletion; however, the most abundant accessibility changes were observed in proteins which are not highly phosphorylated by FIKK4.1. Neither SEMP1 nor PF3D7_0702500 are predicted substrates of the kinase, and PTP3 is phosphorylated at just one site. This suggests that PerTurboID can identify downstream changes in localization or folding of proteins that could not be predicted to be affected by kinase inactivation using phosphoproteomics. While SEMP1 deletion does not affect PfEMP1 trafficking and PF3D7_0702500 is uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietz et al., 2014</xref>), PTP3 deletion completely eliminates PfEMP1 on the RBC surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maier et al., 2008</xref>). Given the known function of both PTP3 and PTP4 for PfEMP1 surface translocation, it is possible that FIKK4.1 acts via one or both of these proteins to facilitate efficient PfEMP1 surface translocation, and thus cytoadhesion.</p><p>Whether the observed changes to Maurer’s cleft proteins and the PSAC nutrient channel composed of the RHOPH complex contribute to PfEMP1 surface translocation is unclear. The reduction in PfEMP1 at the parasite surface and its potential accumulation along the trafficking pathway may have a downstream effect on the mobility and accessibility of surrounding proteins. Although FIKK4.1 deletion affects the phosphorylation of RHOPH complex components RHOPH3 and Clag3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>), it has no apparent effect on parasite viability, suggesting that FIKK4.1 is not responsible for the function of this essential complex under the conditions tested. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that RHOPH proteins interact with J-dots and Maurer’s cleft proteins during trafficking, and that SEMP1 and PF3D7_0702500 co-localize at Maurer’s clefts but also interact with J-dot proteins, with SEMP1 also translocated to the RBC membrane in late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jonsdottir et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dietz et al., 2014</xref>). Our observed changes suggest that FIKK4.1 deletion may interfere with connections between trafficking vesicles, J-dots, and Maurer’s clefts, perhaps by modulating PTP3 or PTP4.</p><p>We found that RIFIN transport was not impaired by FIKK4.1 deletion, whereas other PfEMP1 variants were similarly affected, suggesting a general PfEMP1-trafficking pathway distinct from the trafficking of other surface proteins. While no other FIKK kinase was important for controlling the total amount of PfEMP1 on the surface under the conditions tested here, they may function redundantly or modulate the efficiency of PfEMP1 trafficking or its conformation at earlier timepoints or under other conditions. For example, fever-like temperatures lead to an earlier increase in surface exposure of PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Udomsangpetch et al., 2002</xref>), which could be regulated by other FIKK kinases. They could also modulate cytoadhesion in other ways; FIKK4.2 deletion leads to aberrant knob structures, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kats et al., 2014</xref>). Our optimized flow adhesion system could facilitate the analysis of cytoadhesion with other FIKK deletion lines and PfEMP1-receptor pairs.</p><p>We illustrate the potential for PerTurboID to measure changes to a multitude of protein characteristics in situ, including localization, topology, protein–protein interactions, structure, and post-translational modifications. The detection of several differentially phosphorylated sites upon FIKK4.1 deletion is validated by our previous phosphoproteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davies et al., 2020</xref>), and our topology analyses agree with previous experiments using selective permeabilization to study surface and Maurer’s cleft protein orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blisnick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saridaki et al., 2009</xref>). The detection of proteins specific to either KAHRP or PTP4 demonstrates the precision of TurboID for detecting subtle changes not visible by western blot or immunofluorescence. Despite both probes appearing to be peripherally localized in the RBC, KAHRP-associated proteins included mainly cytoskeletal components, whereas PTP4 associated with chaperones known to form J-dots, to which PTP4 has previously been localized. Interestingly, human alpha-synuclein was highly associated with KAHRP, indicating that it may reside at the erythrocyte cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbour et al., 2008</xref>). By using multiple different probes in different localizations and at different timepoints, PerTurboID can be used to further dissect the temporal regulation of protein trafficking.</p><p>Some caveats are important to consider: the length of biotin pulses should be restricted to avoid functional effects from excessive protein biotinylation. TurboID fusion proteins have the potential to capture random interactions. To gain confidence in direct vs. indirect interactions, the recently published XL-BioID could provide higher temporal resolution by freezing protein complexes in time through chemical crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geoghegan et al., 2022</xref>). For essential proteins, a non-functional probe protein localizing to the niche of interest could be TurboID-tagged to avoid indirect effects on parasite growth. Proteins high in lysines are likely to be over-represented in the data, while small proteins with fewer lysines may be missed. Fortunately, the alternative peptide-based processing method overcomes the main limitation of the traditional proximity labeling workflow: differentiating true interactions (biotinylated proteins) from the high background binding to beads. Here, non-biotinylated peptides can be identified and removed from the dataset, removing the necessity of including a wildtype or no-biotin control and considerably simplifying sample preparation and data analysis. This advantage is exemplified by the increased specificity for exported proteins in the KAHRP and PTP4-TurboID peptide-level dataset relative to the FIKK4.1-TurboID protein-level data.</p><p>PerTurboID can therefore complement other global methods probing protein accessibility such as limited proteolysis with mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cappelletti et al., 2021</xref>) or thermal protein profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Savitski et al., 2014</xref>), with the targeted approach potentially allowing for a finer dissection of a specific subcellular niche and overcoming difficulties in capturing low-abundance proteins in whole-cell preparations. While we apply this technique to cell perturbation by gene deletion, it has the potential to investigate many other changes to the local protein environment, including to measure the effects of drug treatment and external stressors, as well as in measuring temporal changes such as membrane protein trafficking across time.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vitro maintenance and synchronization of parasites</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites were cultured at 37°C in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% w/v AlbuMAX II, 25 mM HEPES, 11 mM glucose, 0.1 mM hypoxanthine, 21.4 mM sodium bicarbonate, and 12.5 µg/mL gentamycin (preformulated by Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study is sophisticated and well-carried out. Despite some the limitations of the methods that prevent conclusive statements on the precise mechanism of PfEMP1 trafficking and membrane insertion, the findings are considered valuable for the community.</p><p>The reviewers have not raised any major issues but several specific points that will need your attention. They have clearly expressed their concerns so I will not reiterate them here.</p><p>However, and importantly, the presentation is confusing and could be improved. Some of the figures are to be revised to improve clarify and the discussion should address the caveats and experimental limitations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Line 174. Description of the TurboID tagging of PTP4 or KAHRP in the FIKK4.1 conditional KO line. It was initially unclear to this reviewer that the conditional KO was made first, cloned and then used for TurboID tagging. This should be spelt out for readers who may otherwise be confused.</p><p>2. Supp. Figure 1</p><p>– Constructs should be listed in the order they are presented in the paper. ie. FIKK4.1 TurboID first.</p><p>– Coloring of primers to indicate position, while concise, may be difficult for some readers, esp. considering that 8% of males are red-green color-blind. I suggest using primer numbers.</p><p>3. Supp. Figure 2B – anti-HA blots for FIKK4.1 show many bands, when there should be one at ~74 kDa for FIKK4.1. The second most prominent band is below 100 kDa could reflect addition of a 30 kDa addition of NeoR for the selection-linked integration. The authors should clarify this. In this reviewer's hands, T2A cleavage is generally efficient. However, could it be compromised in the case of this exported protein?</p><p>4. Figure 4A. Barcoding of the results from + and – rapamycin treatment to disrupt FIKK4.1 is an elegant way to show these complex data. However, the presentation is confusing and could be improved. For KAHRP, I understand that FIKK4.1 KO will reduce phosphorylation in the 351-364 region and that therefore unphosphorylated peptides that include this region will become more abundant. However, it is not clear that the fraction of the unphosphorylated peptides that get biotinylated will necessarily increase. For each row in the case of KAHRP, is the fold change representation calculated relative to the corresponding pool (i.e. the biotinylated fraction of the unphosphorylated pool for the minus P column and the biotinylated fraction of the phosphorylated pool for the plus P column)? Alternatively, does it represent fold change relative to the total amount of the peptide (phos + unphos together)? This second calculation is misleading, I think. Why was it necessary to split KAHRP into minus and plus P arms, but not the other proteins displayed here? Presumably, for each lysine, there is an unphosphorylated fraction even when FIKK4.1 is not disrupted because of finite kinase efficiency.</p><p>Another issue with the barcodes: For ACS7 and RhoPH3 positions 876 and 853 are mentioned in the Results. However, numbered positions are not marked on the column plots, so the reader is left wondering which red or blue line in each column is being described. It might help to label critical positions with numbers on each column.</p><p>Would it help to have two sets of bar codes for each protein, one showing the fold change in phosphorylation upon FIKK4.1 knockout and the other showing the fold change in biotinylation (calculated separately for phosphorylated and unphosphorylated pools)?</p><p>5. Line 522-527. The authors only briefly mention caveats with use of PerTurboID and then state the limitations are &quot;largely overcome by the alternative processing method&quot;. Given the limitations, which are described above in my review, I would suggest expanding the discussion of the caveats and use phraseology more cautiously than &quot;largely overcome&quot;. Otherwise, the Discussion section is appropriately cautious.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Line 27: a citation to the current world malaria report should be included here since these numbers change with years.</p><p>– Figure 1B, 2D-G, S3: It would help the reader to interpret these images if the authors could include a transmitted light channel to orient to the RBC surface vs parasite periphery/PV.</p><p>– Figure S1: The FIKK4.1 turboID tagging schematic shows a stop codon is retained at the end of the FIKK4.1 sequence after modification of the locus to produce the tagged version of the gene. I assume this is an error and that only the stop codon after V5 should be present. Also, there should be a stop codon after the NeoR in the FIKK4.1 kinase deletion mutant (assuming this is the same strain/design as in the authors' previous Nat Micro paper) here and in the schematic in Figure 2A. Finally, it might help the reader to have the schematics in Figure S1 presented in the order they are discussed in the main text (ie, FIKK4.1-TurboID first, etc).</p><p>– Line 126: Needs a citation for this claim that ~16% of the genome encodes predicted exported proteins.</p><p>– Line 129-131: The authors may wish to note that RBCs are known to be the major peripheral source of α-synuclein (Barbour et al., 2008; PMID: 18182779). Although to my knowledge a function for α synuclein in RBCs is not known, this may help to explain why it was detected in these experiments. Given α synuclein is highly enriched in the KAHRP-T dataset, does this suggest localization at the RBC membrane/cytoskeleton? If so, are there any implications for RBC remodeling? Since the α synuclein data are mentioned multiple times in the Results section, the authors might comment briefly on this in the discussion.</p><p>– Line 153-156, Figure 1G: Human proteins are better represented at the 16-20 hpi time point while exported parasite proteins are better represented at the 40-44 hpi time point and non-exported parasite proteins seem generally evenly distributed between early and late time points. Does RBC biotin permeability change during intraerythrocytic development (perhaps based on activation of NPPs beginning at ~14 hpi and increasing into the trophozoite stage)? If so, how might higher biotin permeation at the later time point influence the data?</p><p>– Lines 216, 269, 277, 279, 494 496, 498, 807: This complex is generally referred to as the &quot;RhopH complex&quot; rather than the PSAC complex, since although its components are important to PSAC channel function, the exact mechanism has not been established (ie, whether RhopH directly forms the channel, etc).</p><p>– Line 274: Although not used to map their site-specific proteomic data, the authors might also wish to cite the independent soluble RhopH complex structure by Ho et al. 2021 (PMID: 34446549) here.</p><p>– Line 289: The authors should support this claim by citing Guy et al. 2015, PMID: 26513658.</p><p>– Line 299: Capitalize &quot;turboID&quot; as with other occurrences throughout the manuscript.</p><p>– Figure 1C, 2B: The data in 1C show that surface presentation of Var2CSA is not diminished by Turbo activity when biotin is added to FIKK4.1-T parasites. Was this assay ever carried out on the unmodified WT parental parasites to ensure the Turbo fusion itself to FIKK4.1 does not impact Var2CSA presentation? Similarly, Figure 2B shows that the TurboID tag on PTP4 or KAHRP does not change surface presentation relative to the FIKK4.1 diCre kinase domain mutant background on which these lines were built. However, given this FIKK4.1 conditional mutagenesis strategy involves at T2A skip after the HA epitope tag which does not skip with 100% efficiency (meaning that a portion of the FIKK4.1 protein will contain a C-terminal fusion to NeoR that could alter function, as shown in the western blots from the authors' previous Nat Micro paper and apparent here in the FIKK4.1 band detected by anti-HA at a higher than expected MW in Figure S2B which appears to account for ~30% of the FIKK4.1 protein) it seems important to compare with Var2CSA surface exposure in the parental (WT unmodified) line.</p><p>– Figure 1F: This is a nice diagram to convey the organization of the RBC membrane/cytoskeleton and summarize the top human proteins identified by FIKK4.1-T. However, I would recommend color coding the parasite proteins as well – or at least using a different color than the grey that is used for the human proteins that were not enriched by PL since this might confusingly suggest that PfEMP1 and other parasite-encoded knob proteins were not enriched by FIKK4.1-T.</p><p>– Figure 2B: Please clarify if these Var2CSA surface presentation assays were carried out in the presence or absence of biotin.</p><p>– Figure S2A: several major biotinylated bands in the KAHRP-TurboID input are noticeably absent in the avidin pull down; most notable, two major bands at about 80 and 90 kD and a band &gt;135 kD. Curiously, these bands also appear much less prominent in the time course in S2C. Any comment on why this might be?</p><p>– Line 464: this should be &quot;KO/WT&quot; as in the Y-axis of 5F.</p><p>– Lines 507-514: It is also possible that other FIKKs might function redundantly to support PfEMP1 trafficking.</p><p>In Figure 3C, the &quot;RBC cytosol&quot; label should be added to the bottom of the PV group as in the &quot;RBC surface&quot; and &quot;Maurer's Clefts&quot; groups to avoid possible confusion about topology. Also, J dots (which should probably be labeled &quot;J dots&quot; instead of just &quot;Dots&quot; in keeping with conventional nomenclature), are thought to be membrane-less organelles and thus the membrane in the diagram may be confusing. Additionally, the authors should clarify where topology has been biochemically determined (I only found this for SBP1 with refs 54 and 55, lines 520-521) vs where it is suggested by their biotinylated peptide data.</p><p>– Figure 5A: It may be useful to the reader to note in the figure legend that the FIKK9s mutant deletes 7 FIKKS while all others are individual FIKK knockouts.</p><p>– Line 926: The DMSO condition is not technically &quot;WT&quot; as it contains a 3xHA-2A-NeoR tag on FIKK4.2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is well written, and the data is very clear. There are a few suggestions to improve the work further:</p><p>1. Some of the figures are very busy and contain many panels. This makes it difficult to sometimes follow.</p><p>2. For IFA images shown it would be good to also show light microscopy to clearly show the whole cell as well.</p><p>3. As far as I understand disruption of FIKK4.1 leads to var2CSA not being translocated to the surface of the iRBC. It would therefore not assemble into knobs. Also, it means that it would accumulate extensively in the MCs. This raises a number of questions in relation to the interpretation of the data:</p><p>a. Are changes observed a result of a true overall change in structure or conformation or rather represent the fact that there is now a gap (due to missing var2CSA) that now creates accessibility.</p><p>b. Does the absence of var2CSA on the surface change overall RBC membrane characteristics that now for example allow PSAC to become more mobile and therefore come into closer proximity to the tagged proteins?</p><p>c. Are changes observed in the biotinylation of var2CSA a result of it getting stuck in MCs and if this is the case wouldn't one expect to see this also in the presence of FIKK4.1 as much of PfEMP1 remains in MCs.</p><p>4. In Figure 5. The authors show that FIKK4.1 impacts surface location of PfEMP1 but not RIFIN. To achieve this the authors used tagged LILRB1 and LAIR1 to demonstrate this. However, there are a number of issues that need to be considered.</p><p>a. In line 434 the authors state that RIFINs are surface exposed and cite the Saito et al., 2017 paper in support. However, as far as I understand the authors do not directly demonstrate that RIFINs are on the surface of the iRBC. They only show binding of the LILRB1 to the surface of the infected RBC. Moreover, the authors show that LILRB1 binding only happens in a small fraction of iRBC and is rapidly lost upon culturing. Can the authors be certain that the signal they detect is indeed due to RIFIN?</p><p>b. Since there is only a small subset of RIFIN that bind either LAIR or LILRB1 it would be interesting to note their expression level or whether disruption of FIKK4.1 has any impact on them.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PerTurboID, A targeted in situ method reveals the impact of kinase deletion on its local protein environment in the cytoadhesion complex of malaria causing parasites&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Dominique Soldati-Favre (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and will be acceptable for publication upon a minor revision addressing some remaining issues as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the authors have addressed the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>However, I am still not completely convinced by the arguments of the authors in relation to RIFIN surface expression.</p><p>I have looked at the presented data carefully again and also had another look at the Harrison et al. paper mentioned.</p><p>While there is little doubt that some RIFIN interact with LLIRB and LAIR there is no demonstration in any of the papers I am aware of that these RIFIN are actually expressed on the surface of the iRBC. NK cell inactivation can be achieved by secretion via microvessels or other mechanisms that do not involve surface expression. Moreover, the MFI is just around 100 as compared to around 600 for var2CSA expression. This raises some questions on how specific to RIFIN the observed signal really is.</p><p>I would recommend that the authors take this into consideration and tune down the conclusion a bit.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86367.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

This demonstrates that it is not necessary for biotinylation to change for us to observe a change in the ratio. In fact, we assume that the accessibility to biotinylation does not change, but that the pool of unphosphorylated protein increases. As we don’t observe the non-biotinylated peptides at all, all the fold changes are simply RAP/DMSO, calculated separately for the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated version of the peptide (not relative to the total amount). Only the phosphorylated peptides for KAHRP are shown in the main figure in order not to overcomplicate it, as KAHRP best illustrates the points discussed. All other proteins with at least one significantly changing peptide are shown in Supplementary figure 5, where all proteins with observed phosphorylated peptides include a +P barcode.

Since the α synuclein data are mentioned multiple times in the Results section, the authors might comment briefly on this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that is it likely that α-synuclein localises to the RBC cytoskeleton, and have added this and the citation to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 153-156, Figure 1G: Human proteins are better represented at the 16-20 hpi time point while exported parasite proteins are better represented at the 40-44 hpi time point and non-exported parasite proteins seem generally evenly distributed between early and late time points. Does RBC biotin permeability change during intraerythrocytic development (perhaps based on activation of NPPs beginning at ~14 hpi and increasing into the trophozoite stage)? If so, how might higher biotin permeation at the later time point influence the data?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting possibility and while it’s possible that NPP activity affects biotin permeability, we think it’s unlikely due to the small size of biotin and as we observe a biotin signal in Turbo-ID lines by IFA before ~14 hpi. Regardless, as the TurboID tag resides within the cell, a change in biotin permeability would affect all proteins equally and wouldn’t affect the data as far as we are aware.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 216, 269, 277, 279, 494 496, 498, 807: This complex is generally referred to as the &quot;RhopH complex&quot; rather than the PSAC complex, since although its components are important to PSAC channel function, the exact mechanism has not been established (ie, whether RhopH directly forms the channel, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you we have changed PSAC to RHOPH complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 274: Although not used to map their site-specific proteomic data, the authors might also wish to cite the independent soluble RhopH complex structure by Ho et al. 2021 (PMID: 34446549) here.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes both structures should certainly be cited, thank you for bringing this oversight to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 289: The authors should support this claim by citing Guy et al. 2015, PMID: 26513658.</p></disp-quote><p>Citation added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 299: Capitalize &quot;turboID&quot; as with other occurrences throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1C, 2B: The data in 1C show that surface presentation of Var2CSA is not diminished by Turbo activity when biotin is added to FIKK4.1-T parasites. Was this assay ever carried out on the unmodified WT parental parasites to ensure the Turbo fusion itself to FIKK4.1 does not impact Var2CSA presentation? Similarly, Figure 2B shows that the TurboID tag on PTP4 or KAHRP does not change surface presentation relative to the FIKK4.1 diCre kinase domain mutant background on which these lines were built. However, given this FIKK4.1 conditional mutagenesis strategy involves at T2A skip after the HA epitope tag which does not skip with 100% efficiency (meaning that a portion of the FIKK4.1 protein will contain a C-terminal fusion to NeoR that could alter function, as shown in the western blots from the authors' previous Nat Micro paper and apparent here in the FIKK4.1 band detected by anti-HA at a higher than expected MW in Figure S2B which appears to account for ~30% of the FIKK4.1 protein) it seems important to compare with Var2CSA surface exposure in the parental (WT unmodified) line.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included supplementary figures comparing FIKK4.1 cKO Var2CSA presentation to that of wildtype, demonstrating that there is very little difference.

In lieu of that, we included several other parasite lines including FIKK4.2 cKO, FIKK7.1 cKO, and FIKK4.1 cKO, which are all wildtype at the FIKK4.1 locus. While the FIKK4.1-TurboID had lower median fluorescence intensity for Var2CSA compared to FIKK4.2 and FIKK4.1 cKO lines, it was higher than FIKK7.1 cKO. We found Var2CSA surface expression to be generally variable between parasite lines, which necessitated our conditional approach for gene KO. We believe this is natural variation between parasite lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 1F: This is a nice diagram to convey the organization of the RBC membrane/cytoskeleton and summarize the top human proteins identified by FIKK4.1-T. However, I would recommend color coding the parasite proteins as well – or at least using a different color than the grey that is used for the human proteins that were not enriched by PL since this might confusingly suggest that PfEMP1 and other parasite-encoded knob proteins were not enriched by FIKK4.1-T.</p></disp-quote><p>We have coloured the parasite proteins in black to differentiate them from unchanging RBC proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2B: Please clarify if these Var2CSA surface presentation assays were carried out in the presence or absence of biotin.</p></disp-quote><p>They were performed in the absence of biotin.

Curiously, these bands also appear much less prominent in the time course in S2C. Any comment on why this might be?</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the proteins are strongly retained on the beads and are not solubilised, or they precipitate during the incubation phase of pull down. We have not further commented on this here because they are indeed less prominent or absent in the shorter pulses in the timecourse, which is used for all mass-spectrometry experiments. Our interpretation is that these could be proteins of highly abundance along the trafficking pathway as they don’t prominently show up in the pulsed samples. From our data we are not able to identify the nature of the proteins, although it could be interesting to that in the future if they represent intermediate trafficking complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 464: this should be &quot;KO/WT&quot; as in the Y-axis of 5F.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 507-514: It is also possible that other FIKKs might function redundantly to support PfEMP1 trafficking.</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, statement has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3C, the &quot;RBC cytosol&quot; label should be added to the bottom of the PV group as in the &quot;RBC surface&quot; and &quot;Maurer's Clefts&quot; groups to avoid possible confusion about topology. Also, J dots (which should probably be labeled &quot;J dots&quot; instead of just &quot;Dots&quot; in keeping with conventional nomenclature), are thought to be membrane-less organelles and thus the membrane in the diagram may be confusing. Additionally, the authors should clarify where topology has been biochemically determined (I only found this for SBP1 with refs 54 and 55, lines 520-521) vs where it is suggested by their biotinylated peptide data.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot conclude from our data in which orientation the proteins are inserted into the PV, or on which side the biotinylation occurs. We have changed ‘Dots’ to ‘punctate in RBC cytosol’ as the localisation isn’t definitive for these proteins. PTP7 has been moved to the maurer’s cleft category as it is better suited. Many of these proteins are likely trafficked in chaperoned complexes such as the J-dots where the TM domain is not membrane inserted – the schematic depicts their likely topology if/when inserted into a membrane – for example some MC proteins are trafficked to the RBC surface in later stages. This has been clarified in the figure legend.

As far as I understand disruption of FIKK4.1 leads to var2CSA not being translocated to the surface of the iRBC. It would therefore not assemble into knobs. Also, it means that it would accumulate extensively in the MCs. This raises a number of questions in relation to the interpretation of the data:</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that deletion of FIKK4.1 leads to a surface translocation defect of ~50% and is NOT completely blocked. Therefore, we don’t expect to see all- or – nothing phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. Are changes observed a result of a true overall change in structure or conformation or rather represent the fact that there is now a gap (due to missing var2CSA) that now creates accessibility.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a possibility, but overall the amount of PfEMP1 in the knobs is relatively small so we do not know how much of a gap a reduction of 50% of PfEMP1 would make, and if the proteins would move into that gap. Answering these questions will require single molecule quantification, or PerTurboID experiments with lines where PfEMP1 surface translocation is completely blocked, which should then result in higher accumulation of proteins at the knobs which we could compare to. This is too ambitious for this project, but we anticipate that over the course of the next years we will build much more information and be able to answer that question more definitively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Does the absence of var2CSA on the surface change overall RBC membrane characteristics that now for example allow PSAC to become more mobile and therefore come into closer proximity to the tagged proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a possibility: disruption of FIKK4.1 also reduces the rigidity of the RBC, which could lead to higher mobility of the RHOPH complex.</p><p>We have added “The reduction in PfEMP1 at the parasite surface and its potential accumulation along the trafficking pathway may have a downstream effect on the mobility and accessibility of surrounding proteins”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Are changes observed in the biotinylation of var2CSA a result of it getting stuck in MCs and if this is the case wouldn't one expect to see this also in the presence of FIKK4.1 as much of PfEMP1 remains in MCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know if more PfEMP1 is retained in the Maurer’s clefts, or if PfEMP1 is delivered to the knobs, but is not translocated efficiently. To test this, we would need to generate a Maurer’s cleft sensor line in an FIKK4.1 KO to quantify PfEMP1 levels. We have plans to do this in the future. Clearly, IFAs are not sensitive enough to pick up a difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 5. The authors show that FIKK4.1 impacts surface location of PfEMP1 but not RIFIN. To achieve this the authors used tagged LILRB1 and LAIR1 to demonstrate this. However, there are a number of issues that need to be considered.</p><p>a. In line 434 the authors state that RIFINs are surface exposed and cite the Saito et al., 2017 paper in support. However, as far as I understand the authors do not directly demonstrate that RIFINs are on the surface of the iRBC. They only show binding of the LILRB1 to the surface of the infected RBC. Moreover, the authors show that LILRB1 binding only happens in a small fraction of iRBC and is rapidly lost upon culturing. Can the authors be certain that the signal they detect is indeed due to RIFIN?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the Saito et al. paper allows us to infer that any binding between LILRB1/LAIR1 and iRBC is due to RIFINs. There is more evidence of a direct complex between the RIFINs and LILR1B, which would be hard to explain if the RIFIN would not reach the surface of the iRBC https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7116854/. Uninfected RBC do not bind these ligands, and they showed that transgenic lines expressing specific RIFINs bound to LILRB1 or LAIR1. While it is possible that another parasite protein also binds to these ligands, it is unlikely that our parasite lines don’t express any of the several RIFINs which do bind them. Any changes to RIFIN surface presentation would therefore be observed. We observed about 5-20% binding of iRBC to either LILRB1 or LAIR1, consistent with a mixed population of RIFINs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Since there is only a small subset of RIFIN that bind either LAIR or LILRB1 it would be interesting to note their expression level or whether disruption of FIKK4.1 has any impact on them.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no change in RIFIN surface levels so we would not expect expression levels to be changing. Whether other RIFINs may change in expression levels is unknown, but given a lack of selective pressure in our cell culture conditions and that FIKK4.1 is a exported kinase, we do not necessarily expect changes in parasite gene expression levels.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved and will be acceptable for publication upon a minor revision addressing some remaining issues as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the authors have addressed the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>However, I am still not completely convinced by the arguments of the authors in relation to RIFIN surface expression.</p><p>I have looked at the presented data carefully again and also had another look at the Harrison et al. paper mentioned.</p><p>While there is little doubt that some RIFIN interact with LLIRB and LAIR there is no demonstration in any of the papers I am aware of that these RIFIN are actually expressed on the surface of the iRBC. NK cell inactivation can be achieved by secretion via microvessels or other mechanisms that do not involve surface expression. Moreover, the MFI is just around 100 as compared to around 600 for var2CSA expression. This raises some questions on how specific to RIFIN the observed signal really is.</p><p>I would recommend that the authors take this into consideration and tune down the conclusion a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>First the intensity values for LILRB1 and LAIR1 binding are actually very high for individual iRBCs (but not uiRBCs), when considering the histograms in 5G rather than 5H (which was incorrectly labelled). However, there is a bigger spread, reflecting the variability of the expression of rifins within the population. But the ability of the LAIR1 and LILRB1 reagents to recognize the proteins on the surface of unfixed and unpermeabilised iRBCs, but not on uiRBCs, strongly argues for their presence on the surface. The specificity of these reagents has been extensively tested and is supported by structural biology analysis and others have previously shown these to bind to unpermeabilised iRBCs using FACS analysis. While this does not preclude additional secretion, it certainly provides strong evidence for the presence of rifins on the surface.</p><p>Second we have generated a PF3D7_1254800 (LILRB1 binding rifin) Turbo-ID line linked to a selection marker to force expression for an unrelated project in the lab. With this cell line, we observe a marked increase of LILRB1 binding to iRBCs, strongly supporting the validity of the argument for this rifin on the surface. This increase is not observed in a cell line that force expresses a var2csa:PfEMP1:TurboID variant, showing the specificity of the signal. This cannot be included in this manuscript as it is completely unrelated, but hopefully convinces the reviewer (and you) that our confidence in our data has merit.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86367-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>These data do not preclude additional secretion of RIFINs, for example via microvesicles (we presume the reviewer does not mean microvessels), but show that expression on the surface certainly occurs. This is also in line with experiments for other rifins, which has been tested in more detail (for example here) https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-015-0784-2.If the reviewer is aware of data that shows secretion of the rifins we tested it woud add a layer to their function, but not invalidate the data of us and others. But we don’t think we need to discuss the possibility of secretion in our paper in the absence of such data in the public domain.</p></body></sub-article></article>
