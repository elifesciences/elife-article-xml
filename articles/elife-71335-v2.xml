Reducing insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) increases lifespan across species, but the effects of reduced IIS interventions in extreme geriatric ages remains unknown. Using the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we engineered the conditional depletion of the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 transmembrane receptor using an auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system. This allowed for the temporal and spatial reduction in DAF-2 protein levels at time points after which interventions such as RNAi become ineffective. Using this system, we found that AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein surpasses the longevity of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. Depletion of DAF-2 during early adulthood resulted in multiple adverse phenotypes, including growth retardation, germline shrinkage, egg retention, and reduced brood size. By contrast, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 post-reproduction, or specifically in the intestine in early adulthood, resulted in an extension of lifespan without these deleterious effects. Strikingly, at geriatric ages, when 75% of the population had died, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein resulted in a doubling in lifespan. Thus, we provide a proof-of-concept that even close to the end of an individual’s lifespan, it is possible to slow aging and promote longevity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The goal of geroscience, or research into old age, is to promote health during old age, and thus, to increase lifespan. In the body, the groups of biochemical reactions, or ‘pathways’, that allow an organism to sense nutrients, and regulate growth and stress, play major roles in ensuring healthy aging. Indeed, organisms that do not produce a working version of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor, a protein involved in one such pathway, show increased lifespan. In the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, mutations in the insulin/IGF-1 receptor can even double their lifespan. However, it is unclear whether this increase can be achieved once the organism has reached old age.</p><p>To answer this question, Venz et al. genetically engineered the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> so that they could trigger the rapid degradation of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor either in the entire organism or in a specific tissue. Venz et al. started by aging several <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms for three weeks, until about 75% had died. At this point, they triggered the degradation of the insulin/IGF-1 receptor in some of the remaining worms, keeping the rest untreated as a control for the experiment.</p><p>The results showed that the untreated worms died within a few days, while worms in which the insulin/IGF-1 receptor had been degraded lived for almost one more month. This demonstrates that it is possible to double the lifespan of an organism at the very end of life.</p><p>Venz et al.’s findings suggest that it is possible to make interventions to extend an organism’s lifespan near the end of life that are as effective as if they were performed when the organism was younger. This sparks new questions regarding the quality of this lifespan extension: do the worms become younger with the intervention, or is aging simply slowed down?</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>DAF-2</kwd><kwd>auxin</kwd><kwd>degron</kwd><kwd>dauer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_163898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ewald</surname><given-names>Collin Yvès</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRIMEDBIO-286499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ciosk</surname><given-names>Rafal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inducible degradation of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor shows that a doubling in lifespan is possible even at extremely old ages in an organism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The goal of aging research or geroscience is to identify interventions that promote health during old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Partridge et al., 2018</xref>). Nutrient-sensing pathways that regulate growth and stress resistance play major roles as conserved assurance pathways for healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). One of the first longevity pathways discovered was the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling pathway (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). Reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) increases lifespan across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). Mice heterozygous for the IGF-1 receptor, or with depleted insulin receptor in adipose tissue, are stress-resistant and long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blüher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holzenberger et al., 2003</xref>), for example, and several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the IIS pathway have been associated with human longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kenyon, 2010</xref>). Moreover, gene variants in the IGF-1 receptor have been associated and functionally linked with long lifespans in human centenarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suh et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that a comprehensive understanding of this pathway in experimental, genetically tractable organisms has promising translational value for promoting health in elderly humans. However, whether or not reducing IIS during end-of-life stages can still promote health and longevity in any organism is unknown. Therefore, we turned to the model organism <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to investigate whether reducing IIS during old age was sufficient to increase lifespan.</p><p>The groundbreaking discovery that a single mutation in <italic>daf-2</italic>, which is the orthologue of both the insulin and IGF-1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>), or mutations in ‘downstream’ genes in the IIS pathway, could double the lifespan of an organism was made in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman and Johnson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>). Since its discovery, over 1000 papers on <italic>daf-2</italic> have been published, making it one of the most studied genes in this model organism (Source: PubMed). Genetic and genomics approaches have revealed that the DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor signaling regulates growth, development, metabolism, inter-tissue signaling, immunity, stress defense, and protein homeostasis, including extracellular matrix remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gems et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murphy and Hu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wolkow et al., 2000</xref>). Much of our knowledge of the effects of <italic>daf-2</italic> on aging has come from the study of reduction-of-function alleles of <italic>daf-2</italic>. Several alleles of <italic>daf-2</italic> have been isolated that are temperature-sensitive with respect to an alternative developmental trajectory. For instance, most <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants develop into adults at 15°C and 20°C but enter the dauer stage at 25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gems et al., 1998</xref>), which is a facultative and alternative larval endurance stage in which <italic>C. elegans</italic> spends most of its life cycle in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu, 2007</xref>). Under favorable conditions, <italic>C. elegans</italic> develops through four larval stages (L1–L4). By contrast, when the animals are deprived of food and experience an overcrowded environment and/or thermal stress (above 27°C), the developing larvae molt into an alternative pre-dauer (L2d) stage. If conditions do not improve, <italic>C. elegans</italic> enter the dauer diapause instead of the L3 stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Golden and Riddle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karp, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A major limitation in using <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants is that several of them show L1 larval and pre-dauer stage (L2d) arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gems et al., 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>daf-2</italic> alleles have been categorized into two mutant classes depending on the penetrance of dauer-like phenotypes during adulthood, such as reduced brood size, small body size, and germline shrinkage, as observed in the <italic>daf-2</italic> class II mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arantes-Oliveira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gems et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hess et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Podshivalova and Kerr, 2017</xref>). RNA interference of <italic>daf-2</italic> can be applied, which increases lifespan without dauer formation during development and circumvents induction of <italic>daf-2</italic> class II mutant phenotypes during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kennedy et al., 2004</xref>). However, the increase in lifespan by RNAi of <italic>daf-2</italic> is only partial compared to strong alleles such as <italic>daf-2(e1370</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, adult-specific RNAi knockdown of <italic>daf-2</italic> quickly loses its potential to increase lifespan and does not extend lifespan when started after day 6 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillin et al., 2002</xref>), that is<italic>,</italic> after the reproductive period of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Whether this is due to age-related functional decline of RNAi machinery or residual DAF-2 protein levels, or whether the late-life depletion of <italic>daf-2</italic> simply does not extend lifespan remains unclear. As such, using an alternative method to reduce DAF-2 levels beyond RNAi or <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation may allow us to more clearly uncouple the pleiotropic effects of reduced IIS during development from those that drive <italic>daf-2</italic>-mediated longevity during late adulthood.</p><p>To this end, we used an auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system to induce the depletion of the degron-tagged DAF-2 protein with temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> IAA17 degron is a 68-amino acid motif that is specifically recognized by the transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR1) protein only in the presence of the plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>). Although cytoplasmic, nuclear, and membrane-binding proteins tagged with degron have been recently shown to be targeted and degraded in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), to our knowledge, the AID system has not been used previously to degrade transmembrane proteins, such as the DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor. We find that using AID effectively degrades DAF-2 protein and promotes dauer formation when applied early in development. Dauer-like phenotypes are present in adults when AID of DAF-2 is applied late in development. Some of these adulthood dauer traits are induced by the loss of <italic>daf-2</italic> in neurons, but others seem to be caused by the systemic loss of <italic>daf-2</italic>. More importantly, the post-developmental, conditional degradation of DAF-2 protein extends lifespan without introducing dauer-like phenotypes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that when more than half of the population has died at day 25 of adulthood, AID of DAF-2 in these remaining aged animals is sufficient to promote longevity. Our work suggests that therapeutics applied at even extremely late stages of life are capable of increasing longevity and healthspan in animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and validation of a degron-tagged DAF-2 receptor</title><p>To monitor and conditionally regulate protein levels of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor, we introduced a degron::3xFLAG tag into the 3' end of the <italic>daf-2</italic> open reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This degron::3xFLAG insertion into the genome was designed to tag the DAF-2 receptor at the cytosolic part for two reasons: first, to minimize any interference by the 81-amino acids large degron::3xFLAG-tag with the DAF-2 receptor function; and second, to ensure accessibility of the degron for targeted degradation by the TIR1 ubiquitin ligase expressed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We endogenously tagged the DAF-2 receptor using CRISPR, and the resulting <italic>daf-2(bch40</italic>) CRISPR allele was verified by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We performed western blot analysis against the 3xFLAG-tag and detected a specific band in <italic>daf-2(bch40</italic>) animals. This band was absent in wild type (N2) and animals carrying only the <italic>eft-3p</italic>::TIR1::mRuby::<italic>unc-54</italic> 3'UTR transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which expresses TIR1 in all somatic cells, including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomioka et al., 2016</xref>). To promote degradation of the degron::3xFLAG-tagged DAF-2 receptor, we crossed <italic>daf-2(bch40</italic>) into TIR1-expressing <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The strain obtained from this cross will be called ‘DAF-2::degron’ throughout this paper (i.e., <italic>Si57</italic> [P<italic>eft-3</italic>::TIR1::mRuby::<italic>unc-54</italic> 3'UTR+ <italic>Cbr-unc-119</italic>(+)] II; <italic>daf-2(bch40</italic> [degron::3xFLAG::STOP::SL2-SV40-degron::wrmScarlet-<italic>egl-13</italic> NLS]) III). This strain showed no obvious phenotypes and exhibited a normal developmental progression at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To verify whether the band from the western blot was indeed DAF-2::degron::3xFLAG, we treated DAF-2::degron animals with <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi.

We first asked whether our DAF-2::degron::3xFLAG tag allows quantification of endogenous DAF-2 levels. We observed comparable wild-type DAF-2::degron::3xFLAG levels across a range of temperatures (15–28°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that temperature does not influence DAF-2 levels in wild type. Intriguingly, however, we found that using FLAG-HRP antibodies to monitor protein levels, DAF-2 protein almost completely disappeared after 36–48 hr of starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). In keeping with this result, well-fed animals, for which we added 1% glucose into the bacterial diet (OP50), increased the DAF-2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).

The dependence on auxin concentration for dauer formation of L1 animals suggests a threshold of DAF-2 receptor levels for the decision or commitment to dauer diapause. Even more surprising was the observation that dauer formation was also observed at 15°C and 20°C with complete penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).

First, larval stage (L1) wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> that are food-deprived, exposed to elevated temperatures (&gt;27°C), and/or are crowded, enter into a pre-dauer L2d stage, where they continue monitoring their environment before committing and molting into dauers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karp, 2018</xref>).

By using AID to manipulate DAF-2 levels directly, we found that AID degradation of DAF-2 during a narrow time period in the mid-L1 stage is sufficient to induce dauer formation, suggesting that the decision to enter dauer relies upon a threshold of DAF-2 protein levels. This decision is uncoupled from temperature or food abundance. Thus, absolute DAF-2 protein abundance appears to be a key factor in the animal’s decision to enter into the dauer state during early development.</p><p>Although IIS is reduced in <italic>daf-2(e1370</italic> or <italic>e1368</italic>) mutants at lower temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ewald et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gems et al., 1998</xref>), dauer larvae are formed only when these <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants are exposed to higher temperatures.

Other parallels between mammals and nematodes are the tissues from which lower insulin/IGF-1 receptor levels promote longevity. Mice carrying brain-specific heterozygous IGF-1 receptor knockout are long-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kappeler et al., 2008</xref>), as are the mice with adipose-specific knockout of the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blüher et al., 2003</xref>). This is reminiscent of our findings that AID of DAF-2::degron in neurons or intestine (the major fat-storage tissue in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) was sufficient to increase the lifespan. These similarities could reflect conserved functions, as <italic>daf-2</italic> is considered the common ancestor to both insulin and IGF-1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Although it is known that neurons and the intestine are important for food perception and regulation of food intake, the effects of food perception or intake on insulin receptor and IGF-1 receptor levels are poorly understood. Starving rats for 3 days increases the abundance of insulin-bound insulin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koopmans et al., 1995</xref>), possibly to increase glucose uptake. It is unknown whether prolonged starvation would lead to lower basal insulin/IGF-1 receptor levels. However, alterations of the IGF-1 receptor levels are associated with altered lifespan. For instance, heterozygous IGF-1 receptor knockout mice, which have lower IGF-1 receptor levels, have an increased lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holzenberger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kappeler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Also, overexpression of the short isoform of p53 (p44) increases IGF-1 receptor levels and shortens the lifespan of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the administration of recombinant human IGF-1 increases IGF-1 receptor abundance in murine embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier et al., 2004</xref>). Food components themselves can affect insulin receptor levels. For instance, palmitate activates PPARα to induce <italic>miR-15b,</italic> which targets insulin receptor mRNA for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Potentially, food components could impact the murine insulin/IGF-1 receptor also via its degradation.</p><p>Indeed, there is some evidence suggesting the regulation of insulin/IGF-1 receptor abundance by E3 ubiquitin ligases. For instance, the E3 ligase CHIP regulates insulin/IGF-1 receptor levels in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and human cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tawo et al., 2017</xref>). In mice, the muscle-specific mitsugumin 53 (MG53) E3 ligase targets the insulin receptor for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2013</xref>). High-fat diet results in the reduction of insulin receptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>) via higher MG53-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2013</xref>). MG53 is upregulated under a high-fat diet in mice, and MG53-/- deficient mice are protected from high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and other metabolic syndrome-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, another E3 ligase, MARCH1, is overexpressed in obese humans and targets the insulin receptor for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagarajan et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that food abundance controls mammalian insulin receptor levels via E3 ligase-mediated degradation. Although in <italic>C. elegans</italic> we found the opposite changes in DAF-2 receptor levels, that is, they were reduced upon starvation and increased upon high glucose feeding, our observations suggest that nutritional cues may regulate insulin/IGF-1 receptor levels via a variety of mechanisms, including ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, across species.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that interventions at almost the end of life can increase lifespan. We have established that auxin-induced degradation is suitable for targeting transmembrane receptors for non-invasive manipulations during developmental and longevity in vivo studies. We reconciled a longstanding question by providing evidence that dauer-like traits are not a spill-over of reprogrammed physiology from developing L2d pre-dauers. Instead, the essential growth-related functions of DAF-2 are causing deficits when applied during development or growth phases. We have shown that tissue-specific interventions or global interventions beyond reproduction or growth extend lifespan without pathology or deficits. Degradation of DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor might not be an artificial intervention since DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor abundance is read-out to adapt metabolism to food abundance. Dissecting intrinsic DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor abundance in response to nutritional cues may impact our understanding of nutrient sensing in promoting health during old age.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>All strains were maintained on NGM plates and OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> at 15°C as described.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper by R. Venz et al., describes careful work involving the use of auxin-mediated degradation of the DAF-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Since its initial discovery as a gene that could dramatically alter lifespan in this organism, daf-2 has been very extensively studied. Nevertheless, the authors make excellent and thorough use of their novel reagents to successfully add important new findings to our understanding of this broadly conserved aging pathway, including that intervening in the levels of this protein very late in life can still have dramatic effects on lifespan.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;End-of-life targeted auxin-mediated degradation of DAF-2 Insulin/IGF-1 receptor promotes longevity free from growth-related pathologies&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Joy Alcedo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and I are in agreement that the subject of the manuscript is of high interest, the data are high quality, and the assertions are generally well-supported by the data. There were a number of issues brought up in review, but a vast majority of them involve clarity and presentation of the data and we agree that they can all be addressed without additional experiments. I have consolidated the reviewer comments below, as addressing them all should prove feasible and will improve the text.</p><p>1) An important claim made in the abstract and several times in the paper is that depleting DAF-2 late in life increases lifespan while avoiding &quot;dauer-associated&quot; phenotypes associated with earlier depletion of DAF-2. The increase in lifespan is shown in figure 5, but &quot;dauer-associated&quot; phenotypes are not addressed in worms with this treatment. Please clarify what you mean by dauer-associated phenotypes. To many, dauer-associated phenotypes involve phenotypes acquired during the dauer state. If the animals never entered the dauer state, then any subsequent phenotypes are not the result of the dauer state.</p><p>2) Another claim that is emphasized is regarding the time when DAF-2 activity is required to promote non-dauer development. There are three aspects related to this claim that require more explanation: 1) statements are made on Line 264 and line 464 that reducing daf-2 during the mid-L1 stage causes dauer formation irrespective of conditions later in development. However, data were not presented addressing the environment at L2d or later stages, other than the observation made earlier that dauer formation is induced at all temperatures tested, 2) The statement on line 465 that the abundance of DAF-2 appears to be the key or sole factor in the dauer formation decision should be revised to reflect the fact that there are several interconnected dauer formation pathways and mutations in genes in any of these pathways are sufficient to cause dauer formation. There is no indication that daf-2 is more important than daf-7 or daf-12, for example, 3) experiments shown in supplemental figure 3 address the precise timing when daf-2 activity is needed to promote non-dauer development. There are three different criteria used to describe the stages in question. The text describes animals as mid-L1. Supplemental figures 1A-B show hours since the onset of feeding. And finally supplemental figure 3C shows the number of germ cells per animal. However, these three criteria are never put in context relative to each other, so it is difficult to understand how they all relate to each other. Under the conditions in the experiments, when does the L1 molt occur in terms of hours post-feeding? How many germ cells are present at different stages of the L1? Is the correlation between germ cell number and developmental stage based on your own observations or previously published work?</p><p>3) There are several places where the information in figure legends and/or methods is incomplete. Some examples are given below, but in general the authors are encouraged to revisit the legends and methods section and make sure the experiments are clearly described.</p><p>Examples of this include:</p><p>A. In some figures when statistical significance is shown as asterisks over a single bar in a graph, it is not clear which samples are being compared. Adding bars to show the comparisons or information in the figure legend would clarify this point.</p><p>B. Please add methods to explain how the starvation experiments shown in figures 1F-1H were performed.</p><p>C. Please add methods to explain how RNAi experiments were performed.</p><p>D. What stage animals were used for the reporter experiments used in figure 2?</p><p>E. In figure 2F, at what stage are the arrested animals? From what I can see they don't look like dauers.</p><p>F. In supplementary figure 3, how were germ cells recognized and distinguished from cells in the somatic gonad?</p><p>G. In supplementary figure 4A-B, which specific genotypes are shown?</p><p>H. In figure 5, panel D is not mentioned in the legend. A description of panel D should be added, together with an explanation of how panel C and panel D differ from each other, since they seem to be showing very similar information.</p><p>4) Similarly, communication of information would be improved by the following:</p><p>A. The text within figures is incredibly tiny. All of the figures would benefit from dramatically increasing the size of the text to fill more of the white space available.</p><p>B. In supplemental figure 1D, without reading the methods section, it is not clear what the experiment is that is being done here. Consider adding more information to the figure legend.</p><p>C. It would be helpful to have brief explanation of why phenotypes such as egg-retention are called &quot;dauer-associated&quot;, when dauer larvae are too young to have eggs. Reduced motility and stress resistance are examples of phenotypes that are shared by dauers and daf-2 mutant adults, but the reproductive phenotypes seem different.</p><p>5) A more minor, but very interesting claim made on line 180 concerns the effect of the environment on DAF-2 levels. Building on the results of Kimura et al., the authors show two different experiments, one in which starvation causes a dramatic reduction in DAF-2 levels (Figure 1F-1G) and a second experiment in which no effect on DAF-2 levels was seen (Figure 1H). They interpret the difference between these experiments to be the different bacterial strains that worms were fed prior to starvation. However, there appears to be many differences between these two experiments. The OP50 experiments were presumably carried out on standard NGM plates, since no additional information was provided. In contrast, the HT1115 experiments mention L4440, which is the empty vector control used for RNAi. This presumably means that worms were exposed to RNAi conditions, including IPTG and ampicillin, as well as the double-stranded RNAi coming from the empty vector. Furthermore, FUDR was mentioned for this experiment but not the OP50 experiment. Therefore, in principle any one of these conditions, or a combination, could have affected DAF-2 levels. If the authors wish to make conclusions about the bacterial strain they should perform an experiment where the bacterial strain is the only difference in experimental conditions. Alternatively, they can adjust their wording to encompass all of the differences between the experiments. In any case, the experimental details for these experiments should be added to the methods section.</p><p>6) In Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B, please annotate the timepoints associated with the L1 and L2 molts in their graphs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71335.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers and I are in agreement that the subject of the manuscript is of high interest, the data are high quality, and the assertions are generally well-supported by the data.

The term dauer-like has been used by our and other labs (PMID: 14576426, 15308663, 28934747) before describing these daf-2 mutant phenotypes. We realized that “dauer-associated” is too vague. What we wanted to define with this term were the daf-2 class II mutant phenotypes that emerge at higher temperatures during adulthood, as characterized by David Gems (PMID: 9725835). Thus, we changed most of the “dauer-associated” to “daf-2 class II mutant” phenotypes. To maintain the flow of the text, we replaced the remaining few “dauer-associated” terms with “dauer-like”.</p><p>We have also rewritten the abstract, since as pointed out in Figure 5, we do not provide quantitative data measuring these “dauer-associated” phenotypes. We only observed that these geriatric AID daf-2 animals are mobile (i.e., do not show dauer-like quiescence).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another claim that is emphasized is regarding the time when DAF-2 activity is required to promote non-dauer development. There are three aspects related to this claim that require more explanation: 1) statements are made on Line 264 and line 464 that reducing daf-2 during the mid-L1 stage causes dauer formation irrespective of conditions later in development. However, data were not presented addressing the environment at L2d or later stages, other than the observation made earlier that dauer formation is induced at all temperatures tested,</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the statements are based on indirect observation and would need more direct evidence. Thus, we deleted this claim and changed the text to:</p><p>For Line 264: “We found that when DAF-2 levels are below a given threshold at the mid-L1 stage, the animals commit to dauer formation.”</p><p>For Line 464: “This decision is uncoupled from temperature or food abundance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statement on line 465 that the abundance of DAF-2 appears to be the key or sole factor in the dauer formation decision should be revised to reflect the fact that there are several interconnected dauer formation pathways and mutations in genes in any of these pathways are sufficient to cause dauer formation. There is no indication that daf-2 is more important than daf-7 or daf-12, for example,</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct. We rewrote this statement to:</p><p>“Thus, absolute DAF-2 protein abundance appears to be a key factor in the animal’s decision to enter into the dauer state during early development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Experiments shown in supplemental figure 3 address the precise timing when daf-2 activity is needed to promote non-dauer development. There are three different criteria used to describe the stages in question. The text describes animals as mid-L1. Supplemental figures 1A-B show hours since the onset of feeding. And finally supplemental figure 3C shows the number of germ cells per animal. However, these three criteria are never put in context relative to each other, so it is difficult to understand how they all relate to each other. Under the conditions in the experiments, when does the L1 molt occur in terms of hours post-feeding? How many germ cells are present at different stages of the L1? Is the correlation between germ cell number and developmental stage based on your own observations or previously published work?</p></disp-quote><p>In supplementary Figure 1A-B, DAF-2degron animals were bleached and eggs were synchronized for two days at 20°C in an M9 buffer supplemented with 5 μg/ml cholesterol to yield a highly synchronous L1 population. The synchronized L1 larvae were put on OP50 NGM plates and then switched to plates containing 1 mM auxin at different time points. Dauer and non-dauer animals were counted after two days at 25°C or three days at 20°C.</p><p>Given that this experimental procedure does not give any information on the larval stage at which DAF-2 AID is effective in inducing dauers, we used the same procedure and determined the larval stage by counting the germ cells. Based on the timing of about 24-25 hours, 50% of the population became dauer vs non-dauer; we determined the larval stage at this time point by counting the germ cells. Freshly hatched L1 have 2 germ stem cells (Z2-3) and L2 have on average 16 germ stem cells (PMID: 26395476). However, we counted all visible cells in the gonad, which are 4 for freshly hatched L1 (Z1-4) and 22 for L1/L2 transition (PMID: 10822256). We relied on the characteristic round shapes of germ cells</p><p>(https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/somatic%20gonad/Images/somaticfig3leg.htm). However, we might have included DTC and other cells inside the gonad. Thus, we revised the text to “gonadal cells” and updated the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are several places where the information in figure legends and/or methods is incomplete. Some examples are given below, but in general the authors are encouraged to revisit the legends and methods section and make sure the experiments are clearly described.</p></disp-quote><p>We revisited, updated, and revised figure legends and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Examples of this include:</p><p>A. In some figures when statistical significance is shown as asterisks over a single bar in a graph, it is not clear which samples are being compared.

The text within figures is incredibly tiny.

It would be helpful to have brief explanation of why phenotypes such as egg-retention are called &quot;dauer-associated&quot;, when dauer larvae are too young to have eggs. Reduced motility and stress resistance are examples of phenotypes that are shared by dauers and daf-2 mutant adults, but the reproductive phenotypes seem different.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have replaced “dauer-associated” with “daf-2 class II mutant” for these phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A more minor, but very interesting claim made on line 180 concerns the effect of the environment on DAF-2 levels. Building on the results of Kimura et al., the authors show two different experiments, one in which starvation causes a dramatic reduction in DAF-2 levels (Figure 1F-1G) and a second experiment in which no effect on DAF-2 levels was seen (Figure 1H). They interpret the difference between these experiments to be the different bacterial strains that worms were fed prior to starvation. However, there appears to be many differences between these two experiments. The OP50 experiments were presumably carried out on standard NGM plates, since no additional information was provided. In contrast, the HT1115 experiments mention L4440, which is the empty vector control used for RNAi. This presumably means that worms were exposed to RNAi conditions, including IPTG and ampicillin, as well as the double-stranded RNAi coming from the empty vector. Furthermore, FUDR was mentioned for this experiment but not the OP50 experiment. Therefore, in principle any one of these conditions, or a combination, could have affected DAF-2 levels. If the authors wish to make conclusions about the bacterial strain they should perform an experiment where the bacterial strain is the only difference in experimental conditions. Alternatively, they can adjust their wording to encompass all of the differences between the experiments. In any case, the experimental details for these experiments should be added to the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that for this statement, more research is required to dissect this. Thus, we changed the text accordingly.</p><p>“Curiously, we noted that this starvation-induced degradation of DAF-2 did not happen when, during development, <italic>C. elegans</italic> were fed another bacterial strain, HT1115, used for RNAi (L4440). When DAF-2::degron animals were grown on L4440 and then shifted on empty NGM plates for 24 or 48 hours of starvation, DAF-2 levels did not decrease (Figure 1H). This observation suggests a hypothesis that the nutritional composition of the animal’s diet prior to starvation influences DAF-2 stability, which will be interesting to test in future research. We conclude that food availability controls not only the secretion of insulin-like peptides to regulate DAF-2 activity (Pierce et al., 2001), but also DAF-2 receptor abundance.”</p><p>We updated the method section and added experiment-specific details into the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B, please annotate the timepoints associated with the L1 and L2 molts in their graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in Supplementary Figure 3C, after 24-25 hours of starved L1 refeeding, animals are still in L1. Thus, in Sup. Figure 3A-B, these are all presumably L1 staged animals.</p></body></sub-article></article>
