mechanosensitive ion channel belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) family, converts mechanical stimuli into ionic electric signals that excite neuronal cells (Yan et al., 2013). Previous investigations have demonstrated that a pushing force applied to the linker helix domain or the compression of NOMPC’s ankyrin repeat (AR) domain can trigger channel opening (Wang et al., 2021). In this study, we explored the direct mechanical causes of NOMPC channel opening as well as the torsional properties of the AR domain, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our results indicate that a torque directed toward the extracellular side, exerted on the amphipathic TRP domain, is the primary factor driving channel opening. The coupling between compression and twisting of the AR domain ensures that both types of deformation can induce channel opening. Therefore, we propose a twist-to-open model, facilitated by the compression-twist coupling property of the AR domain, to provide further insight into the gating mechanism of the NOMPC channel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanosensitive</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>computational biophysics</kwd><kwd>TRP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T2321001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rotation of the transient receptor potential (TRP) domain appears to be a universal mechanism for gating of the TRP channel family, including the mechanosensitive ion channel NOMPC.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels are critical components of mechanosensory transduction, playing an essential role in the perception of sensory stimuli in living organisms. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, MS ion channels are widely expressed in peripheral sensory neurons located near or within the surface tissues responsible for detecting mechanical stimuli. Their primary function is to receive and transduce mechanical signals from the external environment, ultimately converting these signals into electrical impulses. This intricate process, known as mechano-electrical transduction (MET), induces changes in neuronal excitability, thereby facilitating the transmission of vital information to higher-order neural centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hehlert et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Among these, NOMPC, a transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily MS channel identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and zebrafish, plays a central role in various mechanosensing-related activities, including soft touch perception, auditory function, and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Effertz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sidi et al., 2003</xref>). A salient characteristic that distinguishes NOMPC from its counterparts is its unique intracellular domain, which comprises 29 ankyrin repeats (ARs) arranged into a distinctive spring-like conformation. This exceptional architecture, proposed to be associated with microtubules within cellular contexts, designates NOMPC as the only known standalone tether-gating MS channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, in contrast to the extensively studied force-from-lipid MS ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kefauver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2020</xref>), a detailed investigation into the specific molecular mechanism of NOMPC gating is poised to provide fundamental insights into the field of tethered MS ion channels.</p><p>In previous studies, it was proposed that compression of the intracellular AR domain, or a pushing force exerted on the AR domain from the intracellular side, could facilitate the opening of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argudo et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, the TRP domain, widely recognized as crucial in the gating process of TRP channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), was observed to tilt up when viewed along the membrane surface and rotate clockwise when viewed from the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). It appears that compression of the AR domain can generate both a membrane-normal pushing force and a membrane-parallel twisting force on the TRP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argudo et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether the pushing force or the twisting torque acting on the TRP domain is the direct mechanical cause of channel gating. In this work, we determine the critical force component for the gating of NOMPC using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results suggest that the twisting force is the key factor in channel gating, while the compression-twist coupling of the AR domain ensures that the compression of the AR domain can also activate the channel.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Membrane-parallel torsion force was observed on the TRP domain during the push-to-open gating process</title><p>For a comprehensive exploration of the atomistic gating details through MD simulations with an affordable computational cost, we employed a divide-and-conquer strategy as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. Essentially, the membrane-protein simulation system was divided into two subsystems. System I was composed of the transmembrane (TM) region, intracellular linker helices (LH) domain, and AR 29.

Four S6 helices of each chain collectively constitute the central pore of NOMPC, and the TRP domain is sandwiched between the TM domain and the LH domain.

In this context, a pushing/compressive force was applied to the AR29, pointing from the intracellular to the extracellular side (trajectories: CI-1/2). Consistent with our previous findings, the TM central pore of NOMPC exhibited a discernible dilation, accompanied by the upward tilt and clockwise rotation of the TRP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The upward tilt was probably caused by the membrane-normal component of the applied mechanical force, while the clockwise rotation was generated by the membrane-parallel component that led to a torque pointing to the extracellular side, raising the question of which of these two components was the direct driving force for the channel opening.</p><p>To address this pivotal question, we quantitatively analyzed the force distribution in the above simulations CI-1/2, so that we could decompose the force into the membrane-normal and membrane-parallel components to investigate which one could open the channel. In particular, we used the force distribution analysis (FDA) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Costescu and Gräter, 2013</xref>) to quantify the interactions between pairwise residues along the force transmission pathway within system I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). According to our simulation condition and trajectory analyses, the force transmission initiated from the AR29 domain, traversed through the LH domain, and then proceeded to influence the geometrically adjacent yet non-covalently bonded TRP domain, ultimately guiding the S6 domain and instigating the pore opening. Our analysis showed that the strongest interactions between these domains were predominantly located between a few pairs of residues at the interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), including A1118-N1148, Y1109-D1142 on the AR29-LH interface, and K1244-E1571, D1236-R1581, L1256-S1577 on the LH-TRP interface. Their proximity in space made their Coulomb and Lennard–Jones interactions stronger upon the conformational changes. This facilitated the stability of hydrogen bonds, particularly those between K1244-E1571, D1236-R1581, and L1256-S1577, with occupancies of 57%, 71%, and 24%, respectively. This finding was consistent with the hydrogen bond pairs identified in previous studies when a pushing force was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To provide a clear depiction of the net mechanical force distribution resulting from the externally applied mechanical force, we subtracted the FDA results of the force-free simulation trajectories (trajectory: FI-1/2) from the simulation trajectories with pushing/compressive force (trajectory: CI-1/2). The residual force distribution was defined as the net-FDA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). By analyzing the net mechanical force distribution between the LH and TRP domains using the net-FDA method, we observed that, in addition to the membrane-normal force component, the total net mechanical force transmitted from the LH domain to the TRP domain also exhibited a membrane-parallel torsion force component. This generated a torque directed toward the extracellular side, perpendicular to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). Moreover, the transmitted force was primarily concentrated on the E1571 and R1581 residues of the TRP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>To determine the role of the TRP helix in gating, we analyzed the force transmission from the TRP domain to the TM region. The FDA results indicated that the TRP domain interacted with four TM segments, including portions of the S1 helix, the S2-S3 linker, the S4-S5 linker, and S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a, c, and d</xref>). The strongest interaction occurred with a segment of the S6 domain that encompasses the constriction site of the TM pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Consequently, the TRP domain appears to exert an outward force on S6, potentially contributing to gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>). Furthermore, the TRP domain interacts strongly with D1360, located on the S2-S3 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>), and with S1421 and F1422, located on the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). The presence of two pairs of hydrogen bonds between D1360 (S2-S3 linker) and K1578 (TRP), as well as S1421 (S4-S5 linker) and W1572 (TRP) was observed in our simulation and has also been reported in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The FDA results at the interface between the TM and intracellular domains elucidated a discernible pathway of force transfer, primarily through several residues located at the AR-LH-TRP interface. In the TRP domain, both membrane-normal and membrane-parallel force components were observed, providing a foundation for further investigation into which component serves as the primary factor in channel gating. As previous studies showed that a clockwise rotation of the TRP domain may be related to channel opening, it was of particular interest to study the effect of the torsion force on the channel structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Membrane-parallel torsion force can open NOMPC, but not the membrane-normal pushing force on the TRP domain</title><p>Motivated by the above net-FDA results, we aimed to separate the contributions of the membrane-normal and membrane-parallel force components to the gating process and pinpoint whether one or both of these components played an indispensable role in gating. To achieve this, we needed to determine the point of application, the magnitude, and the direction of the exerted mechanical force. As the TRP domain is sandwiched between the AR and TM domains and its conformational change was proposed to be directly related to the channel gating, it is a natural choice to select the TRP domain to apply the decomposed forces in the MD simulations.</p><p>Notably, our FDA in the last section showed that the predominant forces propagated from the LH domain to the TRP domain were distributed on two key residues, E1571 and R1581 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). Therefore, we devised simulations to individually apply membrane-normal and membrane-parallel forces on these two residues of the TRP domain, and the magnitude and direction of the exerted forces were equivalent to those derived from the aforementioned net-FDA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a and b</xref>). As the force transmission occurred mainly via side-chain interactions along the interface between the LH and TRP domains, we selected the side chains of the E1571 and R1581 as the point of application of the exerted forces.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A membrane-parallel torsion force can open NOMPC.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) The side view (<bold>a</bold>) and bottom view (<bold>b</bold>) of the net-FDA of the E1571 and R1581 on the TRP domain exerted from the LH domain, which was decomposed into the membrane-parallel and membrane-normal components. <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mo>⨂</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft2">\begin{document}$\bigotimes$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> represents membrane-normal forces pointing into the membrane.

According to the pore size evolution in the trajectories MPI-1/2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), it became evident that the most constricted region along the pore, the gate situated around the hydrophobic I1554, exhibited an initial radius measuring less than 1.0 Å, as calculated by the HOLE program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smart et al., 1996</xref>). This configuration represented a closed architecture. Under the influence of the membrane-parallel torsion force, the radius of the lower constriction was significantly dilated to above 2.0 Å after 600 ns. This dilation meant that water molecules could smoothly pass through the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), a phenomenon often indicative of the first step of channel opening. This is highly similar to our previous observation when a pushing force was applied to the AR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, in the trajectories MN-1/2/3 with the membrane-normal force on the TRP domain, no pore dilation was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) within our simulation time. In fact, the channel appeared to become even more constricted at the upper constriction region (filter), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>. This indicated that the membrane-normal force component on the TRP domain was probably not able to open the channel, at least no such sign was observed within our simulation time.</p><p>It should be noted that, according to our analysis, the membrane-normal pushing forces exerted on residues 1571 and 1581 are approximately one-third and two-thirds of the membrane-parallel twisting force, respectively. This observation indicates that the twisting component is inherently stronger than the pushing component when a compressive force is applied to the AR domain. To examine the impact of the two force components when they are of equal magnitudes, we conducted additional simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, see ‘Methods’). To ensure the stability of the protein and membrane structure, we opted to reduce the membrane-parallel force rather than increase the membrane-normal force. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, halving the membrane-parallel force resulted in channel opening in two out of three trajectories, while reducing it to one-third resulted in channel opening in one out of three trajectories. These results suggest that, when force components of equal magnitude are applied to the key residues on the TRP domain, the membrane-parallel (twisting) force is more effective in promoting channel opening than the membrane-normal (pushing) force.</p><p>Thus, our investigations substantiated that a torque on the TRP domain, pointing to the extracellular side, was the key to driving the channel open. On the basis of the original push-to-open or compress-to-open model, here we provide further details on the force analysis and channel opening, arguing that it is the membrane-parallel torsion force that acts as the direct mechanical cause to open the channel. It should be noted, though, this does not mean the push-to-open or compress-to-open model was wrong, as our simulations showed that a pushing force on the LH domain can generate a torsion force on the TRP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), so does the compression of the AR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Argudo et al., 2019</xref>). Apparently, the unique structure of NOMPC ensures that a straightforward pushing force or compression of the AR spring can spontaneously generate a torsion force to open the channel.

Building upon the push-to-open and compress-to-open mechanism, here we propose a twist-to-open model, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. At the core of this model was the idea that a twisting force on the TRP domain is the key to the opening of the pore. This is not to say the compress-to-open or push-to-open models are wrong, but that a compression/pushing on the AR domain will lead to a twist force on the TRP domain, and this twist force is the direct cause of the pore opening. The spiral structure of each AR chain, as well as the hydrogen bonding network formed among spatially adjacent residues, enables the AR bundle to convert the compression deformation to a twist deformation, thus exerting a membrane-parallel torsional force on the LH domain. In addition, the structure around the LH domain can also convert a membrane-normal pushing force to a membrane-parallel torsional force, as shown in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, the compression of the AR domain, or a pushing force from the intracellular side, can be converted to a torque on the TRP domain, which points to the extracellular side. We believe that this torque is the direct mechanical cause that drives the TRP domain to rotate clockwise (looking from the intracellular side) to open the channel.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A schematic diagram of the twist-to-open model.</title><p>The side view (left) and bottom view (right) of the twist-to-open model.

We investigated the likely conformational changes of multiple channels within the TRP family upon opening and found that the rotation of the TRP domain is a universal conformational change, whereas the tilt of the TRP domain is considerably less consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Based on these findings, we believe that the rotation of the TRP domain may be a common feature in the gating mechanism of these TRP channels, and the unique structure and compression-twist coupling property of the intracellular domain of NOMPC ensure its robustness in the perception of multiple forms of mechanical stimuli: not only twist, but also compression, can result in the clockwise rotation of the TRP domain, thereby facilitating channel opening.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes of the TRP domain in various TRP channels with resolved closed- and open-state cryo-EM structures.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The membrane-parallel rotational angle of the TRP helix (a positive value indicates clockwise rotation when viewed from the intracellular side).

As initially suggested in the MS channel MscL, researchers have identified that the amphipathic N-terminus of MscL provides a structural framework for bilayer-mediated gating of MS channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bavi et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequent studies have further demonstrated that many MS channels share a common structural feature: amphipathic helices that are directly or indirectly connected to pore-lining regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kefauver et al., 2020</xref>). These amphipathic helices interact with surrounding lipids and transmit membrane tension, which is consistent with the force-from-lipid gating mechanism. Although the present study primarily focuses on the force-from-tether model, it appears that the amphipathic TRP helix, which is connected to the pore-lining S6, is also crucial to the gating of NOMPC. The observed interaction between the TRP domain and the S4–S5 linker suggests that these two structural elements may function together as a composite amphipathic unit, potentially playing a significant role in perceiving and propagating gating signals. In addition, the TRP helix and the S4-S5 linker form the binding site for ligand-gated TRP channels, such as TRPV1. Therefore, we propose that the combined TRP-S4-S5 unit may constitute a key structural element responsible for multimodal gating mechanisms within the TRP channel family.</p><p>Mammalian TRPs possess shorter ARs than NOMPC, raising the question of whether they can also convey force in a manner similar to NOMPC. As an initial exploration, we selected the full-length squirrel TRPV1 (PDB: 7LQY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nadezhdin et al., 2021a</xref>) and applied pushing or torsional forces to the intracellular end of TRPV1, separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rotation of the TRP domain was observed under both types of mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The torsional force-induced conformational change in the TRP domain resembles that observed in NOMPC. This suggests that a torsional force applied to the shorter ARs of mammalian TRPs may generate similar effects on channel gating. However, since these ARs are not tethered, the implications of these results in the context of biological functions remain unclear.</p><p>Although we calculated the detailed interactions between residue pairs of NOMPC, it should be noted that, due to the limitations of the FDA method, our force analysis lacked the entropic force, which may also play a significant role in the force transmission along the AR spring. Nonetheless, this won’t affect our twist-to-open model, since the entropic effect was present in our MD simulations. Another limitation of the present study is that the simulation time is very short compared to the physiological time scale, so we only observed a partially open state of the structure in our simulations and cannot exclude the possibility that other factors, such as the membrane-normal force component, may also assist in the gating process. However, we found that the mechanical stimuli are transferred at a fast speed along AR springs in simulations, at around 1.8 nmps <sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the mechanical stimuli were nearly instant for our simulation time, which allowed us to determine the trend or the direction of the conformational changes, even though the observation of the complete gating process is still challenging. In this context, we think that the dilation of the pore under a torsion force on the TRP domain is a piece of strong evidence that twist is the key to the channel opening.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>PDB ID of resolved cryo-EM structures used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Protein</th><th align="left" valign="top">State description</th><th align="left" valign="top">PDB ID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">RnTRPV1</td><td align="left" valign="top">apo→open (+RTX/DkTx)</td><td align="left" valign="top">5IRZ, 7L2L, 5IRX;

The other parameters for enforced rotation were kept consistent with those used in the previous two steps. Specifically, we used the trajectory RII-1/2/3/4 to calculate the torsional mechanical properties of the AR bundle and the trajectory RII-0 to study the force transmission pathway along the AR chain.

We adopted the same first step as in trajectory RII. The rotational speed in the second step was doubled to 0.1° ns<sup>−1</sup>, resulting in a total twist of 10° within 100 ns. The holding time in the third step was adjusted to 100 ns. This accelerated simulation trajectory is referred to as RII-fast (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).

The concept is interesting - as the only clearly defined example of an ion channel that opens due to forces on a tethered domain, the mechanism by which this occur are yet to be fully elucidated. The main finding is that twisting of the transmembrane portion of the protein - specifically via the TRP domain that is conserved within the broad family of channels- is required to open the pore. That this could be a common mechanism utilised by a wide range of channels in the family, not just mechanically gated ones, makes the result significant. It is intriguing to consider how different activating stimuli can produce a similar activating motion within this family. While the authors do not see full opening of the channel, only an initial dilation, this motion is consistent with partial opening of structurally characterized members of this family.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Demonstrating that rotation of the TRP domain is the essential requirement for channel opening would have significant implcaitions for other members of this channel family.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript centres around 3 main computational experiments. In the first, a compression force is applied on a truncated intracellular domain and it is shown that this creates both a membrane normal (compression) and membrane parallel (twisting) force on the TRP domain. This is a point that was demonstrated in the authors prior eLife paper - so the point here is to quantify these forces for the second experiment.</p><p>The second experiment is the most important in the manuscript.

The concept is interesting - as the only clearly defined example of an ion channel that opens due to forces on a tethered domain, the mechanism by which this occurs is yet to be fully elucidated. The main finding is that twisting of the transmembrane portion of the protein - specifically via the TRP domain that is conserved within the broad family of channels- is required to open the pore. That this could be a common mechanism utilised by a wide range of channels in the family, not just mechanically gated ones, makes the result significant. It is intriguing to consider how different activating stimuli can produce a similar activating motion within this family. However, the support for the finding can be strengthened as the authors cannot yet exclude that other forces could open the channel if given longer or at different magnitudes. In addition, they do not see the full opening of the channel, only an initial dilation. Even if we accept that twist is essential for this, it may be that it is not sufficient for full opening, and other stimuli are required.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Demonstrating that rotation of the TRP domain is the essential requirement for channel opening would have significant implications for other members of this channel family.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive summary and comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript centres around 3 main computational experiments. In the first, a compression force is applied on a truncated intracellular domain and it is shown that this creates both a membrane normal (compression) and membrane parallel (twisting) force on the TRP domain. This is a point that was demonstrated in the authors’ prior eLife paper - so the point here is to quantify these forces for the second experiment.</p><p>The second experiment is the most important in the manuscript. In this, forces are applied directly to two residues on the TRP domain with either a membrane normal (compression) or membrane parallel (twisting) direction, with the magnitude and directions chosen to match that found in the first experiment. Only the twisting force is seen to widen the pore in the triplicate simulations, suggesting that twisting, but not compression can open the pore. This result is intriguing and there appears to be a significant difference between the dilation of pore with the two force directions.</p><p>However, there are two caveats to this conclusion. Firstly, is the magnitude of the forces - the twist force is larger than the applied normal force to match the result of experiment 1. However, it is possible that compression could also open the pore at the same magnitude or if given longer. It may be that twist acts faster or more easily, but I feel it is not yet possible to say it is the key and exclude the possibility that compression could do something similar.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comment. As you pointed out, the membranenormal pushing forces exerted at residues E1571 and R1581 are approximately onethird and two-thirds, respectively, of the membrane-parallel twisting forces. These magnitudes were derived from a previous simulation (Wang et al., 2021), in which we decomposed the resultant force into its membrane-parallel and membrane-normal components upon applying a compressive force to the intracellular AR end. Our results indicated that, upon reaching the TRP helix, the induced twisting force is indeed greater, which partially reflects actual physiological conditions. Therefore, considering the magnitudes of the resultant forces alone, the twisting force is predominantly greater than the pushing force when the AR domain is subjected to compression.</p><p>Then the question became, if forces of the same magnitude are applied in either the membrane-normal or membrane-parallel directions, what would the outcome be? To address this, we conducted additional simulations. Considering the situations discussed above, we applied a smaller membrane-parallel force instead of a larger membranenormal force that may disrupt the integrity of protein and membrane structure. As shown in the Figure 2-figure supplement 2, we adjusted the applied membrane-parallel force to either half or one-third of the original value. When we applied half of the force used in the original setup, the channel opened in two out of three trajectories. When applying onethird of the force, the channel opened in one out of three trajectories. Together with our previous results, these findings suggest that if forces of equal magnitude are applied in the membrane-normal and membrane-parallel directions, the membrane-parallel force has a higher probability of inducing channel opening.</p><p>Still, one cannot completely exclude the possibility that the pushing force on the TRP helix can open the channel if given a very long time. This becomes unfeasible to examine with MD simulations, so we investigated the likely conformational changes of multiple TRP family proteins upon opening, and found that the TRP rotation is a universal conformational change, while the TRP tilt is much less consistent (Figure 6). These findings gives us more confidence that the twist force plays a more crucial role in channel gating than the pushing force. We have added a new table (Table 1) and a new figure (Figure 6) to present this analysis.</p><p>In addition, we did not intend to imply that compression is incapable of contributing to channel opening. In fact, our aim was to highlight that compression can generate both a twisting force and a pushing force, with the twisting force appearing to be the more critical component for facilitating channel opening. We concur that we cannot completely dismiss the possibility that the pushing component may also assist in channel opening. Consequently, we have revised our discussion to enhance clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also note that when force was applied to the AR domain in experiment 1, the pore widened more quickly than with the twisting force alone, suggesting that compression is doing something to assist with opening.</p></disp-quote><p>You are correct that the trajectory corresponding to Experiment 1 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1(b)) indicates pore opening around 300-400 ns, while the trajectory for Experiment 2 (800 ns) shows pore opening around 600 ns. This observation may suggest that the pore opens more rapidly in Experiment 1, assuming that the simulation conditions were identical for both experiments. However, it is important to note that in Experiment 1, an external force was applied to AR29. In contrast, in Experiment 2, the force was applied exclusively to two selected residues on the TRP domain, while other TRP residues also experienced mechanical forces, albeit to a lesser extent. The differing methods of force application in the two experiments complicate the comparison of pore opening speeds under these conditions.</p><p>We acknowledge that the compression of the AR spring can facilitate pore opening. This compression generates both a twisting component and a pushing component on the TRP domain. Our simulations and structural analyses of multiple TRP channels suggest that the twisting component plays a predominant role in gating. However, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the pushing component may also contribute to this process. We have carefully revised our Result, Discussion and Methods sections to enhance clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the forces are likely to be smaller in physiological conditions it could still be critical to have both twist and compression present. As this is the central aspect of the study, I believe that examining how the channel responds to different force magnitudes could strengthen the conclusions and recommend additional simulations be done to examine this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We agree that the force applied in Experiment 2 is possible to be larger than the physiological conditions. Therefore, we performed additional simulations to investigate the possibility of opening the pore using smaller torsional forces.</p><p>As shown in the new Figure 2-figure supplement 1, we applied half and one-third of the original force and performed three replicate simulations for each condition. With half the force, the pore opened in two out of the three simulations. And with one-third of the applied force, the pore opened in one out of the three replicate simulations. The probability of pore opening within the same simulation time decreased as the applied force was reduced, consistent with our expectations. These new results are provided as supplementary figures in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We anticipate that further reductions in the forces will result in additional delays in the opening process; however, this would lead to prohibitive computational costs. Consequently, we have decided to conclude our analysis at this stage and have discussed this matter of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second important consideration is that the study never sees a full pore opening, but rather a widening that is less than that seen in open state structures of other TRP channels and insufficient for rapid ion currents. This is something the authors acknowledge in their prior manuscript in eLife 2021. Although this may simply be due to the limited timescale of the simulations, it needs to be clearly stated as a caveat to the conclusions. Twist may be the key to getting this dilation, but we do not know if it is the key to full pore opening. To demonstrate that the observed dilation is a first step in the opening of pores, a structural comparison to open-state TRP channels would be beneficial in providing evidence that this motion is along the expected pathway of channel gating.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this insightful comment. We acknowledge that our simulations do not capture a fully open state, but rather a dilation that is smaller than the open-state structures of other TRP channels. In our simulations, a pore radius exceeding 2 Å is considered as a partially open state, as this is generally sufficient for the permeation of water molecules or even small cations such as K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> However, the passage of larger molecules and ions, such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and clusters of hydrated ions, remains challenging. As you noted, this partial opening may be attributed to the limited timescale of the simulations.</p><p>Furthermore, in accordance with your suggestion, we analyzed numerous TRP proteins for which multiple open or intermediate states have been resolved, and we have included a new figure (Figure 6). A clockwise rotation of the TRP domain is observed in the majority of these proteins upon gating. For instance, in the case of RnTRPV1, our analysis revealed that during TRPV1 activation, when different ligands are bound (RTX, DkTX), the pore undergoes gradual dilation, which involves a progressive clockwise rotation of the TRP domain. This analysis provides evidence that the observed motion aligns with expected gating transitions, supporting the notion that twist-induced TRP rotation and pore dilation may represent an initial step in the pore opening process.</p><p>Nonetheless, we concur that further studies, including extended simulations, which are currently unfeasible, or experimental validation, will be necessary to ascertain whether our proposed mechanism is adequate for the complete opening of the pore. We have carefully discussed this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experiment three considers the intracellular domain and determines the link between compression and twisting of the intracellular AR domain. In this case, the end of the domain is twisted and it is shown that the domain compresses, the converse to the similar study previously done by the authors in which compression of the domain was shown to generate torque. While some additional analysis is provided on the inter-residue links that help generate this, this is less significant than the critical second experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Although experiment three is less significant in revealing the underlying gating mechanism, it provides quantitative measurements of the mechanical properties of the intriguing AR spring structure, which are currently challenging to obtain experimentally.

We appreciate your recognition of our key finding that torque is responsible for increasing the inner pore radius. Indeed, our simulations illustrated in Figure 2 systematically explore the effects of different forces on pore opening. These results demonstrate that membrane-parallel forces are effective, while membrane-normal forces are not within the simulation time. We acknowledge that this study builds upon previous findings regarding force-induced channel opening. However, we believe that further decomposition of the specific forces and motions responsible for this process provides valuable mechanistic insights. By distinguishing the role of torque from the membrane-normal forces of the TRP helix, which is highly conserved across the TRP channel family, our work contributes to a more precise understanding of TRP channel gating. Moreover, in the revised manuscript, we conducted a systematic analysis of the structures of TRP family proteins and discovered that the clockwise rotation of the TRP domain is likely a universal gating mechanism among the TRP family, which significantly enhances and strengthens our original findings (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Duan and Song interrogates the gating mechanisms and specifically force transmission in mechanosensitive NOMPC channels using steered molecular dynamics simulations.

In the original structural studies, the coordination of lipids in this region seems important for gating. In this manner does the TRP domain and S4-S5 linker combined act like an amphipathic helix as suggested first for MscL (Bavi et al., 2016 Nature Communications) and later identified in many MS channels (Kefauver et al., 2020 Nature).</p></disp-quote><p>In our analysis of the compression trajectories (trajectory: CI-1, Figure 1-figure supplement 4), we identified stable interactions between the TRP domain and the S4-S5 linker. These interactions primarily involve the residues S1421 and F1422 of the S4-S5 linker, as indicated by the large pink data points in Figure 1-figure supplement 4. Therefore, we agree that the TRP helix and the S4–S5 linker can be considered an amphipathic helical unit, analogous to the amphipathic helix observed in MscL and other mechanosensitive channels. Moreover, the pocket adjacent to the S4-S5 linker has been recognized as a binding site for small molecules in other ligand-activated TRP channels, such as the vanilloid-binding TRPV1. We hypothesize that this unit is likely to play a critical role in the polymodal gating of the TRP channel family, including ligand-induced activation. In the revised manuscript, we have included an analysis of the interaction between the TRP domain and the transmembrane (TM) domain, and we have briefly discussed its implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Torsional forces on shorter ankyrin repeats of mammalian TRP channels</p><p>Is it possible torsional forces applied to the shorter ankyrin repeats of mammalian TRPs may also convey force in a similar manner?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an intriguing question.</p><p>To answer your question, we studied the full-length squirrel TRPV1 (PDB: 7LQY, Nadezhdin et al. (2021)) using all-atom steered MD simulations. We applied pushing or torsional forces to the intracellular AR1-2 region of TRPV1, separately (Figure 6-figure supplement 1(a)). Similar to NOMPC, rotation of the TRP domain was observed under both types of mechanical stimulation (Figure 6-figure supplement 1(b-e)). The conformational change induced by the torsional force on the TRP domain resembles the change observed in NOMPC. This suggests that a torsional force applied to the shorter ankyrin repeats of mammalian TRPs may yield similar effects on channel gating. However, given that these ankyrin repeats do not act like tether elements, the implications of these results in the context of biological functions remain unclear. Additionally, in NOMPC, the AR domain is connected to the TRP domain through a linker helix (LH) domain, composed of multiple stacked helices that form a relatively compact structure (Figure 1(a)). In contrast, TRPV1 does not possess a similarly compact LH domain connecting the AR domain to the TRP domain (Figure 6-figure supplement 1(a)). These structural differences render our conclusions regarding NOMPC not directly applicable to TRPV1. We have included an additional discussion about this (Figure 6-figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Constant velocity or constant force</p><p>For the SMD the authors write &quot;and a constant velocity or constant force&quot;.

For example, what is meant by ion channels ’coalescing to form mechanical receptors’? Are the authors implying it requires multiple channels to form a receptor? It is stated that mechanically gated ion channels are only found in nerve endings when in fact they are found in almost every cell type. Another example is the statement ’In the meantime’ the TRP domain was observed to rotate when this observation came prior to the others mentioned before. While these sound like minor edits, they significantly change the meaning of the introduction. I recommend careful editing of the manuscript to avoid accidental inaccuracies like this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback on the clarity and accuracy of the introduction.

JGP (2019)? I wonder what value the authors would get with a new replicate run slower - say 200 ns total aggregate simulation? This would probe the convergence of this energy value. It seems important to determine whether the loading velocity of the experiments performed here with the steered MD is slow enough to allow the protein to relax and adopt lower energy configurations during the transition. The true loading is likely to occur on the millisecond timescale, not the nanosecond to low microsecond timescale. That said, I don’t mean to detract from the result in Figure 2, as this is likely quite solid in my opinion given the nearly 1 microsecond simulations and the replicates showing the same results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. It is important to note that we calculated different physical quantities compared to those reported in Argudo’s study. In Figure 3b, we calculated the torque (instead of the energy, although they share the same dimensional units) of the long AR bundle (AR9-29 of the four filaments combined) and subsequently determined its torsion coefficient. Argudo’s study calculated the torsional spring constant (𝑘<sub>ɵ</sub>) of three 6-AR-unit stretches of one filament, which were designated as ANK1 (AR 12-17), ANK2 (AR 17-22) and ANK3 (AR 22–27). As the four filaments are coupled within the bundled structure and the torsional axes differ between an individual filament and the four-filament bundle, a direct comparison of the torsional spring constants reported in the two studies is not meaningful.</p><p>We agree that extending the simulation time may provide deeper insights into the convergence of energy values. In accordance with your suggestion, we conducted additional simulations to further investigate convergence and compare the results with our existing data, thereby ensuring robustness and consistency. Specifically, we slowed down the original operation of twisting from 10 degrees over 100 ns to 10 degrees over 200 ns, and extended the holding time for selected frames (sampled every 2.5 degrees) from 100 ns to 200 ns. We have updated Figure 3 and relevant main text accordingly. The results of the new simulations are similar to those of the previous ones, with the fitted torsion coefficient revised from (2.31 ± 0.44) × 10<sup>3</sup>kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> ra<sup>−1</sup> 1 to (2.30 ± 0.31) × 10<sup>3</sup> kJmol<sup>−1</sup> rad<sup>−1</sup> This close agreement indicates that our simulations are well-converged.

For simulations involving the application of membrane-normal or membrane-parallel force on the TRP domain, we utilized DSSP (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins) analysis to assess the stability of the secondary structure of the TRP domain. The results indicated that, during the application of external forces, the secondary structure of the TRP domain maintained good stability, as illustrated in Figure 2-figure supplement 3. For simulations involving the rotation of the AR domain, we also analyzed the DSSP of the AR9 to AR11 units, which are positioned directly above the AR8 domain where the twisting force is applied. The secondary structure of the AR domain also exhibited good stability (Figure 4-figure supplement 2). These are briefly discussed in the Methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me that the force transmission analysis in Figure 4 provides much insight into the mechanics of opening.
