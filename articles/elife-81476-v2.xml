type 1 (SA-1) first-order neurons in the human tactile system have distal axons that branch in the skin and form many transduction sites, yielding receptive fields with many highly sensitive zones or ‘subfields.’ We previously demonstrated that this arrangement allows FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to signal the geometric features of touched objects, specifically the orientation of raised edges scanned with the fingertips. Here, we show that such signaling operates for fine edge orientation differences (5–20°) and is stable across a broad range of scanning speeds (15–180 mm/s); that is, under conditions relevant for real-world hand use. We found that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons weakly signal fine edge orientation differences via the intensity of their spiking responses and only when considering a single scanning speed. Both neuron types showed much stronger edge orientation signaling in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains, and FA-1 neurons performed better than SA-1 neurons. Represented in the spatial domain, the sequential structure was strikingly invariant across scanning speeds, especially those naturally used in tactile spatial discrimination tasks. This speed invariance suggests that neurons’ responses are structured via sequential stimulation of their subfields and thus links this capacity to their terminal organization in the skin. Indeed, the spatial precision of elicited action potentials rationally matched spatial acuity of subfield arrangements, which corresponds to a spatial period similar to the dimensions of individual fingertip ridges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>touch</kwd><kwd>microneurography</kwd><kwd>tacile processing</kwd><kwd>peripheral nervous system</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pruszynski</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Foundation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pruszynski</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier 2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pruszynski</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005622</institution-id><institution>Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pruszynski</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual human first-order tactile neurons, those that innervate the mechanoreceptors in the skin, can signal information about edge orientation differences at the limit of what people can feel and across a broad range of speeds relevant for real-world hand use.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The distal axons of fast-adapting type 1 (FA-1) and slow-adapting type 1 (SA-1) neurons innervating the glabrous skin of the primate hand branch extensively in the skin, causing each individual neuron to innervate many spatially segregated low-threshold mechanoreceptive end organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cauna, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cauna, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nolano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paré et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>). This arrangement results in spatially complex receptive fields with many highly sensitive zones (or ‘subfields’) distributed within a circular or elliptical area typically covering 5–10 fingerprint ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>). We have proposed that this arrangement constitutes a peripheral neural mechanism for geometric feature extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hay and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we previously demonstrated that both FA-1 and SA-1 neurons signal information about the orientation of edges moving across a neuron’s receptive field via changes in both their spiking intensity and the sequential structure of their spiking response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>). The intensity of a neuron’s response can be modulated by the degree of spatial coincidence between the neuron’s subfields and local skin deformation caused by the edge. The sequential structure of a neuron’s response (i.e. the gaps between bursts of spikes) can carry information about edge orientation because the orientation affects the sequence and timing of stimulated subfields as the edge passes over the neuron’s receptive field.</p><p>Here, we examine this peripheral signaling mechanism with respect to the ability of individual FA-1 and SA-1 neurons to signal fine differences in the orientation of edges (5–20°) moving across the fingertip and how stimulation speed affects this ability. In our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>), we used edges that had large orientation differences (≥22.5°) compared to edge orientation discrimination thresholds found during object manipulation (~3°; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>) or psychophysical tasks (~10–25°; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bensmaia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lechelt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peters et al., 2015</xref>), and we focused mainly on one movement speed (30 mm/s). However, during natural contacts with objects where the use of tactile information is critical, a wide range of speeds can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole and Abbs, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johansson and Westling, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vega-Bermudez et al., 1991</xref>). This natural variation motivated us to analyze the capacity of individual neurons to signal edge orientation at different fixed speeds but also their ability to signal edge orientation across scanning speeds (i.e. in a speed-invariant manner). Examining speed invariance also allowed us to test the hypothesis that the subfield arrangement of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons gives rise to their ability to signal fine edge orientation via changes in the sequential structure of their spiking responses. Because the layout of a neuron’s subfield arrangement is fairly stable over a range of natural scanning speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>), the hypothesis predicts speed invariant signaling of edge orientation when spike trains are represented in the spatial domain, where the action potentials are represented with respect to the position of the stimulus on the skin at the time of their occurrence.</p><p>We recorded action potentials in the distal axon of single FA-1 and SA-1 neurons innervating human fingertips while tangentially scanning their receptive field with finely oriented edges (±5 and ±10° relative to the scanning direction) at speeds spanning more than one order of magnitude (15–180 mm/s). We report that FA-1 and SA-1 neurons can signal fine edge orientation differences via changes in spiking intensity (peak and mean firing rate) but that they do so much more reliably by changes in the sequential structure of the evoked spike trains. In the latter case, FA-1 neurons perform better than SA-1 neurons, but both show the best edge orientation discrimination capacity for scanning speeds that humans naturally use when moving their hands to discriminate fine spatial features. Furthermore, when spike trains are represented in the spatial domain, their orientation-dependent sequential structuring is preserved across a wide range of scanning speeds, meaning that FA-1 and SA-1 neurons can provide speed invariant information about edge orientation. Taken together, these findings further the idea that the dendritic-like branching of first-order tactile neurons’ distal axons contributes to early processing of fine geometric features in the tactile sensory ascending pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study participants and data sample</title><p>Human participants (five males and eight females) provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

The instantaneous rotational position of the drum was monitored via an optical shaft encoder (AC36, Hengstler GmbH), which provided position resolution of 3 µm in the scanning direction.</p><p>Raised lines oriented –10, –5, 5, and 10° relative to the axis perpendicular to the direction of motion were presented five times on the stimulus pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These orientations were chosen to efficiently pack the stimuli onto the stimulating surface and to permit pairwise comparison of lines with angular differences of 5 (between +5 and +10° line stimuli; between –5 and –10° line stimuli), 10 (between –5 and +5° line stimuli), 15 (between –5 and +10° line stimuli; between +5 and –10° line stimuli), and 20° (between –10 and +10° line stimuli). The lines, extending across the width of the stimulus surface (12 mm), were 0.5 mm high, and their widths were 0.5 mm at the top and 0.8 mm at the base. All lines were spaced at least 8 mm apart to minimize interactions between neighboring lines on a neuron’s response.</p><p>All neurons were scanned at eight tangential speeds: 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mm/s presented in random order. A subset of neurons was scanned at up to four additional speeds: 2.5, 5, 10, and 270 mm/s. When the 270 mm/s speed was presented, it was randomly interleaved with the main eight speed conditions. When the three slowest speeds were presented, they were always done after all other speed conditions and in a set order, from fastest to slowest (i.e. 10 mm/s, 5 mm/s, and then 2.5 mm/s). These very slow speeds take a long time to complete so presenting them at the end minimized the risk of losing isolation of the current neuron during the eight main speeds and thereby creating partial datasets. All the analyses presented here focus on the main speed conditions since these were available for all neurons. Note that the same general trends hold for the additional speeds and that the raw data for all speed conditions is provided alongside this manuscript. For each neuron and speed, the drum rotated three times, resulting in 15 trials for each line stimulus and recorded speed condition (5 presentations of stimuli per drum rotation x 3 drum rotations = 15 trials).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Sampling</title><p>The nerve signal, the instantaneous position of the stimulus surface, and the contact force were digitally sampled at 19.2 kHz, 2.4 kHz, and 0.6 kHz, respectively (SC/ZOOM, Department of Integrative Medical Biology, Umeå University).</p><p>To quantify the intensity of a neuron’s response, we used peak and mean firing rate.

For the intensity measures, we quantified how frequently the peak or mean firing rate evoked by each presentation of a particular line orientation at one speed was closer to the average response of the trials with the same line orientation for another speed (i.e. correctly classified) as opposed to trials with the other line orientations (i.e. incorrectly classified). For firing rate profiles, we quantified how often a neuron’s firing rate profile for a given orientation and speed was best correlated with profiles evoked by stimuli with the same orientation but at different speeds (i.e. correctly classified) as opposed to profiles evoked with the other line orientations also at different speeds (i.e. incorrectly classified). These analyses were performed with firing rate profiles conventionally represented in the temporal domain but also represented in the spatial domain where the positions of the underlying action potential are referenced to the position of the stimulus surface relative to the skin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Precision of spiking responses</title><p>The hypothesis that subfield arrangement structures neurons’ spiking activity when edges pass over their receptive fields motivated us to estimate the spatial precision of generated action potentials with reference to neurons’ signaling of fine edge orientation differences. For this purpose, we used a correlation-based measure of similarity between pairs of individual spike trains after imposing various amounts of noise on the position of the recorded action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fellous et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schreiber et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we convolved each spike train with Gaussians of different kernels with roughly logarithmically spaced SDs in the range of 5–1280 µm, which corresponds to increasingly blurring a neuron’s receptive field sensitivity topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>). For each neuron and kernel width, we then pairwise correlated all smoothed spike trains and determined the spatial precision of action potentials by calculating which kernel width yielded the largest average difference in correlations with the same orientations at other speeds and with different orientations at different speeds (termed ‘best kernel’). This analysis thus only considered correlations between speed conditions since our hypothesis predicts speed-invariant edge orientation signaling when spike trains are represented in the spatial domain.</p><p>For spike trains convolved with the best kernel averaged across speeds for the FA-1 and SA-1 neurons, respectively, we also quantified for each neuron type the proportion of correctly classified orientations across scanning speeds analogous to the analysis of speed-invariant orientation signaling with firing rate profiles (chance performance = 0.25). Finally, based on pairwise comparisons between the available stimuli, we quantified the proportion of correctly classified orientations as a function of angular difference (chance = 0.5). Given our dataset, the available angular differences were 5 (between –5 and –10° line stimuli and between +5 and +10° line stimuli), 10 (–5 and +5°), 15 (–10 and +5°; –5 and +10°), and 20° (–10 and +10°).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>We carried out all statistical analysis in R Studio (V1.2.5) and SPSS (V29).

In all cases, kernel width data was log-transformed, and discrimination probability data was arcsine square root transformed where needed. For ANOVAs evaluating discrimination probability, we subtracted chance from the data such that a significant intercept in the ANOVA model meant that overall performance was above chance. These analyses included scanning speed (and sometimes orientation difference) as a within-group (repeated measures) factor and neuron type as a between-group factor.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We examined the capacity of individual FA-1 and SA-1 neurons innervating human fingertips to signal fine orientation differences of edges moving across their receptive field as a function of scanning speed as well as their ability to signal fine orientation differences in a speed-invariant manner. We did so with respect to different aspects of their spiking responses. These included traditional intensity measures (i.e. peak and mean firing rate) as well as spatiotemporal measures based on the sequential structure of the spike trains. For the sequential structure, our emphasis was on its representation in the spatial domain where each action potential is referenced to the position of the edge stimulus on the skin when it occurred as this relates to the spatial structuring of the neuron’s receptive field in the form of subfields.</p><p>We recorded action potentials from 30 FA-1 and 23 SA-1 isolated neurons when stimulated by repeatedly sweeping raised lines across their receptive field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The lines were oriented ±5 and ±10° relative to their direction of motion. All neurons were stimulated at eight speeds from 15 to 180 mm/s. Each edge orientation was presented 15 times per speed.

In this scenario, the best-case outcome is that across-speed discrimination performance is equivalent to within-speed discrimination performance for a given speed condition. As expected, given how strongly intensity measures (i.e. peak and mean firing rates) are affected by the scanning speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), these measures failed to provide any reliable information about edge orientation at other scanning speeds (intercept of two-way ANOVA referenced to chance performance; peak firing rate: F<sub>1,51</sub> = 0.09, p=0.77, ηp<sup>2</sup>=0.002; mean firing rate: F<sub>1,51</sub> = 0.07, p=0.72, ηp<sup>2</sup>=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).

Moreover, the sequential structure allows speed-invariant signaling of fine edge orientation differences across a wide range of scanning speeds when represented in the spatial domain, when action potentials are referenced to the position of the edge stimulus on the skin. In contrast, response intensity from an individual neuron appears informative only when it is stimulated with a uniform scanning speed.</p><p>Our findings reveal that single human first-order tactile neurons signal edge orientation most reliably at slow to moderate speeds, corresponding to those used when actively performing tactile spatial discrimination tasks with the fingertips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vega-Bermudez et al., 1991</xref>). Our findings also reveal that edge orientation signaling decreases for stimulation speeds exceeding ~45 mm/s, corresponding to the speeds at which spatial discrimination capacity decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bensmaia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vega-Bermudez et al., 1991</xref>). We speculate that the choice of speeds in active tasks and changes in discrimination capacity as a function of speed in passive tasks are associated with the ability of first-order tactile neurons to produce the relevant information. Edge orientation sensitivity at natural speeds was strikingly high, with neurons routinely showing speed-invariant orientation signaling for differences as small as 5°, which is substantially better than what humans can consciously report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bensmaia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lechelt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peters et al., 2015</xref>) but on a par with what people exhibit in object manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The edge orientation sensitivity we report might underestimate the spatial sensitivity of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons. First, many first-order tactile neurons could reliably discriminate even our most finely spaced edge orientations. Second, our analysis ignored the viscoelastic and anisotropic properties of the fingertip, and thus possible complex time-varying deformations of the fingertip skin as a surface slide over it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delhaye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>). Varying amounts of compression, stretching, and shearing of the skin within a neuron’s receptive field may therefore have occurred during the repeated scans both within and across speeds and between edges with different orientations. Such events would have erroneously increased our estimate of the spatial jitter of action potentials across the repetitions of a given stimulus and thus erroneously reduced our estimate of edge orientation information in the spike trains.</p><p>For stimuli with larger orientation differences (≥22.5°), we previously showed that a neuron’s sensitivity to edge orientation was linked to the layout of subfields in its receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>). That is, we could predict the structure of the generated spike trains (in terms of the presence of spikes and the lengths of gaps between spike bursts) as a function of edge orientation based on how the neuron’s subfields were sequentially stimulated. In the present study, we could not directly relate a neuron’s edge orientation signaling to the sensitivity topography of the receptive field because we did not collect receptive field maps. Nevertheless, two pieces of evidence suggest that the mechanism is the same. First, that a neuron exhibits speed invariance in signaling fine edge orientation differences especially at natural scanning speeds is consistent with its responses being structured by its subfield layout, which for FA-1 and SA-1 neurons, is rather speed invariant at least for speeds up to 60 mm/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>). Second, in terms of Gaussian kernel widths, the estimate of the spatial precision of action potentials in this study is practically identical to the estimated spatial sensitivity of the subfield arrangement of the FA-1 and SA-1 neurons mapped by small dots laterally scanning the receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>). For both studies, the estimated spatial sensitivity implies a spatial period expressed in sinusoidal terms that basically matches the width of an individual papillary ridge. That is, based on a Gaussian function being very similar to the period of a cosine cycle specified between −π and π, the spatial sensitivity in Gaussian terms averaged across both neuron types in the two studies corresponds to a sinusoidal period of 0.33 mm and 0.41 mm, respectively (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>). One possibility is that the width of the line stimuli could have acted as a low-pass filter and thus led to an underestimation of spatial sensitivity. However, we do not believe this to be the case given previous work showing that ridge deflections that stimulate FA-1 and SA-1 neurons are largely driven by the leading edge of similar stimuli and that the neurons, as well as their monkey equivalents, generally respond more intensely to the leading rather than trailing ends of tactile elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaMotte and Whitehouse, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>). FA-1 neurons were generally better than SA-1 neurons in signaling fine edge orientation based on the spatial structuring of their responses. A plausible explanation is that the receptive fields of human FA-1 neurons have about twice as many subfields as SA-1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 1992</xref>), while the overall receptive field sizes are comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansson and Vallbo, 1980</xref>). A larger number of subfields could in principle provide higher sensitivity to fine orientation differences by offering more varied sequential structuring with orientation changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>). The superiority of FA-1 neurons in this regard, together with their density in the fingertip being approximately twice as high as that of the SA-1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</xref>), suggests that FA-1 neurons play a primary role in extracting detailed spatial properties associated with dynamic fingertip events. Indeed, FA-1 neurons (or those like FA-1 neurons) dominate innervation in other body areas, such as the lips/tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trulsson and Essick, 1997</xref>) and foot sole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corniani and Saal, 2020</xref>), where the high-fidelity extraction of dynamic mechanical events seems key to their function. In contrast, the low-threshold mechanoreceptive innervation of the human hairy skin appears dominated by slowly adapting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corniani and Saal, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our study highlights that individual FA-1 and SA-1 neurons can signal fine edge orientation differences via the sequential structure of evoked spike trains. However, for a host of reasons, it seems unlikely that the central nervous system would rely on registering the sequential structure of spike trains in individual neurons to estimate edge orientation. For example, such a scheme would require the spike train to be considered in its entirety which would take a long time, especially at slower scanning speeds due to the sizable spread of a neuron’s subfields over the skin, and it would not function at all without lateral scanning motion. And for speed invariant signaling of edge orientation information, it would require that the nervous system have knowledge about the time course of each spike train. Similar limitations would also apply to the intensity measures, and in addition, accurate time-varying instantaneous information about scanning speed would be required for these measures to contribute to speed invariant signaling of edge orientation.</p><p>We have instead proposed a population level mechanism for geometric feature signaling that utilizes the high-spatial precision of spike generation offered by the presence FA-1 and SA-1 neuron subfields and which can signal tactile spatial details both instantaneously and in a speed-invariant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hay and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014</xref>). Briefly, the basis is that subfields belonging to different neurons are highly intermingled because of the high density of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons, especially in the fingertip skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</xref>), and the substantial size of the skin area in which a neuron’s subfields are distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johansson and Vallbo, 1980</xref>). Consequently, when an edge of a certain orientation deforms the skin at a particular location, a subset of neurons whose subfields spatially coincide with the edge is synchronously excited, but at a slightly different orientation or location, synchrony occurs primarily in another subset of neurons. In this scheme, the degree to which stimuli synchronously engage different subsets of neurons determines the ultimate edge orientation resolution of the nervous system as well as its resolution in the case of discrimination of tactile spatial details in general. Our previous simulations based on realistic innervation density and receptive field sizes suggest that the presence of subfields is particularly beneficial for edge-orientation signaling for short edges that involve only a small part of the fingertip which might be particularly relevant for the precise control of the digits in tasks requiring dexterous object manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>). Regarding the conscious perception of edge orientation, when edges of different lengths are pressed against a fingertip, humans perform poorly for 2 mm long edges followed by an abrupt improvement for edges longer than 4 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peters et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the substantial performance degradation for 2 mm long edges relates to the fact that for a vast majority of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons, this length is substantially smaller than the area of the fingertip skin where a neuron’s subfields are distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jarocka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 1992</xref>). That is, if the edge length is smaller than the scale of the subfield arrangement, a single neuron likely carries less information about edge orientation compared to edge lengths can stimulate the entire set of subfields.</p><p>The present study cannot ultimately determine how the nervous system builds and propagates information about the high-dimensional space of stimulus features required for doing object manipulation or exploratory tasks. However, the anatomical and functional organization of tactile ascending pathways, as well as sensory pathways in general, suggest that synchronized activity across neuronal ensembles induced by sensory events may play a key role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brette, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pruszynski and Zylberberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salinas and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanley, 2013</xref>). A hallmark of sensory ascending pathways, including tactile pathways, is massive increases in divergence and convergence as excitatory connections synapse sequentially and downstream representations engage orders of magnitude more neurons than the incoming axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones, 2000</xref>). This dimensionality expansion together with the subfield organization of first-order neurons and the sensitivity of neuronal activity to the timing of synaptic input would offer exceptional potential for simultaneous high-resolution identification of various tactile spatiotemporal events, based on patterns of correlated inputs across neurons. Furthermore, different synaptic integration times imply that both the precise timing of individual spikes in presynaptic axons as well as the intensity of spike bursts could contribute depending on the time scales of the sensory inputs and of the nature and context of the current tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hay and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lankarany et al., 2019</xref>). For object manipulation that requires rapid information about changes in spatial contact states, the nervous system could primarily rely on the precise timing of input across neuronal ensembles, while in perceptual judgment tasks, that usually take place under less time pressure allowing more time for synaptic integration, information in individual neurons’ spike intensities could play a greater role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hay and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pruszynski et al., 2018</xref>). It is well established that the central processing of sensory information in general can depend on task and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crapse and Sommer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gazzaley and Nobre, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zagha et al., 2013</xref>). For the somatosensory system, descending motor-related signals at different levels of the sensorimotor system can affect virtually all levels of the tactile processing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canedo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow and Nicolelis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghez and Pisa, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seki and Fetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zagha et al., 2013</xref>). A seemingly effective way to adapt tactile feature computations as a function of behavioral goals would be for descending mechanisms to act on synapses of the tactile ascending pathways to influence the exact pattern of synchronized activity across the neuronal ensembles that are propagated. The plausibility of this assumption, we believe, will be clarified by recent advances in recording neural activity from earliest stages of tactile processing in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Confais et al., 2017</xref>) and brainstem of awake and behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Versteeg et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hannes P Saal as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tamar Makin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benoit Delhaye (Reviewer #2); Saad S Nagi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewer #1 questioned whether the comparison between rate and spike-timing based codes was fair, as the spike-timing code was adjusted for scanning speed, while the rate code was not. Please address this point in the revision; this will likely require additional analysis.</p><p>2) Please add a section in the Discussion providing a more in-depth comparison with the psychophysical literature (see comment by reviewer #1).</p><p>3) Several reviewers had questions about the stimulus set (choice of stimuli, inclusion of some conditions in the results but not others). Please clarify these in the text.</p><p>4) Reviewer #2 asked about the link between the spatial precision of the neurons and the size of a fingerprint ridge. In a somewhat related question, reviewer #1 wondered about the robustness of sub-field responses especially during higher scanning speeds. Please comment on these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In the comparison across different speeds, the temporal profile is corrected for scanning speed, while the spike rates are not. To make a fairer comparison while assuming that scanning speed is accessible, one might fit a linear function to the speed/rate data (see Figure 2) and then 'correct' the rates accordingly. Any systematic deviation in firing rates due to the different orientations should then be discriminable. Given that firing rates do not perform particularly well even in the within-speed discrimination analysis, I would not expect them to outperform the spatial profile in the across-speed analysis either, but such an analysis would provide more robust evidence that rates alone are not sufficient to accomplish fine discrimination.</p><p>2) Why was a vertical orientation (0 degrees) not included in the setup? The authors cite 10 degrees as the perceptual lower bound, but this value cannot be directly tested due to the omission of a vertically oriented edge.</p><p>3) The comparison with the psychophysical literature could be more extensive. For example, the Bensmaia paper that is cited in the introduction also investigated perceptual thresholds across different scanning speeds, a question that is relevant for the current paper as well. The Peters study tested different edge lengths, which might be compared against the size of the typical receptive field etc.</p><p>4) Figure 2: At the highest scanning speeds, the average spike count drops to below 10 spikes. Presumably here not every sub-field does reliably elicit a spike anymore. Are the few spikes that do get elicited randomly distributed across all subfields, or do certain sub-fields reliably produce spikes while others drop out completely? That is, is the signal robust but not strong enough to aid in discrimination, or is the robustness lost?</p><p>5) Figure 7 and associated analysis: In the confusion matrices, when orientations are mis-classified, does this appear most often with their closest orientation? Such smoothness would be expected from the interaction of the sub-fields with the differently oriented lines.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I only have a few comments:</p><p>- The data collected at 2.5, 5, and 10 mm/s does not appear in the results, is there a reason?</p><p>- The authors should probably elaborate on the link between the spatial precision of the neurons (~60-70 um) and the fingerprint ridges dimension (~300-400um), which I believe are not so close. Also, the edge widths are close to fingerprint ridges periodicity, could this have an artificial effect on the results?</p><p>- P16, first paragraph: Delhaye et al., 2019 is a review of primate somatosensory cortex and is not related to the sentence &quot;the viscoelastic and anisotropic properties of the fingertip, and thus possible complex time-varying deformations of the fingertip skin as a surface slides over it&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very well-written paper.

This is the case because, as we show in the paper, stimulation speed very strongly influences the intensity of FA-1 and SA-1 responses. In the limit, with perfect correction for stimulation speed, the neurons would do as well as they do in the within-speed comparison. Performance is already poor within-speed and hence the reviewer rightfully does not expect a correction to yield any qualitative change in interpretation with any correction. Of course, the nervous system cannot perform an ideal correction because it does not have direct access to the speed condition but rather must estimate stimulation speed via neural activity from (some set of) neurons in the population. This leads to the reviewer’s specific suggestion that we apply a correction according to the mean speed sensitivity of the population (as shown in Figure 2). We have done the requested correction which, on average, does not lead to reliable across-speed discrimination performance. The reason that correction by population level intensity information is not particularly effective is because the effect of speed is quite variable across neurons. We have also taken this comment as an opportunity to clarify to the reader why we are doing this analysis. We have made the following changes to the manuscript to help emphasize our analytical intentions and thus clarify the conclusions we believe can be drawn from this study.</p><p>“On average, FA-1 and SA-1 neurons carried little information about fine orientation differences even under the assumption that scanning speed is accessible based on the overall intensity of the population response. That is, even after compensating for the effect of scanning speed on a neuron’s response by normalizing its response by a linear function approximating the population level speed-intensity relationship (Figure 2), the neuron’s failed to provide reliable information about edge orientation (peak firing rate: F1,51 = 0.16, p = 0.69, ηp2 = 0.003; mean firing rate: F1,51 = 2.7, p = 0.1, ηp2 = 0.051).</p><p>(Results – Speed-invariant orientation signaling)</p><p>We are motivated to investigate speed-invariance because speed often varies when touching and manipulating objects but mostly because it provides one means of testing whether the subfield arrangement of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons is an important factor for their signaling of fine differences in edge orientation. (Results – Speed-invariant orientation signaling)</p><p>In this scenario, the best-case outcome is that across-speed discrimination performance is equivalent to within-speed discrimination performance for a given speed condition. (Results – Speed-invariant orientation signaling)</p><p>As expected, given how strongly intensity measures (i.e., peak and mean firing rates) are affected by the scanning speed (Figure 2), … (Results – Speed-invariant orientation signaling)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why was a vertical orientation (0 degrees) not included in the setup? The authors cite 10 degrees as the perceptual lower bound, but this value cannot be directly tested due to the omission of a vertically oriented edge.</p></disp-quote><p>We omitted a 0° stimulus to efficiently pack stimuli onto the drum which, as the reviewer knows, is critical for microneurography experiments due to the risk of losing isolation. With respect angular differences that can be tested, our present stimuli allow for comparing deltas of 5° degrees (+5° and +10°; -5° and -10° lines), 10° (-5° and +5°), 15° (-5° and +10°; +5° and -10°) and 20° (-10° and +10°). Adding a 0° line stimulus would have added more comparison options for these angular differences but would not yield additional angular differences per se. We now make this logic clear in the text.</p><p>“These orientations were chosen to efficiently pack the stimuli onto the stimulating surface and to permit pairwise comparison of lines with angular differences of 5° (between +5° and +10° line stimuli; between -5° and -10° line stimuli), 10° (between -5° and +5° line stimuli), 15° (between -5° and +10° line stimuli; between +5° and -10° line stimuli) and 20° (between -10° and +10° line stimuli). (Methods – Stimuli)</p><p>Given our data set, the available angular differences were 5° (between -5° and -10° line stimuli and between +5° and +10° line stimuli), 10° (-5° and +5°), 15° (-10° and +5°; -5° and +10°) and 20° (-10° and +10°).

For example, the Bensmaia paper that is cited in the introduction also investigated perceptual thresholds across different scanning speeds, a question that is relevant for the current paper as well. The Peters study tested different edge lengths, which might be compared against the size of the typical receptive field etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and appreciate this push. We have now elaborated the relevant text in the Discussion.</p><p>“Our findings reveal that single human first-order tactile neurons signal edge orientation most reliably at slow to moderate speeds, corresponding to those used when actively performing tactile spatial discrimination tasks with the fingertips (Olczak et al., 2018; Vega-Bermudez et al., 1991). Our findings also reveal that edge orientation signaling decrease for stimulation speeds exceeding ~45 mm/s, corresponding to the speeds at which spatial discrimination capacity decreases (Bensmaia et al., 2008; Vega-Bermudez et al., 1991). We speculate that the choice of speeds in active tasks and changes in discrimination capacity as a function of speed in passive tasks are associated with the ability of first-order tactile neurons to produce the relevant information. Edge orientation sensitivity at natural speeds was strikingly high, with neurons routinely showing speed-invariant orientation signaling for differences as small as 5°, which is substantially better than what humans can consciously report (Bensmaia et al., 2008; Lechelt, 1992; Olczak et al., 2018; Peters et al., 2015) but on a par with what people exhibit in object manipulation (Pruszynski et al., 2018). (Discussion)</p><p>Regarding the conscious perception of edge orientation when edges of different lengths are pressed against a fingertip, humans perform poorly for 2 mm long edges followed by an abrupt improvement for edges longer than 4 mm (Peters et al., 2015). It is tempting to speculate that the substantial performance degradation for 2 mm long edges relates to the fact that, for a vast majority of FA-1 and SA-1 neurons, this length is substantially smaller than the area of the fingertip skin where a neuron's subfields are distributed (Jarocka et al., 2021; Johansson, 1978; Phillips et al., 1992). That is, if the edge length is smaller than the scale of the subfield arrangement, a single neuron likely carries less information about edge orientation compared to edge lengths can stimulate the entire set of subfields. (Discussion)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2: At the highest scanning speeds, the average spike count drops to below 10 spikes. Presumably here not every sub-field does reliably elicit a spike anymore. Are the few spikes that do get elicited randomly distributed across all subfields, or do certain sub-fields reliably produce spikes while others drop out completely? That is, is the signal robust but not strong enough to aid in discrimination, or is the robustness lost?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a very interesting question about the nature of subfield spike generation capacity and interactions among subfields – an issue we are presently tackling both empirically and computationally. The present experiment makes it difficult to say anything conclusive, however, since we do not have receptive field maps for these neurons. What is clear is that, over a rather large range, that basic subfield induced structure is maintained (which is why the across speed discrimination functions well for spikes aligned in spatial coordinated) but that this structuring breaks down for very high speeds. A simple (speculative) idea is that, when the speed is very high, the stimulus will traverse a subfield and generate an action potential, and then traverse other subfields while the neuron is still in its refractory period and thus not yield an action potential; in the extreme only one subfield will generate one action potential for all orientations and thus there would be no information about edge orientation in its response pattern. Of course, additional kinds of interactions are possible depending on the biophysics of these neurons, and these could, in principle, open up a host of computational advantages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7 and associated analysis: In the confusion matrices, when orientations are mis-classified, does this appear most often with their closest orientation? Such smoothness would be expected from the interaction of the sub-fields with the differently oriented lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, misclassifications happen to the closest orientations which can be seen in the off-diagonal terms of Figure 7. Note, however, that such smoothness is not an absolute necessity given a neuron’s response profile relates to the geometry of the subfield layout (see Pruszynski et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2018). Smoothness can also be seen in Figure 8 in the sense that smaller edge orientation differences are harder to discriminate than bigger edge orientation differences.</p><p>“Discrimination accuracy for all combinations of edge orientations and speeds is illustrated as a confusion matrix in Figure 7. Note that the various line stimuli were similarly discriminated and that misclassifications tended to occur towards edges with similar orientation (i.e. off-diagonal terms). (Results – Discrimination accuracy based on convolved spike trains)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I only have a few comments:</p><p>- The data collected at 2.5, 5, and 10 mm/s does not appear in the results, is there a reason?</p></disp-quote><p>When we started collecting data for this study, we focused on the 15-180 mm/s speeds, which were presented in random order. Later in data collection, we added a 270 mm/s condition and later still, 2.5, 5, 10 mm/s speeds. These slowest three conditions were not randomized and were always collected at the end of data collection because the slow speeds take a very long time and thus we would often lose neuronal isolation before completion. Thus, the core data we have for all neurons is from 15-180 mm/s which gives us power in terms of number and the capacity to treat speed as a repeated measure. We have much lower numbers for the other conditions and thus limits and complicates statistical analysis. That said, these speeds show the expected trends and are included in the openly available dataset attached to this manuscript for future consideration. We now explain this explicitly in the Methods.</p><p>“All neurons were scanned at eight tangential speeds: 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 mm/s presented in random order. A subset of neurons was scanned at up to four additional speeds: 2.5, 5, 10, and 270 mm/s. When the 270 mm/s speed was presented, it was randomly interleaved with the main eight speed conditions. When the three slowest speeds were presented, they were always done after all other speed conditions and in a set order, from fastest to slowest (i.e. 10 mm/s, 5 mm/s and then 2.5 mm/s). These very slow speeds take a long time to complete so presenting them at the end minimized the risk of losing isolation of the current neuron during the eight main speeds and thereby creating partial data sets. All the analyses presented here focus on the main speed conditions since these were available for all neurons. Note that the same general trends hold for the additional speeds and that the raw data for all speed conditions is provided alongside this manuscript. For each neuron and speed, the drum rotated three times, resulting in 15 trials for each line stimulus and recorded speed condition (5 presentations of stimuli per drum rotation x 3 drum rotations = 15 trials).

Also, the edge widths are close to fingerprint ridges periodicity, could this have an artificial effect on the results?</p></disp-quote><p>Great comment, we agree this was unclear. We have previously dealt with these issues in detail in the context of receptive field maps using small dot stimuli (Jarocka et al., 2021) and the same concepts are in play here. That is, the spatial precision of action potentials reported (~70 um) corresponds to a sinusoid with a spatial period of (~350 um). In terms of the edge width being of similar scale to the ridges, we don’t believe this is likely given the leading edge of the stimulus is likely driving the deflection of ridges (Lamotte and Whitehouse, 1986) which we saw when recording from FA-1 and SA-1 neurons in our previous work in the sense that they responded more to leading than trailing ends of stimuli (Pruszynski and Johansson, 2014). Without fully rehashing the entire discussion from the Jarocka paper, we have added text to make these points and links explicitly.</p><p>“Indeed, the spatial precision of elicited action potentials rationally matched spatial acuity of subfield arrangements, which corresponds to a spatial period similar to the dimensions of individual fingertip ridges.” (Abstract)</p><p>“Second, in terms of Gaussian kernel widths, the estimate of the spatial precision of action potentials in this study is practically identical to the estimated spatial sensitivity of the subfield arrangement of the FA-1 and SA-1 neurons mapped by small dots laterally scanning the receptive field (Jarocka et al., 2021). For both studies, the estimated spatial sensitivity implies a spatial period expressed in sinusoidal terms that basically matches the width of an individual papillary ridge. That is, based on a Gaussian function being very similar to the period of a cosine cycle specified between -π and π, the spatial sensitivity in Gaussian terms averaged across both neuron types in the two studies corresponds to a sinusoidal period of 0.33 mm and 0.41 mm respectively (for details, see Jarocka et al., 2021). One possibility is that the width of the line stimuli could have acted as a low-pass filter and thus led to an underestimation of spatial sensitivity. However, we do not believe this to be the case given previous work showing that ridge deflections that stimulate FA-1 and SA-1 neurons are largely driven by the leading edge of similar stimuli and that the neurons, as well as their monkey equivalents, generally respond more intensely to the leading rather than trailing ends of tactile elements (Blake et al., 1997; LaMotte &amp; Whitehouse, 1986; Pruszynski &amp; Johansson, 2014).” (Discussion)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- P16, first paragraph: Delhaye et al., 2019 is a review of primate somatosensory cortex and is not related to the sentence &quot;the viscoelastic and anisotropic properties of the fingertip, and thus possible complex time-varying deformations of the fingertip skin as a surface slides over it&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies, that was a typo, we have now corrected this citation to point to Delhaye et al, 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0874).</p><p>“Second, our analysis ignored the viscoelastic and anisotropic properties of the fingertip, and thus possible complex time-varying deformations of the fingertip skin as a surface slides over it (Delhaye et al., 2016; Jarocka et al., 2021).” (Discussion)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very well-written paper.
