has rarely been explored. Here, we found that interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), but not TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or IκB kinase epsilon (IKKε), was recruited and sequestered in viral IBs when the cells were infected by EBOV transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs). Nucleoprotein/virion protein 35 (VP35)-induced IBs formation was critical for IRF3 recruitment and sequestration, probably through interaction with STING. Consequently, the association of TBK1 and IRF3, which plays a vital role in type I interferon (IFN-I) induction, was blocked by EBOV trVLPs infection. Additionally, IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation induced by Sendai virus or poly(I:C) stimulation were suppressed by EBOV trVLPs. Furthermore, downregulation of STING significantly attenuated VP35-induced IRF3 accumulation in IBs. Coexpression of the viral proteins by which IB-like structures formed was much more potent in antagonizing IFN-I than expression of the IFN-I antagonist VP35 alone. These results suggested a novel immune evasion mechanism by which EBOV evades host innate immunity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ebola virus</kwd><kwd>VP35</kwd><kwd>VP24</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>virus inclusion bodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82372255</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Advanced Customer Cultivation Project of the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ACCP-MS04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013076</institution-id><institution>National Major Science and Technology Projects of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018ZX09711003-005-005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013076</institution-id><institution>National Major Science and Technology Projects of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2600704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Hainan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ebola virus VP35 protein evades host antiviral immunity by interacting with STING to sequester IRF3 into inclusion bodies and inhibit type I interferon production.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ebola virus (EBOV) disease is the deadliest infectious disease caused by infection with EBOV, an enveloped, nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feldmann et al., 2003</xref>). The 19 kb viral genome comprises seven genes encoding the nucleoprotein (NP), virion protein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein (GP), VP30, VP24, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahanty and Bray, 2004</xref>). Inclusion bodies (IBs) that form in EBOV-infected cells are specialized intracellular compartments that serve as sites for EBOV replication and the generation of progeny viral RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nanbo et al., 2013</xref>). In IBs, the EBOV genome is replicated and transcribed by viral polymerase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Misasi and Sullivan, 2014</xref>). VP35 serves as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and contributes to viral replication by homo-oligomerization through a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reid et al., 2005</xref>) as well as through its phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which was recently discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van Tol et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Innate interferon responses constitute the first lines of host defense against viral infection. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), including RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, play pivotal roles in the response to RNA virus infection. After the recognition of RNA virus infection, RIG-I is recruited to the mitochondrial antiviral adaptor protein (MAVS) through the caspase activation and recruitment domain. The activation of MAVS recruits multiple downstream signaling components to mitochondria, leading to the activation of inhibitor of κ-B kinase ε (IKKε) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which in turn phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). Phosphorylated IRF3 forms a dimer that translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of type I interferon (IFN-I) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fitzgerald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To promote viral replication and persistence, viruses have evolved various strategies to evade or subvert host antiviral responses. For example, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) has developed a mechanism to evade host immune responses through the interaction between nonstructural proteins and IFN-I induction proteins, including TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee and Shin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), sequestering them inside SFTSV-induced cytoplasmic structures known as IBs. In addition to inhibiting IFN-I induction, SFTSV nonstructural proteins can hijack STAT1 and STAT2 in IBs to suppress IFN-I signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ning et al., 2015</xref>). These studies highlight the role of viral IBs as virus-built ‘jails’ that sequester some crucial host factors and interfere with the corresponding cellular processes.</p><p>EBOV uses various approaches to evade the host immune response, including antagonizing IFN production, inhibiting IFN signaling, and enhancing IFN resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reid et al., 2006</xref>). VP35 is an IFN-I inhibitor that antagonizes host innate immunity by interacting with TBK1 and IKKε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prins et al., 2009</xref>), suppressing RNA silencing and inhibiting dendritic cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haasnoot et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yen et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report that viral IBs in EBOV transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particle (trVLP)-infected cells appear to play a role in immune evasion by sequestering IRF3 into IBs and preventing the interaction of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRF3 is hijacked into cytoplasmic IBs in EBOV transcription and replication-competent virus-like particles infected cells</title><p>When HepG2 cells were infected with EBOV trVLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoenen et al., 2014</xref>), which authentically model the complete virus life cycle, IBs with a unique structure and viral particles formed in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

Given the sequestration of IRF3 by EBOV trVLPs in IBs, the TBK1–IRF3 association in EBOV trVLP-infected cells was assessed by an in situ Duolink proximity ligation assay (PLA). Cytoplasmic complexes consisting of endogenous TBK1 with IRF3 (the red signal) were observed in HepG2 cells treated with poly(I:C), which induces the activation of the RIG-I signal cascade and IRF3 phosphorylation, and poly(I:C)-induced TBK1:IRF3 complexes were significantly reduced by EBOV trVLPs infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Decreased TBK1–IRF3 association was further demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, Sendai virus (SeV) infection-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation were significantly inhibited by EBOV trVLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>).

Several EBOV proteins (VP35, VP24, GP, VP30, and VP40) are known to participate in host immune evasion to facilitate viral replication and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Audet and Kobinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cantoni and Rossman, 2018</xref>). VP35 was demonstrated to suppress IFN-I production by inhibiting IRF3/7 phosphorylation, disrupting DC maturation, and facilitating the escape of immune sensation by dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cárdenas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Messaoudi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Prins et al., 2009</xref>). VP30 and VP40 suppress RNA silencing by interacting with Dicer and modulating RNA interference components via exosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fabozzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pleet et al., 2017</xref>). VP24 and GP are also known to block IFN-I signaling by hiding type I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-1) on the cell surface and counteracting tetherin or interfering with established immune responses by adsorbing antibodies against GP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Audet and Kobinger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Viral IBs are a characteristic of cellular EBOV infection and are important sites for viral RNA replication, and NP and VP35 are extremely critical proteins for the formation of IBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoenen et al., 2012</xref>). However, whether viral IBs are involved in antagonizing IFN-I production during EBOV trVLPs infection has not yet been reported. Here, we found that IRF3 is hijacked and sequestered into EBOV IBs by viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which demonstrates that viral IBs are utilized for IRF3 compartmentalization. Meanwhile, this compartmentalization resulted in the spatial isolation of IRF3 from the kinases TBK1 and IKKε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>). This suggests that IRF3 deprivation by viral IBs may antagonize host antiviral signaling by inhibiting IFN-I production signaling.</p><p>As expected, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L, which is involved in the composition of IBs, was significantly more antagonistic to SeV-induced IFN-β production than the expression of VP35 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In addition, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L can significantly antagonize the promoting effect of poly(I:C) on IFN-β transcription, and IRF3 knockout could not further inhibit the transcription of IFN-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), which may be because viral hijacking of IRF3 into IBs nearly completely antagonized its function of promoting IFN-β production. In this study, the effect of poly(I:C) is consistent with the results obtained with SeV, which indicates that poly(I:C) may mainly activate the RLR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>, the expression of NP/VP35/VP30/L significantly inhibited the ability of SeV to promote the transcription of IFN-β downstream genes (CXCL10, ISG15, and ISG56) but did not completely suppress the effect of SeV, which may be due to the low transfection rate of HeLa cells. Furthermore, the knockout of IRF3 in cells could not further promote EBOV and EBOV trVLPs replication compared with that observed in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G, H</xref>), which may have been because IRF3 was hijacked into viral IBs and could not be phosphorylated into the nucleus to regulate IFN-I production. These results suggest that viral IBs act as virus-built ‘jails’ to imprison transcription factors and present a novel and possible common mechanism of viral immune evasion in which the critical signaling molecule IRF3 is spatially segregated from the antiviral kinases TBK1 and IKKε.</p><p>Although almost all IRF3 could be sequestered to viral IBs formed by VP35 and NP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>), we found that neither VP35 nor NP interacted with IRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, we found that VP35 interacts with STING and colocalizes in IBs and that knockdown of STING inhibits the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–G</xref>). These results suggest that VP35 may hijack IRF3 into IBs through STING. However, whether other host proteins are involved in this process and the role of NP in the recruitment of IRF3 by VP35 remain unclear. In addition, we found that VP35 may hijack IRF3 into IBs via STING association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>); however, whether VP35 activates the STING-IRF3 pathway in a cGAS-independent manner by interacting with STING and the molecular mechanism remain to be further investigated.</p><p>In summary, EBOV VP35 sequesters IRF3 into viral IBs and inhibits the association of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε, preventing IRF3 from entering the nucleus and thereby inhibiting IFN-I production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, this study reveals a new strategy by which EBOV escapes the innate immune response and provides new ideas for EBOV disease treatment.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors were trying to investigate whether viral IBs are involved in antagonizing IFN-I production during EBOV trVLPs infection. They found that IRF3 is hijacked and sequestered into EBOV IBs after viral infection, thereby leading to the spatial isolation of IRF3 with TBK1 and IKKε. In such a progress, the activity of IRF3 is suppressed and downstream IFN-I induction is inhibited. The authors designed many experiments, such as the PLA that examined the colocalization, to support their conclusions. However, necessary negative controls were missed in several assays. More key index is needed to be examined in several assays.</p><p>The paper is well organized and most data in this paper could support the conclusions, while there are several issues that need to be further solved.</p><p>1. In Figure 2-4, authors should examine the expression of downstream IFNs as well as the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of IRF3 to further prove the suppression of IRF3 activity by infecting with trVLPs.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The inhibitory effect of trVLPs infection on the phosphorylation of IRF3 S396 and SeV-induced IRF3 nuclear localization was determined by immunoprecipitation (Figure 3D) and immunofluorescence (Figure 4A and 4B), respectively. In addition, we demonstrated that IFN-β transcription was inhibited more potently by EBOV viral inclusion bodies compared with VP35 alone (Figure 7B and 7C).</p><p>Moreover, EBOV viral inclusion bodies were demonstrated to inhibit the transcription of IFN downstream genes (e.g., CXCL10, ISG15 and ISG56) more potently than VP35 alone (new Figure 7D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 5, to better prove the conclusion that EBOV NP and VP35 play an important role in sequestering IRF3 in IBS, authors should add the &quot;NP+VP35+VP30&quot; and &quot;NP+VP35+VP24&quot; groups to reperform the assay.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: According to the reviewer’s suggestion, VP24 or VP30 was added to the “VP35+NP” group, and the results showed that the “NP+VP35+VP24” and “NP+VP35+VP30” groups exhibited little, if any, effect on the distribution of IRF3 compared with the “NP+VP35” group (new Figure 5 - figure supplement 2A-B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 6f, the expression of STING should be examined by immunostaining to show the knockdown efficiency in trVLPs-infected cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As suggested by the reviewer, immunostaining was performed to visually detect the effect of STING knockdown on the IRF3 distribution during trVLPs infection (new Figure 6F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Zhu et al explored molecular mechanisms by which Ebola virus (EBOV) evades host innate immune response. EBOV has a number of means to shut down the type I interferon induction (by viral VP35 protein) and block type I interferon action (by viral VP24 protein). This study reported a new mechanism that inclusion body (IB) used for viral replication sequesters IRF3, a key transcription factor involved in the interferon signaling, resulting in blockade of downstream type I interferon gene transcription. This finding is potentially interesting and may provide a new insight into EBOV's evasion of innate immunity. However, there are some flaws in the experimentations and analyses that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. Most of experiments were performed by transfection of trVLP plasmids, which is very different from virus infection. The conclusions should be examined and verified in the context of virus infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As suggested by the reviewer, the effects of IRF3 depletion on live Ebola virus replication were examined as described in the revised manuscript. Consistent with the results obtained after trVLPs infection, IRF3 depletion exerted little, if any, effect on viral replication (new Figure 7H), which supports the notion that, upon EBOV infection and the formation of inclusion bodies, IRF3 has little, if any, transcription activation activity after sequestration by inclusion bodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig 1 - VP35 displayed a classical IB staining only in Panel A, while much less so in Panel C and not in panel B. It seemed that the VP35 staining images were chosen in a way towards the authors' favor. The statistical analysis of co-localization of VP35 and IRF3, TBK1 or IKKe should be performed to draw the conclusion. Another concern is that IKKe is normally lowly expressed under a rest condition and becomes induced only when the interferon signaling is activated. It seemed to be expressed at a high level even when the interferon signaling is blocked in Panel C. The authors should comment on this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Ebola virus inclusion bodies show variations in both shape and size. According to the reviewer’s suggestion, the colocalization of TBK1 or IKKε and VP35 is shown in new figures (new Figure 1C and 1E), and quantitatively analyzed by the fluorescence intensity using ImageJ software (new Figure 1B, 1D and 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig 2 - Was this experiment done by transfection or infection? The description of result is not consistent with the figure legend. The labeling was also not consistent between panel A and B. I would suggest performing Western blot to analyze the expression level of IRF3.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We apologize for the incorrect description of the data. Ebola virus trVLPs were initially produced based on transfection but also involved the viral infection process. The use of “transfection” in the figure and figure legends has been changed to “infection” in the revised manuscript.As suggested by the reviewer, Western blotting was performed to analyze the IRF3 expression levels at different time points after trVLPs infection (new Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig 3 and 4 - As VP35 is well known for its highly efficient blockade of type I interferon activation, how would the authors differentiate the effect of VP35 alone from the sequestration of IRF3 in IBs in these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Previous studies have found that VP35, rather than NP, inhibits the expression of interferon, and the “VP35+NP” treatment, which induces IRF3 sequestration, showed inhibited IFN-β luciferase activity much more potently than VP35 expression alone (Figure 7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig 3 - PolyIC can activate both RLR and TLR signaling pathways. Can the author comment on which pathway it activates in this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: In this study, the effect of poly(I:C) was consistent with the results observed with SeV, which indicated that poly(I:C) may mainly activate the RLR signaling pathway. A discussion was added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors demonstrated that VP35 interacts with STING and recruit the latter to IBs. How would this affect the function of STING given that STING plays essential roles in cGAS/cGAMP pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This study unexpectedly showed that VP35 can recruit IRF3 into viral inclusion bodies through STING, but whether it regulates the cGAS-STING pathway remains to be further investigated. Related discussion was added to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is difficult to follow the logics of Fig 7. The expression level of each viral protein should be determined. Ideally, a mutation in VP35 that disrupts its ability to antagonize the interferon signaling but still allows for the IB formation can be used to assess the relative contribution of IB sequestering IRF3.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As suggested by the reviewer, a series of VP35 mutants were constructed, but we failed to obtain a VP35 mutant that contains a mutation that disrupts the ability of the protein to antagonize interferon signaling but still allows IB formation. Instead, coexpression of “NP+VP35+VP30+L”, which induces IBs formation, inhibited IFN-I more potently than the expression of VP35 alone (Figure 7B). IRF3 knockout inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I production but had little, if any, effect on poly(I:C)-induced IFN-I production in the “NP+VP35+VP30+L” group (Figure 7C). IRF3 knockout in the cells did not significantly affect viral replication, but overexpression of activated IRF3 (IRF3/5D), instead of wild-type IRF3, inhibited viral replication (new Figure 7G-H). These results collectively suggested that almost all IRF3 in cells was hijacked and sequestered into IBs in the Ebola virus-infected cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
